(2017) (which includes some of the same authors), which can be used to construct convolutional neural networks on arbitrary graphs. These extensions include strided graph convolutions and data augmentation.\n\nI think the title is a bit misleading in that respect, because to me it implies that the entire method of designing these models is newly proposed in this work, rather than a couple of extensions. It might be a good idea to make this more clear in the title.\n\nThe method is evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and demonstrated to perform comparably to a conventional convolutional baseline. This is actually an impressive result, as the graph convolutional network has a much weaker prior - although I would argue there is still a prior, contrary to what is claimed in the title (\"without priors about data\"). The fact that there is any convolutional structure to be found in the data at all is still used as prior knowledge.\n\nThe method is also evaluated on an fMRI dataset, where it improves performance.\n\nI think the extensions that are introduced are valuable. While I realise that this is a workshop submission, I would still have appreciated a more thorough comparison to the state of the art - given that graph convolutional networks are intensively studied right now and there are many proposed implementations, as paragraph 2 of the introduction adequately shows. The claim in the conclusion that the method \"[..] significantly outperforms existing alternatives\" is not very well founded.\n\nFigure 1 is great, as it allows the reader to get an idea of what the paper is about at a glance.\n\nThe notation in section 2.2 is a bit unclear, the symbol \u22a5 seems to be used incorrectly at first glance.\n\nThe paper is well-written, and considering the length constraint, relatively easy to follow. The proposed extensions to the method of Pasdeloup et al. are interesting and the results are promising, so I think this would make a good workshop contribution.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Matching Convolutional Neural Networks without Priors about Data", "abstract": "We propose an extension of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to graph-structured data, including strided convolutions and data augmentation on graph.\nOur method matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art CNNs when applied on images, without any prior about their 2D regular structure.\nOn fMRI data, we obtain a significant gain in accuracy compared with existing graph-based alternatives.\n", "paperhash": "lassance|matching_convolutional_neural_networks_without_priors_about_data", "_bibtex": "@misc{\n  lassance2018matching,\n  title={Matching Convolutional Neural Networks without Priors about Data},\n  author={Carlos Eduardo Rosar Kos Lassance and Jean-Charles Vialatte and Vincent Gripon and Nicolas Farrugia},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJ9e4HJPM}\n}", "authorids": ["carlos.rosarkoslassance@imt-atlantique.fr", "jc.vialatte@imt-atlantique.fr", "vincent.gripon@imt-atlantique.fr", "nicolas.farrugia@imt-atlantique.fr"], "authors": ["Carlos Eduardo Rosar Kos Lassance", "Jean-Charles Vialatte", "Vincent Gripon", "Nicolas Farrugia"], "keywords": ["irregular domains", "convolutional neural networks", "graph based convolutional neural networks", "graphs", "deep learning"], "pdf": "/pdf/bd87222aabfc22b0681fee97633f76a093b2faae.pdf"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "duedate": 1520657999000, "tmdate": 1521582901135, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/-/Paper155/Official_Review", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper155/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper155/AnonReviewer3", "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper155/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper155/AnonReviewer2"], "reply": {"forum": "SJ9e4HJPM", "replyto": "SJ9e4HJPM", "writers": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper155/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper155/AnonReviewer[0-9]+", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "review": {"required": true, "order": 2, "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}"}, "rating": {"required": true, "order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"]}, "confidence": {"required": true, "order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"]}}}, "nonreaders": [], "expdate": 1528433999000, "cdate": 1521582901135}}}, {"tddate": null, "ddate": null, "original": null, "tmdate": 1521582844160, "tcdate": 1520589112543, "number": 2, "cdate": 1520589112543, "id": "H1lrKCkYM", "invitation": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/-/Paper155/Official_Review", "forum": "SJ9e4HJPM", "replyto": "SJ9e4HJPM", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper155/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper155/AnonReviewer1"], "content": {"title": "An extension of CNN to graph-structured data with strided convolution and data augmentation on graphs.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "review": "The paper presents an extension of the method proposed on Pasdeloup et al (2017) with strided convolutions along graph downscaling, data augmentation and convolutions on downscaled graphs.

Concerns about experiments.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "review": "This work seems to extend the prior work of Pasdeloup et al. (2017) to perform strided convolution. This strided convolution is only discussed in a very short Section 2.4 which doesn't provide much insight. From procedure in Sec. 2.4.1 it appears that authors sequentially add vertices of increasing (graph) distance from a center node. Such procedure does not down-sample as every subsequent stride will usually contain more vertices. If I understood correctly, that striding procedure is the main novelty, I think it should be given more attention in the paper.\n\nExperiments:\nIn Table 1 accuracy for Full Data Augmentation with proposed procedure using Grid Graph (93.94) is higher than one achieved using CNN (93.8). This seems quite surprising and is not mentioned in the manuscript.\n\nWhen comparing to Defferrard et al. (2016), I would be interested to see results on the data used in their paper (20news groups).\n\nAs the method is based on Pasdeloup et al. (2017), comparison to it seems necessary and is missing.\n\nHenaff et al. [1] is one of the first practical methods generalizing CNNs to graphs.
