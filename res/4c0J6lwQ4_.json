In particular, it proposes an mTAN network to leverage the mTAN module in an encoder-decoder framework for both unsupervised and supervised Learning.  The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of Multi-Time Attention Networks to learns a time representation and learns to attend to observations at different time points by computing a similarity weighting by the learning time embedding.  Empirical studies are performed to show the superiority of the proposed model mTANs over several baseline approaches on the tasks unsupervised and supervised learning. \n\nPros: \n \n1. The paper proposes a novel model to learns a continuous time representation and adapt to fixed dimensional vectors or discrete sequences. For me, the problem itself is real and practical. \n2. The proposed mTAN is novel for capturing the time dependencies time-series, sparse, irregularly sampled, and multivariate data. \n3. This paper provides comprehensive experiments, including both unsupervised and supervised learning results, to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.  \n\nCons: \n \n1.\tThe paper uses a lot of notations in equations and descriptions, which cause a little bit confusion to follow the authors\u2019 idea.

It incorporates the time attention mechanism to learn embedding for continuous time-series based on a kernel smoothing method. Results on real-world dataset such as EHR data has outperformed other baselines.\n\nI have the following comments that I think is worthwhile to consider to improve the paper:\n\n1. I didn't see much on the main method sections that specifically address/discuss sparsity and irregular sample problems, it seems like the proposed method also works for general time-series data.\n\n2. In the discretization part, it would be better to make it clear how to find the set of reference time points r in practice. It may not be efficient enough if one needs to track each time stamp for each variable to obtain this set $r$.\n\n3. How does an extra module of mTAND in encoding and decoding procedure help intuitively? Given that RNN has already captured temporal information.\n\n4. The noise distribution for sparse / irregularly sampled data can often be heavily skewed, so the Gaussian noise assumption in this paper may not hold.\n\nAdditional questions/suggestions:\n1. It is better to specify how to compute the gradient for ELBO, e.g., are there any approximations used, are methods like REINFORCE or Gumbel softmax implemented for non-continuous cases, as well as how does the parameter initialize for unsupervised learning problems.\n\n2. Does the unified supervised and unsupervised objective in Eq (15) mean the proposed method combines imputation/interpolation with learning/inference for time series data?\n\n3. From the time series perspective, the positional encoding in Eq (1) is more like a season and trend decomposition, not sure if this plays a similar role here.\n\n4.

Since mTANs are fundamentally continuous-time interpolation-based models, we perform an ablation study by comparing mTAND-based similarity kernel with the IP-nets (Shukla & Marlin, 2019), which use RBF-kernel based interpolation layers. We show that learning the similarity kernel using mTAND module performs better than using a fixed RBF kernel on classification tasks. Learning the similarity function provides our model with flexibility to learn complex temporal kernel functions and hence improves over methods using fixed similarity kernel.\t\n\n*In an interpolation problem, we would like to consider a robust baseline as a linear interpolation or an AR-like modeling. Even if I must admit that the authors already propose a lot of comparisons with models from the -recent- literature, this would give us a meaningful MSE result to compare other approaches.*\n\nA: We have compared the performance of our proposed model to simple interpolation-based methods on interpolation task. We perform this experiment on synthetic dataset and use the same setting of the experiment described in Appendix A.2.  \n\n-----------------------------------\nMethod          |   MSE \n\nmTAND-Full   |   0.0335\n\nMICE               |   0.1634\n\nLinear             |   0.0909\n\nPrevious         |   0.1129\n\n------------------------------------\nLinear: linear interpolation, Previous: interpolating using previous value, MICE: multivariate imputations by chained equations "}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper881/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper881/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-Time Attention Networks for Irregularly Sampled Time Series", "authorids": ["~Satya_Narayan_Shukla1", "~Benjamin_Marlin1"], "authors": ["Satya Narayan Shukla", "Benjamin Marlin"], "keywords": ["irregular sampling", "multivariate time series", "attention", "missing data"], "abstract": "Irregular sampling occurs in many time series modeling applications where it presents a significant challenge to standard deep learning models.

We address the issues below: \n\n*Q: I didn't see much on the main method sections that specifically address/discuss sparsity and irregular sample problems, it seems like the proposed method also works for general time series data.*\n\nA: As shown in Eq 3, the intermediate continuous-time function $\\hat{x}_{hd}(t, \\mathbf{s})$ computed at query point $t$ is only based on the observed time points \n\n$\\mathbf{t_d} = [t_{1d}, t_{2d}, \\cdots]$ and the corresponding values  $\\mathbf{x_d}=[x_{1d},x_{2d}, \\cdots]$. Irrespective of time series being sparse and irregularly sampled or regularly sampled, the flexibility in Eq 3 allows the intermediate output to be computed at any set of query points and with any set of input time points and values. We will clarify this in the paper.\n\n*Q:  In the discretization part, it would be better to make it clear how to find the set of reference time points  r in practice. It may not be efficient enough if one needs to track each time stamp for each variable to obtain this set r.*\n\nA: Assuming that all data cases are defined over a common interval, which is the case in all of our experiments, the set of reference time points $r$ is chosen to be $T$ evenly spaced time points within that interval. The number of such points is a hyper-parameter of the method.\n\n*Q: How does an extra module of mTAND in encoding and decoding procedure help intuitively? Given that RNN has already captured temporal information.*\n\nA: Standard RNNs do not represent time at all and require fully observed sequences of vector-valued inputs. These are reasonable assumptions for regularly spaced, completely observed multivariate time series, but not for irregularly sampled and unaligned multivariate time series where different dimensions can be observed at different time points for the same data case and there are variable time gaps between observations. These problems can be addressed with extensions of standard RNN models like GRU-D and ODE-RNN, which are exactly the models we compare to. Relative to models like GRU-D that operate forward in time only, the mTAND module when used as an encoder looks at the whole input time series via attention and produces a regularly spaced sequence of hidden representations. A standard RNN can then be applied to extract any additional structure from the sequence of regularly spaced hidden values produced by the  mTAND module. When used as a decoder, the mTAND module is similarly able to reconstruct points that are not aligned or regularly spaced.\n\n*Q: The noise distribution for sparse / irregularly sampled data can often be heavily skewed, so the Gaussian noise assumption in this paper may not hold.*\n\nA: The Gaussian noise distribution applies at the output of a deep generator. This is standard for many VAE architectures. Any other distribution over continuous random variables could also be used instead if desired, as is the case for other VAEs.\n\n*Q: It is better to specify how to compute the gradient for ELBO, e.g., are there any approximations used, are methods like REINFORCE or Gumbel softmax implemented for non-continuous cases, as well as how does the parameter initialized for unsupervised learning problems.*\n\nA: We are not dealing with discrete latent variables in this work. No additional approximations are required other than those commonly used in VAEs with Gaussian latent variables. We use $k$ samples to compute the ELBO and follow the reparameterization trick (Kingma & Welling, 2014) for computing the gradients. \n   \n*Q: Does the unified supervised and unsupervised objective in Eq (15) mean the proposed method combines imputation/interpolation with learning/inference for time series data?*\n\nA: As shown in Equation 15, the supervised learning component leverages the latent states as a feature extractor and the unsupervised loss (ELBO) acts as a regularizer. Although this question is not entirely clear, we want to clarify that the supervised learning model does not leverage the final imputed output from the decoder as input.\n\n*Q: It would be very helpful for me to understand the paper if the authors could add a schematic figure to demonstrate the complete structure of the model.*\n\nA: We have added an architecture diagram of our proposed encoder-decoder framework and mTAND module in Appendix A.3 (Figure 2 and 3)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper881/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper881/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-Time Attention Networks for Irregularly Sampled Time Series", "authorids": ["~Satya_Narayan_Shukla1", "~Benjamin_Marlin1"], "authors": ["Satya Narayan Shukla", "Benjamin Marlin"], "keywords": ["irregular sampling", "multivariate time series", "attention", "missing data"], "abstract": "Irregular sampling occurs in many time series modeling applications where it presents a significant challenge to standard deep learning models.

The multi-time attention mechanism takes a query time t and a multivariate sparse and irregularly sampled time series, and returns a fixed dimensional embedding for the query time t. This mechanism is used twice in an encoder-decoder VAE framework with varying reference (input) and query (output) time points.\n\nThe idea of the paper is novel, impactful, and well-explained. \nThe evaluation and benchmarking is proper with significant improvements over the baselines for classification and interpolation tasks.

The model is really very difficult to understand in this version of the article.\n\n* Results are impressive but I don't get which part of the architecture lead to such a performance\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper881/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper881/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-Time Attention Networks for Irregularly Sampled Time Series", "authorids": ["~Satya_Narayan_Shukla1", "~Benjamin_Marlin1"], "authors": ["Satya Narayan Shukla", "Benjamin Marlin"], "keywords": ["irregular sampling", "multivariate time series", "attention", "missing data"], "abstract": "Irregular sampling occurs in many time series modeling applications where it presents a significant challenge to standard deep learning models. This work is motivated by the analysis of physiological time series data in electronic health records, which are sparse, irregularly sampled, and multivariate. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning framework for this setting that we call Multi-Time Attention Networks. Multi-Time Attention Networks learn an embedding of continuous time values and use an attention mechanism to produce a fixed-length representation of a time series containing a variable number of observations. We investigate the performance of this framework on interpolation and classification tasks using multiple datasets. Our results show that the proposed approach performs as well or better than a range of baseline and recently proposed models while offering significantly faster training times than current state-of-the-art methods.", "one-sentence_summary": "This paper presents a new architecture for learning with sparse and irregularly sampled multivariate time series that achieves improved performance than current state-of-the-art methods while providing significantly reduced training times.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "shukla|multitime_attention_networks_for_irregularly_sampled_time_series", "supplementary_material": "", "pdf": "/pdf/35e8d4bd3fd59a402e488637f16e0fec9e36706a.pdf", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Poster", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nshukla2021multitime,\ntitle={Multi-Time Attention Networks for Irregularly Sampled Time Series},\nauthor={Satya Narayan Shukla and Benjamin Marlin},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=4c0J6lwQ4_}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
