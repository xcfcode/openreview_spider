In this paper I can\u2019t find evidence that this generative model is better than search. I can guess the speed is better than search, but seems no evidence overall it is better.\u201d \n\nA1:  Thank you for the valuable comment. \n\n+ Our generative model is designed to replace the traditional, heuristic-based evaluation functions used by search-based approaches for chess, as opposed to being an end-to-end chess-playing model. Move generation is done by performing a negamax search using our model.\n\n+ We agree that there is no evidence the model produced via style transfer outplays traditional AIs for chess. However, the goal of our paper was not to produce a more proficient AI, but rather to produce an AI that could be used for pedagogical purposes such as assisting players train against different styles of play. This has been made more clear in the appendix of our revised paper, and we thank you for bringing this to our attention.\n\nQ2: \u201cFor \u201cstyle\u201d, there is an explanation of style transfer is minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy [1]. In this paper, I can\u2019t find any relation of the method is related to MMD style.\u201d\n\nA2: Thank you for bringing the ambiguity around the term \"style\" to our attention. We consider style transfer as a form of minimizing the EM distance discussed in the WGAN paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07875.pdf). This is different from the style transfer discussed in the work of Gatys et al. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf) which focuses on minimizing the mean squared distance between Gram matrices. Our notion of style is discussed more in the appendix of the revised paper.\n \n+ With regards to minimizing MMD, the WGAN paper has a more in-depth discussion.  \n"}, "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Style Transfer Generative Adversarial Networks: Learning to Play Chess Differently", "abstract": "The idea of style transfer has largely only been explored in image-based tasks, which we attribute in part to the specific nature of loss functions used for style transfer.

Due to the space limit, we left out experiments concerning other players from the results section. These experiments have been added to an appendix which is present in the revised paper.\n\n+ We have tested the STGAN method on 2 master players with notably unique styles: Mikhail Tal and Mikhail Chigorin. Sequences of moves generated by models trained using the latter player's data are shown in the appendix.\n\n+ We are interpreting your comment concerning overall performance to mean the proficiency of our trained models in comparison to other established AIs for chess.

A creative solution to this evaluation problem would definitely increase the quality of this work.\u201d\n\nA2: We completely agree that evaluation of style is extremely difficult. \n\n+ Our evaluation on target/predicted move was done only after the sequence of moves (played up to that configuration) had been predicted. We did not make this clear in the first version of the paper, so we greatly appreciate you bringing this to our attention. This has been made more clear in the revised paper.\n\n+ With regards to a creative solution to the style evaluation problem, we chose to go with comparing final positions after a sequence of generated moves, specifically within chess openings. Our focus on opening sequences is due to there being well established preferences/styles for chess openings, which then lend themselves to more clear comparisons. We realize that for midgame sequences it is much more difficult to compare styles, and we note that this could be an area of future research.\n"}, "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Style Transfer Generative Adversarial Networks: Learning to Play Chess Differently", "abstract": "The idea of style transfer has largely only been explored in image-based tasks, which we attribute in part to the specific nature of loss functions used for style transfer.
