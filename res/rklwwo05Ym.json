We agree that marginalizing out the weights is the natural thing to do if we accept the generative model. However, due to the training objective being a lower bound on the true objectives of the proposed family of models why would we prefer the arithmetic model to the others? This one of the main points of the paper.\n\n As to the variational approximation leading to the geometric mean prediction, they are closely related but the variational approximation lacks the normalizing constant Z present in eq 6. We acknowledge this relationship by saying that \"oftentimes the geometric average (GMC) is used, because of its close relationship to the loss\".\n\n3. There is no disagreement with standard learning theory, in a sense we propose a shortcut: there is no need to train the model for different alpha, lambda choices since these hyperparameters only affect evaluation. This is due to the training objective being a lower bound on the true objectives of the proposed family of models.\n\nIt is unclear what is unconvincing about the tightness of the bound argument. In any case, our intention there is to argue that in the absence of validation data, the most natural evaluation method is the deterministic one. However, if there is validation data available, then the tightness of the bound argument is not necessary: tuning alpha, lambda only requires the common lower bound.\n\n\nIn general, regarding the paper not being convincing, sound and the arguments being convoluted, we would like to improve both content and presentation.

But they are not sound. No convincing approach. ", "review": "This paper studies the problem of making predictions with a model trained using dropout. Authors try to provide a theoretical foundation for using dropout when making predictions. For this purpose, they show that when using dropout training we are maximizing a common lower bound on the objectives of a family of models, including most of the previously used methods for prediction with dropout. \n\nI find that the paper addresses a relevant problem and try to apply a novel approach. But, in general, I find the paper is not easy to follow and to grasp the main ideas. \n\nHere I detail my main concerns:\n\n\n1. This is one of my main concerns. The contraposition between the geometric and the average model. I don't like this contraposition. The average model is just the standard marginalization operation over the weights, $p(y|x) = \\int p(y|x,w)p(w|\\Theta)dw$. This is the natural solution for the prediction problem to the problem if we accept the generative model given in Eq (3). \n\nIn the case of the variational dropout, we depart from the same generative model, but we employ an approximation. It is the variational approximation the one that induces the geometric mean provided in eq (6). I.e. if we want to compute the posterior over the label y* for a sample x*, after training, we should compute the associated lower bound\n$\\ln p(y*|x*) >= E_q[\\ln p(y*|x*,w)] - KL(q|p)$\nIn this case, q(w) = p(w|\\Theta), as stated Eq (3) and in the corresponding equation provided in page 2 (the q(w) is not learnt because it only depends on the dropout rate, while the $\\Theta$ are learnt by maximum log-likelihood and do not have a $q$ associated).  This gives rise to the geometric mean approximation provided in Eq (6).  I.e. the geometric mean prediction is simply the result of using a variational approximation at prediction time.   \n\nMy problem here is that authors employ convoluted arguments to introduce this geometric mean prediction and the average prediction, without making the connection discussed above. \n\n3. Section 3.3 and 3.4 introduces new arguments for modifying the dropout rate (and the alpha) parameter at test time. But, again, I find the arguments convoluted. We consider the dropout rate a hyper-parameter of the model, the standard learning theory tells us to fix the parameters with the training data and evaluate them later when making predictions. Why should we use different dropout rates at training and testing? Authors arguments about the tightness of the bound of Eq (8) and Eq(9). are not convincing to me. \n\nSo, I don't find authors provide convincing answers to the raised questions at the beginning of the paper about the use of dropout when making predictions. \n\nMinor comments:\n\n1. The generative model for Variational dropout is the same than the generative model for the \"conditional model\", eq. (3). \n\n2. In Eq. (7) authors are defining the weighted power mean. I think it would be clearer to directly introduce the weighted power mean instead of the standard power mean in Section 3.2.\n\n3. Section 3.3. I find some parts are difficult to understand. \"suppose we pick a base model from the power mean family and have a continuum of subvariants with gradually reduced variance in their predictions but the same expectation.\" Later, I can understand authors are referring to the possibility of reducing the dropout rate.

The family includes models that compute a power mean over the sampled dropout masks, and their less stochastic subvariants with tighter and higher lower bounds than the fully stochastic dropout objective. We argue that since the deterministic subvariant's bound is equal to its objective, and the highest amongst these models, the predominant view of it as a good approximation to MC averaging is misleading. Rather, deterministic dropout is the best available approximation to the true objective.", "keywords": [], "authorids": ["melisgl@google.com", "cblundell@google.com", "tkocisky@google.com", "kmh@google.com", "cdyer@google.com", "pblunsom@google.com"], "authors": ["G\u00e1bor Melis", "Charles Blundell", "Tom\u00e1\u0161 Ko\u010disk\u00fd", "Karl Moritz Hermann", "Chris Dyer", "Phil Blunsom"], "pdf": "/pdf/6d117d07246423d3e82fea732059ae170464890b.pdf", "paperhash": "melis|pushing_the_bounds_of_dropout", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nmelis2019pushing,\ntitle={Pushing the bounds of dropout},\nauthor={G\u00e1bor Melis and Charles Blundell and Tom\u00e1\u0161 Ko\u010disk\u00fd and Karl Moritz Hermann and Chris Dyer and Phil Blunsom},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rklwwo05Ym},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper269/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234500302, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "rklwwo05Ym", "replyto": "rklwwo05Ym", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper269/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335686546, "tmdate": 1552335686546, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper269/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 10}
