The method alternates two steps: a node embedding step (using convolutions) and an adjacency matrix update (using local convolutions or fully connected layers).

The objective function is composed of a linear combination of typical losses such as cross-entropy, intersection over union and other regularization terms. The linear coefficients are treated as hyper-parameters. The methods are evaluated on graph generation and edge prediction tasks, showing results comparable to the state-of-the-art.\n\nOverall, the paper is clearly written and addresses an important problem. However, I found the proposed method rather heuristic and not very well theoretically principled. Why should one use the proposed architecture (stacking learning steps)? What is the latent structure that this method is trying to learn, a particular sequence of graphs? Which one? Where do the supposed benefits come from? In general, both the architecture and loss (or combination of losses) need to be better justified.\n\nRegarding experiments, on the positive side, the authors consider a representative set of methods.

The approach is evaluated on two synthetic datasets, a \u201ccommunity\u201d dataset and a \u201cgeometric figures\u201d dataset.\n\nUnfortunately, I do not think this paper as it stands currently is ready for publication at ICLR for the following reasons: (1) the comparison and discussion with prior literature is lacking; (2) the experiments are rather weak; and (3) the significance and novelty of the method itself seems limited.\n\n1. I am very surprised there was no discussion of [1] (or even better, a comparison to), which is another method which uses information about the full graph (via message-passing) to infer the connectivity of the graph in an unsupervised way. The discussion of the literature on graph neural networks in general is a bit weak, missing important references such as [2-4]. Such approaches, especially message-passing style approaches like [4], do exactly what the current paper suggests has not been done: they make predictions based on information in the nodes while considering the structure of the graph as a whole (via message-passing). Although [4] does not explicitly make edge predictions the approach is straightforward to generalize to making edge predictions, see [5].\n\n2. The experiments in the paper only test the proposed method on very toy domains, and thus feel weak. The results in Table 2, for example, suggest that the proposed method has reached ceiling-level performance and thus to really tell the difference between GLN_f, GLN_c, and any other methods, more difficult problems are called for. The geometric figures dataset, in particular, does not seem to me like it would test the claim that the paper would like to make: that it is important to take into account the fully structure of the graph when predicting edges. Indeed, there is a very simple rule that can be applied in the geometric figures case which does not use global graph information (if the two nodes have the same color, connect them, if they are different colors, do not connect them). It is therefore unsurprising that GLN_c actually does slightly better than GLN_f (according to Table 2) on geometric figures.\n\nAdditionally, the experiments do not provide much insight into the architecture itself. For example, the present architecture is meant to repeat the embedding and link-prediction steps some number of times, and in the experiments it seems that these steps are repeated four times. But how important is the repetition in practice? It would be nice to see the effect of repetitions on final performance, to demonstrate whether this is in fact an important component of the model or not. Similarly, there are several different loss functions but it is not obvious to what extent these losses contribute to the final performance of the model. It would be nice if there could be some ablation studies that train the model with different combinations of losses to see which are actually important.\n\n3. Finally, I have some concerns about the model itself. If I understand correctly, both f_l and c_l depend on a number of learned parameters which is a function of the number of nodes in the graph. This is unfortunate, as one of the strengths of the graph neural network approach is that GNNs usually have a number of parameters that is independent of the size of the graph, thus allowing GNNs to scale to graphs of arbitrary size. However, that is not the case in this model. Moreover, the architecture of f_l and c_l do not seem particularly novel. f_l just involves passing the node embeddings through a MLP to produce the link predictions. c_l involves something closer to message-passing, though where weighted combinations are learned on a per-node basis (rather than sharing the same function across all nodes). This could be interesting, even though it sacrifices the scale-free nature of GNNs, if it could be shown to actually outperform existing GNN approaches on more realistic datasets. However, given the lack of experiments demonstrating this, it is hard to say how significant the approach is.\n\n[1] Kipf, Fetaya, Wang, Welling & Zemel (2018).
