Pros:  This is an important problem with many applications.  Cons:  The novelty is minimal.  Some previous work has done joint training of supervised models with CCA, and some has addressed training deep CCA in a stochastic setting.  The reviewers (and I) are unconvinced that the differences from previous work are sufficient, and the paper does not carefully compare with the previous work.

Integrating supervision into existing deep CCA methods required a fundamental change in formulation. Deep CCA does not compute the embeddings directly as it optimizes an equivalent objective; therefore, we could not simply add an additional term. Instead, we found an alternative formulation for maximizing the correlation and three different ways to handle the orthogonality constraints of CCA. We contributed these 3 CCA-inspired solutions that progressively relax the orthogonality constraints of CCA. None of these 3 approaches correspond to anything in the literature. Further, our approach gives significant accuracy improvements on three different types of analysis tasks: 8.5% improvement for cross-view classification on MNIST, 2.2-3.2% for regularization with a second view on CBCS, and 15% for multi-view learning on XRMB.\n\nOriginality 2: We tested 3 distinct use cases: C1) cross-view classification, C2) multi-view regularization during training, and C3) semi-supervised representation learning for multi-view prediction.\n\nIn our cross-view classification experiment on MNIST (Sec. 4.1), we trained an SVM on the embedding from the first view and tested using the embedding from the second view. This toy setup validates both the discriminativeness of the embedding and the success in finding a shared space. Our results showed clear deficiencies in previous deep CCA methods and demonstrated that ours is much more robust to small training sets.\n\nReal world use cases are best represented by C2 and C3. C3 studies multi-view classification for phonetic recognition on speech data using XRMB. Both views were used for training and at test time. This experiment demonstrated our TOCCA methods for learning a better representation for classification and seems to be the test case that you suggested in your comment about our MNIST experiment. We found a 15% increase in classification with TOCCA vs. the best deep supervised CCA-based methods that we compared with.\n\nOriginality 3: Our other real world test case (and the one that motivates our work) is the cancer classification experiment for C2 (Sec. 4.2). We demonstrated that TOCCA can regularize a model when two views are available for training but only one at test time. This example uses a breast cancer data set with imaging and genomic data and was motivated by our clinical collaborators. Specifically, all patients undergoing a tumor biopsy or resection will be screened by a pathologist, i.e., the pathologist will inspect the tissue sample under a microscope to detect cancer and assess its aggressiveness. This analysis is comparatively cheap and part of the established workflow. Genomic analysis, which may be performed to inform treatment decisions based on genomic subtype (see https://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types/prosigna), is expensive. Hence, having an image-based screening method to determine who would benefit from further genomic analysis could be much more cost effective and enable this technology to benefit more patients. Our results demonstrated that having the extra genomic view during training can improve upon an image-only model. Our clinical collaborators on this project are interested in this exact use case.\n\nNote that this setup was specifically chosen based on strong practical needs of our medical collaborators where the assumption is that only one of the modalities will be available during test time. We agree that, if one had both modalities at test time, this experimental setup would not be considered optimal. Our setup was not chosen to highlight the performance of TOCCA, instead TOCCA was designed (and experimentally tested) to fulfill the requirements for a real clinical problem. We are happy to clarify this in the manuscript.\n\nQuality: The three use cases that we studied are not contrived; each is suited to a different application. This diversity of experiments demonstrated the versatility of our approach. Note also (and see also above) that we do not only add a term, but propose and explore a family of different relaxations. Even if our approach is considered simple, it shows strong improvements over state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets and for multiple tasks. This makes TOCCA, in our opinion, a highly practical and useful approach.\n\nClarity: Code will be on GitHub after the review period; however, it was also submitted anonymously with this paper (stated on pg. 6, footnote 3)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper394/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper394/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Multi-View Learning via Task-Optimal CCA", "authors": ["Heather D.

The traditional method for computing correlations between feature sets is Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), which finds linear projections that maximize correlation between feature vectors, essentially computing a shared embedding for two views of data.

Being generative, it might not have strong discriminative power for some downstream classification tasks. Previous approaches to infuse discriminative power into the shared subspace estimated by CCA are linear. So, this paper proposes to learn 1) non-linear 2) discriminative subspaces for CCA. The paper accomplishes this by simply adding a task specific term to the optimization objective of DeepCCA (Andrew et. al. 2013), which involves just adding a task-specific MLP on top and minimizing the associated loss-function. \n\n\n1). The novelty of the proposed approach is limited. It just adds an extra term (extra neural network layer) with a corresponding weighting hyperparameter to the objective function of a previous method (DeepCCA) without much motivation.\n\n\n2). The experimental setup and results are sound but some of the tasks seem contrived to show the improved performance of TOCCA methods. For instance, in the cross-view MNIST classification the authors use only projection from one view at training time and use the other view at test-time. What's the motivation for this setup? Why not split the data into train and test set by splitting observations, then train on both the views at train time and test on the held-out observations at test-time? I hope I am not missing something. \n\n3). Similarly, for the \"Regularization for Cancer Classification\" task, it's assumed that only one view is available at test time. Why is that? What are the real-world examples of such setups?  \n\n\nQuality:\n\nThe paper is technically sound, though it is a trivial extension of a previous method. The experimental setup is somewhat contrived to show the superiority of the proposed method. \n\n\nClarity:\n\nThe paper is well organized and is well written in general. The supplementary material contains more results and code will be available after the review period. \n\n\nSignificance:\n\nThe paper solves an important problem by infusing discriminative power into generative subspaces learned by CCA but the results are not that important in my eyes. Since the empirical setup is a little contrived it is hard to even know whether a simple two-step approach that first estimates CCA subspace and then uses those projections in a SVM or MLP would perform comparable or better if given a fair-chance to compete.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper394/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper394/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Multi-View Learning via Task-Optimal CCA", "authors": ["Heather D.

The problem is timely and important as it is challenging to perform CCA jointly with the task classification (see below) and hence previous work typically perform this in a pipeline - that is, first projecting the data using a pre-trained CCA and then training a task classifier using the projected representation. As the authors note, this may be problematic as CCA may delete important information that is relevant for the classification, if training is not done jointly. \n\nAs the authors note, the main challenge in developing a task-optimal form of deep CCA that discriminates based on the CCA projection is in computing this projection within the network. To deal with this, the authors propose approximations for two steps: maximizing the sum correlation between activations A1 and A2 and enforcing orthonormality constraints within A1 and A2. Particularly, the authors present three methods that progressively relax the orthogonality constraints. Also, because correlation is not separable across batches, SGD is not possible for deep CCA training and the authors deal with this too (although this was dealt with in previous work on deep CCA as well).\n\nThis is an empirical paper in the sense that no guarantees are provided for the proposed techniques. The experiments are thorough, convincing and the span a range of applications. The results demonstrate the value of the proposed approximations, and I hence recommend a weak accept of the paper.
