The authors claim that their proposed model outperforms the previous baselines. \n\nHere are my comments: \n\n1. Presentation needs improvement. Some statements are difficult to follow, or more explanations are needed. For example, \"little work has considered representing fundamental values directly\". What does \"fundamental values\" mean? This phase only occurs once in the introduction part. The authors do not elaborate on how to model fundamental values in their method. The benefits of modeling fundamental values should be illustrated.\n\n2. Following the above point, I do not see a clear motivation for this work. Also, I do not find the challenges of the problem addressed in this paper. Without knowing this, it is difficult to evaluate the contributions of this paper.\n\n3. For the framework in Figure 2, I like the modeling Future component. This design is interesting and reasonable. However, I do not understand the modeling noise component. I fail to find its rationality in the paper. Figure 2 is the key to this paper. There is no description of that. The second paragraph of Section 3 unfortunately is not its description.\n\n4. I lost the connection between Section 3.5 and Section 3.1 - 3.4. Since there are many variables, a notation table is suggested.\n \n5. Stock prediction is a very interesting topic. However, I find the benchmark dataset used in this paper is out-of-the-date. This is an application-oriented paper, which should demonstrate its practicability. It is encouraged to see the performance of the proposed method on the recent stock prediction. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1175/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1175/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "News-Driven Stock Prediction Using Noisy Equity State Representation", "authorids": ["~Xiao_Liu14", "hhy63@bit.edu.cn", "yue.zhang@wias.org.cn"], "authors": ["Xiao Liu", "Heyan Huang", "Yue Zhang"], "keywords": ["news-driven stock prediction", "equity state representation", "recurrent state transition"], "abstract": "News-driven stock prediction investigates the correlation between news events and stock price movements.\nPrevious work has considered effective ways for representing news events and their sequences, but rarely exploited the representation of underlying equity states.\nWe address this issue by making use of a recurrent neural network to represent an equity state transition sequence, integrating news representation using contextualized embeddings as inputs to the state transition mechanism.\nThanks to the separation of news and equity representations, our model can accommodate additional input factors.\nWe design a novel random noise factor for modeling influencing factors beyond news events, and a future event factor to address the delay of news information (e.g., insider trading).\nResults show that the proposed model outperforms strong baselines in the literature.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "liu|newsdriven_stock_prediction_using_noisy_equity_state_representation", "one-sentence_summary": "We investigate explicit modeling of equity state representations in news-driven stock prediction by using an LSTM state to model the fundamentals, adding news impact and noise impact by using attention and noise sampling, respectively.", "pdf": "/pdf/8edfea7f8cb03fcf3205c123f11639241f554caf.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=ACB1_v9e24", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nliu2021newsdriven,\ntitle={News-Driven Stock Prediction Using Noisy Equity State Representation},\nauthor={Xiao Liu and Heyan Huang and Yue Zhang},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=imnG4Ap9dAd}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).

The authors claim that separately representing the news and equity states is a novel part of this paper. Also, the random noise factor and future event factors are proposed as novel modules.\n- Quality: The paper is somewhat unclearly written and the performance improvement compared with conventional methods is marginal. The novelty is marginal or the authors should explain the novel contents in detail. \n- Clarity: The paper contains some unclear explanations and inappropriate notations but could be improved.\n  - Regarding notation, the authors need to be more strict. \n  - Why the trading day is denoted by $x$ in Sec. 3 and denoted by $t$ in other text? It should be consistent. \n   - Eq. (2). Why there is an 'i' on the upper side of argmax? If it is a typo, then please fix it.\n   - Eq. (2). Is the t in the right hand side is necessary? (i.e. the $| t$ in the $\\hat{p_t}(\\hat{y_t} = i | t)$).\n   - In the Equation (2) and (3), the $\\overleftarrow{}$ and $\\overrightarrow{}$ seems redundant representation. The authors could simplify the notation.\n  - What is $h$ in Eq (3)? I can only guess but the authors should clarify. \n   - There is no explicit definition of the equity state $z$. I guess that most of the ML people would easily figure out that it is an implicit state handled by LSTM, however, the people in the finance field may be confused that it could be an explanatory state (factor) such as momentum, volatility, or mean reversion. Also, the original news events are represented in natural language but it is represented as a news event vector $v_t$ in this paper. I suggest that the authors add an explicit explanation of the definition for a more self-contained paper.\n   - Through subsections 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4, the submodules are explained with many notations. But it is difficult to figure out what the inputs and outputs are. I suggest the authors modify Figure 2 to include associated variables.\n  - Equation (3)~(8) can be rearranged by operations since the past, present, and future news are computed in a similar way. \n   - Sec. 3.2 The long-term articles may include short-term articles, and it seems redundant. Why not merge them into one module? (i.e. weighting scheme based on recent time). \n  - Is the $v_t=[a_t, b_t, c_t]$ for training and $v_t=[\\hat{a}_t, b_t, c_t]$ for test? It should be clarified in Sec. 3.3. \n- Originality: I barely see originality in this paper.\n- Significance: I barely see significant modules proposed in this paper.\n- Pros\n- Cons\n   - Random noise factor. \n      - One of the two novel features in this paper is the random noise factor. The authors claimed that it could model unknown factors such as sentiments, however, what I understand is that it is a simple data augmentation function. If it is an important module, the authors could assign more pages to explain and showing experimental results associated with the module.\n   - Future news\n    - What does it mean by predicting future news $\\hat{a}_t$ using the past news $c_t$ and present news $b_t$ in Equation (9)? I don't make sense to me that future news can be predicted. \n     - Throughout the paper, it should be very careful and clear about explaining future news. It may confuse the readers that the algorithm employs future data even in the test. Only careful readers would find out the \"At test time, future news events are not accessible\". It should be emphasized.\n  - Ablation study\n     - Excluding only one module significantly drops the predicted performance and could not improve than Ding et al.(2016). It means that the surviving modules may not be novel and effective in terms of performance. \n- Experiments\n   - I recommend the authors try other evaluation metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, to evaluate the realistic wealth curve. (i.e. if the model makes the right prediction for small movement and makes the wrong prediction for large price movement, then the wealth will eventually be reduced).\n   - Ablation study is also performed properly.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1175/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1175/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "News-Driven Stock Prediction Using Noisy Equity State Representation", "authorids": ["~Xiao_Liu14", "hhy63@bit.edu.cn", "yue.zhang@wias.org.cn"], "authors": ["Xiao Liu", "Heyan Huang", "Yue Zhang"], "keywords": ["news-driven stock prediction", "equity state representation", "recurrent state transition"], "abstract": "News-driven stock prediction investigates the correlation between news events and stock price movements.\nPrevious work has considered effective ways for representing news events and their sequences, but rarely exploited the representation of underlying equity states.\nWe address this issue by making use of a recurrent neural network to represent an equity state transition sequence, integrating news representation using contextualized embeddings as inputs to the state transition mechanism.\nThanks to the separation of news and equity representations, our model can accommodate additional input factors.\nWe design a novel random noise factor for modeling influencing factors beyond news events, and a future event factor to address the delay of news information (e.g., insider trading).\nResults show that the proposed model outperforms strong baselines in the literature.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "liu|newsdriven_stock_prediction_using_noisy_equity_state_representation", "one-sentence_summary": "We investigate explicit modeling of equity state representations in news-driven stock prediction by using an LSTM state to model the fundamentals, adding news impact and noise impact by using attention and noise sampling, respectively.", "pdf": "/pdf/8edfea7f8cb03fcf3205c123f11639241f554caf.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=ACB1_v9e24", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nliu2021newsdriven,\ntitle={News-Driven Stock Prediction Using Noisy Equity State Representation},\nauthor={Xiao Liu and Heyan Huang and Yue Zhang},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=imnG4Ap9dAd}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
