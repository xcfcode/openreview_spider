We completely agree that ablation studies are a MUST to investigate the influence of architectural choices. We had already investigated this in the appendix sections and during method development and we will add a larger ablation study in the main paper. On the other hand, the architectural choices were based on a single idea of introducing mass conservation. This idea directly implied the design of the input gate, redistribution matrix and output gate. We will elaborate on how these architectural components influence the final performance of MC-LSTM. \n\nAd 2.) We completely agree that prior competitive baselines are necessary for such works. We therefore benchmarked MC-LSTM against several baselines and recently published methods, for example different LSTM variants, neural arithmetic units, and neural arithmetic logical units in the area of neural arithmetics. We extend our comparative effort by adding physics-inspired architectures, such as Hamiltonian neural networks. Since in standard benchmarks for language models there is no quantity to conserve, we used benchmarking frameworks of areas in which a physical quantity has to be conserved. We evaluated MC-LSTM on the benchmarking setting in the area of neural arithmetics (Madsen, 2020), in physics on the damped pendulum modeling task by Iten et al. (2020), and in environmental modeling on flood forecasting (Kratzert et al., 2019). We emphasize that MC-LSTM is currently the best neural arithmetic unit and the best model for predicting peak flood events, which can strongly impact environmental modeling.\n"}, "signatures": ["~G\u00fcnter_Klambauer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "~G\u00fcnter_Klambauer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "MC-LSTM: Mass-conserving LSTM", "authorids": ["~Pieter-Jan_Hoedt1", "~Frederik_Kratzert1", "~Daniel_Klotz1", "halmich@ml.jku.at", "~Markus_Holzleitner1", "gsnearing@google.com", "~Sepp_Hochreiter1", "~G\u00fcnter_Klambauer1"], "authors": ["Pieter-Jan Hoedt", "Frederik Kratzert", "Daniel Klotz", "Christina Halmich", "Markus Holzleitner", "Grey Nearing", "Sepp Hochreiter", "G\u00fcnter Klambauer"], "keywords": ["LSTM", "RNN", "mass-conservation", "neural arithmetic units", "inductive bias", "hydrology"], "abstract": "The success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision is mainly driven by their strong inductive bias,  which is strong enough to allow CNNs to solve vision-related tasks with random weights, meaning without learning.

Unlike the standard LSTM, the proposed mass-conserving LSTM subtracts the output hidden state of the LSTM from its current cell state, thus preserving the \"mass\" stored in the cell states at each step. A left-stochastic recurrent weight matrix is also used to conserve the \"mass\" across the time steps. Empirical experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed MC-LSTM on a range of datasets such as addition & arithmetic tasks, traffic forecast, and rainfall modeling models. \n\nSeveral issues were clarified during the rebuttal period in a way that satisfied the reviewers. However, some concerns still remain unanswered:\n\n1) This is an empirical paper that proposes a modified LSTM that brings forward a few different ideas: L1 norm, stochastic transition matrices, and subtracting the output hidden states. An ablation study is a MUST in such an applied work. It has been pointed out by other reviewers that there are many prior references on LSTMs variants. It would greatly strengthen the paper by considering more diverse baselines. There is no experiment nor discussion on how much each modification helps wrt the final accuracy. Thus it remains unclear how the results can generalize to other problems.\n\n2) Although the results seem convincing across various datasets that mass conservation seems to help, the datasets are non-standard benchmarks in the machine learning conferences thus there is a lack of competitive prior baselines. As the proposed LSTM has a different number of parameters compared to the standard LSTM, is it fair to compare the different architectures under the same number of neurons? What happens if we compare the architectures with the same number of parameters? And how well does the model scale as we vary the hidden size? It would be helpful to keep the contributions into perspective by using standard RNN benchmark datasets such as Penn TreeBank or Wiki-8.\n\nOverall, the basic idea seems interesting, but the lack of ablation studies significantly hurt the contribution and the positioning of the paper. Given the current submission, the paper needs further development, and non-trivial modifications, to be broadly appreciated by the machine learning community.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "MC-LSTM: Mass-conserving LSTM", "authorids": ["~Pieter-Jan_Hoedt1", "~Frederik_Kratzert1", "~Daniel_Klotz1", "halmich@ml.jku.at", "~Markus_Holzleitner1", "gsnearing@google.com", "~Sepp_Hochreiter1", "~G\u00fcnter_Klambauer1"], "authors": ["Pieter-Jan Hoedt", "Frederik Kratzert", "Daniel Klotz", "Christina Halmich", "Markus Holzleitner", "Grey Nearing", "Sepp Hochreiter", "G\u00fcnter Klambauer"], "keywords": ["LSTM", "RNN", "mass-conservation", "neural arithmetic units", "inductive bias", "hydrology"], "abstract": "The success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision is mainly driven by their strong inductive bias,  which is strong enough to allow CNNs to solve vision-related tasks with random weights, meaning without learning.

To do so, they aim at exploiting the memory cells of the LSTM as mass accumulators and then force the conservation laws via the model equations.

They have shown in various applications that these models lead to on par or better performance compared to state of art approaches. However, after examining the paper, I am not yet fully convinced that 1) a general unified MC-LSTMs can achieve good performance in all the mentioned cases 2) the conserved mass is interpretable (and corresponds to the problem\u2019s invariant, conserved quantity). I have listed those concerns in the question sections as authors might have precise answers. \n\n#### Pros\n\nThe authors in this paper have proposed a new family of LSTMs (i.e. MC-LSTMs) which can be shown to have a conservation property for the mass held by the LSTM memory cells. The authors have applied their models in three different prediction tasks involving quantity conservation, namingly summation(and subtraction), traffic prediction and rainfall runoff modelling. The proposed models (with some variants) achieve better or at least on par with current state of art models.\n\nThese different applications illustrate the usefulness of the models; the authors also reference appropriately to current state of art approaches, helping reviewers to well situate the paper\u2019s contribution.\n\n#### Questions:\n\nWell I understand there are differences for each application (motivating to choose different neural architectures), it would be very interesting to know the performance of one quite general architecture (compared to say standard LSTM implemented in torch). In the paper, we have seen in the experiments:\n- time - independent R^t used in arithmetics\n- time - dependent R^t used in hydrology experiments\n- Hypernetwork based R^t used in pendulum experiments\nAnd also they vary on the auxiliary/mass inputs choices. \nWhat would be the performance if the authors use a quite general architecture (for example the second setting) for all the experiments please?\n\nJust for confirmation, in the experiments, the LSTMs involve forgetting gate right (contrary to what described in eq (1))\n\nI don\u2019t find explanations for the r value for the hydrology experiments. Meanwhile the r value for the traditional r value is different from what is chosen for the MC-LSTM. Why is this please?\n\n#### Minor issues:\n\nThere seems some formatting issues at the end of \u201cMechanisms beyond storing are required for real-world applications\u201d in Introduction. \n\nIn related work, Hamiltonian approaches (Greydanus et al. 2019) don\u2019t seem to assume access knowledge to time derivatives w.r.t. Inputs. Rather, it favours the conservation parametrised by the Hamiltonian.  \n\n#### Minor suggestions:\n\nIn abstract, \u201cexpressed through continuity equations\u201d, these aspects don\u2019t seem to be addressed by MC-LSTMs, so I propose to not include this phrase in the abstract. \n\nI suggest adding some citations In the introduction where the authors said \u201cLSTM to excel at speech, text, and language tasks\u201d http://nlpprogress.com/. \n\nThe authors mention in the abstract and introduction about the interpretability but only show the mass interpretation in the hydrology experiments. For which I would suggest the authors show it in at least one other experiments (e.g. traffic) to 1) be more convincing 2) highlight this property (which may reveal to be very beneficial for production systems)\n\nI would be good to mention forgetting gate around equation (1) as those are used for later experiments in the paper. \n\n#### Thank you for the authors to having answered my questions and having addressed all my comments. My main concern was about the generalisation of the proposed architecture and the results at the current revision are convincing to me. I believe this direction of the research together with the approach taken make a nice contribution to the conference. In consequence, I have raised my score from 5 to 7.

We see MC-LSTM as a modular system and the empirical analysis also as a form of showcase, where the different implementations emphasize the flexibility of MC-LSTM. Thus, it is our opinion that the choice of R --- in size and behavior --- is also a form of inductive bias. We do agree with the reviewer that this was not clear in the original version. In the revised manuscript, we emphasize this point to make it  clearer to future readers. Regardless of that, we re-ran experiments of neural arithmetic problems, using the time-dependent formulation of R^t. We found that the results changed only slightly, which can be seen as an indicator that the architecture generalizes well. \n - (Forget gate)  The reviewer is right. We used the original LSTM formulation by Hochreiter in Eq. (1), but for the experiments we used standard LSTMs that also involve a forget gate. In Eq. (1), we just want to explain our point of departure to motivate the MC-LSTM. We now state this clearer in the manuscript.\n - (R value): We apologize for the unclarity of the statement with the r value. This \u201cr\u201d value is the Pearson correlation. There might also be some misunderstanding about the hydrology models for rainfall-runoff modeling and the models for snow-water equivalent. We reformulated the paragraph to improve clarity and avoid misunderstandings. \n\nRegarding Minor Issues:\n - (formatting issues) We reformatted the document and hope that the formatting issue disappeared.  \n - (Hamiltonian approaches) Thanks, we reformulated this statement about Hamiltonian NNs in the related works section.  \n\nRegarding Minor Suggestions:\n - (continuity equations) We removed this statement in the revised manuscript. \n - (additional NLP references) We added references as proposed. \n - (Interpretability) We agree with this suggestion and added an analysis of trained MC-LSTM arithmetic tasks as well as for the pendulum (see also AnonReviewer1).\n - (Forget gate) Good point, this should definitely be mentioned.

The main concerns of the reviewer are regarding the relative brevity of the qualitative analysis. We hope that the concerns are addressed in the revised manuscript. In the following, we provide answers to the individual concerns point-by-point:\n\nRegarding Weaknesses:\n 1. (Qualitative Results) We provide a qualitative analysis of the results for the arithmetic task and for the pendulum in the respective sections in the main paper and in the appendix. \n 2. (Related work) We added the missing references that the reviewer suggested.\n\nRegarding Questions & Additional Feedback\n 1. (Vanishing gradient) We thank the reviewer for this question. The gradient flow is largely governed by the redistribution matrix R. We would like to note that with a redistribution matrix close to identity, the gradient flow is similar to that of LSTM with a forget gate. For random redistribution matrices,  the circular law theorem for random Markov matrices can be used to analyze gradient flow. We now provide more details on this topic in the main manuscript (\u201cInitialisation and gradient flow\u201d in section 3) and in Appendix Section D. \n 2. (Qualitative analysis) This is a good suggestion. We conducted such an analysis for the arithmetic units and the pendulum that is now presented in the respective sections in the main paper and in the appendix.\n 3. (L1 norm): The L1 norm is not intrinsically necessary. The actual norm used should not have major influence on the results. We have two reasons for using the L1-norm here: First, we want to avoid saturation of the gates through large values of the cell states (which could also be achieved by other normalization methods). Second, L1 normalization supplies probability vectors that represent the current distribution of the mass across cell states which fits well with the stochastic matrices used for redistribution. In the revised manuscript, we extended the explanation for our choice in the corresponding section in the main paper.\n 4. (Extension) When the mass is directly supplied to MC-LSTM as mass input, quantities like mass^2 can not be represented in MC-LSTM. However, if mass inputs are fed into an MLP and then into MC-LSTM, other conserved quantities, such as 2\\*mass or mass^2, can potentially be represented. Another option is to have an linear layer (or MLP) mapping the MCLSTM output to the output neuron, which could learn a scaling (such as 2\\*mass). The fact that these strategies can work is shown in our experiments with neural arithmetics, where the output has to be scaled (recurrent arithmetic), and in MNIST-addition, where the quantity to be conserved has to be learned via CNN filters. \n 5. (MC-Transformer) We think this is an interesting idea. Generally, it does not seem to be a trivial extension because of the inherent mechanism of a transformer. However, we can point out that there is some relation to Transformer: each mass accumulator learns to attend to all other mass accumulators of the previous timestep via the redistribution matrix. Thus, a mass accumulator updates its own representation based on its attending to other mass accumulators, which is similar to how sequence tokens update their representations in Transformers and BERT.\n\nWe also addressed the typos in the revised manuscript."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3049/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3049/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "MC-LSTM: Mass-conserving LSTM", "authorids": ["~Pieter-Jan_Hoedt1", "~Frederik_Kratzert1", "~Daniel_Klotz1", "halmich@ml.jku.at", "~Markus_Holzleitner1", "gsnearing@google.com", "~Sepp_Hochreiter1", "~G\u00fcnter_Klambauer1"], "authors": ["Pieter-Jan Hoedt", "Frederik Kratzert", "Daniel Klotz", "Christina Halmich", "Markus Holzleitner", "Grey Nearing", "Sepp Hochreiter", "G\u00fcnter Klambauer"], "keywords": ["LSTM", "RNN", "mass-conservation", "neural arithmetic units", "inductive bias", "hydrology"], "abstract": "The success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision is mainly driven by their strong inductive bias,  which is strong enough to allow CNNs to solve vision-related tasks with random weights, meaning without learning.

We agree with that. The two shortcomings the reviewer pointed out, were that the usage of the softmax is unclear and that the computation cost was not discussed in the original manuscript. As our individual answers below show, we took both points at heart and incorporated them in the updated version:  \n\nRegarding Cons: \n 1. (Softmax) We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Our aim was to give a basic formulation of MC-LSTM that provides the foundation for applying it to different tasks. However, it is possible to use other approaches that guarantee column-normalized matrices, e.g. by using sigmoids and normalization. For example, in the hydrology experiment we use normalized sigmoids as activation function in the input gate. We did not communicate this well enough. For the final version, we made sure that this flexibility is well-emphasized and better described in the manuscript. \n 2. (Computational Complexity) This is an interesting aspect that we now consider in more depth in the main paper. Indeed, the computational complexity of MC-LSTM is usually higher than for standard LSTMs. For a small number of mass inputs and time-independent MC-LSTM gates, the computational complexity is very similar.

We find it motivating that others also value solutions that focus on applicability of real-world applications. \n\nRegarding Cons (experimental settings): \n - It is true that we focus on applications where conservation is part of the underlying process. We do not envision MC-LSTM as a general purpose network, which would, for example, replace LSTM in application domains such as next-word prediction, or similar. Rather we see it as a variation that is specifically tailored for applications where mass conservation (in our general sense) is helpful or necessary, which --- as the reviewer points out --- are many real-world systems.\nAlthough it is not impossible, it would also not be trivial to decide what the mass or auxiliary inputs in e.g. a language modeling task should be. Ultimately, we believe that some restrictions in terms of applicability will always apply to methods with greater inductive bias such as the MC-LSTM. However, within these confinements quite some flexibility is possible. \nWe also want to point out that e.g. the hydrology example does not strictly require mass-conservation since the mass balance is not closed (i.e., only a part of the incoming water reaches the measurement station within the river, the remainder is \u201clost\u201d due to evapotranspiration and percolation effects) and the incoming amount of water (i.e., the precipitation) is a noisy estimate. Other options for relaxing the setup exist too. For example,  one possibility would be to learn additional scaling factors for the inputs to account for systematic input-biases. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3049/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3049/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "MC-LSTM: Mass-conserving LSTM", "authorids": ["~Pieter-Jan_Hoedt1", "~Frederik_Kratzert1", "~Daniel_Klotz1", "halmich@ml.jku.at", "~Markus_Holzleitner1", "gsnearing@google.com", "~Sepp_Hochreiter1", "~G\u00fcnter_Klambauer1"], "authors": ["Pieter-Jan Hoedt", "Frederik Kratzert", "Daniel Klotz", "Christina Halmich", "Markus Holzleitner", "Grey Nearing", "Sepp Hochreiter", "G\u00fcnter Klambauer"], "keywords": ["LSTM", "RNN", "mass-conservation", "neural arithmetic units", "inductive bias", "hydrology"], "abstract": "The success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision is mainly driven by their strong inductive bias,  which is strong enough to allow CNNs to solve vision-related tasks with random weights, meaning without learning.
