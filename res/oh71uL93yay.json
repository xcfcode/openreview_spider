The reviewer made a number of helpful suggestions, and we have addressed your comments and included further clarifications in the paper to make the paper clearer and more understandable.\n\nQ1: *Additional specialized effort is needed to extend label propagation in inductive setting.*\n\nA1: The proposed method can be generalized to inductive setting as long as the edge weights is not modeled using its identity but a function of features of its two end-points. Please refer to the last paragraph in page 4 for details.\n\n\nQ2: *I think that it is more appropriate if the authors introduced the proposed objective function as a simple implementation of multi-objective optimization.*\n\nA2: We agree with the reviewer that it is a great intuition and explanation for the proposed loss term. We have added this part in the paper.\n\n\nQ3: *How is GCN+LPA implemented?*\n\nA3: GCN+LPA is implemented by simply averaging the predicted probability vectors output by GCN and LPA. These two vectors are within the same scale since they are both normalized.\n\n\nQ4: *What is the sparseness of edges in random graphs in Figure 5?*\n\nA4: The average number of neighbors for each node in random graph is set as 5 (this is clarified under Figure 6). This setting is reasonable since we can see from Table 3 that the average node degree in most real-world datasets is quite small ($\\leq 5$).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2138/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2138/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unifying Graph Convolutional Neural Networks and Label Propagation", "authorids": ["~Hongwei_Wang1", "~Jure_Leskovec1"], "authors": ["Hongwei Wang", "Jure Leskovec"], "keywords": ["graph convolutional neural networks", "label propagation", "semi-supervised node classification"], "abstract": "Label Propagation (LPA) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) are both message passing algorithms on graphs.

Simultaneously learning W and A in GCN will certainly increase the risk of overfitting since the number of learnable parameters increases. The reason why introducing an LPA loss term can alleviate this problem is that LPA loss term provides **direct** supervision for learning edge weights.\n\n\nQ2: *I would suggest that using LPA to obtain the updated edges and then fix them, before sending them to the GCN model.*\n\nA2: We agree with the reviewer that this is an alternative to combine GCN and LPA.

The reviewer made a number of helpful suggestions, and we have addressed your comments and included further clarifications in the paper to make the paper clearer and more understandable.\n\nQ1: *The performance improvement between the proposed method and GDC is marginal, which can hardly demonstrate the advantage of the unified model over the graph diffusion network.*\n\nA1: Our method outperforms GDC in most cases, which demonstrates its advantage over GDC. It is true that the performance gain is not statistically significant, but given the large number of SOTA GNNs proposed in recent two years, it is extremely hard to achieve significant performance gain over every baseline on every dataset. Even GDC itself does not significantly outperform every baseline on every dataset according to their reported results. We think that the result in this paper is sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Besides, our contribution is more than the empirical effectiveness but also the theoretical analysis on GCN and LPA.\n\n\nQ2: *The result of the baseline GCN+LPA is worse than GCN and LPA.*\n\nA2: The reason that GCN+LPA performs worse than GCN is straightforward: it simply averages the predicted results of GCN and LPA, but the performance of LPA is quite bad. Therefore, LPA is a drag on the performance of GCN+LPA. The purpose of setting this baseline is to show that simply averaging their results does not work well. In fact, we did have designed another baseline called LPA->GCN, which uses LPA to produce pseudo-labels for unlabeled nodes then training on GCN using all labels (including the pseudo-labels). The result of this baseline is slightly better than GCN+LPA but still much worse than our proposed method. We do not show its result in this paper because we think that LPA+GCN is already sufficient to show that simply combining these two modules does not work well.\n\n\nQ3: *The lack of detailed hyperparameter tuning strategies of compared baseline.*\n\nA3: The hyperparameter settings are the same as reported in their original papers or codes. This is fair because we are using the same datasets and the same experimental settings (e.g. train/test ratio) as baselines.\n\n\nQ4: *What is the model difference between the proposed method and GAT?*\n\nA4: This is clarified in Abstract (the No. 5 line from the bottom: \u201c*Our model can also be seen as\u2026*\u201d), Introduction (the No. 6 line from the bottom of the second last paragraph: \u201c*It is worth noticing that\u2026*\u201d), and Related Work (the last paragraph: \u201c*Attention and Diffusion on Graphs*...\u201d). Basically, the difference between the proposed method and GAT is that, in GAT, edge weights are learned based on **node feature similarity**, while our work learns edge weights based on **node labels**.\n\n\nQ5: *It would be better to show the performance as the training/test ratio varies.*\n\nA5: This is shown in Table 2, where we vary the labeled node rate from 5% to 80%. A large labeled node rate will increase our performance gain because our method relies on node labels to reweight edges.\n\n\nQ6. *Only model scalability comparison between GCN-LPA method and GCN is studied.*\n\nA6: We only compare the running time between GCN-LPA and GCN because their implementations are quite similar, except that GCN-LPA introduces an extra LPA regularizer. Therefore, comparing their running time is reasonable. We do not compare with other baselines because the running time largely depends on their implementations (programming framework, number of epochs, early stopping, number of hidden dimensions...) The comparison will be reasonable only if they are implemented under the same framework. This is a huge work that we may not able to complete within the rebuttal period, but we will add the comparison between GCN-LPA and other baselines in the future version.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2138/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2138/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unifying Graph Convolutional Neural Networks and Label Propagation", "authorids": ["~Hongwei_Wang1", "~Jure_Leskovec1"], "authors": ["Hongwei Wang", "Jure Leskovec"], "keywords": ["graph convolutional neural networks", "label propagation", "semi-supervised node classification"], "abstract": "Label Propagation (LPA) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) are both message passing algorithms on graphs.

The main idea is to optimize edge weights (after making edge weights trainable) by maximizing the intra-class feature influence. Introducing the theorems on the relationship between feature and label influence, and LPA\u2019s prediction, the authors propose the unified objective function (a summation of the GCN loss and LPA loss) which combines both methods.   \n##########################################################################\nReasons for score: \n \nOverall, I vote for accepting. The manuscript is overall well written, and the motivation of the proposed method is well explained by the proposed theorems. The logic leading to the objective function sounds reasonable and interesting.

With the assumption of GCN that \u2018labels/features are correlated over the edges of the graph\u2019, it is desired that weights of inter-class edges are large, and those of intra-class edges are small. Hence, these noisy edges could impair GCN\u2019s performance.\n\nAddressing this problem, this work propose to optimize the given adjacency matrix based on the performance of Label Propagation(LPA) on it. LPA also assume the \u2018homophily\u2019 property of graphs, hence adapting adjacency matrix on it can encourage larger weights being given to trajectories linking two same-class nodes. This step is expected to be beneficial for the performance of GCN.\n\nThis paper has following strong points:\n1.\tProposed GCN-LPA can learn to optimize the edges and perform node classification in an end-to-end manner, without causing much more training time cost;\n2.\tThe writing is clear and easy to understand. The motivation, theory part is presented step by step, with complete proofs of those theorem;\n3.\tExperiments show that the proposed model is better at splitting embedding of nodes from different classes, and achieve improvement in node classification performance.\nFollowing are the weak points:\n1.\tThe idea that LPA can help GCN is not convincing. These two methods have similar assumption over the data, as also shown in the relation between label influence weight and feature influence weight in Theorem 1. Hence, why the authors claim on Page4, after Eq(9), that only updating edges with GCN will cause overfitting? Would not they be the same?\n2.\tThe experiment is not very complete. Implemented GCN-LPA optimizes edges with gradient from both LPA and GCN tasks. The idea that LPA contains complementary information for GCN is not well justified. I would suggest that using LPA to obtain the updated edges and then fix them, before sending them to the GCN model.\n3.\tBesides, there are some other papers also seeking to adapt edges for the training of GCN, which are not mentioned.

In a number of experiments on real-world graphs, our model shows superiority over state-of-the-art graph neural networks in terms of node classification accuracy.", "one-sentence_summary": "This paper studies theoretical relationships between Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) and Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA), then proposes an end-to-end model that unifies GCN and LPA for semi-supervised node classification.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "wang|unifying_graph_convolutional_neural_networks_and_label_propagation", "pdf": "/pdf/c87b8a8d5bd52b657693e324583e35898d09f617.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=WeyE1GLnfq", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nwang2021unifying,\ntitle={Unifying Graph Convolutional Neural Networks and Label Propagation},\nauthor={Hongwei Wang and Jure Leskovec},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=oh71uL93yay}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
