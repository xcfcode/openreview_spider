The problem has been studied in the security game, resource allocation game and Stackelberg game, where the defender is to play a resource allocation game given the best response of the attacker. in this paper, the authors use stochastic-shortest-path MDP to model the attacker's planning problem. The defender's objective is stated in eq (2) and (3) but not explained clearly.\n\nThe work considers a deceptive attacker whose objective is not to maximize the total reward/minimize the total cost, but rather to balance two objectives: minimizing the total cost while maximizing the KL divergence between its current policy and the optimal goal-achieving policy. This opponent model seems to be simplistic, given security game has studied the opponent using more rigorous equilibrium analysis and with dynamic Bayesian game formulation. \n\nsee Manshaei, Mohammad Hossein, et al. \"Game theory meets network security and privacy.\" ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR) 45.3 (2013): 25.\n\nThe practical application is well motivated. \u2028The paper itself is incomplete and contains many typos.

The paper reviews previous literature and outlines a model, but it seems to be at the draft stage as it stands as the experiment section is missing (section 4). Also, in some parts the sentences are broken and hard to follow, for example, \u201cHere we formulate the stochastic goal recognition control (S-GRC) problem as an extension of the GRD problem to allows non-optimal agents and stochastic actions, which means the agent\u2019s action are not deterministic and the possible successor states are with probability, the measures we can take are interdictions with cost.\u201d\nBased on the above comments I think the paper is not ready for publication.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2584/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2584/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["luojunren17@nudt.edu.cn", "gaowei14@nudt.edu.cn"], "title": "Deceptive Opponent Modeling with Proactive Network Interdiction for Stochastic Goal Recognition Control", "authors": ["Junren Luo", "Wei Gao", "Zhiyong Liao", "Weilin Yuan", "Wanpeng Zhang", "Shaofei Chen"], "pdf": "/pdf/6f4a2ad52c033670611d1e0e4b44154c0dd9a5ab.pdf", "abstract": "Goal recognition based on the observations of the behaviors collected online has been used to model some potential applications. Newly formulated problem of goal recognition design aims at facilitating the online goal recognition process by performing offline redesign of the underlying environment with hard action removal.\nIn this paper, we propose the stochastic goal recognition control (S-GRC) problem with two main stages: (1) deceptive opponent modeling based on maximum entropy regularized Markov decision processes (MDPs) and (2) goal recognition control under proactively static interdiction.\nFor the purpose of evaluation, we propose to use the worst case distinctiveness (wcd) as a measure of the non-distinctive path without revealing the true goals, the task of S-GRC is to interdict a set of actions that improve or reduce the wcd.\nWe empirically demonstrate that our proposed approach control the goal recognition process based on opponent's deceptive behavior.", "keywords": [], "paperhash": "luo|deceptive_opponent_modeling_with_proactive_network_interdiction_for_stochastic_goal_recognition_control", "original_pdf": "/attachment/6f4a2ad52c033670611d1e0e4b44154c0dd9a5ab.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nluo2020deceptive,\ntitle={Deceptive Opponent Modeling with Proactive Network Interdiction for Stochastic Goal Recognition Control},\nauthor={Junren Luo and Wei Gao and Zhiyong Liao and Weilin Yuan and Wanpeng Zhang and Shaofei Chen},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJgqalBKvH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
