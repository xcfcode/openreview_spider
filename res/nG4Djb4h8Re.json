First, meta learning / few shot learning is usually supervised and we argue that unsupervised and weakly supervised approaches are very useful. Second, in this work, we advance the field by leveraging traditional unsupervised learning techniques (i.e., in our case, POS) to provide pseudo labels in a state-of-the-art meta learning framework to train MetaPhys. We are the first to propose an unsupervised deep learning method in the domain of physiological sensing, other unsupervised methods have relied on traditional signal processing and de-mixing (e.g., independent component analysis). Although TS--CAN, MAML and POS do exist, we are the first to integrate and use those three different components in a novel way and our results show a considerable improvement over the state-of-the-art.\n\nIn this work, we provided a certain degree of explanation for why MetaPhys outperforms existing methods, highlighting that both appearance and motion (pixel difference) information is important in the adaptation phase. To our best knowledge, we are the first providing insights why meta learning helps achieve better results in remote physiological sensing.

We\u2019d like to highlight the novelty in our work. Meta learning/few shot learning is usually conducted in a supervised manner and there is still relatively little work exploring unsupervised methods/performance. In this work, we leverage an optically-grounded unsupervised learning technique and a modern meta learning framework to jointly train MetaPhys. This is also the first work that leverages pseudo labels in training a physiological sensing model and the first unsupervised deep learning method in remote physiological measurement. Our results indicate that even a relatively simple de-mixing approaches provides labels that can be used in a meta learning context to obtain strong results and that training with these, sometimes noisy labels, well outperforms the de-mixing approach itself.  \n\nIn Table 1, we show the results from POS, MetaPhys improves the performance (reducing MAE by 53% compared to POS alone). In terms of how POS works, it can be summarized in four main steps: 1) spatial averaging of each video frame, 2)  temporal normalization, 3) de-mixing/source signal separation using a fixed matrix projection to remove specular reflections and other noise, 4) band-pass filtering. We have added more details about POS in the paper. \n\nWe have included more detailed results in the Section 5 about comparison between pretrained and MAML model performance as a function of  size of the support set, and robustness to hyperparameters. Specifically, we experimented with different window sizes in MetaPhys as we think it is the most important parameter that could be tuned.  We tested providing a 6s, 12s and 18s window of data for model adaptation (i.e., the support set) during meta training and testing, and the results showed training with 18s (RMSE: 3.12 BPM) outperformed 6s (RMSE: 5.43) and 12s (RMSE: 5.53) in the MMSE dataset. We found a similar trend on the UBFC dataset as well. (RMSE of 18s: 3.12, RMSE of 12s: 4.48, RMSE of 6s: 3.46).  There are not many other hyperparameters to examine, but if you would like us to present results with different learning rates or other parameters we would be happy to include them. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper703/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper703/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "MetaPhys: Few-Shot Adaptation for Non-Contact Physiological Measurement", "authorids": ["~Xin_Liu8", "~Ziheng_Jiang1", "~Joshua_Wolff_Fromm1", "~Xuhai_Xu1", "~Shwetak_Patel1", "~Daniel_McDuff1"], "authors": ["Xin Liu", "Ziheng Jiang", "Joshua Wolff Fromm", "Xuhai Xu", "Shwetak Patel", "Daniel McDuff"], "keywords": ["Healthcare", "Meta Learning", "Computer Vision"], "abstract": "There are large individual differences in physiological processes, making designing personalized health sensing algorithms challenging.

The goal is to develop few-shot adapting personalized frameworks for remote physiological measurements with limited data. Authors perform cross-dataset evaluations to illustrate the model's few-shot adaptation capabilities.\n\nPositives:\nThe authors present their application domain and purpose very clearly, and the related work from literature are nicely explored. Experimental evaluations are thorough and the comparisons to state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches are done well.\n\nConcerns:\nUnfortunately I do not see any methodological contribution in this paper from a \"representation learning\" perspective. MetaPhys is (as far as it is presented in the paper) a framework on using model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) on physiological measurement data in unsupervised subject adaptation settings. Since MAML is already a model-agnostic approach, the paper seems to me like a well-presented reformulation and implementation of a well-known meta-learning algorithm in this respective application domain. The paper does not make a clearly stated distinction of their approach/contribution from a representation learning standpoint.\nThe authors list their contributions in four bullet-points, where the third and fourth ones relate to analyses of temporal and appearance features during model personalization, and analyses for subjects with different skin types. However these analyses are only addressed superficially (not described or analyzed in detail) at the end of the paper. Hence I would be questioning these as \"contributions\" of this paper.\n\nMinor comment:\nIn fact, the authors present MetaPhys for both supervised and unsupervised few-shot adaptation settings. Then why did the authors use \"unsupervised\" indication for the paper's title (and even in Abstract)?\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper703/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper703/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "MetaPhys: Few-Shot Adaptation for Non-Contact Physiological Measurement", "authorids": ["~Xin_Liu8", "~Ziheng_Jiang1", "~Joshua_Wolff_Fromm1", "~Xuhai_Xu1", "~Shwetak_Patel1", "~Daniel_McDuff1"], "authors": ["Xin Liu", "Ziheng Jiang", "Joshua Wolff Fromm", "Xuhai Xu", "Shwetak Patel", "Daniel McDuff"], "keywords": ["Healthcare", "Meta Learning", "Computer Vision"], "abstract": "There are large individual differences in physiological processes, making designing personalized health sensing algorithms challenging.

The motivation is that traditional fine-tuning method for this task is difficult since it requires large sets of high-quality training data for specific individuals, due to differences between each individual, measurement environment, and camera sensor condition. Therefore, the authors applied MAML on top of the existing deep learning network (TS-CAN) and implemented a model that aims to learn fast from a small number of training samples. The main contributions of this paper are: a meta-learning model that supports both supervised and unsupervised few-shot adaptation; improved performance by about 40% compared to a baseline that does not use meta learning; empirical analysis of performance for subjects with different skin types. \n\nStrengths- \nFew-shot learning could be beneficial for remote patient monitoring applications. \u2028\nExperimental results on all three datasets are positive, with around 40%-50% MAE improvement compared to the baseline. \u2028\nProvided experimental evaluation provides some insight into why the proposed approach works well in this application. \u2028\n\nWeaknesses- \u2028\nThis is a straightforward application of meta learning / few shot learning to a specific domain.

For example, it is not clear how exactly are \u2018pseudo labels\u2019 generated and how do they compare with the ground truth labels. \u2028\nThe experimental results do not do enough to provide some novel insight into MAML. For example, it would be good to see a comparison between pretrained model and MAML model performance as a function of data size, and how robust to hyperparameters are the competing approaches.  \u2028\n\nSummary of the rating:\nWhile the experimental results are positive, there is little methodological novelty and the experimental results do not seem to provide some interesting insights that might spur machine learning research in some novel directions.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper703/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper703/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "MetaPhys: Few-Shot Adaptation for Non-Contact Physiological Measurement", "authorids": ["~Xin_Liu8", "~Ziheng_Jiang1", "~Joshua_Wolff_Fromm1", "~Xuhai_Xu1", "~Shwetak_Patel1", "~Daniel_McDuff1"], "authors": ["Xin Liu", "Ziheng Jiang", "Joshua Wolff Fromm", "Xuhai Xu", "Shwetak Patel", "Daniel McDuff"], "keywords": ["Healthcare", "Meta Learning", "Computer Vision"], "abstract": "There are large individual differences in physiological processes, making designing personalized health sensing algorithms challenging.

Although fine-tuning for a user might address this issue, it is difficult to collect large sets of training data for specific individuals because supervised algorithms require medical-grade sensors for generating the training target. Therefore, learning personalized or customized models from a small number of unlabeled samples is very attractive as it would allow fast calibrations. In this paper, we present a novel meta-learning approach called MetaPhys for learning personalized cardiac signals from 18-seconds of video data. MetaPhys works in both supervised and unsupervised manners. We evaluate our proposed approach on two benchmark datasets and demonstrate superior performance in cross-dataset evaluation with substantial reductions (42% to 44%) in errors compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Visualization of attention maps and ablation experiments reveal how the model adapts to each subject and why our proposed approach leads to these improvements. We have also demonstrated our proposed method significantly helps reduce the bias in skin type.  \n", "one-sentence_summary": "MetaPhys: A novel meta-learning approach for learning personalized cardiovascular signals from 18-seconds of video data.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "liu|metaphys_fewshot_adaptation_for_noncontact_physiological_measurement", "pdf": "/pdf/9db81ac5f75626e42396ae15c95a83ceadce9587.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=d9lrLI5qhn", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nliu2021metaphys,\ntitle={MetaPhys: Few-Shot Adaptation for Non-Contact Physiological Measurement},\nauthor={Xin Liu and Ziheng Jiang and Joshua Wolff Fromm and Xuhai Xu and Shwetak Patel and Daniel McDuff},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=nG4Djb4h8Re}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
