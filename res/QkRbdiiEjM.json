We answer your questions below:\n\n1. Reddit dataset.\n\nAs stated on page 8 of our paper, Reddit is a relatively simple dataset as it has a high label rate (65.9%). Thus, it can be understood that some previous methods can still achieve similar performance on this simple dataset. However, from the comparison of computation cost shown in the left part of Figure 4, we observed that GraphSAGE-mean has a comparable computation cost with GCN. Plus, the huge advantage of per-epoch training time of AdaGCN compared with GCN as shown in Table 4, can provide sufficient empirical proof to demonstrate that AdaGCN still significantly outperforms Graph-SAGE and similar methods in terms of computation cost.\n\n2. Writing.\n\nThank you for this suggestion about writing. We promise to correct typos and improve the presentation in the revised version.\n\n3. Notations.\n\nWhen $K$ refers to the number of classes, it is natural to leverage $k$ to refer to the specific category of a node. Besides, $w_i$ indicates the weight of node $i$ while $w^l$ represents the all weight matrix of nodes in the $l$-th base classifier, for which we used the superscript for the distinguishment. We will make the definitions of notations clearer.\n\n4. Time complexity.\n\nIn our experiments, we evaluate the efficiency of different GCN approaches under the same framework while observing the limited variance of training time. We will add the analysis of time and memory complexity if accepted.\n\n5. Figure 4.\n\nThe nearly constant tendency stems from the computational advantage of AdaGCN, for which we conducted a rigorous analysis in Section 3. Concretely speaking, our RNN-like architecture avoids the additional computation related to sparse matrices A in a network. Thus, the linear tendency will continue even after 10 layers.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1400/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1400/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AdaGCN: Adaboosting Graph Convolutional Networks into Deep Models", "authorids": ["~Ke_Sun3", "~Zhanxing_Zhu1", "~Zhouchen_Lin1"], "authors": ["Ke Sun", "Zhanxing Zhu", "Zhouchen Lin"], "keywords": ["Graph Neural Networks", "AdaBoost"], "abstract": "The design of deep graph models still remains to be investigated and the crucial part is how to explore and exploit the knowledge from different hops of neighbors in an efficient way.

Here is our clarification.\n\n[1] Noisy nodes\n\nRobustness against noisy nodes is an interesting issue. However, we argue that the issue you mentioned may not happen in our AdaGCN, mainly due to the fact that we have employed the early stopping mechanism. During the layer-wise optimization, if higher-order graph convolution achieves worse performance, early stopping, which serves as a regularization, can help avoid this performance degradation and finally selects a model with a relatively small number of layers. We will leave this issue as the future work to explore.\n\n[2] Table 2\n\nWe argue that they are sufficiently close although there is a slight gap. Randomness may be part of the reasons.\n\n[3] Fast-GCN\n\nWe conjecture that it is linked with the sensitivity of hyper-parameters about important sampling in FastGCN. Specifically, our preprocessing of the graphs, which followed Klicpera et al., 2018, is slightly different from FastGCN, and for convenience, we still used the default optimal hyper-parameters of FastGCN for each dataset, respectively. Thus, the sensitivity of sampling hyper-parameters in FastGCN might cause a slight decreasing in its efficiency on some datasets. Overall, we can still admit the efficacy of FastGCN, but we are expected to carefully tune its hyper-parameters of sampling in the practice. Moreover, it is also safe to claim that our AdaGCN is competitive in computation efficiency.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1400/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1400/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AdaGCN: Adaboosting Graph Convolutional Networks into Deep Models", "authorids": ["~Ke_Sun3", "~Zhanxing_Zhu1", "~Zhouchen_Lin1"], "authors": ["Ke Sun", "Zhanxing Zhu", "Zhouchen Lin"], "keywords": ["Graph Neural Networks", "AdaBoost"], "abstract": "The design of deep graph models still remains to be investigated and the crucial part is how to explore and exploit the knowledge from different hops of neighbors in an efficient way.

The objective of this paper is to design a deeper graph models in an efficient way for better performance. The computational efficiency and performance of the proposed algorithm are evaluated using the task of node property prediction on several public datasets. This is a new variant of GNN, but the quality this paper is lower than the expectation regarding to the clarity and organisation. \n\nPros: \n1.\tThe algorithm integrated Adaboosting for graph data. Thus, AdaGCN could utilise different levels of node features for final prediction. \n2.\tThe method is optimised in a layer-wise way rather than the traditional GCN optimisation, which is similar to the optimisation of recurrent neural networks. \n3.\tAuthors compared the structure of AdaGCN with that of other GNN variants. \n4.\tFor the experiments, the proposed algorithm is more computationally efficient, and achieves better performance on the task of node property prediction.  The performance of AdaGCN is slightly more robust than previous methods. The performance drop is not observed within 10 layers for AdaGCN as shown in Fig 3. \n\nCons: \n1.\tSpeaking of the state of art performance, GraphSAGE with LSTM also achieves a 95.4% F1 score on the Reddit dataset for node classification tasks. Thus, the authors may need to compare the training time and performance with more recent algorithms, like ClusterGCN and GraphSAGE. \n2.\tThe paper is not well written. Many typos are discovered. For example, extra space is added in the first sentence after equation 3. Meanwhile, the punctuation around equations is not consistent. For the full sentence following an equation, one would place a full stop after the equation. However, there is no full stop after equations 5, 6, 7, and 8. Abbreviations, such as \"JK\", \"APPNP\", and \"PPNP\", are used before introduction. \n3.\tSome notations are confusing and misleading. $K$ refers to the number of node categories, and $k$ refers to a category of a node. Meanwhile, $w_i$ and $W^{l}$ have completely irrelevant definitions. \n4.\tTo evaluate the efficiency of different GCN approaches, the authors listed the per-epoch training time of methods. The implementation of GCN with different frameworks would result in the large variance of training time. It is better that the authors could include the time and memory complexity of each algorithm. \n5.\tFig 4, after 10 layers, it is not clear whether the linear trend would continue. This result is a bit misleading.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1400/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1400/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AdaGCN: Adaboosting Graph Convolutional Networks into Deep Models", "authorids": ["~Ke_Sun3", "~Zhanxing_Zhu1", "~Zhouchen_Lin1"], "authors": ["Ke Sun", "Zhanxing Zhu", "Zhouchen Lin"], "keywords": ["Graph Neural Networks", "AdaBoost"], "abstract": "The design of deep graph models still remains to be investigated and the crucial part is how to explore and exploit the knowledge from different hops of neighbors in an efficient way.

This method makes it possible to use information from multi-hop neighbours. Computationally, the proposed method is efficient, which is illustrated through various experiments. The paper is well written with good clarity, while the proposed method is novel and significant to the research community. \n\nReasons for recommending acceptance\n- To that of reviewer's knowledge, the proposed scheme is novel. The method address the issue of using information for higher-order neighbours, without increasing the computational complexity. \n- comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets, evaluating AdaGCN in terms of computational efficiency, accuracy, dependency on the number of layers. \n\nQuestions\n- While comparing MixHop against AdaGCN, the authors mention that AdaGCN does have generalization guarantees from Boosting theory. This statement is loose, and a formal justification may be needed. \n- In Figure 4 (Right), where the epoch time is measured against the number of layers, AdaGCN is shown to have nearly constant time w.r.t. layers. Some more explanation would be useful in understanding this. \n\n\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1400/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1400/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AdaGCN: Adaboosting Graph Convolutional Networks into Deep Models", "authorids": ["~Ke_Sun3", "~Zhanxing_Zhu1", "~Zhouchen_Lin1"], "authors": ["Ke Sun", "Zhanxing Zhu", "Zhouchen Lin"], "keywords": ["Graph Neural Networks", "AdaBoost"], "abstract": "The design of deep graph models still remains to be investigated and the crucial part is how to explore and exploit the knowledge from different hops of neighbors in an efficient way.
