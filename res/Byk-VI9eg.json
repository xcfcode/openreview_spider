The authors motivate this from two points of view:\n\n(1) Having multiple discriminators tackle the task is equivalent to optimizing the value function using random restarts, which can potentially help optimization given the nonconvexity of the value function.\n\n(2) Having multiple discriminators can help overcome the optimization problems arising when a discriminator is too harsh a critic. A generator receiving signal from multiple discriminators is less likely to be receiving poor gradient signal from all discriminators.\n\nThe paper's main idea looks straightforward to implement in practice and makes for a good addition to the GAN training toolbelt.\n\nI am not very convinced by the GAM (and by extension the GMAM) evaluation metric. Without evidence that the GAN game is converging (even approximately), it is hard to make the case that the discriminators tell something meaningful about the generators with respect to the data distribution. In particular, it does not inform on mode coverage or probability mass misallocation.\n\nThe learning curves (Figure 3) look more convincing to me: they provide good evidence that increasing the number of discriminators has a stabilizing effect on the learning dynamics. However, it seems like this figure along with Figure 4 also show that the unmodified generator objective is more stable even with only one discriminator. In that case, is it even necessary to have more than one discriminator to train the generator using an unmodified objective?\n\nOverall, I think the ideas presented in this paper show good potential, but I would like to see an extended analysis in the line of Figures 3 and 4 for more datasets before I think it is ready for publication.\n\nUPDATE: The rating has been revised to a 7 following discussion with the authors.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Multi-Adversarial Networks", "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a framework for producing a generative model by way of a two-player minimax game.

We also evaluate the quality of the learned models using Inception scores and illustrative generated images as well as supplementary evidence of the learned model's quality.\n\nWith regards to Figures 12 and 13, no, these plots are not contradictory.

More detailed results for CIFAR and MNIST using the GMAM metric are included in the Appendix to show this. We have also included Inception scores for the CIFAR dataset in the Appendix to show that the GMAM metric compares well with how the score evaluates Generated images.\n\nFigure 3 and Figure 4 plot the dynamics of the different models while learning. With multiple discriminators it is evident that variance in the Generator objective is reduced and the convergence to equilibrium is achieved up to twice as fast.\nFurther, the using the original unmodified objective with a single discriminator leads to saturation early on in the training process with the generator not getting meaningful signals. Using multiple discriminators mitigates this issue as well.\nFigures 10 and 11 in the Appendix plot the same dynamics as Figures 3 and 4 on the CelebA dataset. Here training with the original unmodified objective and a single discriminator was not possible due to the saturation problem, while with multiple discriminators we could use the original objective.\n\nFor more empirical results, we have shall include plots similar to figures 3 and 4 (and 10, 11) for the CIFAR dataset as well.

This comes with a number of benefits, mainly being able to use less powerful discriminators which may provide better training signal to the generator early on in training when strong discriminators might overpower the generator.\n\nMy main comment is about the way the paper is presented. The caption of Figure 1. and Section 3.1 suggests using the best discriminator by taking the maximum over the performance of individual ensemble members. This does not appear to be the best thing to do because we are just bound to get a training signal that is stricter than any of the individual members of the ensemble.

This means that we don't have any optimality guarantees when training against a suboptimal discriminator.  In practice, we never have access to the optimal discriminator, so we must train without these guarantees, however training against a better discriminator should bring us closer to the case where we DO have optimality guarantees.\n\nTraining against a more lenient discriminator focuses on GAN convergence to equilibrium.\n2) GAN Convergence to Equilibrium: As you say, it is difficult to train a generator against a strong discriminator.

The max is over the N players and is taken at each time step.  For example, at time t, each discriminator receives a loss, V_i(t), after assigning probabilities to the samples generated by the generator and those from the real dataset.  Let's say N=3 and the losses are V_1(t),V_2(t),V_3(t) = -2,-1,-3.  We then compute the max: \\max\\{ V_1(t),V_2(t),V_3(t) \\} = \\max\\{ -2,-1,-3 \\} = -1.  This means we backpropagate the loss of discriminator_2 to update the generator weights.\n\nYou can think of the standard GAN as following this same procedure, but computing the max over a single discriminator, which trivially returns the single discriminator: \\max{ V_1(t) \\} = V_1(t).\n\n2. The primes are meant to distinguish between two instantiations of the discriminator and it's associated loss.  We will make this more clear.\n\nThe point we were trying to make is imagine you use a standard single-discriminator GAN with the discriminator and generator initialized with weights w_d and w_g respectively.  Assume we are NOT using dropout, so the training is entirely deterministic.  Let's run training to convergence and record the loss of the discriminator at each time step t.  Call this loss V'_1(t) as in the paper.\n\nNow, let's use GMAN with N discriminators.  Initialize the generator weights to w_g and discriminator_1's weights to w_d just as in the previous experiment.  The N-1 other discriminators can be initialized randomly.  We still are NOT using dropout.  Let's run training to convergence and record the loss of each discriminator at time step t.  Call these losses V_1(t), ..., V_N(t) as in the paper.\n\nThe only difference between these two training runs is that the second run includes N-1 other discriminators.  The point that we are trying to make is that the mere existence of the N-1 discriminators changes the dynamics of the game because of the complex interactions between all the players.  This means that V_1(t) does not equal V'_1(t).  In fact, it's hard to make any claims on how much V_1(t) and V'_1(t) differ, therefore, it's hard to make any claims on how much \\max\\{ V_1(t), ..., V_N(t) \\} and \\max\\{ V'_1(t) \\} = V'_1(t) differ *(the max is over the players, not over time).\n\nThis argument is simply to say that, unfortunately, we CANNOT claim that taking the max over N discriminators returns a strictly higher loss than using a single discriminator.  Maybe this is obvious and we've only confused readers more, but we thought it was an important point to make.\n\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Multi-Adversarial Networks", "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a framework for producing a generative model by way of a two-player minimax game.

The deep model will perfectly classify fake vs. real, and training signals/derivatives would be close to 0.

Moving along the derivative of the linear classifier will roughly try to align the means of real and fake data.\n\nThe point I'm trying to address here is that if you have an ensemble of differently complex discriminators, you may not always want to follow the best one...

We're glad you enjoyed the paper.  We apologize for the delay.  Our machine went down temporarily.  \n\n1) We've added CIFAR-10 GMAM metrics to the appendix (A.1.3 Table 3).  We also added Inception scores for CIFAR-10 (A.1.3 Table 4).  GMAN-0 (which averages discriminator losses) performed best in this case.  GMAN* did not perform as well as it did on MNIST, but self-regulating the difficulty of the game is an interesting avenue for future research.\n\n2) From our understanding, the Inception Score is computed using a deep net resulting from supervised training on ImageNet with class labels.  In that sense, it implicitly requires labels.  It's not clear if the authors of the Inception Score suggest using the same Inception model trained on ImageNet for generating Inception Scores on any possible image dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10); it seems natural to assume an Inception model is trained anew for each new image dataset.  More generally, the Inception Score cannot be used outside of image generation tasks.
