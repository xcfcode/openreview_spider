However, the primary concerns in the evaluation still remain: (1) it seems to focus on comparing against Vanilla-CLN, instead of focusing on the source of the knowledge, or on the efficacy in incorporating it (see earlier work on examples of how to evaluate these), and (2) the results are not considerably better with the proposed work, making the reviewers doubtful about the significance of the proposed work.\n\nThe reviewers agree that the paper is not ready for publication.", "confidence": "4: The area chair is confident but not absolutely certain", "recommendation": "Reject", "title": "Poor results, Evaluating knowledge or method to incorporate it?"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1277/Area_Chair1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1277/Area_Chair1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Human-Guided Column Networks: Augmenting Deep Learning with Advice", "abstract": "While extremely successful in several applications, especially with low-level representations; sparse, noisy samples and structured domains (with multiple objects and interactions) are some of the open challenges in most deep models.

The advice gradient itself is bounded between -1 <= \\nabla <= +1. So exp(\\nabla) is bounded between (0.367, 2.718). However, we do appreciate the reviewer's concern that the effect of the multiplicative gates depend on the original value of the nodes on which the gates are applied. Higher the value of a node more is the effect (if exp(\\nabla)>1).  While theoretically this needs validation, in practice, as our experiments show clearly, the effects are indeed quite stable. There has not been any scenario where K-CLN performs worse than original CLN. For a much longer paper, we will certainly explore the theoretical underpinnings.\n\nIn existing research on human-guided learning, human advice has been shown to be most effective in case of systematic noise. Such noise can be introduced due to 2 primary reasons (1) Noise in observation (data recording) (2) Noise due to lack of representative samples. Challenge 2 is especially crucial in structured data (objects and interactions), since most interactions in the world are false or unobserved. Our experimental question is directed at these 2 primary challenges. We believe our baseline, original CLN, is justified since they have already been proven to be a superior approach for collective classification in structured data. Our objective is to show that CLNs augmented with richer human inputs than mere labels in noisy sparse samples in structured domains can exhibit superior performance to only label-based learning. We will provide more examples of advice rules used in the experiments in the final version if accepted. Quality of advice is a concern in any human-in-the-loop system. However, reasonably good advice helps alleviate the challenges due to noise and sparsity. \n\nWe will shorten the data description. Our objective was to highlight the level of complexity of the different tasks and the impact of sparsity (in context of the dimensionality of the data). The only figures in our work are the original CLN framework and its modifications due to K-CLN. Rest are plots of 2 different types of experiments w.r.t. each data set/domain. While it is possible to condense all data sets into one set of plots, that will immensely hamper the clarity of the presented results. Hence all plots are kept distinct and separate. It will be great if you could guide us to the figures that you deem unnecessary."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1277/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1277/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1277/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Human-Guided Column Networks: Augmenting Deep Learning with Advice", "abstract": "While extremely successful in several applications, especially with low-level representations; sparse, noisy samples and structured domains (with multiple objects and interactions) are some of the open challenges in most deep models.

However, I have some concerns:\n\nCorrectness\n==========\nIn the main modification to the CLN in Eq (3), the rule-based gates are introduced to every hidden layer. However, the functional gradient with respect to the \"advise gradient\" is only computed for the last layer (at the end of Section 3). The exponential gates may cause some instability issue due to its unboundedness. \n\nEvaluation\n=========\nThe  questions  in  experiment  (Can  K-CLNs  learn  efficiently/effectively  with  noisy  sparse  samples?)  do  not  support  the  problem  statement  about  human  advice  incorporation.  Thus,  all  they  did  in  the  experiment  is  trying  to  compete  against  CLN.\n\nI would believe that the improvement (which I trust is real) depends critically on the quality and quantity of the human-crafted rules, much in the same way that feature engineering plays the major roles in the classical structured output prediction. Hence more details about the rules set used in experiments should be given.\n\nPresentation\n===========\nIn  the  experiment  part,  the  authors  need  to  describe  their  model  configuration.

Their main idea is to introduce human knowledge to guide the previous column network for robust training.\n\nPros:\n\n1. The authors find a fresh direction for learning with noisy samples. The human advice can be viewed as previledged information.\n\n2. The authors perform numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of their framework. And their experimental result support their previous claims.\n\nCons:\n\nWe have three questions in the following.\n\n1. Motivation: The authors are encouraged to re-write their paper with more motivated storyline. The current version is okay but not very exciting for idea selling. For example, human guidance should be your selling point, and you may not restrict your general method into ColumnNet, which will limit the practical usage.\n\n2. Related works: In deep learning with noisy labels, there are three main directions, including small-loss trick [1], estimating noise transition matrix [2,3], and explicit and implicit regularization [4]. I would appreciate if the authors can survey and compare more baselines in their paper instead of listing some basic ones.\n\n3. Experiment: \n3.1 Baselines: For noisy labels, the authors should add MentorNet [1] as a baseline https://github.com/google/mentornet From my own experience, this baseline is very strong.\n3.2 Datasets: For datasets, I think the author should first compare their methods on symmetric and aysmmetric noisy data. Besides, the authors are encouraged to conduct 1 NLP dataset.\n\nBy the way, if your human guidance is totally wrong, how your model handle such extreme cases? Could you please discuss this important point in your paper?\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] L. Jiang, Z. Zhou, T. Leung, L. Li, and L. Fei-Fei.
