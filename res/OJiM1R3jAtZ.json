Three reviewers suggested (borderline) acceptance and two did rejection. The main concerns of reviewers are (a) limited/incremental novelty (from all reviewers) and (b) limited experiments (from three reviewers). AC also agrees that the authors' response for novelty beyond the prior works, e.g., AWR (and CRR), is not convincing enough (although their goals/settings are different). AC also thinks that more discussion, analysis and results when offline datasets are poor (e.g., far from experts) are necessary to meet the high standard of ICLR (the authors provided some, but AC thinks it is not convincing enough). Hence, AC recommend rejection.

The performance of BEAR [1] is attached as reference. We attempted to fine-tune BEAR online using the same protocol as AWAC but the performance did not improve and often decreased; thus we report the offline performance. All performances are scaled 0-100, where 0 is a random policy and 100 is an expert policy, as is standard for D4RL.\n\nThe results are presented in Figure 8. First, we observe that AWAC offline is competitive with BEAR offline. Then, AWAC is able to make progress in solving the tasks with online fine-tuning, even when initialized from random data or \u201cmedium\u201d quality data. We found that AWAC is in fact able to improve online in almost every setting. When starting with lower quality data, there is more room for online improvement so the gap between BEAR is higher. But AWAC is also able to take advantage of higher quality datasets to start at a higher initial performance.\n\nPlease let us know if there are any other concerns we can help address.\n\n[1] Stabilizing Off-Policy Q-Learning via Bootstrapping Error Reduction.

See this link (https://imgur.com/a/t8zcMZf) for results on the six environments. CQL performs well offline, comparable to our method, but does not fine-tune well online on five of the six tasks. As CQL is designed for offline RL, this is not too surprising. Additionally note that the contributions of CQL and AWAC are somewhat orthogonal, in that the min-Q loss in CQL could be added for value estimation in AWAC.

Empirically, ours is the only method in our experiments that demonstrates this capability. For instance, see how SAC with BC pretraining has a characteristic dip in easier problems (Figure 2 plot 2) and fails to learn in harder problems (Figure 3) because the initialization from pre-training does not persist through fine-tuning. For effective and efficient online RL from prior data, we need a method that achieves decent offline performance and preserves that performance through online exploration, so that exploration data during the online phase is also meaningful.\n\nWhat allows AWAC to actually fine-tune online while retaining offline pre-training performance is not just the particular form of the constraint -- other algorithms such as BRAC (Wu et al 2019) also use the KL constraint -- but the way we enforce this constraint implicitly. This allows us to actually perform the update without any explicit behavior modeling, which as we discuss in Section 3.3 is the main reason for prior offline RL methods being too conservative for online finetuning. In summary AWAC is able to combine the best of both worlds - good offline pretraining like BRAC (Wu et al), BEAR (Kumar et al) which is much better than standard off-policy RL algorithms like SAC (Haarnoja et al), and good online finetuning like SAC, performing much better than the offline RL algorithms like BRAC (Wu et al), BEAR (Kumar et al), which are too conservative due to imperfect behavior modeling. \n\n> Writing suggestions\n\nThank you for these suggestions.

Specific concerns are addressed below.\n\n> differences with AWR\n\nThe key difference between AWAC and AWR is the value estimation: in AWAC, we use a fully off-policy estimate of A^pi, while AWR estimates A^beta through generalized advantage estimation. While this may seem like a somewhat minor modification, do observe in the experiments that AWAC is significantly more sample efficient than AWR in all tasks. Additionally, we study the fine-tuning scenario which AWAC is especially designed for.\n\n> Critic regularized regression (CRR)\n\nThe CRR paper itself states that our work is concurrent: \u201cConcurrently to our work, [25] proposed Advantage Weighted Actor Critic (AWAC) for accelerating online RL with offline datasets. Their formulation is equivalent to CRR with exponential filtering.\u201d  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15134. The eventual algorithm is very similar, but the derivations are different and we additionally study the fine-tuning scenario beyond offline RL, and provide a systematic set of controlled experiments to understand the challenges. \n\n> Experiments don't make a case for this method\n\nWe believe our results are actually very strong. As you point out, our method is the only one that can solve relocate-binary-v0, which is a very difficult task involving 30 action dimensions and sparse rewards. It is additionally the single best performing method for door-binary-v0 with a final success rate of 95%, with the next best performing method ABM hovering around 50% success rate. In pen-binary-v0, ABM is slightly worse and all other methods are much worse. And while other methods perform comparably to AWAC at some tasks of the easier MuJoCo benchmark tasks, none consistently perform best like AWAC does.\n\n> Can AWAC handle arbitrary off-policy data?\n\nThe parameter beta allows deviation from the behavior policy, so AWAC may improve significantly beyond the behavior policy. In addition, we have an experiment (Figure 4) where AWAC is shown to learn a policy with the behavior policy being a uniform random policy.\n\n> experiments with D4RL [5] dataset\n\nThank you for this suggestion, we are now conducting additional experiments with varying data quality in D4RL and we will update the paper with those shortly.\n\n> Bibtex issues\n\nThank you for pointing out these issues, they have now been resolved and the paper updated."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2748/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2748/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AWAC: Accelerating Online Reinforcement Learning with Offline Datasets", "authorids": ["~Ashvin_Nair1", "~Murtaza_Dalal1", "~Abhishek_Gupta1", "~Sergey_Levine1"], "authors": ["Ashvin Nair", "Murtaza Dalal", "Abhishek Gupta", "Sergey Levine"], "keywords": ["reinforcement learning"], "abstract": "Reinforcement learning provides an appealing formalism for learning control policies from experience.

We will reply to the common issue raised about novelty beyond prior work in this thread and then reviewer-specific comments in their own thread.\n\n> Novelty beyond prior work\n\nIt is indeed true that prior works have proposed similar algorithms. But we highlight two important contributions of our paper that are unique. First, we study the setting of online fine-tuning after offline pre-training in detail, identifying three key issues that plague prior algorithms in this setting, preventing these algorithms from actually solving the problem. Second, we empirically show that designing an algorithm without these issues results in an algorithm that can in fact take advantage of prior data and then quickly fine-tune with a small amount of online interaction. In comparison, the closest algorithm to AWAC, advantage weighted regression (AWR) mentioned by reviewers 1, 2 and 5, performs very poorly in this setting due to the difference in value function learning. AWR estimates the Q-value of the behavior policy, using generalized advantage estimation, while AWAC estimates Q^pi of the current policy using fully off-policy bootstrapping. This difference allows AWAC to learn a better policy in the offline phase, and then be more sample efficient in the online phase. As seen from our empirical results, this makes a huge difference in algorithm performance. For instance, in Figure 3, AWR obtains a final performance of 53%, 0% and 0% on the dexterous manipulation tasks of pen, door and relocate respectively while AWAC obtains a final performance of 97%, 95%, and 55%. The value estimation results in the difference between making no progress on the two harder dexterous manipulation tasks and being able to solve them convincingly.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2748/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2748/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AWAC: Accelerating Online Reinforcement Learning with Offline Datasets", "authorids": ["~Ashvin_Nair1", "~Murtaza_Dalal1", "~Abhishek_Gupta1", "~Sergey_Levine1"], "authors": ["Ashvin Nair", "Murtaza Dalal", "Abhishek Gupta", "Sergey Levine"], "keywords": ["reinforcement learning"], "abstract": "Reinforcement learning provides an appealing formalism for learning control policies from experience.

Hence, I vote for accepting, given the following concerns are addressed in the rebuttal period.\n\nPros:\n- Interesting adaption of algorithms to effectively use the offline data in online RL scenarios which is independent from the sampling policy\n- Ensuring the policy to stay close to the observed data without directly estimating the sampling policy\n- Nicely motivated with helpful examples\n- Clarifies differences with the related work\n\nComments:\n- The presentation of the paper could be improved. There are some inconsistencies in the text. At the beginning the approach is introduced to be based on dynamic programming and then turns into temporal difference learning, which is misleading. In addition, offline pre-training and online fine-tuning is not quite accurate as the algorithm 1 is using the mix of data in one phase which does not involve pre-training, or is it actually in two phases?\n\n- The paper seems to be an incremental improvement/combination of several recent works mentioned in the paper.\n\n- The experiments are all on simulated environments. It would be interesting to see how the approach performs on real-world applications, and with some other evaluation metric than convergence rate. \n\n- Demonstration data is not always as complete as mentioned in the paper. Expert demonstrations that are used for imitation learning, normally lack the reward values and in the form of (s,a) pairs only. \n\n\nMinor:\n-Typo in section 3.2: is policy is pre-trained\n- Plot 4 in Fig. 2 not addressed in section 3.3", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2748/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2748/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AWAC: Accelerating Online Reinforcement Learning with Offline Datasets", "authorids": ["~Ashvin_Nair1", "~Murtaza_Dalal1", "~Abhishek_Gupta1", "~Sergey_Levine1"], "authors": ["Ashvin Nair", "Murtaza Dalal", "Abhishek Gupta", "Sergey Levine"], "keywords": ["reinforcement learning"], "abstract": "Reinforcement learning provides an appealing formalism for learning control policies from experience.

To achieve this goal, they propose an algorithm called advantage weighted actor-critic (AWAC), which uses an implicit constraint to reduce accumulated bootstrapping error when doing off-line training and reduce the conservation when doing on-line fine-tuning. The experiments show that the proposed method can learn difficult, high-dimensional, sparse reward dexterous manipulation problems from human demonstrations and off-policy data.\n\nPros:\n1. The organization is clear and related work is sufficient. This paper introduces the off-line training and on-line fine-tuning problem and its challenge by gradually summarize the existing studies, and with sufficient investigation of existing work, it is easy for readers to dive into the problem\n2. The proposed method is easy to implement. Thanks to the implicit formulation of the constraint, the proposed AWAC algorithm can sample directly from off-line datasets without fitting a parametric model. This strategy is especially advantageous when the dimensionality is high. Besides, since this algorithm does not need the parametric model any more, it is more friendly for users who are not familiar with the off-line dataset.\n3. The details of experimental settings are provided, and thus there should be no issues with the repeatability of the experiments.\u00a0\n\nCons:\n1. It is doubtful for the contribution on online fine-tuning. The constraint is designed for off-line training because off-line training has the problem of bootstrapping error accumulation. There is no judgment or proof that online training also suffers from the bootstrapping problem. How can the authors claim their contribution on on-line learning with the constraint?\n2. The technical depth is not high. It seems the only contribution of this paper is to combine the constraint with an unparameterized strategy. But I would like to say that this is not a big problem, as many influential reinforcement learning algorithms are straightforward but have very significant improvement, e.g., DDQN and PPO.\n3.

To address this problem, they propose to constraint policy updates with respect to behavioral policy. Their proposed method is built mainly on the top of AWR [1]. \n\n- There is a significant similarity between the proposed method and AWR [1]. The main difference that I can see is AWR doesn't have a fine-tuning step but this paper does. Can authors list their differences with AWR? \n\n- CRR [3] is very similar to the proposed method in this paper as well, what are the differences? ( I disagree with the authors that CRR is a concurrent work with this paper)\n\n-  This paper claims that AWAC can utilize various types of prior data without any changes to their method and it is agnostic to the type of behavioral policy (e.g. random vs. expert). I don't see how this is the case. For example, if data were collected by a random policy, this method constrains the current policy to be a uniform one.\n\n- Experiments don't make a case for this method, i.e. AWAC is only better than others in relocate-binary-v0 and barely better in Walker2d-v2.  ABM almost gets the same performance.\n\n- Fine-Tuning with random policy data is not convincing either. I'd suggest running some experiments with D4RL [5] dataset like *-medium-expert, *-medium-replay, and *-random to build a better case for your proposed method.\n\n- One reason that existing RL methods can't fully utilize previously collected data with online updates is the distribution shift between the policy (a.k.a behavioral policy) that collected the data and the learned policy [2, 3]. Can the authors comment on this and discuss how the proposed method addresses the distribution shift problem that likely the root cause of this problem? A section in the paper about this will help to improve this paper.  \n \n- Related work section needs significant improvement. It only lists various papers without any useful discussion.  \n\nEven though I found this paper interesting, I'm still not convinced about the contribution of this paper. Given similarity and overlap with previous works [1,3], more experiments could be helpful to see how this method is better than others and why one should select this method vs. others.\n\nMinor comments:\n\nIt seems there are various problems with your bibtex, for example, \"Behavior Regularized Offline Reinforcement Learning\" wasn't published in iclr and author names are mixed with other information like in  \"A Generalized Path Integral Control Approach to Reinforcement Learning\" \"usc\" in author names and \"Web Services\" appeared with author names \"P3O: Policy-on Policy-off Policy Optimization.\"  \n\n[1] Xue Bin Peng, Aviral Kumar, Grace Zhang, and Sergey Levine.

However, the classic active formulation of reinforcement learning necessitates a lengthy active exploration process for each behavior, making it difficult to apply in real-world settings. If we can instead allow reinforcement learning to effectively use previously collected data to aid the online learning process, where the data could be expert demonstrations or more generally any prior experience, we could make reinforcement learning a substantially more practical tool. While a number of recent methods have sought to learn offline from previously collected data, it remains exceptionally difficult to train a policy with offline data and improve it further with online reinforcement learning. In this paper we systematically analyze why this problem is so challenging, and propose an algorithm that combines sample-efficient dynamic programming with maximum likelihood policy updates, providing a simple and effective framework that is able to leverage large amounts of offline data and then quickly perform online fine-tuning of reinforcement learning policies.
