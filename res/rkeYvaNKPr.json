[..]\n> In the considered class of problems, \\phi is an unknown feature function that can be used to construct an equivalent MDP. For any injective feature function we have a candidate \u201cideal\u201d trajectory representation function \\phi o T : \\Gamma \\rightarrow Re^d.\nOn the other hand, f_\\theta is an approximation of such functions. \nWe revisited them in the new version. \\phi now always denote trajectory representations. f_\\theta is only used for the approximation. We define a classifier C: Re^d \\rightarrow H to have a coherent formulation.\n\n2- \"Using RL techniques,[..] is optimal for N\". This passage is not fully clear [..]\n> We realise that our wording might have been misleading in this sense. \\hat(M) does not introduce an approximation of the equivalent MDP. The reason we introduce \\phi is that most RL techniques use features. We wanted our approach to be adaptable to all down-stream RL algorithm and thus provided of a feature based equivalent MDP template for our approximation. We modified section 3.1 to provide a simpler, and less constraining formulation of such equivalent MDPs.\n\n3- The assumption that similar trajectories can be identified is somehow strong. It would be good to have a more thorough support for it. \n> We provide multiple examples in the introduction that support this hypothesis, namely the waiter problem. The rating of a client can be used as a weak supervision to construct the similarity batches.\nFurthermore, in the Salzburg city data set, we do not possess a signal that identifies the tasks. However we were able to construct a batch of similar behaviors based on the place where the tourists went. \n> We also want to highlight, that our method, requires a weaker assumption that standard techniques in expanding NMRDPs into MDPs. In other words, all previous works that tackle the expansion problem require stronger assumptions.  \n\n4- It is not fully clear what L_BH^local is indeed a local loss. It seems like you are simply using the mapping from the whole trajectory. Is this why it is called local? \n> the loss is denoted as \u201clocal\u201d because we are only propagating the gradient to the current time step, more or less as if the previous representation is correct. By alternating the minimization of this loss and the re-evaluation of the representations, we can optimize the initial loss. We reworked section 4.2 to make the proposed algorithm clearer.\n\n5- While I appreciate that the introduction is sketching many different scenarios [..] I suggest you rather pick one single scenario with a good level of detail to provide a more solid support to the paper. \n> The reviewer's question #3 is what motivated us to provide multiple examples. We understand that our work does not follow the usual frameworks of NMRDP expansion and wanted to provide multiple scenarios where this approach is applicable.\n\n** Minor comments \n1- You often use \"he\" to refer to the agent. It would be better to use \"it\" or \"she\".\n>Thanks for noting it, we will change them."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper603/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper603/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Trajectory representation learning for Multi-Task NMRDPs planning", "authors": ["Firas JARBOUI", "Vianney PERCHET", "Roman EGGER"], "authorids": ["firasjarboui@gmail.com", "vianney.perchet@gmail.com", "roman.egger@fh-salzburg.ac.at"], "keywords": ["Representation Learning", "State Estimation", "Non Markovian Decision Process"], "TL;DR": "Expanding NMRDPs into MDPs using trajectory representation learning", "abstract": "Expanding Non Markovian Reward Decision Processes (NMRDP) into Markov Decision Processes (MDP) enables the use of state of the art Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to identify optimal policies.

However they satisfy the markovian property by including the task nature in the state space (for example if the task is to teach an agent to go to multiple grid cells, the state he would use contains the current position and the target position). \nEven though they do not explicitly say that the reward is indeed task-dependent,  successfully using the bellman equation to solve this kind of settings implies that the reward is markovian with respect to the chosen state, and thus with respect to the task.\nWe precise in the introduction of the new version that we can exploit recent work in those fields to learn optimal policies once the trajectory representation function is learned.\n\n2- At training time, the PK data set is somehow supervised, [..] the most interesting uses of the learned representation.\n\n>Our approach is indeed not fully unsupervised, but \u201cweakly\u201d supervised. However providing a PK dataset does not require knowing the T function. As illustrated in the examples given in the introduction, there are many cases where the construction of these batches is possible without accessing the T function (e.g. in the waiter example, trajectory similarity can be induced from a similarity in ratings provided it\u2019s the same client). In the experimental setting, we do not know the function that maps trajectories to tasks, however we can identify trajectories that headed to the same destination. \n> Although the obtained representation function could be used to reverse engineer the T function, this is not necessary in our context as the overarching objective is to identify an equivalent MDP to the considered NMRDP.\n\n3- If the task function T is known, [..] No evaluation is available in this sense. \n\n> It is true that in synthetic scenarios, the actual T function is available. In such experimental setting, as the one we propose in section 5.1 (the grid-world NMRDP), we can provide the comparison proposed by the reviewer. This will indeed confirm to what extent the obtained representations are useful to approximate an equivalent MDP.

In the new version of the paper, we precise when the equation hold for any horizon T to ease the distinction. We alleviated some of the notations as mentioned, re-formulated Section 4 and provided a constructive proof of how (6) implies (7).\n\n- Lack of baselines: [...] compare the different trajectory representations.\n\n> Given that our work is a first attempt in \u201cneutralizing\u201d the problem of expanding NMRDPs into MDPs, and given that we are also the first attempt to solve the problem in a weakly supervised framework, comparing our work to alternative/off-the-shelf baselines can not be done in an experiment that would be \u201cfair\u201d towards competitors which are not designed for the same objectives.\nWe also believe that experimentally trying multiple sequence embedding models (and quantifying their performances) is beyond the scope of this paper \u2013 actually, we tried several of them before choosing the final one. It is clear that different embeddings would also work, with certainly similar properties (maybe slightly better, probably slightly worse). But the scope of the paper was to justify the overall method, rather than fine tuning and optimizing it (and we are fairly confident that the \u201cbest\u201d embedding actually depends on the problem at hand) (note that this is actually ongoing work)\nHowever we agree that providing quantitative performance of the model is an interesting contribution to the paper. In the revised and uploaded version, we provide a comparison between:\na- an agent using DQN where the input contain the learned representations \nb- an agent using DQN but only access state features.\nc- agents using RDQN accessing state features with and without a history of the rewards\nThe used environment and the learned representations are those presented in section 5.1.\nThe agent using a trajectory representation outperforms all 3 other agents.\n\n- Unclear generalization to more complex problems: [..] a point the paper does not address.\n\n> \\phi is a feature function introduced to construct an equivalent MDP using the latent tasks. \n\\phi is a function from H to R^d, T is a function from \\Gamma to H. \\phi being injective does not imply that \\phi \\circ T is injective. And thus we do not require to hash all trajectories into different features. \n\\phi\u2019s injectifity (between H and R^d) ensure the equivalence between \\tilde\\mathcal{M} and \\mathcal{M}^* and by transition \\mathcal{N}. \n> Morally, in our approach we approximate the injectifity property of \\phi with the separability of trajectory representations with respect to tasks (i.e. eq (6)). \nHowever it\u2019s true that this remain a strong assumption. In the new version, we modify section 3.1, to provide a more relaxed condition of \\phi. We define \\phi now as a function from trajectories to R^d, and only require the existence of a classifier C such that C o \\phi = T.\nWe also precise in the new version that f_\\theta can be used either to compute the tasks or to aproximate \\hat{\\mathcal{M}} by substituting \\phi with f_\\theta. \n> We agree that the curse of dimensionality is one of the main issues in trajectory representation. We consider that treating this problem is beyond the scope of this paper as our proposition to use trajectory representation learning to expand NMRDPs into MDPs can eventually include breakthroughs that solve trajectory representation in the high dimension case. However we argue that not all real life examples are high dimensional and our approach can be used as is.\n\nPositives: \nThe method is overall well principled and the theoretical justification of the triplet loss is interesting. The dataset used for experiments is also interesting. \n\n> We thank you for your appreciation. We highlight that the dataset used in the experiment encouraged us to pursue the IRL problem in NMRDPs using the same principles introduced in this paper.\n\nMinor/Questions: \n- Bottom of page 4 [..] which is only stated afterwards?\n> Eq (5) introduces a system that need to be solved to find \\mathcal{M}^*. given an injective function \\phi, we can construct a solution. We are providing a particular solution to the problem and we did not solve for all possible expansion of the NMRDP.\nSection 3.1 is modified as explained, however the reasoning is the same, the required condition is sufficient but not required to solve Eq (5), this is why we state it afterwards.\n\n- Calling the algorithm 'EM' is a bit of a stretch [ .. ]  why not use regular backpropagation through time to train though the entire sequence?\n> We agree that TBPTT is a more suitable framework to describe our approach. However we constructed it in a similar fashion to EM. We changed the way we introduced this in the new version of the paper. \nWhat lead us to such choice is the empirical stability and speed of the proposed approach.

In general, in NMRDP the dynamics is Markovian but the reward function may depend on the entire trajectory. The authors consider a sub-case where the trajectory can be mapped to a specific \"task\" and the reward function can be formalized as a mapping between the state-task pair to the reward. This greatly simplifies the problem that can be mapped onto an augmented MDP and solved using standard RL tools. The authors focus on the representation learning problem of the mapping between trajectories to an embedding of the task itself. In particular, they consider contrastive learning to find a representation that discriminate between trajectories associated to the same task and trajectories coming from different tasks. The resulting LSTM-based architecture is then evaluated on a grid-world synthetic problem and on GPS trajectories from tourists in the city of Salzburg.\n\n** Overall evaluation\nMy main concerns about the paper is that the exact objective of the setting and the representation learning is not that clear and the empirical validation is limited to a qualitative assessment of the representation learning with no down-stream task. More in detail.\n\n1- The assumption of task-dependent reward functions is very sensible. Yet I wonder to which extent it overlaps with literature in multi-task and meta-learning, or more in general with embedding of time-series (the trajectory in your case). It would be useful to frame/compare at the conceptual level the similarities and differences of the proposed setting with those fields.\n2- At training time, the PK dataset is somehow supervised, as it is possible to know which trajectories are associated to the same task. At test time, the learned f_theta recursively maps trajectories to tasks. As such, it seems like it could effectively detect changes into the task itself by tracking how the trajectory evolves (when the task function is unknown). This aspect is never really evaluated in the empirical section, but it would be one of the most interesting uses of the learned representation.\n3- If the task function T is known, it means that standard RL techniques can be used to solve MDP N. The actual advantage of using a specific function to embed the task to a space in Re^d is never really explained in the paper. Does it make solving N simpler or more effective than using a simple encoding for the task? No evaluation is available in this sense.\n4- The empirical evaluation is limited to qualitative analysis of the representation learned in the problem. Yet, there is no clear support that the representation is good/useful in a more quantitative way (e.g., by actually solving the RL part or in identifying quickly the current task).\n\nSome more specific questions/comments\n\n1- Some of the notation is a bit redundant. For instance, phi is mapping from H to Re^d, while f is a mapping from trajectories to Re^d, but in the end they are doing the same thing, as H itself can be obtained as a mapping from trajectories to tasks through T. \n2- \"Using RL techniques, finding an optimal policy pi* in the equivalent MDP \\hat M is possible and by extension pi* is optimal for N\". This passage is not fully clear, if phi is introducing some form of approximation, then pi* may no longer be optimal for the original MDP N. On the other hand, if phi is not approximating but \"just\" changing the representation from H to Re^d, then it is not clear what is the interest of it.\n3- The assumption that similar trajectories can be identified is somehow strong. It would be good to have a more thorough support for it.\n4- It is not fully clear what L_BH^local is indeed a local loss. It seems like you are simply using the mapping from the whole trajectory. Is this why it is called local?\n5- While I appreciate that the introduction is sketching many different scenarios to support the models studied in the paper, in the end they mostly lack of depth and they rather give a confusing impression instead of clarifying in a compelling way what is the problem studied in the paper. I suggest you rather pick one single scenario with a good level of detail to provide a more solid support to the paper.\n\n** Minor comments\n1- You often use \"he\" to refer to the agent. It would be better to use \"it\" or \"she\"."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper603/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper603/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Trajectory representation learning for Multi-Task NMRDPs planning", "authors": ["Firas JARBOUI", "Vianney PERCHET", "Roman EGGER"], "authorids": ["firasjarboui@gmail.com", "vianney.perchet@gmail.com", "roman.egger@fh-salzburg.ac.at"], "keywords": ["Representation Learning", "State Estimation", "Non Markovian Decision Process"], "TL;DR": "Expanding NMRDPs into MDPs using trajectory representation learning", "abstract": "Expanding Non Markovian Reward Decision Processes (NMRDP) into Markov Decision Processes (MDP) enables the use of state of the art Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to identify optimal policies.

The authors suggest learning a trajectory embedding by using a triplet loss, justified by a sufficient condition for learning an embedding which corresponds to the true task id.  \n\nOverall I felt the paper fell a bit short of the standards for ICLR, based on subpar writing, lack of comparison to convincing baselines, and unclear applicability to more complex environments.\n\nMain issues:\n- The methodological sections of the paper seems conceptually accessible while being written in an overly mathematical, meandering fashion, using heavy, sometimes unclear notation, or referring to notation from other papers.\n\nAs an example, \\mathcal{M}^* is first introduced by reference to another paper (the notation does not really need to be introduced until the mapping is made precise later in the paper); \\phi(\\theta)_i^j(-1) is an unnecessarily heavy, unpleasant notation for the concept used. \nIt was unclear if T is meant to represent the total trajectory length or a time index of a given trajectory (the notation would imply the former, the way it used, the latter).  Similarly equation (6) is a very mathematical way to denote a relatively simple condition (which could be written more simply by comparing inf and sup distances between two trajectory embeddings corresponding to different or identical latent h). Again, equation (7) seems like a contrived way to write a relatively simple concept, and the simple proof that (6) implies (7) is not included.\nI feel this section could be improved by using precise but as simple notation as possible, and a sequence of propositions explaining why the triplet loss allows for identifiability of the reward process, with a clear flow between statements.\n\n- Lack of baselines:\nNo alternative or baseline seems considered in the paper. The setting is perhaps a bit unusual, but since the data considered is essentially sequence of observations, any model of sequences could be used to produce embeddings (for instance, recurrent VAE, autoregressive models, time-contrastive methods) and compare the different trajectory representations.\n\n- Unclear generalization to more complex problems:\n(6) only implies (7) as far as I can tell, is sufficient but not necessary, and may be too strong of a condition to enforce; similary, theoretically requiring injectivity of phi seems practically too strong of a condition, as it essentially requires hashing each trajectory into a different embedding, in spite of the fact that many aspects of observations may be irrelevant for the task at hand). A key difficulty to scale this algorithm will be to find how to distance between trajectories in high dimension - perhaps the most important question for representation learning of trajectories, and a point the paper does not address.\n\n\nPositives:\nThe method is overall well principled and the theoretical justification of the triplet loss is interesting. The dataset used for experiments is also interesting.\n\nMinor/Questions:\n- IIUC, the equation (3) needs to hold for all times T, this needs to be clearly stated as often T is used to denote total episode length.\n- Bottom of page 4, 'The construction of the task ... \\phi_T=\\phi(\\mathcal T(o_T, \\phi_{T-1}); does this not require injectivity of \\phi, which is only stated afterwards?\n- Calling the algorithm 'EM' is a bit of a stretch (there are no latent variables), it is better to call it a form of coordinate ascent.\n- The way the EM-like algorithm is set up, it appears the gradient with respect to theta is only computed with respect to a single time step (similar to elman networks style truncated backprop) - why not use regular backpropagation through time to train though the entire sequence?\n- typo on section 5.1: 'Grid-world problem'\n- It is very hard to see on figure 3 what we are supposed to see (I don't see these as having the same destination, perhaps highlight more clearly?)\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper603/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper603/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Trajectory representation learning for Multi-Task NMRDPs planning", "authors": ["Firas JARBOUI", "Vianney PERCHET", "Roman EGGER"], "authorids": ["firasjarboui@gmail.com", "vianney.perchet@gmail.com", "roman.egger@fh-salzburg.ac.at"], "keywords": ["Representation Learning", "State Estimation", "Non Markovian Decision Process"], "TL;DR": "Expanding NMRDPs into MDPs using trajectory representation learning", "abstract": "Expanding Non Markovian Reward Decision Processes (NMRDP) into Markov Decision Processes (MDP) enables the use of state of the art Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to identify optimal policies.
