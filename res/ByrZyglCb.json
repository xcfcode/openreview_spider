The core contribution of the paper is the illustration that: under the assumption of flat, or curved decision boundaries with positive curvature small universal adversarial perturbations exist.  \n\nPros: the intuition and geometry is rather clearly presented.  \n\nCons: \nReferences to \"CaffeNet\"  and \"LeNet\" (even though the latter is well-known) are missing.  In the experimental section used to validate the main hypothesis that the deep networks have positive curvature decision boundaries, there is no description of how these networks were trained. \n\nIt is not clear why the authors have decided to use out-dated 5-layer \"LeNet\"  and NiN (Network in network) architectures instead of more recent and much better performing architectures (and less complex than NiN architectures). It would be nice to see how the behavior and boundaries look in these cases.  \n\nThe conclusion is speculative:\n\"Our analysis hence shows that to construct classifiers that are robust to universal perturbations, it\nis key to suppress this subspace of shared positive directions, which can possibly be done through\nregularization of the objective function. This will be the subject of future works.\" \n\nIt is clear that regularization should play a significant role in shaping the decision boundaries. Unfortunately, the paper does not provide details at the basic level, which algorithms,  architectures, hyper-parameters or regularization terms are used. All these factors should play a very significant role in the experimental validation of their hypothesis.\n\nNotes: I did not check the proofs of the theorems in detail. \n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Robustness of Classifiers to Universal Perturbations: A Geometric Perspective", "abstract": "Deep networks have recently been shown to be vulnerable to universal perturbations: there exist very small image-agnostic perturbations that cause most natural images to be misclassified by such classifiers.

The paper develops two models for the decision boundary:\n\n(a) A locally flat model in which the decision boundary is modeled with a hyperplane and the normals two the hyperplanes are assumed to lie near a low-dimensional linear subspace.\n\n(b) A locally positively curved model, in which there is a positively curved outer bound for the collection of points which are assigned a given label. \n\nThe paper works out a probabilistic analysis arguing that when either of these conditions obtains, there exists a fooling perturbation which affects most of the data. \n\nThe theoretical analysis in the paper is straightforward, in some sense following from the definition. The contribution of the paper is to posit these two conditions which can predict the existence of universal fooling perturbations, argue experimentally that they occur in (some) neural networks of practical interest. \n\nOne challenge in assessing the experimental claims is that practical neural networks are nonsmooth; the quadratic model developed from the hessian is only valid very locally. This can be seen in some of the illustrative examples in Figure 5: there *is* a coarse-scale positive curvature, but this would not necessarily come through in a quadratic model fit using the hessian. The best experimental evidence for the authors\u2019 perspective seems to be the fact that random perturbations from S_c misclassify more points than random perturbations constructed with the previous method. \n\nI find the topic of universal perturbations interesting, because it potentially tells us something structural (class-independent) about the decision boundaries constructed by artificial neural networks. To my knowledge, the explanation of universal perturbations in terms of positive curvature is novel. The paper would be much stronger if it provided an explanation of *why* there exists this common subspace of universal fooling perturbations, or even what it means geometrically that positive curvature obtains at every data point. \n\nVisually, these perturbations seem to have strong, oriented local high-frequency content \u2014 perhaps they cause very large responses in specific filters in the lower layers of a network, and conventional architectures are not robust to this? \n\nIt would also be nice to see some visual representations of images perturbed with the new perturbations, to confirm that they remain visually similar to the original images. \n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Robustness of Classifiers to Universal Perturbations: A Geometric Perspective", "abstract": "Deep networks have recently been shown to be vulnerable to universal perturbations: there exist very small image-agnostic perturbations that cause most natural images to be misclassified by such classifiers.

Please see clarifications below.\n\n1. Universal perturbations are static images that can be used by adversaries to fool a classifier (no need to run an optimization procedure to fool each new image); classifiers hence need to be robust to this excessively simple perturbation model. Adversarial perturbations are image-specific and do not generalize well across different images.\nThe existence of universal perturbations is also informative for the geometry of the classification boundaries, which is one step towards better understanding the fundamental properties of deep networks.\n\n2. The goal of the paper is not (yet) to improve the design of classifiers, but to gain insight through their analysis. It is beyond the scope of a single paper to prescribe procedures to improve robustness by modifying the curvature of classification regions.\nNevertheless, we should mention that our analysis (in particular, the fact that universal perturbations are random vectors in subspace S_c) has already been used by others to provide a constructive procedure to combat universal perturbations [Anonymous, 2017]*.

In the experiments, we have looked at coarse scale second-order information through a finite difference of gradients.
