Experimental results show improvements compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm.\n\nReview:\n(1) Pros\nThe proposed optimization method considers the dynamic self-adjustment of the learning rate in the optimization based on the ratio between the L2-norm of parameters and that of gradients on parameters  when the batch size increases, and shows improvements in experiments compared with previous methods.\n\n(2) Cons\ni) LR \"warm-up\" can mitigate the unstable training in the initial phase and the proposed method is also motivated by the stability but uses a different approach. However, it seems that the authors also combine with LR \"warm-up\" in your proposed method in the experimental part, e.g., Table 3. So does it mean that the proposed method cannot handle the problem in general?\n\nii) There is one coefficient that is independent from layers and needs to be set manually in the proposed local learning rate. The authors do not have a detail explanation and experiments about it. In fact, as can be seen in the Algorithm 1, this coefficient can be as an independent hyper-parameter (even is put with the global learning rate together as one fix term).\n\niii) In the section 6, when increase the training steps, experiments compared with previous methods should be implemented since they can also get better results with more epochs.\n\niv) Writing should be improved, e.g., the first paragraph in section 6.

Comment : \"LR \"warm-up\" can mitigate the unstable training in the initial phase and the proposed method is also motivated by the stability but uses a different approach. However, it seems that the authors also combine with LR \"warm-up\" in your proposed method in the experimental part, e.g., Table 3. So does it mean that the proposed method cannot handle the problem in general?\"\nA: Warm-up alone is not able to mitigate the unstable training for Alexnet. LARS with warm-up can. There is also a new version of algorithm which eliminates warm-up completely\n\n2. Comment: \"There is one coefficient that is independent from layers and needs to be set manually in the proposed local learning rate. The authors do not have a detail explanation and experiments about it. In fact, as can be seen in the Algorithm 1, this coefficient can be as an independent hyper-parameter (even is put with the global learning rate together as one fix term).\"\nA: Agree. In the paper we used fixed trust coefficient $eta\" and changed learning rate. One can used instead fixed global learning rate policy which does not depend on networks, and scale up only trust coefficient . I will add the explanation to the revised paper.\n\n3. Comment \"In the section 6, when increase the training steps, experiments compared with previous methods should be implemented since they can also get better results with more epochs.\" \nA: The point of section 6 was to show that there is no \"fundamental\" limit on the accuracy of large batch training, provided we do train it long enough and regularize well (e.g. increase weight decay or add data augmentation. \n\n4.

LARS is the only algorithm (AFAK) that allows to train Alexnet with batch > 2K to the same accuracy as for small batches\n2) We added Appendix with data on  LARS performanse comparing to other \"Large Batch training\" methods for Resnet-50. \n\nSpecific comments: \n1) Q: \"In Algorithm 1, how to choose $ \\eta $ and $ \\beta $ in the experiment?\"\nA: $ $0<\\eta<1 $, and it depends on the batch size $B$. It grows with B: for example for Alexnet with B=1K  the optimal $\\eta=0.002$, with B=4K  the optimal $\\eta=0.005$, with B=4K  the optimal $\\eta=0.008$,...  Weight decay $\\beta$ is chosen as usual. We found that with large batch it's beneficial to increase weight decay to improve the regularization \n2) typo: fixed in the revised paper \n3) Q: \"How can the training algorithm based on LARS improve the generalization for the large batch?\"\nA: LARS does not replace standard regularization methods (weight decay, batch norm, or data augmentation).  But we found that with LARS we can use larger weight decay than usual,  since LARS automatically limits the norm of weights during training: $|| W(T)|| <= ||W(0)|| * exp \\int_{0}^{T} \\gamma(t) dt$. \n4) Q: In the experiments, what is the parameter iter_size? How to choose it?\n    A: iter_size is used in caffe to emulate large batch if batch does not fit into GPU DRAM.
