Regarding point 1 in the weakness, we would like to inform the reviewer that we have updated the hierarchical attention section, a key contribution, so, it is more clear and differentiable from other existing methodologies. To summarize, as ours is the first attempt in applying hierarchical decoding with hierarchical attention in the domain of text-summarization, we found that the previous hierarchical attention approach by Nallapati et al. 2016, i.e., using sentence (post) level attention (gamma) to scale word level attention (alpha) didn't improve very much, i.e., Rouge-1 of 31.3 and Rouge-2 of 10.2 against Rouge-1 of 30.6 and Rouge-2 10.0,  in the hierarchical decoding of interleave text-summaries; see scores in rows 3 and 5 in Table 8. Therefore, in contrast to earlier work, we introduce another level of attention, i.e., high-level attentions (beta). Our newly introduced beta attention is also computed at the word-level with the primary objective being to obtain a thread representation and secondarily to rescale word-attention (alpha). Additionally, beta attention is rescaled by post attention (gamma). Thus, the major difference in our novel approach is attention rescaling, i.e., gamma->beta->alpha, where \u2018->\u2019 indicates rescaling,  in contrast to previous approaches (Nallapati et al, Cheng et al. 2016, Tan et al. 2017 and Hsu et al. 2018), which use gamma->alpha only. The scores in rows 1 (Rouge-1 33.4) and 2 (Rouge-1 32.7) in Table 8 show it improves performance against previous approach (Rouge-1 31.3), and examples in Table 9 and the Appendix show beta attention brings in phrase-level information and also works in tandem with gamma.\n\nRegarding novelty in encoder and decoder, we would like to inform the reviewer that Nallapati et al. 2017 used a hierarchical encoder, they did not use a hierarchical decoder. We are the first to attempt hierarchical decoding in text-summarization while Li et al. 2015 applied it in the context of Autoencoders. Hierarchical decoding not only improves performance, but also computation speed which is equally important in case of longer summaries.\nWe believe summarization is more challenging since it requires generating a new text distilling the original; it also forms a real test bed for hierarchical decoding. \n\nRegarding novelty in hierarchical attention, Thanks for letting us know the lacking, we have updated Table 1 with citations and also updated the hierarchical attention section. We refer the reviewer to page 6. Further, we draw inspiration from the See et al. 2017 pointer mechanism which allows modelling two distributions, i.e., over source tokens and vocabulary tokens together using a switch probability. Basically, the intuition is that in an end-to-end learning if there are two distributions that involves a common set of tokens then they must be modeled together by something, e.g., switch probabilities, but not in isolation. We also model two distributions, but in contrast to See et al., we use them to capture larger-scale and local context, i.e., high-level distribution (beta) and low-level distribution (alpha) over the same source tokens and we model them together by scaling one (alpha) by the other (beta). Further, the popularly held intuition of hierarchical attention, i.e., sentence attention scales word attention, is still upheld as gamma (post-attention) scales the beta. Therefore, all attentions are modeled together without any extra train labels unlike Hsu et al 2018.\n\nRegarding point 2 in the weakness, the reason for exclusion is that the disentanglement component of (Shang et al. 2018) requires an explicit number of clusters, which fixes the number of summaries, while the medium and hard corpus has a variable number of clusters, i.e., 2 to 3 (medium) and 2 to 5 (hard). We believe our hard corpus is a challenging task as the model has to detect highly variable threads, i.e., 2 to 5 from 500 source tokens. To justify this, we would also like to note that we mention in the Discussion section that we ran our model on the AMI corpus, a real-world meeting corpus, where the source size was limited to 600 and target to 150 tokens and hier2hier gives us Rouge-1 of 37.57 and Rouge-2 of 11.72, which outperforms the results of Shang et al. 2018 (approx Rouge-1 of 30) for the same target size (150 tokens). Additionally, we fine-tuned one of the Pubmed trained models to the AMI corpus and found a simple fine-tuning after 50k iterations lead to improvement of an additional 2-3 rouge scores. \nAs these experiments were not part of the original submission, we can update the paper with them upon the acceptance. Regarding the last point in the weakness, we would like to inform reviewer that it is not only the novel hierarchical attention but also hierarchical decoding that is adding gain in the performance.\n\nFurther, we have reformatted images and tables, and reduced the draft size to a little over 8 page.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1786/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1786/Reviewers"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1786/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["skarn@cis.lmu.de", "chen@fxpal.com", "yanying@fxpal.com", "ulli.waltinger@siemens.com", "hinrich@hotmail.com"], "title": "Generating Multi-Sentence Abstractive Summaries of Interleaved Texts", "authors": ["Sanjeev Kumar Karn", "Francine Chen", "Yan-Ying Chen", "Ulli Waltinger", "Hinrich Sch\u00fctze"], "pdf": "/pdf/df9803dcdd2ecb8e6fdcfee2a4e4f1b1c56be326.pdf", "abstract": "In multi-participant postings, as in online chat conversations, several conversations or topic threads may take place concurrently.

To address some of the reviewer concerns and questions, we ran the experiments to examine performance when disentangled threads are concatenated and used as input, e.g., posts-thread1->posts-thread2->posts-thread3->posts-thread4 => summary1->summary2->summary3->summar4, and for expediency, we used a 150k sampled Pubmed Hard corpus as the original Pubmed Hard corpus is twice the size and a seq2seq model takes about 5 days to converge. The results are presented in Table 4. Evidently, seq2seq doesn't gain much from ground-truth disentangled posts, which is coherent with the result for disentangling using clustering on the easy corpus (see Table 3). We believe this is due to the sequential decoder not being able to utilize the later cluster of posts. Consider a case where all the sentences in a channel are very similar, e.g., all discussing HIV (see example 2 in the Appendix), and when the seq2seq encoder runs over such disentangled posts sequentially, i.e., cluster1-cluster2-cluster3-cluster4 and the decoder generates summaries sequentially, i.e., summary1-summary2-summary3-summary4, then it might be good at generating  summary1 and summary2; however, it may not be as good for  summary3 and summary4, due to the long-term dependency problem. \n\nAdditionally, Table 4 shows that hier2hier still performs best when the posts are disentangled. Also, comparison of hier2hier results on interleaved and disentangled corpora shows that hier2hier is quite successful in disentangling on its own. see examples in the Table 9 and appendix. Overall, disentanglement is helpful for hier2hier models, however it\u2019s a time-consuming process and can lead to error propagation. \n\nRegarding concerns on how tasks look like, we have rearranged Table 2 which illustrates an interleaved text in the corpus, and  Table 9, which illustrates model output. We hope this makes the task further understandable . Additionally, we have put more examples in the appendix. Further, we also modified the draft to address reviewer concern on images and tables formatting, they are either enlarged, rearranged or combined to enhance comprehensibility.

Since we are focused on text-summarization, Table 1 (updated) summarizes some of the forms of hierarchical attention in the domain. We would also like to point out that previous ideas on hierarchical attention in the field were devised assuming sequential decoding, and top-down integration of attention, where sentence- (post-) level attention scale word-level attentions, e.g., Nallapati et al. and Hsu et al. As far as we know, ours is the first architecture of applying hierarchical decoding with hierarchical attention in text-summarization, and we found the previous approach on hierarchical attention, i.e., sentences level attentions scaling word level doesn't help much in hierarchical decoding of interleaved text; see scores in row 3 (hier2hier(+gamma-beta)) and row 5 (hier2hier(-gamma-beta)) in Table 7. Therefore, we introduce another mid-level attention, and refer to it as high-level attention (beta), which brings in phrase-level information and works in tandem with both post- and word-level attentions. We refer the reviewer to the updated hierarchical attention section on page 5. \n\nRegarding the second concern on weak baseline, we agree that SOTA summarization is superior to the base model, i.e., seq2seq; however, most of these SOTA are also built on seq2seq with advance features like a pointer mechanism and/or coverage and/or RL training. As future work, we aim to include those in our hier2hier setup, as it improved the performance in the news summarization task, we believe the similar improvement will follow in the interleaved case.\n\nFurther, we find a very good point is raised in the reviewer first question. At the moment, due to way seq2seq is trained, we are forcing our model to learn to generate tokens by recognizing the occurrence of thread (Table 5) or \nthe density of threads (Table 7) as this is how token of summaries arranged; however, in the future, we will design or use a training loss that is computed at the summaries level rather than tokens. Further, we would also like to point out that the ROUGE-1 scores; however, doesn\u2019t penalize the order of summaries, and the number of transitions between summaries is much smaller than the number of transitions between word pairs within a summary.\nRegarding the second question, the answer is yes. We have compiled the corpus in a manner that the reference summary order follows the first new thread occurrence, e.g., \npost1-thread1, post1-thread2, post-2-thread2, post1-thread3 => thread1-summary, thread2-summary, thread3-summary. Additionally, we evaluated models strength in recognizing threads where summaries are ordered by the location of each thread\u2019s greatest density. Here, density refers to smallest window of posts with over 50% of posts belonging to a thread; e.g., post1-thread1, post1-thread2, post-2-thread2, post2-thread1, post3-thread1, post4-thread1 => thread2-summary, thread1-summary. In this example, although thread1 occurs early, as the majority of posts on thread1 occurs latter, therefore, its summary also occurs later. As shown in Table 7, the model recognizes threads even in these scenarios, which is indicated by its performance (see Table 7) and is similar to the above scenario (Table 5). \nRegarding the concern on the implementation, we would like to inform reviewer that we indeed used one provided by TensorFlow, however, we modified hyperparameters and learning algorithms and therefore wanted to convey that the gains are not due to those changes. We will reference the TensorFlow model that we used as a base. Further, we have also modified the draft to fix typos pointed out by the reviewer and also changed images and tables formatting to enhance comprehensibility, now the draft size is a little over 8 page."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1786/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1786/Reviewers"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1786/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["skarn@cis.lmu.de", "chen@fxpal.com", "yanying@fxpal.com", "ulli.waltinger@siemens.com", "hinrich@hotmail.com"], "title": "Generating Multi-Sentence Abstractive Summaries of Interleaved Texts", "authors": ["Sanjeev Kumar Karn", "Francine Chen", "Yan-Ying Chen", "Ulli Waltinger", "Hinrich Sch\u00fctze"], "pdf": "/pdf/df9803dcdd2ecb8e6fdcfee2a4e4f1b1c56be326.pdf", "abstract": "In multi-participant postings, as in online chat conversations, several conversations or topic threads may take place concurrently.

The proposed approach is end-to-end  trainable, whereas (Shang et al. 2018)\u2019s method tackles the problem in two separate stages. \n\n<Weakness>\n1. The technical novelty may need to be further justified.\n- The proposed model (in Fig.2) consists of the encoder, the decode and hierarchical attention module. \n- The encoder and the decoders are standard ones based on (Nallapati et al. 2017) and (Li et al. 2015), respectively. It is hard to find any technical novelty here. \n- This paper argues that the proposed hierarchical attention is novel with no clear ground. It simply mentions the inspiration from (See et al. 2017), but does not explicitly what aspects are novel as Hierarchical attention has been popularly used in general seq2seq models for many NLP applications. \n- Table 1 is rather cursory and incomplete as it compares with only three different models.\n\n2. Experiments have much room for improvement. \n- The two datasets are simply mixture of text from existing datasets and rather artificial and far from actual interleaved posts, as shown in Table 2. \n- In page 6, three different corpora are introduced with varying interleave parameters. However, the parameters a,b,m, and n are rather small (<= 5), so it is hard to say the configurations are challenging.\n- The SOTA model (Shang et al. 2018) is only compared on the PubMed Easy Corpus in Table 3. Is there any special reason to exclude it from the comparison with more challenging corpora? \n- In most results of experiments, the paper focus on showing that the proposed hierarchical attention model is better than basic seq2seq, which may not be strong results to show the effectiveness of the proposed model.\n\n<Minor comments>\n- This draft does not seem to follow the ICLR format.\n- Fig.2-4 are hard to see in details. They should be enlarged and re-organized. \n- References should be added to Table 1. \n- This paper exceeds the limit of 8 pages. I cannot find any good strong ground to have more additional pages than the commended length. \n\n<Conclusion>\nMy rate is borderline with slightly leaning toward reject, mainly due to issues of technical novelty and evaluation. I will decide my rate finally, based on the authors\u2019 response to the concerns above. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1786/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1786/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["skarn@cis.lmu.de", "chen@fxpal.com", "yanying@fxpal.com", "ulli.waltinger@siemens.com", "hinrich@hotmail.com"], "title": "Generating Multi-Sentence Abstractive Summaries of Interleaved Texts", "authors": ["Sanjeev Kumar Karn", "Francine Chen", "Yan-Ying Chen", "Ulli Waltinger", "Hinrich Sch\u00fctze"], "pdf": "/pdf/df9803dcdd2ecb8e6fdcfee2a4e4f1b1c56be326.pdf", "abstract": "In multi-participant postings, as in online chat conversations, several conversations or topic threads may take place concurrently.

Unlike previous work that first perform unsupervised clustering to extract ordered threads, the authors instead propose a hierarchical model that directly process interleaved threads.

On synthetic interleaved datasets composed from PubMed and StackExchange, the proposed method outperform seq2seq with attention as well as a pipeline system that applies unsupervised clustering followed by seq2seq. The authors present results for well-chosen ablations as well as baselines. \n\nMy concerns stem from the synthetic nature of these tasks. In particular:\n\n- is it difficult to disentangle the threads? Suppose we train a simple, supervised model instead of using unsupervised clustering and run the same pipeline experiment, how well would the model perform compared to hier2hier?\n- due to the nature of these two tasks, is disentanglement even helpful for summarization? If not, heir2hier might be picking up on helpful signals that are not accessible to baselines. I don't have a good idea of what the tasks look like from reading the paper. I would ask that the authors put some examples of input output pairs in the paper. The algorithm in the appendix for interleaving is not very helpful.\n- I would like to see some upperbound of running seq2seq on ground-truth disentangled threads.\n\nSome comments on the writing:\n- Figure 4 and Table 2 are way too small"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1786/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1786/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["skarn@cis.lmu.de", "chen@fxpal.com", "yanying@fxpal.com", "ulli.waltinger@siemens.com", "hinrich@hotmail.com"], "title": "Generating Multi-Sentence Abstractive Summaries of Interleaved Texts", "authors": ["Sanjeev Kumar Karn", "Francine Chen", "Yan-Ying Chen", "Ulli Waltinger", "Hinrich Sch\u00fctze"], "pdf": "/pdf/df9803dcdd2ecb8e6fdcfee2a4e4f1b1c56be326.pdf", "abstract": "In multi-participant postings, as in online chat conversations, several conversations or topic threads may take place concurrently.

Previous work tackled this problem as a pipeline of disentangling threads from mixed chat posts and then generating a summary for each post. The presented work proposes a hierarchical attention model to solve this task in an end-to-end fashion. \n\nThe proposed architecture is divided into :\n\n- a hierarchical encoder: encodes each sentence to a vector using bi-lstm and average pooling which is then fed to a post-to-post encoder which generates a set of representations corresponding to those posts.\n\n- a hierarchical decoder: number of disentangled posts are generated using a thread-to-thread decoder which given the max pooled representations from the post-to-post encoder generated a number of initial representations for each thread summary using hierarchical attention combining attention over paragraphs and over words at each decoding time step. \n\nExperiments: \nAuthors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by comparing against a set of baselines traditional seq2seq, as well as cluster-> seq2seq and the model from Shang et al. (2018). Evaluation datasets consisted of several datasets for chat summarization synthesized to mimic interleaved conversation with different difficulties. \n\nThrough an ablation study, authors also show the effectiveness of the hierarchical encoding and hierarchical decoding as well as the post level and high-level attention. \n\noverall:\nAlthough this paper is well written and well-motivated. The work is a bit incremental and builds upon previous ideas from hierarchical attention literature to apply for interleaved text generation. The provided baselines are quite weak compared to the SOTA summarization methods at the moment, although none of them is directly modelled for interleaved text summarization through multi summaries. \n\ntypos: \n* Nallapati et al. Nallapati et al. (2016)\n* See et al. See et al. (2017)\n\n\nQuestion: \nIs there an intuition behind penalizing a model that generates correct summaries for each thread with different order? Do references summaries follow the same order as in the threads in the conversation?\n\nIn the paper you dedicated several paragraphs to reimplement basic models such as seq2seq or (See et al.) pointer generator network and make sure they work correctly. There are existing implementations and pre-trained models available such as in OpenNMT.

This leads to difficulties for readers reviewing the postings in not only following discussions but also in quickly identifying their essence. A two-step process, disentanglement of interleaved posts followed by summarization of each thread, addresses the issue, but disentanglement errors are propagated to the summarization step, degrading the overall performance. To address this, we propose an end-to-end trainable encoder-decoder network for summarizing interleaved posts. The interleaved posts are encoded hierarchically, i.e., word-to-word (words in a post) followed by post-to-post (posts in a channel). The decoder also generates summaries hierarchically, thread-to-thread (generate thread representations) followed by word-to-word (i.e., generate summary words). Additionally, we propose a hierarchical attention mechanism for interleaved text.
