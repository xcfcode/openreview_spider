Existing works such as Quaternion CNN (Zhu et al., 14 ECCV\u201918), Quaternion RNN (Parcollet et al., ICLR\u201919), and Quaternion Transformer (Tay et al., ACL\u201919) explained that the weight-sharing property (as illustrated in our Figure 1) in the hypercomplex multiplication makes the Quaternion representation learning more effective.\n\nFurthermore, in our earlier conversation, we noted that \"Table 2 has also demonstrated that our PHM-Transformer ($n=4$) outperforms Quaternion Transformer on 6 out of 7 machine translation tasks when their parameter savings are at the same level (75% saving)\". This suggests that PHM further learns more effective representations than the Quaternion representation. To get intuitions for why:\n\n* As in our responses to Reviewer5 and Reviewer3, we found that PHM can effectively learn predefined real-space operations, such as a rotation in a 3D real space. We have added Section 4 in the revised supplementary materials to include such results. \n* As in our responses to Reviewer5, our experiments on artificial datasets also show that PHM can learn to recover complex/Quaternion/Octonion/Sedenion multiplication rules. Specifically, even simple discretization operations can precisely recover the expected geometric properties in predefined hypercomplex spaces. Now we have also added Figure 2 in the revised Section 3.3 to show that PHM layers can empirically learn hypercomplex multiplications.\n* As in our earlier conversation, even for arbitrary dimensions where multiplication rules are undefined, when we manually specify multiplication rules to generate artificial datasets, PHM can still learn from the dataset to recover such rules. \n\nAll these results suggest that PHM is both flexible and effective in learning different operations in both real space and hypercomplex space. Intuitively, the operations learned by PHM from data may be more effective than those predefined mathematical rules of hypercomplex spaces for the investigated tasks.\n\nWe hope that the above could clarify on why the representation learning in hypercomplex space may add value to the (probably huge) existing body of literatures on real-space representation learning, since hypercomplex representation for deep learning is still in its infancy. Again, thank you and the other reviewers for helping us make the paper better!

Past work in this area has been promising but has been limited to certain dimensions for which there are predefined multiplication operations. The novel contribution of this work is to parameterize the hypercomplex multiplication operations, enabling the model to discover new operations rather than relying on the small number of existing operations and the small number of dimensions for which such operations exist. The authors find that their approach can substantially reduce the number of parameters without reducing performance (and in some cases even improving performance). \n\nStrengths:\n\n1. The proposed method makes a promising approach from the literature more flexible, helping to pave the way for making this approach more broadly useful.\n\n2. The authors illustrate this flexibility by showing how their approach can be effective for two different architectures (LSTMs and Transformers), making the general point that it can be applied to any architecture that uses feedforward components. They also apply it to multiple tasks, again illustrating the flexibility.\n\n3. As mentioned above, the approach can substantially increase a model\u2019s parameter count without affecting performance. Relatedly, it can also improve inference speed.\n\n4. The paper is generally thorough and clear.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. The specific contribution of this paper is the parameterization of the multiplication operation, but the evidence that this parameterization is helpful is mild, as there are only a few cases where the proposed model noticeably outperforms the Quaternion model. Thus, the evidence presented does not make a strong case for the necessity of this parameterization.\n\n2. Much of the argument hinges on the reduced parameter count, but there was not any mention of exactly how many parameters each model had (at least, not that I saw - I did not check the appendix). I think the paper could be substantially strengthened by adding a \u201cParameter count\u201d column to each table.\n\n3. There is no clear intuition offered for why this approach might be expected to be effective. Offering such an intuition is certainly not necessary (since results alone are enough), but the paper would be more satisfying if there were such an intuition present.\n\nOverall, I am rating this as a 7, because I find it to be a solid paper but worry that its contribution on top of the existing work that has studied hypercomplex operations may be too small and may not have enough evidence for its usefulness.\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1018/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1018/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Beyond Fully-Connected Layers with Quaternions: Parameterization of Hypercomplex Multiplications with $1/n$ Parameters", "authorids": ["~Aston_Zhang2", "~Yi_Tay1", "~SHUAI_Zhang5", "~Alvin_Chan1", "~Anh_Tuan_Luu2", "~Siu_Hui1", "~Jie_Fu2"], "authors": ["Aston Zhang", "Yi Tay", "SHUAI Zhang", "Alvin Chan", "Anh Tuan Luu", "Siu Hui", "Jie Fu"], "keywords": ["hypercomplex representation learning"], "abstract": "Recent works have demonstrated reasonable success of representation learning in hypercomplex space.

To do so, the linear transformation is turned into a new linear transformation based on the Kronecker product. A sum of Kronecker products is used to \"simulate\" the different internal relations that could occur in between multi-dimensional components. However, I think that an empirical validation of the ability of the method to recover well-know product, i.e. Hamilton / complex products, is missing. \n\nAccording to the results, with experiments conducted on 3 different tasks, the proposed approach definitely seems to work and is an important step further to better understand and manipulate high-dimensional algebras with deep neural networks.\n\nRemarks and questions:\n1. While the theoretical aspect of the degeneration of the proposed approach to the Hamilton product \"sounds\" plausible, I would like to see a more empirical demonstration. Can this approach, correctly parametrize a rotation in a 3D space (simple task of learning a single rotation of an object). \n2. The quaternion case of this method relies on a set of [-1,0,1] to build the S matrices. This is what ensures the geometrical properties of the quaternion space while doing the different manipulations. This method, however, uses real-valued matrices. It is thus almost certain that the geometrical aspect of the \"learnt\" algebra is impossible to interpret. Do the authors think that a quantisation of the matrices could help finding pure quaternion / complex / octonions / sedenions matrices ? Such an analysis is crucial to validate the fact that the work proposed here is a generalisation of what have been done before to N dimensions for neural networks. \n\n- Would be great to include the number of parameters in the different Table.", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1018/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1018/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Beyond Fully-Connected Layers with Quaternions: Parameterization of Hypercomplex Multiplications with $1/n$ Parameters", "authorids": ["~Aston_Zhang2", "~Yi_Tay1", "~SHUAI_Zhang5", "~Alvin_Chan1", "~Anh_Tuan_Luu2", "~Siu_Hui1", "~Jie_Fu2"], "authors": ["Aston Zhang", "Yi Tay", "SHUAI Zhang", "Alvin Chan", "Anh Tuan Luu", "Siu Hui", "Jie Fu"], "keywords": ["hypercomplex representation learning"], "abstract": "Recent works have demonstrated reasonable success of representation learning in hypercomplex space.

Our contribution (PHM) is to generalize such representations and their multiplications; thus, PHM shares practical benefits of Quaternion representations, such as parameter savings, while allowing for architectural flexibility via its customizable hyperparameter $n$. Additionally, Table 2 has also demonstrated that our PHM-Transformer ($n=4$) outperforms Quaternion Transformer on 6 out of 7 machine translation tasks when their parameter savings are at the same level (75% saving). Thus, PHM\u2019s more effective representations than Quaternion representations can also be considered as a practical benefit. \n\nWhile not within the scope of our paper (our contribution has to satisfy the requirement of generalizing hypercomplex multiplications, not purely reducing parameters), we believe that our paper naturally inspires future research on exploring more practical benefits of our proposed method. If you think that it is necessary, we would like to include more concluding thoughts in the paper to inspire future research.\n\n\n### On the Term \u201cHypercomplex\u201d\nFor hypercomplex spaces that only exist in $2^k$-D, our method parameterizes and generalizes their multiplications rules. Thus, the term \u201chypercomplex\u201d has advantages of being self-explanatory for its relations to hypercomplex multiplications, but we are open to suggestions if a better naming exists :)\n\n\n### On Interpretability of the Learning\nOur experiments on artificial datasets show that PHM can learn to recover complex/Quaternion/Octonion/Sedenion multiplication rules (in the $\\mathbf{A}$ matrices). Similarly, even for arbitrary dimensions where such rules are undefined, when we manually specify multiplication rules to generate artificial datasets, PHM can also learn from the dataset to recover such rules: the learned results are interpretable as those manually specified rules.

Using a 3D rotation matrix $\\mathbf{W}$, we created an artificial dataset {($\\mathbf{x}_i$, $\\mathbf{y}_i$)} where $\\mathbf{y}_i$ is generated via 3D rotation of the input: $\\mathbf{y}_i = \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{x}_i$. As shown in Figure 2 of the revised supplementary materials, the loss converges to zero. This empirical result shows that the PHM layer can learn a single rotation of an object in 3D space. We have added Section 4 in the supplementary materials to include such results.\n\n\n### On Quantisation for Finding Pure Complex/Quaternion/Octonion/Sedenion Matrices\n\nThis is a very smart idea. The deep learning framework requires real-valued parameters to compute gradients during model training. Our experiments on artificial datasets show that PHM can learn to recover complex/Quaternion/Octonion/Sedenion matrices with real values (in the $\\mathbf{A}$ matrices) very close to -1, 0, 1. For example, our learned values -1.00000000e+00, -5.18326004e-08, 9.99999881e-01 can be easily rounded to -1, 0, 1, respectively.

Specifically, \u201cfully-connected layers with quaternions\u201d (quaternions are 4D hypercomplex numbers), which replace real-valued matrix multiplications in fully-connected layers with Hamilton products of quaternions, both enjoy parameter savings with only 1/4 learnable parameters and achieve comparable performance in various applications. However, one key caveat is that hypercomplex space only exists at very few predefined dimensions (4D, 8D, and 16D). This restricts the flexibility of models that leverage hypercomplex multiplications. To this end, we propose parameterizing hypercomplex multiplications, allowing models to learn multiplication rules from data regardless of whether such rules are predefined. As a result, our method not only subsumes the Hamilton product, but also learns to operate on any arbitrary $n$D hypercomplex space, providing more architectural flexibility using arbitrarily $1/n$ learnable parameters compared with the fully-connected layer counterpart.
