The visualization results indicate our model can indeed capture the interaction between multiple objects as well as with the context.\n\n\n**Q2: \u201cWhat is the value of 'k' used in the experiments? How is this chosen? Does this change across datasets, environments, tasks, etc.? k has a direct effect... and it would be interesting to see how it affects the predictions.\u201d**\n\nA2: k is equal to N in our experiments. The reason is that when we predict the trajectory of t=N+1, we only have access to the previous N features. We revised our submission to explain this point (Section 4, red text).\n\nThe value of N depends on the task:\n1. For PHYRE and ShapeStacks where the objects are governed by gravity, it is possible to infer the future from just the initial configuration. Following (Bakhtin et al., 2019; Ye et al., 2019), we set N=1.\n2. For SimB and RealB, the objects are moving in a flat table so we cannot infer the future trajectories based on a single image. Therefore in this setting, we set N=4 to infer the velocity/acceleration of objects.\n\nIn SimB and RealB, we did experiments with different N (=k), the results do not have significant differences. We choose N=4 due to a balance between performance and computation budgets. The results are in the table below:\n\n|       method      | N |       mean error of [0, $T_{train}$]  | mean error of [$T_{train}$, 2x$T_{train}$]  | \n| ------------------- | --- |  ----------------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------  |\n|                         |     |        RealB        SimB           |          RealB                 SimB |\n|    Ours (CIN)   |  3  |         0.35          2.63            |            2.52                 28.69              |\n|    Ours (CIN)   |  4  |         0.32          2.55            |            2.44                 27.04              |\n|    Ours (CIN)   |  6  |         0.31          2.49            |            2.40                 26.74              |\n\n\n**Q3: \u201cI am not convinced about the use of the term 'spatial information' when using ROI pooling. From what I can see, ROI pooling results in a 3-d representation of the object as opposed to 1-d representations obtained when using cropped images. This offers a richer representation that captures object-centric features that are invariant to the spatial dimensions of objects. But I do not think that the spatial information is explicitly coded into the features are any point.\u201d**\n\nA3: The term 'spatial information' means the objects' shapes which can be implicitly encoded in the RoIPooling features, instead of the x,y spatial locations. We tried to add location features into our framework. While we did observe improvements in less complex environments such as SimB and RealB, it does not help much in more complex environments such as PHYRE (see the table below). We hypothesize this is because location features cannot provide more information to infer the interaction with the environment. We revised our submission to make it clear (Section 3.1, red text).\n\n| Feature              \t             \t| mean error of [0, $T_{train}$]  | mean error of [$T_{train}$, 2x$T_{train}$]  | \n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------| -----------------|\n|                                      | PHYRE  SS  RealB SimB  |  PHYRE  SS  RealB  SimB |\n| RoI Feature   \t\t   \t\t|  1.70   1.73   0.32   2.55  \t| 11.91   4.33   2.44   27.04\t|\n| RoI + Position Feature |    1.68   1.70   0.31   2.42   |   11.93   4.28   2.26   26.32 |\n\n\n\n**Q4: \u201cHow are objects registered across time? If the GT is used, then I am not sure how would the model fare without access to such explicit information when encountering unseen objects?\u201d**\n\nA4: No, we do not use GT information. For billiards data (RealB and SimB), we perform tracking by the association of object appearance features. For PHYRE and ShapeStacks, we only require 1 image as input, therefore no need to do tracking.\n\n\n**Q5: \u201cAre features re-computed or predicted?\u201d**\n\nA5: Only the first N frames use features from RoIPooling. In later frames, there is no visual input thus we use the predicted features recursively.\n\n\n**Q6: Inconsistency in notation.**\n\nA6: Thank you for your valuable feedback. We revised the paper to fix the notations (Equation 3, red part).\n\n\nThanks again for the comments.

There are several alternatives one could try to improve the representation for better performance:\n\n1. Use self-supervised auxiliary loss, e.g. contrastive learning, etc. We believe doing so will help in scenarios when the input scenes are really complex and real-world.\n\n2. Another way is to augment features with object state information: We tried this idea by augmenting object features using the positional encoding of objects (coordinate of bounding boxes). While we did observe improvements in less complex environments such as SimB and RealB, it does not help much in more complex environments such as PHYRE (see the table below). We hypothesize this is because positional features cannot provide more information to infer the interaction with the environment.\n\n| Feature              \t             \t| mean error of [0, $T_{train}$]  | mean error of [$T_{train}$, 2x$T_{train}$]  | \n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------| -----------------|\n|                                      | PHYRE  SS  RealB SimB  |  PHYRE  SS  RealB  SimB |\n| RoI Feature   \t\t   \t\t|  1.70   1.73   0.32   2.55  \t| 11.91   4.33   2.44   27.04\t|\n| RoI + Position Feature |    1.68   1.70   0.31   2.42   |   11.93   4.28   2.26   26.32 |\n\n**Q2: How does F_p work for scenes with a different number of objects?**\n\nA2: Thanks for pointing it out. There was a typo in the Equation of f_p: the index t, t-1, ..., t-k should be superscript instead of the subscript. Please refer to the updated submission file (Equation 3, red part).\nThe number of objects only affects the e_i^t in equation (1). The f_p function is applied for each object feature across different timesteps, therefore it is agnostic to the number of objects and can be applied to any number of them.\n\n\n**Q3: \u201cThe authors mention that \u2018In SimB, the improvement is not as significant because there is no environment information needed to infer future dynamics\u2019.

The network has stride 4 and the output is 32x32. Since almost all objects are larger than 4 x 4 in the original image, the feature of each object occupies at least one pixel in the feature map.

Despite being simple, it brings together the key ideas from computer vision (region proposal features) and machine learning (interaction network) together. The advantage of simplicity is further supported by the results where our method significantly outperforms all prior state-of-the-art methods by a healthy margin.\n\n\n**Q3: What is the meaning of \u2018operate in the state space\u2019?**\n\nA3: The term \u2018state space\u2019 here comes from control theory literature. State here means objects' physical properties such as positions, shapes, sizes, orientation, etc. In the real world, we don't have direct access to the underlying true state, but only sensory observations (e.g., images) to estimate those states. Moreover, even if we can estimate the objects\u2019 states, it is hard to have a general approach to describe the environments using several parameters, such as the billiard table under different viewpoints or the bars/jars in the PHYRE dataset. In contrast, our approach directly takes image observation as input and implicitly encodes the environment information into object features, which is general and practical in the real world. We will clarify it in the paper.\n\n\nThanks again for the comments.

The key idea is to have a richer object-centric feature representation using ROI-Pooling to encode the objects for prediction and use convolution operators to help the IN handle the change in the dimensionality of the feature representation. The paper is well-written and is evaluated on several popular benchmarks. The proposed variations seem to have a considerable effect on the performance to offer significant gains on challenging benchmarks.\n\nComments:\n- The predictions for time t+1 is a function of features from t-k to t. What is the value of 'k' used in the experiments? How is this chosen? Does this change across datasets, environments, tasks, etc.? k has a direct effect on the number of parameters in the network W_p and it would be interesting to see how it affects the predictions.\n- On that note, are the object features re-computed using ROI pooling at every time step, or are the predicted features used recursively? Have you tried generating frames based on the predictions to see if it helps capture the interaction/context between the different objects in the scene based on predictions? \n- How are the objects registered across time? In other words, is there some tracking used to map the object bounding boxes across time to ensure that consistency is enforced when modeling the interaction of the same object over time? If there is no explicit registration, then is the interaction modeled on a per-frame basis i.e. ground truth is used to ensure that the features of each object are used for its interaction modeling? If the GT is used, then I am not sure how would the model fare without access to such explicit information when encountering unseen objects?\n- I am not convinced about the use of the term 'spatial information' when using ROI pooling. From what I can see, ROI pooling results in a 3-d representation of the object as opposed to 1-d representations obtained when using cropped images. This offers a richer representation that captures object-centric features that is invariant to the spatial dimensions of objects. But I do not think that the spatial information is explicitly coded into the features are any point. \n- While the paper is well written, there are some inconsistencies in notations that are hard to follow. For example, in Equation 2, the parameters to the function f_Z has 'h' which in the writing refers to the height of the object-centric representation vector. Following consistent notations will greatly improve the readability.\n- The paper would benefit from a more thorough ablation study.

I cannot see this size in the paper (should be in A.1?). It seems it might be too small to properly use ROIPooling that discriminates between close objects.\nI am not sure the baseline comparisons are very fair, since it is stated that they are either video based or do not have mechanism to cope with \"background\" objects.\n\n \n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2388/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2388/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Long-term Visual Dynamics with Region Proposal Interaction Networks", "authorids": ["~Haozhi_Qi1", "~Xiaolong_Wang3", "~Deepak_Pathak1", "~Yi_Ma4", "~Jitendra_Malik2"], "authors": ["Haozhi Qi", "Xiaolong Wang", "Deepak Pathak", "Yi Ma", "Jitendra Malik"], "keywords": ["dynamics prediction", "interaction networks", "physical reasoning"], "abstract": "Learning long-term dynamics models is the key to understanding physical common sense.
