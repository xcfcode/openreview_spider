", "comment": "\n As advised,  we made particular effort to improve the readability of the paper.  We made multiple large/small revisions throughout the paper to reflect the suggestions.  We would like to elaborate on our revisions  in the form of writing a response to each comment we received:  \n\n>Weaknesses:\n>-Readability of the paper can be generally improved. I had to go over the paper many times to get the idea.\n\nWe  took this advice as seriously as possible, and particularly  reorganized introduction and section 2.\nWe reworded many phrases in an effort to convey our ideas from more intuitive perspective.   \nWe moved the technical description of the section 2 to the appendix for the readers with interests in functional theoretic background of our algorithm.We hope that our revision improves the readability of the paper. \n\n>-Figures should be provided with more detailed captions, which explain main result and providing context \n>(e.g. explaining baselines).\n\nWe added more description to the captions, and elaborated on the experiment described by each figure. \n\n>Questions/Comments:\n>-Equation (7) has typos (uses theta_old instead of theta in some places)\n\nThank you  very much!  We fixed the typos in the equation 7. \n\n>-Section 4.1 (effect of monoticity) is a bit confusing. My understanding is that parameter update rule of \n>equation (3) and (6) are equivalent, but you seem to use (6) there. Can you clarify what you do there and in \n>general this experiment a bit more?\n\nWe must admit that we were not clear enough about the motive of the second experiment in section 4.1.  \nAs we have additionally explained in the revised version of the section 2.3,  the \u201cmonotoniciy\u201c is a property satisfied by the optimal-transport-based update that can possibly have a good  effect on the distillation step.  \nMonotonicity is a property that our algorithm guarantees for the map used in our update as well. \nIn distillation step, the goal of the user is to  approximate the target distribution with the parametric distribution, \nand as many SGD steps can be used as liked. In conventional GANs, only one SGD update is applied to the parametric generator G. \nThe purpose of our second experiment in section 4.1 is to assess the effect of monotonicity on this distillation step.  We prepared a pair of target distributions---one constructed with a monotonic map and another constructed with a non-monotonic map, with the former being further away(in Wasserstein sense) from the current distribution and both of them yielding the same value for the objective function. \nAgainst the intuition based on \u201cthe distance\u201d,  the distillation procedure is easier for the distribution constructed with the monotonic map.\nThis experiments demonstrates a case in which the monotonicity works in favor of the training of G( in distillation step).   \n\n>-Comparing with entropy maximization method of EGAN (Dai et al, 2017) is a good idea, but I\u2019m wondering \n>if you can compare it on low dimensional settings (e.g. as in Fig 2). It is also not clear why increasing entropy \n>with EGAN-VI is worse than baselines in Table 1.\n\nWe conducted experiments on the low dimensional setting as well, and confirmed that our implementation of EGAN-VI indeed achieves higher entropy than the vanilla experiment without the regularization. As we can see in the results, the  performance is not  too impressive, however. \n\nAs for the second concern that is being raised, we would like to note that the original implementation of EGAN in the publication was conducted without Spectral Normalization(SN), which generally improves the results for most methods. Our baseline method is not an ordinary DCGAN, but the DCGAN with SN that is known to perform at competitive quality on the dataset like ImageNet and CIFAR10. \nIn fact, the \u201cvanilla DCGAN with SN\u201d and \u201cEGAN with SN\u201d both perform better than the vanilla EGAN as well. In this light, it is not so surprising that  EGAN with SN  performs worse than the vanilla SN-DCGAN on CIFAR10,  because the variational inference for the entropy of the distribution in high dimensional space like the one dealt with in CIFAR10.   \n For the experiment, we used EGAN-VI based on Gaussian distribution, as opposed to EGAN-Nearest Neighbor. In the original publication, this version of  EGAN-VI was being used for their experiment on CIFAR10.   We experimented with multiple parameters and always reported the result with best Inception Score/ FID. \nIn general, EGAN needs to prepare a decoder in addition to the pair of Generator and Discriminator. Because the training for both of them are being conducted separately, it is difficult to find the right balance between the two during the training.   \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1441/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1441/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1441/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DISTRIBUTIONAL CONCAVITY REGULARIZATION FOR GANS", "abstract": "We propose Distributional Concavity (DC) regularization for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a functional gradient-based method that promotes the entropy of the generator distribution and works against mode collapse. \nOur DC regularization is an easy-to-implement method that can be used in combination with the current state of the art methods like Spectral Normalization and Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty to further improve the performance.\nWe will not only show that our DC regularization can achieve highly competitive results on ILSVRC2012 and CIFAR datasets in terms of Inception score and Fr\\'echet inception distance, but also provide a mathematical guarantee that our method  can always increase the entropy of the generator distribution.

The paper motivates the proposed method as follows:\n-       Using the concept of functional gradient, the paper interprets the update in the generator parameters as an update in the generator distribution\n-       Given this functional gradient perspective, the paper proposes updating the generator distribution toward a target distribution which has *higher entropy and satisfies monoticity*\n-       Then, the paper proves that this condition can be satisfied by ensuring that generator\u2019s objective (L) is concave\n-       Since it\u2019s difficult to ensure concavity when parametrizing generators as deep neural networks, the paper proposes adding a simple penalty term that encourages the concavity of generator objective\nExperiments confirm the validity the proposed approach. Interestingly, the paper shows that performance of multiple GAN variants can be improved with their proposed method on several image datasets\n \nStrengths:\n-   \tThe proposed method is very interesting and is based on sound theory\n-   \tConnection to optimal transport theory is also interesting\n-   \tIn practice, the method is very simple to implement and seems to produce good results\n \nWeaknesses:\n-       Readability of the paper can be generally improved. I had to go over the paper many times to get the idea.\n-       Figures should be provided with more detailed captions, which explain main result and providing context (e.g. explaining baselines).\n \nQuestions/Comments:\n-       Equation (7) has typos (uses theta_old instead of theta in some places)\n-       Section 4.1 (effect of monoticity) is a bit confusing. My understanding is that parameter update rule of equation (3) and (6) are equivalent, but you seem to use (6) there. Can you clarify what you do there and in general this experiment a bit more?\n-       Comparing with entropy maximization method of EGAN (Dai et al, 2017) is a good idea, but I\u2019m wondering if you can compare it on low dimensional settings (e.g. as in Fig 2). It is also not clear why increasing entropy with EGAN-VI is worse than baselines in Table 1.\n\n \nOverall recommendation:\nThe paper is based on sound theory and provides very interesting perspective. The method seems to work in practice on a variety of experimental setting. Therefore, I recommend accepting it.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1441/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DISTRIBUTIONAL CONCAVITY REGULARIZATION FOR GANS", "abstract": "We propose Distributional Concavity (DC) regularization for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a functional gradient-based method that promotes the entropy of the generator distribution and works against mode collapse. \nOur DC regularization is an easy-to-implement method that can be used in combination with the current state of the art methods like Spectral Normalization and Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty to further improve the performance.\nWe will not only show that our DC regularization can achieve highly competitive results on ILSVRC2012 and CIFAR datasets in terms of Inception score and Fr\\'echet inception distance, but also provide a mathematical guarantee that our method  can always increase the entropy of the generator distribution.

While the primary motivation of the work is claimed to be 'mode collapse', it does not turn out from the submission what mode collapse is.\n\nWe have given more detailed explanation of mode collapse, and provided citation that can be consulted for further information regarding its definition. In short, Mode collapse collectively refers to the lack of diversity in generator distribution [1-5]. This phenomena happens even in the simplest case of generating a mixture of Gaussian Distribution (See Fig 22, [1] for example) . Without any notable countermeasure, GANs tend to produce a distribution with less number of modes than the target distribution . \n\n> 3. Estimating entropies is a standard practice in statistics and machine learning, with an arsenal of estimators; the motivation of the submission is questionable. \n\nIn the revision, we have emphasized how the classical empirical techniques in estimating the entropy are not suited for the training of GANs aimed toward the synthesis of high dimensional distribution. In fact, our method yields much better performance than Energy-based GANs(EGANs) [6], that uses a rather high calibre variational inference based technique to directly estimate the entropy, which was, in their experiment, performed the best among all classical techniques they tested. For more details, please consult the original text.  \n\nIn many application of GANs, the objective is to synthesize a generative model on high dimensional space, and it is a very difficult problem on its own to rely on classical techniques to estimate the entropy in such high dimensional space. In most study of generative models, the distribution is defined in term of latent variables, and its law is given by G# p where p is some known distribution---or the pushforward of p with a measurable function G with an euclidean range.  The most straightforward approach in entropy estimation uses some form of plugin Estimator based on Kernel density estimation and nearest neighbor estimation hat p: \nestimate  =  g(\\hat p(X_i), X_i  \\in Data ). \nFor the real world applications of GANs (e.g image generations), the dimensions of the data space are high.  On the CIFAR 10 benchmark, the dimension is   32*32*3, and the dimension of the ImageNet benchmark is high as 64*64*3.   Even for Kernel density estimator on of  regular density on d dimensional Euclidean space for example, the mean square error is MSE(f*, \\hat f) = O(h^4  +  1/(n h^{d})) where h is the bandwidth, n is the number of samples [7,8].\nThis is to say we need small enough bandwidth with tremendous size of n for large d. On the top of this, for  the density of p_g of G\\# p is computed through the formula\nH(p_g) = H(p(z)) + E_p(z)[det(D_z G(z))]. \nIn order to compute E_p(z)[det(D_z G(z))], we need at least O(n d^2) (often d^3 in usual implementation)  and this expression does not include the massicve scaler that is dependent on the number of parameters, which again, is  often extremely large, and can be in order of millions\uff08Fig 2 in [9]) .  Again, Energy-based GANs(EGANs)[6], that uses a rather high calibre variational inference based technique are not performing too well relative to our approach.  \nAlso, one of the fundamental motivation for the development of GANs techniques is to do away with the precise and explicit density of the target distribution in high dimensional space. For more details of these motives, please consult classical literatures in GANs [1,4,10].\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1441/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1441/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1441/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DISTRIBUTIONAL CONCAVITY REGULARIZATION FOR GANS", "abstract": "We propose Distributional Concavity (DC) regularization for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a functional gradient-based method that promotes the entropy of the generator distribution and works against mode collapse. \nOur DC regularization is an easy-to-implement method that can be used in combination with the current state of the art methods like Spectral Normalization and Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty to further improve the performance.\nWe will not only show that our DC regularization can achieve highly competitive results on ILSVRC2012 and CIFAR datasets in terms of Inception score and Fr\\'echet inception distance, but also provide a mathematical guarantee that our method  can always increase the entropy of the generator distribution.
