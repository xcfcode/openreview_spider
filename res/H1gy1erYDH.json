I now understand that the difference between the two is that the former uses \u201cd/d\\theta softmax(logits)\u201d, whereas the latter uses \u201cd/d\\theta softmax(logits + gumbel_noise)\u201d; is this correct?\n\nI think the newly-added Section 2.1 and your justification for the use of spectral normalization contradict each other. On one hand, Section 2.1 dismisses continuous relaxations on the basis that the difference between a one-hot encoded token and a distribution over tokens is easy to spot by the discriminator, which then becomes very certain of its predictions. On the other hand, the proposed approach requires the discriminator\u2019s Lipschitz constant to be bounded for the generator to use the gradient of the discriminator effectively. It seems to me that this line of reasoning could just as well apply to continuous relaxations, because bounding the Lipschitz constant of the discriminator limits how \u201ccertain\u201d it can be of its prediction.

There is technically an infinite number of possible \u201cstraight-through estimators\u201d. The one we think of as the straight-through estimator is just the most obvious way to define the backward gradient (by pretending the activation is an identity function) - but there is no reason to think that it is the best. Thus it is worth searching for modifications.\n\nSpectral normalization is not so much an \u201caddon\u201d as it is a crucial prerequisite for our method. Since we want to incorporate the gradient of the discriminator in the generator, we need to bound the Lipschitz constant of the discriminator (using spectral normalization) and makes it possible for the generator to use gradient of the discriminator effectively. For more details, please see the revised version of section 5.7. \n\nOur experiments show that the recentering trick increases 20% FED compared to the baseline straight-through estimator (both using spectral normalization), which is why we feel it is worth incorporating."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2047/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2047/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["jsaon92@gmail.com", "alvin.chiang.180@gmail.com", "liangtaiwan1230@gmail.com", "gblin75468@gmail.com", "cph@yoctol.com", "raywu0@gmail.com", "ypiheyn.imm02g@g2.nctu.edu.tw", "cyhuang@ntu.edu.tw"], "title": "CaptainGAN: Navigate Through Embedding Space For Better Text Generation", "authors": ["Chun-Hsing Lin", "Alvin Chiang", "Chi-Liang Liu", "Chien-Fu Lin", "Po-Hsien Chu", "Siang-Ruei Wu", "Yi-En Tsai", "Chung-Yang (Ric) Huang"], "pdf": "/pdf/1e28e6406283f37f7caec31ef50dfe43f9a3d97f.pdf", "TL;DR": "An effective gradient-based method for training a text generating GAN", "abstract": "Score-function-based text generation approaches such as REINFORCE, in general, suffer from high computational complexity and training instability problems.

The main reason is CaptainGAN minimizes different objective from MLE models. This objective assigns an extremely low cost to mode dropping and does not force the generator to mimic all aspects of real data. This can result in poor modeling of the likelihood but does not necessarily lead to poor sample generation. For more details, please see the revised version of section 5.5.

We specifically do not use Gumbel-Softmax Estimator for text generation. As explained in our revision, using the Gumbel-Softmax Estimator leads to a training interaction with potentially pathological quirks which is not reflective of the actual text generation process.\n\nKeeping training and inference consistent (both using sampled tokens) is why we use the Straight-Through estimator (note: not a \u201cStraight-Through Gumbel estimator\u201d). However, that choice by itself doesn\u2019t guarantee good results.

(2016) in combination with gradient centering. The proposed approach is evaluated on COCO and EMNLP News in terms of BLEU and Self-BLEU scores, Fr\u00e9chet Embedding Distance, Language Model Score, and Reverse Language Model Score.\n\nMy assessment is that the submission is below the acceptance bar, mainly due to clarity and novelty concerns. The proposed approach does have empirical backing, but I would argue that it is a very straightforward application of the straight-through Gumbel estimator to GANs, which is itself similar to existing work on applying the Gumbel-softmax estimator to GANs (Kusner & Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato, 2016). Detailed comments can be found below.\n\nThe submission does not feel self-contained. For instance, it borrows notation from Jang et al. (2016) without explicitly acknowledging it, and my personal experience is that reading Jang et al. (2016) beforehand makes a big difference in terms of clarity in Section 2.2.\n\nThe notation is inconsistent and confusing, and gets in the way of understanding the proposed approach. Here\u2019s a (non-exhaustive) list of examples:\n\n- The reward function is first introduced as f_\\phi(\\mathbf{x}) above Equation 3, but all subsequent mentions of the reward function use f_\\phi(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}).\n- The \\mathbf{m}_\\theta variable is introduced in Equation 5 and is immediately replaced with \\mathbf{p}_\\theta, which adds notational overhead without any benefit.\n- The difference between \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} and \\hat{x} is not explained in the text. From the context I understand that \\hat{x} is a categorical scalar in {1, \u2026, V}; is this correct?\n- In Equation 6, x_1, \u2026, x_V are used to denote the *values* that \\hat{x} can take. This clashes with the previous convention that \\mathbf{x} is a sequence sampled from p_{data} (Equation 1). Given that convention and the difference between bolded and non-bolded variables discussed above, I would have expected that x_1, \u2026, x_V would correspond to the categorical values of elements of the \\mathbf{x} sequence. That contributes to confusion in Equation 9, where \\mathbf{e}_{x_t} and p_\\theta(x_t) are *not* time-dependent.\n- Equation 8 sums over time steps, but the first summation that appears in Equation 8 does not make use of the temporal index. There is also a symbol collision for T, which is used both as the sequence length and as the \"transpose\" symbol.\n\nAs a result, the proposed centering method and the rationale for it is still not entirely clear to me. In particular, is the gradient centering approach necessary to avoid the drawback of score function-based approaches (i.e. the generator is only given feedback on the tokens it samples), or does the non-centered, straight-through variant of the proposed approach also avoid this drawback?\n\nI\u2019m also not convinced that the centering heuristic is a crucial component of the proposed approach when the biggest improvement observed over the straight-through baseline is obtained by adding spectral normalization. I would argue that the proposed approach is a straightforward application of the straight-through Gumbel gradient estimator to GAN training, which is similar in spirit to work by Kusner & Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato (2016) (not cited in the submission) -- the main difference being that the latter uses the Gumbel-softmax distribution directly and anneals the temperature parameter over the course of training. A comparison between the two would be warranted.\n\nReferences:\n\n- Kusner, M. J., & Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato, J. M. (2016).

This is mainly due to the non-differentiable nature of the discrete space sampling and thus these methods have to treat the discriminator as a reward function and ignore the gradient information. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, CaptainGAN, which adopts the straight-through gradient estimator and introduces a \u201dre-centered\u201d gradient estimation technique to steer the generator toward better text tokens through the embedding space. Our method is stable to train and converges quickly without maximum likelihood pre-training. On multiple metrics of text quality and diversity, our method outperforms existing GAN-based methods on natural language generation.", "keywords": ["Generative Adversarial Network", "Text Generation", "Straight-Through Estimator"], "paperhash": "lin|captaingan_navigate_through_embedding_space_for_better_text_generation", "original_pdf": "/attachment/382544f814c5ba4aa7656300b3fe8c25b5ef04e5.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nlin2020captaingan,\ntitle={Captain{\\{}GAN{\\}}: Navigate Through Embedding Space For Better Text Generation},\nauthor={Chun-Hsing Lin and Alvin Chiang and Chi-Liang Liu and Chien-Fu Lin and Po-Hsien Chu and Siang-Ruei Wu and Yi-En Tsai and Chung-Yang (Ric) Huang},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1gy1erYDH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
