The proof of Lemma 1 is stated for a feedforward network, but the DenseNet and UNet architectures both have skip connections to intermediate layers where feature maps are concatenated. However, the concatenation operation is linear. Therefore, the entire cascade still only consists of linear units and ReLUs. For a fixed input, this means that the whole cascade is scale invariant.

It would be better to discuss this point to make the scope of the proposed method clear.\"\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that this is an interesting point. We have applied our methodology to image restoration (simultaneous deblurring and denoising). Preliminary results indicate that bias-free networks generalize across noise levels for a fixed blur level, whereas networks with bias do not. An additional question is whether it is possible to achieve generalization across blur levels. Our initial results indicate that removing bias is not sufficient to achieve this (a possible explanation is that additional structure beyond scaling invariance may be needed). We have updated our discussion and future work section to address this.\n\n\nQ2. \"About the visualization of the linear weighting functions in Figure 4, what can we figure out from the visualization, especially for image denoising? If possible, please elaborate on it.\"\n\nFor any given input image, the network operates by computing a linear function of the input. Thus, each output (denoised) pixel is computed as a weighted sum of input pixels.  The last three columns of figure 4 visualize these weighting functions (filters). We see that these filters adapt to the edges and other structures in the image, averaging over pixels that corresponding to nearby \u201csimilar\u201d content, and avoiding content that is far away, or very different.  For example, pixel 3 is on a tree branch, and denoised by averaging over a collection of nearby pixels lying along the branch, but not including pixels from the background (similar examples can be seen in supplementary Figs 13, 14 and 15). The weighting function for pixel 1 is completely different, in both shape and size. Thus, even though the network architecture is translation-invariant (i.e., consisting of convolutions and nonlinear point operations) it exhibits spatially adaptive behaviors. In addition to this, one can also see that the effective area over which the network averages goes up with increasing noise level.  This is to be expected for denoising methods (e.g., the classical linear solution - Wiener filter - also does this). We have updated our manuscript to clarify these points. \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1036/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1036/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Robust And Interpretable Blind Image Denoising Via Bias-Free Convolutional Neural Networks", "authors": ["Sreyas Mohan", "Zahra Kadkhodaie", "Eero P.

Moreover, the analysis of the network Jacobian and its interpretation as a nonlinear adaptive filter provides some interesting insight in the local properties of bias-free denoisers. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this paper, if the authors provide a theoretical discussion on why the bias term might degrade generalization performance.\"\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that a theoretical discussion would be a useful addition to the paper. We have added such a discussion in the first paragraph of Section 7. To recap, in this work, we show that removing constant terms from CNN architectures ensures strong generalization across noise levels, and also provides interpretability of the denoising method via linear-algebra techniques. We provide insights into the relationship between bias and generalization through a set of observations. Theoretically, we argue that if the denoising network operates by projecting the noisy observation onto a linear space of \u201cclean\u201d images, then that space should include all rescalings of those images, and thus, the origin. Networks with bias do not have this property, whereas bias-free networks do. Empirically, in networks that allow bias, the net bias of the trained network is quite small within the training range. However, outside the training range the net bias grows dramatically resulting in poor performance, which suggests that the bias may be the cause of the failure to generalize. In addition, when we remove bias from the architecture, we preserve performance within the training range, but achieve near-perfect generalization, even to noise levels more than 10x those in the training range.\n\nMinor comments:\n\n-\"It is not clear if d should be multiplied by \\sigma^2 in its definition on page 7. The definition mentions dependence on noise variance, but the formula does not have it.\"\n\nThank you for pointing this out. We define \"effective dimensionality\" as the amount of variance captured by applying the linear map to an $N$-dimensional Gaussian noise vector with variance $\\sigma^2$, normalized by the noise variance. Since the dimensionality is defined as the fraction $\\frac{E_n ||A_y n||^2}{\\sigma^2}$,  $\\sigma$ doesn\u2019t show up in the formula. We have updated our manuscript to make this clearer. \n\n-\"In Section 3 in the expression of the mean squared error it is not defined what g(y) means.\"\n\nThe mean-squared error is minimized over the denoising function g. In deep learning, the denoising function g is parameterized by the weights of the network, so the optimization is over these parameters. We have updated the manuscript to make this clearer.\n\n-\"Axis labels are missing on Fig. 3.\n\nThank you for noticing this - we have fixed it (adding a single pair of axes that are then shared across all subfigures). \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1036/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1036/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Robust And Interpretable Blind Image Denoising Via Bias-Free Convolutional Neural Networks", "authors": ["Sreyas Mohan", "Zahra Kadkhodaie", "Eero P.

First, they argue that state-of-the-art denoising networks perform poorly outside of the training noise range. The authors empirically show that as denoising performance degrades on unseen noise levels, the network residual for a specific input is being increasingly dominated by the network bias (as opposed to the purely linear Jacobian term). Therefore, they propose using bias-free convolutional neural networks for better generalization performance in image denoising. Their experimental results show that bias-free denoisers significantly outperform their original counter-parts on unseen noise levels across various popular architectures. Then, they perform a local analysis of the bias-free network around an input image that is now a strictly linear function of the input. They empirically demonstrate that the Jacobian is approximately low-rank and symmetric, therefore the effect of the denoiser can be interpreted as a nonlinear adaptive filter that projects the noisy image onto a low-dimensional signal subspace. The authors show that most of the energy of the clean image falls into the signal subspace and the effective dimensionality of this subspace is inversely proportional to the noise level.\n\nEven though it is theoretically not too well-motivated in the paper why the bias term degrades generalization performance, the experimental results seem to clearly demonstrate the merit of bias-free denoisers. Moreover, the analysis of the network Jacobian and its interpretation as a nonlinear adaptive filter provides some interesting insight in the local properties of bias-free denoisers. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this paper, if the authors provide a theoretical discussion on why the bias term might degrade generalization performance.\n\nSome smaller comments: \n-It is not clear if d should be multiplied by \\sigma^2 in its definition on page 7. The definition mentions dependence on noise variance, but the formula does not have it.\n-In Section 3 in the expression of the mean squared error it is not defined what g(y) means.\n-Axis labels are missing on Fig. 3."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1036/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1036/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Robust And Interpretable Blind Image Denoising Via Bias-Free Convolutional Neural Networks", "authors": ["Sreyas Mohan", "Zahra Kadkhodaie", "Eero P.
