The method consists of a rationale extraction phase, where the subgraph \"important\" for the desired property is identified and a graph completion step. \n\nWhen reading the paper for the first time, I found it a bit hard to follow the approach. The paper might be easier to read when the individual model components are introduced directly with the E- and M-step. Currently, the graph completion model is introduced in Sec 3.1, then the E- and M-steps are described in Sec. 3.2, while the \"explainer\" is only mentioned and referred to Sec. 3.3. An easier to follow structure might be: 1) Rationale extraction 2) Graph completion 3) E/M iteration.\nBeyond that, the terms \"evolution\" and \"explanation\" might be misleading here: The method is not an evolutionary algorithm, as the title might suggest. Even if subgraphs are extracted that lead to the generation of promising molecules in the graph completion step, this does not show that these subgraphs responsible. To warrant the term explaination, a  thorough analysis of the extracted rationales would be necessary, in particular since they might not even be connected graphs.\n\nThe evaluation of the method in Table 1 and Fig. 3 show that the method outperforms previous appraoches and is capable of shifting the generated distribution shifts to higher scores. The human evaluation is weak, since only a single expert was asked. A panel of experts with reported agreement among the panel would improve the paper. However, since the scores of the molecules are available, it does not become quite clear to me, how human experts benefit the performance evaluation under those same criteria.\n\nPros\n-----\n- Interesting approach to update the pool of rationales\n- Outperforms previous approaches, Fig 3. show that desired properties improve over rounds\n- Ablation study demonstrates improvement by proposed procedure\n\nCons\n----\n- Structure of the paper could be improved\n- The paper states that in the explainer a \"subgraph s of k vertices\" is extracted, therefore I assume the size of the rationale is fixed. This would severely restrict the space of rationales.\n- The notion of explainability is not sufficiently discussed in the paper and the claim(?) that the rationales are somehow meaningful is not examined.\n\nUpdate: I read the reply and thank the authors for the clarifications.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2246/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2246/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Molecule Optimization by Explainable Evolution", "authorids": ["~Binghong_Chen1", "~Tianzhe_Wang1", "~Chengtao_Li1", "~Hanjun_Dai1", "~Le_Song1"], "authors": ["Binghong Chen", "Tianzhe Wang", "Chengtao Li", "Hanjun Dai", "Le Song"], "keywords": ["Molecule Design", "Explainable Model", "Evolutionary Algorithm", "Reinforcement Learning", "Graph Generative Model"], "abstract": "Optimizing molecules for desired properties is a fundamental yet challenging task in chemistry, material science, and drug discovery.

The aspect of explainability is novel. The presentation of the paper is mostly clear. The approach is quite geared to molecule generation, but can potentially also inspire applications in other domains, which makes it interesting from a general ML perspective as well. \n \nI like the paper from the theoretical side, which alone warrants acceptance of the paper at ICLR in my opinion. \n \nHowever, I have a few minor concerns / comments: \n \nI am a bit on the fence with the validation method. Since almost every new paper in the field proposes a new validation approach, it has become pretty much impossible to assess what the state of the art of the field is (or if the concept of SOTA is even something meaningful), and this paper is no exception in this regard. But I assume the authors will disagree here. \n \nIn practice, generating 20k molecules is a lot. Looking at the statistics of the top100 molecules would probably be sufficient. \n \nAlso, I find it somewhat surprising that some of the baseline algorithms (in particular the Winter et al MSO model), which are less constrained than algorithm presented here, are not achieving higher scores, in particular when the algorithms can query the scoring function 5 M times. Maybe this is something the authors could comment on in the rebuttal. \n \nAs an additional baseline, I would suggest to report the \"best in dataset\", I.e. run the scoring function on the seeds and all molecules used to train the generator, and pick the top molecules. \n \n \nRelated work: \n \nI would suggest to additionally cite https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01329 which was the first paper to apply neural models to molecule generation in drug discovery, and the first of such papers which has been prospectively validated in laboratory experiments by scientists not affiliated with the authors.\n\n### Update 1 after discussion:\nScore raised.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2246/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2246/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Molecule Optimization by Explainable Evolution", "authorids": ["~Binghong_Chen1", "~Tianzhe_Wang1", "~Chengtao_Li1", "~Hanjun_Dai1", "~Le_Song1"], "authors": ["Binghong Chen", "Tianzhe Wang", "Chengtao Li", "Hanjun Dai", "Le Song"], "keywords": ["Molecule Design", "Explainable Model", "Evolutionary Algorithm", "Reinforcement Learning", "Graph Generative Model"], "abstract": "Optimizing molecules for desired properties is a fundamental yet challenging task in chemistry, material science, and drug discovery.

We address the convergence of our algorithm below.\n\nThis convergence analysis is very similar to EM as we've already defined the components using the terms in the EM framework. But to make it more clear, we give a sketch of the proof below. From a theoretical standpoint, here we assume 1) we use the true support set $\\mathcal{S}$ instead of the finite support set $\\mathcal{S}_t$ in (Eq. 8), and 2) $\\alpha$ and $m$ in (Eq. 10) are carefully selected such that the gradient update has small enough variance.\n\n**Proof:**\n- As $J(\\theta, p(s))$ has an upper bound, we only need to show that it is non-decreasing over E step and M step.\n- E-step: we need to show that $J(\\theta^{t}, p^{t+1}(s))\\geq J(\\theta^{t}, p^{t}(s))$. It is obvious with assumption 1) as (Eq. 6) has the closed form solution (Eq. 7), so the updated value of $J$ is the maximum after the argmax operation.\n- M-step: we need to show that $J(\\theta^{t}, p^{t}(s))\\geq J(\\theta^{t-1}, p^{t}(s))$. First, it is worth noticing we used the same trick as in REINFORCE to derive Eq. 10 from Eq. 9, i.e. we can do SGD by the gradient we get in Eq. 10. Then, with assumption 2), by doing SGD, the unbiased gradient estimator with small variance will always converge to a non-decreasing result in the objective value. \n- By the above analysis, we can justify that this EM-like method can converge to some local optimum.\n\nWe further note that both assumptions are rather mild, since for assumption 1), $\\mathcal{S}_t$ grows with time $t$ and gradually converges to $\\mathcal{S}$, and for assumption 2), a large enough $m$ and a small enough $\\alpha$ should suffice.\n\nAlso, we\u2019d like to mention that in the appendix, we have a plot (Fig. 5) of the final objective\u2019s convergence curve to justify that empirically our algorithm can converge.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2246/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2246/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Molecule Optimization by Explainable Evolution", "authorids": ["~Binghong_Chen1", "~Tianzhe_Wang1", "~Chengtao_Li1", "~Hanjun_Dai1", "~Le_Song1"], "authors": ["Binghong Chen", "Tianzhe Wang", "Chengtao Li", "Hanjun Dai", "Le Song"], "keywords": ["Molecule Design", "Explainable Model", "Evolutionary Algorithm", "Reinforcement Learning", "Graph Generative Model"], "abstract": "Optimizing molecules for desired properties is a fundamental yet challenging task in chemistry, material science, and drug discovery.

We address your concerns below in detail.\n\n**1. Evaluation Metric.**\n\nThe evaluation metric we used in the paper is mostly similar with RationaleRL ([1]), i.e. we compare the success rate, novelty and diversity here. Moreover, we hope to use a more comprehensive metric that can jointly take these three factors into consideration, so we propose QNU as an overall metric, as explained in the 3rd paragraph on page 7. \n\nFor the reason why we used 20k molecules for evaluation, the goal of our work is that to learn a sampler being able to generate some diverse and novel molecules with high property value over a highly discrete space (also of high variance), i.e. we want to learn a distribution instead of a few points with high value, which tends to be a more general problem. In fact, the setting for evaluation is close to what RationaleRL used, by decoding each rationale with a fixed number of times. Furthermore, if we only evaluate the molecules with highest values, it is very likely that these molecules are similar to each other (and to the seed molecules) and of low diversity, which is meaningless for helping scientists to design novel drugs.\n\n**2. Low performance in the MSO baseline.**\n\nWe ran MSO with a swarm size of 20000 for 250 epochs using our defined score function f(g) (in Eq. 15). The main reason for MSO\u2019s low performance is that it produced molecules with relatively low diversity, so most queries were wasted for evaluating the same molecules. In fact, we ran MSO for more than 1 day to get the reported result, which actually exceeds the resource budget in our experiment setting. We conjecture that MSO is not well suitable for producing high scoring molecules with high diversity since there\u2019s no regularization for the diversity of molecules it generates.\n\n**3. Best in Dataset.**\n\nThe statistics of all the scores for the generated molecules and seed molecules: the best score in the seed molecules is 0.713, while ours is 0.716. However, we\u2019d like to address that only comparing the best might not meaningful since our method is designed to generate a series of molecules all achieving a good score. Therefore, \"best in dataset\u201c could not reflect the performance gain of the ``\u201cdistribution learning\u201d by our method, and so we didn't treat it as a proper metric in the paper.\n\n[1] Jin, Wengong, et al. \"Multi-Objective Molecule Generation using Interpretable Substructures\" in ICML 2020."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2246/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2246/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Molecule Optimization by Explainable Evolution", "authorids": ["~Binghong_Chen1", "~Tianzhe_Wang1", "~Chengtao_Li1", "~Hanjun_Dai1", "~Le_Song1"], "authors": ["Binghong Chen", "Tianzhe Wang", "Chengtao Li", "Hanjun Dai", "Le Song"], "keywords": ["Molecule Design", "Explainable Model", "Evolutionary Algorithm", "Reinforcement Learning", "Graph Generative Model"], "abstract": "Optimizing molecules for desired properties is a fundamental yet challenging task in chemistry, material science, and drug discovery.

Notion of Explainability.**\n\nWe\u2019re sorry about the lack of preciseness for the notion of explainability. We were intended to use the word \"explainability'' to describe the ability of a subgraph to generate high scoring molecules, rather than using chemical science to explain what exactly causes the high scores. Also we showed the results in Fig. 4 to explain that a good rationale can be a good inductive bias in designing good molecules (as we use $p_\\theta(g|s)$ to decode some good molecules by the rationale). We will address these issues (and the potentially misleading concept of \"evolutionary'') in our revision.\n\nWe totally agree with you and R3 that a more rigorous explanation using scientific language is important and helpful for the material scientists.

The method is novel and achieves promising results.", "review": "The paper tackles the problem of molecule property optimisation. To this end, the authors proposes an alternating approach consisting of an explainer model and a molecule completion model. The explainer model takes a complete molecule as input and outputs a subgraph that represents the part that contributes most to property prediction. Then, the molecule completion model uses the subgraphs to sample a complete graph that can maximise the property scores. The loss function of molecule completion model directly maximises the properties, which is non-differentiable so that the authors use a REINFORCE algorithm for optimisation. \n\nPros:\n\n1. The paper proposes use subgraphs that contributes most to the property prediction for searching better molecules. The subgraphs are learned supervisedly through the signals from the property to be optimised. Compared to unconditional VAE models, this approach might be easier to optimise, since the subgraphs can serve as templates. \n\n2. The method is novel and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods compared to previous methods.\n\n3. The paper is well-written and the idea is articulated in a formal description.\n\nCons (or questions):\n\n1. Some convergence analysis shall be needed, i.e. why this method will converge to the optimal values of the objective. The authors claim the method is an EM algorithm, and some proofs about convergence might be needed. Otherwise, some learning curves might be helpful, since the REINFORCE algorithm is known to suffer from high variances.
