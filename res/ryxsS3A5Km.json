We have added additional results comparing our method with other more recent and relevant methods. Please refer to the updated manuscript.\n\nRegarding the questions:\n- What's the intuition behind implementing the \u201cadapt\u201d operator as additive bias over the previous weights, rather than just copying the previous weights and fine tuning?\n\nThe role of adaptor is to strike a balance between number of parameters and performance. As mentioned in the end of section 3.1, we have different cost for select each option. Adaptor provides a way of using and modifying previous representation without incurring any forgetting by adding a relatively small amount of parameter overhead.\n\n- In the general case, if the architecture search is a continuous relaxation (softmax combination of operators), why is the \"adapt\" operator necessary? Wouldn't this already be a linear combination of new and old parameters? (In the example case of a 1\u00d71 adaptor it makes sense, but this is a special restricted case which adapts with a smaller set of parameters)\n\nIn the adaptor case, when searching the combination of the old parameters with 1x1 conv forms an option. For example, in case we have two options, reuse and adaptor, the softweight is over the original parameter and the original parameter plus adaptor combined, so here the second part is treated as one option. To some extend what you are suggesting is true, however, this does not exactly corresponds to what is happening (as we explained above).\n\n- How is the structure regulariser backpropagated into the parameters of each layer? As I understand, it is composed of a constant discrete term z (number of parameters in each option), multiplied by architecture softmaxes alpha; the gradient with respect to each alpha is a constant, and so this has the effect of scaling the gradients of each operator.\n\nIn our implementation, the structure regularizer does not backprop to the parameters of each layer. Instead, the regularizer serves as a penalty for different choices, and thus has effect on the magnitude of alphas. Since alpha controls the weight for different options, this would influence the choice of different options during structure learning.\n\n- For the \"reuse - tuned\" case, isn\u2019t the model effectively maintaining a new network for each task?\n\nNo. When the model is reused, the parameters are tuned, and the tuned parameter is used both for current tasks that it is finetuned on as well as all previous tasks.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1572/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1572/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1572/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Continual Learning via Explicit Structure Learning", "abstract": "Despite recent advances in deep learning, neural networks suffer catastrophic forgetting when tasks are learned sequentially.

We have added additional results comparing our method with other more recent and relevant methods. Please refer to the updated manuscript.\n\nRegarding the questions:\n-\tIn the equation (4), I wonder that, in the model, the hyperparameter(lambda_i or beta_i) of regularizer looks different according to the task, is it correct?\n\nYes they can be different for each tasks, this is more of a design choice. However, in our implementation and experiments, to make things easier, we just used the same hyperparameter for all tasks.\n\n-\tAs shown in the Fig. 2) three choice-reuse, adaptation, and, new, is decided in the layer level. But with a semantic intuition, such that two different task can share specific features and simultaneously each of them requires the different neural space to learn discriminative ones at layer l, it seems better if the model could search structure much flexible. Is there some of experimental trial or plan about these kind of joint-adoption?\n\nThis is a very good point. Ideally we would like to be able to do more finer grained search, and that is definitely desired. In practice, we could only make the search space more restricted so that the search can be done in a more efficient manner. Of course one is not restricted to use only the options that we provided in our implementation. More finer grained and search is definitely possible, for example, learning to share at filter/neuron level instead of layer level. This is more of a balance between training efficiency and final performance. The current implementation highlights the importance of taking structure into account. However, one should not limit themselves with only the options that we demonstrated. As long as the search space is reasonably sized and operations are plausible, it could be incorporated in our framework. This leads to interesting future work directions.\n\n-\tWhat is the main contribution of adaptation? I wonder that only reuse and new can work well including the role of adaptation, or not.\n\nThe role of adaptation is to strike a balance between number of parameters and performance. As mentioned in the end of section 3.1, we have different cost for select each option.

In this update revision we did following changes.\n\n1) We added more analysis on forgetting, which we think provides more insights into the method. In addition to use simple L-2 based regularization we finetuned our model without using any regularization, and we still obtained interesting result where the forgetting is minimal. This further suggests the importance of structure learning when learning continual tasks.\n\n2) As all reviewers suggested, we added more comparisons to more recent, existing methods. In particular, we compared ours with the more recent methods such as  dynamically expandable network, incremental moment matching, progressive network, hard attention to task, etc on permuted MNIST dataset. We show that our method is performs competitive or better as compared to all these method.\n\n3) Provided more details in appendix\n\n4) Corrected editorial errors as pointed out by reviewers.\n\nDue to the time limit, we only completed experiments on permuted MNIST. Additionally we are also running experiment on split MNIST so that we have more comparisons, and we will update another version with those results before the deadline.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1572/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1572/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1572/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Continual Learning via Explicit Structure Learning", "abstract": "Despite recent advances in deep learning, neural networks suffer catastrophic forgetting when tasks are learned sequentially.

This is framed as an architecture search problem, applying ideas from Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS). The approach is verified on the Permuted MNIST dataset and evaluated on the Visual Decathlon, showing an improvement.\n\nI think this is an interesting idea with potential, and is worth exploring, and the paper is well-structured and easy to follow.\n\nUnfortunately, I feel the paper fails to consider recent work on CL, both in terms of discussion and benchmarking. The only previous work that is compared is EWC, on permuted MNIST, and the Visual Decathlon performance is only compared to simple baselines (such as adding an adapter or fine tuning) which makes it difficult to gauge the contribution.\nThere are recent works, some with better results on more difficult problems, such as Variational Continual Learning [1], Progress and Compress [2], or (Variational) Generative Experience Replay [3][4].\nGiven the approach is based on dynamically adding parameters or modules, Progressive Networks and Dynamically Expandable Networks (both cited) are especially relevant and should be compared (I believe the former may be related to the \u201cadapter\u201d baseline, but this should be made explicit).\n\nI have some questions / discussion points:\n- What's the intuition behind implementing the \u201cadapt\u201d operator as additive bias over the previous weights, rather than just copying the previous weights and fine tuning?\n- In the general case, if the architecture search is a continuous relaxation (softmax combination of operators), why is the \"adapt\" operator necessary? Wouldn't this already be a linear combination of new and old parameters? (In the example case of a 1\u00d71 adaptor it makes sense, but this is a special restricted case which adapts with a smaller set of parameters)\n- How is the structure regulariser backpropagated into the parameters of each layer? As I understand, it is composed of a constant discrete term z (number of parameters in each option), multiplied by architecture softmaxes alpha; the gradient with respect to each alpha is a constant, and so this has the effect of scaling the gradients of each operator.\n- For the \"reuse - tuned\" case, isn\u2019t the model effectively maintaining a new network for each task?\n\nI also have a number of other comments:\n- Reference to figure in page 6 should be figure 4, not 5.\n- I think the readability of the paper would benefit from another few proofreads; there are a number of grammatical issues throughout, and several sentence fragments, eg. in the top para of page 2: \u201c..., it has the potential to encourage information sharing. Since now the irrelevant part can be handled\u2026\u201d.\n\nI would encourage the authors to strengthen the experimental comparison by incorporating stronger, external baselines, and improving some of the minor writing issues.\n\n[1] Nguyen, Cuong V., et al. \"Variational Continual Learning.\" ICLR, 2018.\n[2] Schwarz, Jonathan, et al. \"Progress & Compress: A scalable framework for continual learning.\" ICML, 2018.\n[3] Shin, Hanul, et al. \"Continual learning with deep generative replay.\" NIPS, 2017.\n[4] Farquhar, Sebastian, and Yarin Gal. \"Towards Robust Evaluations of Continual Learning.\" arXiv, 2018.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1572/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Continual Learning via Explicit Structure Learning", "abstract": "Despite recent advances in deep learning, neural networks suffer catastrophic forgetting when tasks are learned sequentially.

The model is composed to the neural architecture search and parameter learning based on the intuition that largely different tasks should allow to use different network structure to train them. In structure learning, they introduce three candidate to decide network architecture, reuse, adaptation and new. In the experiments, they show that their model outperforms SGD and EWC.\n\nBasically, the intuition of structure learning and the validation of that is straight forward and easy to follow. However, I\u2019m not sure that the proposed model can outperform the recent continual learning methods, such as IMM(Lee et al, 2017), DEN or  RCL(Ju Xu et al, 2018). There is only a relatively weak(and old) comparison with l2, and EWC.\n\n-\tIn the equation (4), I wonder that, in the model, the hyperparameter(lambda_i or beta_i) of regularizer looks different according to the task, is it correct?\n-\tAs shown in the Fig. 2) three choice-reuse, adaptation, and, new, is decided in the layer level. But with a semantic intuition, such that two different task can share specific features and simultaneously each of them requires the different neural space to learn discriminative ones at layer l, it seems better if the model could search structure much flexible. Is there some of experimental trial or plan about these kind of joint-adoption?\n-\tWhat is the main contribution of adaptation?
