Experiments are conducted to show that it leads to improved generalisation error and faster convergence.\n\nThe paper is well written and the idea well presented. \n\ni) The data sets and consequently the statistical assumptions used are limited (e.g. no continuous data, only autoregressive generative modelling).\nii) The hyper parameters are nearly constant over the experiments. It is ruled out that they have not been picked in favor of one of the methods. E.g. just judging from the text, a different learning rate could have lead to equally fast convergence for vanilla LSTM. \n\nConcluding, the experiments are flawed and do not sufficiently support the claim.

We address some of your concerns below.\n\n\u201c... why would it also improve generalization?\u201d\n\nThis is one of the effects of batch normalization in feed-forward networks. We believe that  generalization improvement is due to the use of batch statistics. As the estimated means and variances through the batch are not perfect, they introduce some noise in the training process that have a regularizing effect.\n\nWe experimentally verified this effect by varying the minibatch size. When the minibatch size is increased, noise is reduced in the estimated means and variances. Consequently, we observed faster optimization, but it also tends to increase the model overfitting. By reducing the batch size, we observe a gain in generalization, but a relative slowdown in the optimization.\n\n\n\n\u201c...Several \u2018hacks\u2019 for the method (per-time step statistics, adding noise for exploding variance, sequence-wise normalization)\u201d\n\nWe would like to clarify the motivations behind the use of per-time step statistics and sequence-normalization.  When BN is applied to an LSTM, one needs to consider the normalization of the state activation and the inputs.\n\nWhile LSTM activations do converge to a stationary distribution,  we observe that their statistics during the initial transient differ significantly (see Figure 5 in Appendix A). It is therefore necessary to leverage per time step statistics for estimating the mean and variance of the *state activation*, to take into account this initial transient. Note that we always use per-time step statistics for the state activations in our experiments.\n\nOn the other hand, inputs means and variances  are not necessarily time-dependent. You can therefore share the statistics over the different time-step leading to the sequence-wise normalization for the *input*.\n\nFinally, adding noise is a way to artificially increase the variance, when the estimated variance  is exactly 0. This problem occurs in the in-order MNIST task due to the first hundred or so pixels being black. Increasing the $\\epsilon$ in (eq. 5) would be an alternative way to deal with 0 variances, however, we empirically observe that increasing $\\epsilon$ also tends to degrade the optimization.\n\n\n\n\u201c...  computational overhead\u201d\n\nIntroducing BN indeed implies a computational overhead as you need to compute the mean and variance statistics and normalize the activation.  One SGD update of our BN-LSTM implementation is usually about 50% slower than a vanilla LSTM.\n\nHowever, since BN eases optimization, it typically requires fewer epochs than the LSTM baseline to converge. In addition, we observed that introducing BN made it possible to train models with lower capacity, which are faster to compute. We were not able to train models with similar reduced capacity using a baseline LSTM.\n\nIn particular, on the CNN task, it took roughly three weeks to train the LSTM baseline with a capacity of 240 units. We tried to reduce the capacity of the baseline, but we were not able to train the baseline models with reduced capacity. By introducing BN, we were able to train a model with a capacity of 120 units on this task, reducing the total training time to about a week.\n\n\n\u201c... Only character or pixel-level tasks, what about word-level?\u201d\n\nWe also report on the CNN dataset which is a word-level question answering task.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Recurrent Batch Normalization", "abstract": "We propose a reparameterization of LSTM that brings the benefits of batch normalization to recurrent neural networks.

Contrary to previous work from (Laurent 2015; Amodei 2016), the work demonstrates that batch-normalizing the hidden states of RNNs can improve optimization, and argues with quantitative experiments that the key factor to making this work is proper initialization of parameters, in particular gamma. Experiments show some gain in performance over vanilla LSTMs on Sequential MNIST, PTB, Text8 and CNN Question-Answering.\n\nNovelty+Significance\nBatch normalization has been key for training deeper and deeper networks (e.g. ResNets) and it seems natural that we would want to extend it to RNNs.  The paper shows that it is possible to do so with proper initialization of parameters, contrary to previous work from (Laurent 2015; Amodei 2016). Novelty comes from where to batch norm (i.e. not in the cell update) and in the per-time step statistics. \n\nAdding batch normalization to LSTMs incurs additional computational cost and bookkeeping; for training speed comparisons (e.g. Figure 2) the paper only compares LSTM and BN-LSTM by iteration count; given the additional complexity of the BN-LSTM I would have also liked to see a wall-clock comparison.\n\nAs RNNs are used across many tasks, this work is of interest to many.  However, the results gains are generally minor and require several tricks to work in practice. Also, this work doesn\u2019t address a question about batch normalization that it seems natural that it helps with faster training, but why would it also improve generalization? \n\nClarity\nThe paper is overall very clear and well-motivated. The model is well described and easy to understand, and the plots illustrate the points clearly.\n\nSummary\nInteresting though relatively incremental adaptation, but shows batch normalization to work for RNNs where previous works have not succeeded.
