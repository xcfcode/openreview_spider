However, while LSTMs provide exceptional results in practice, the source of their performance and their limitations remain rather poorly understood. Using character-level language models as an interpretable testbed, we aim to bridge this gap by providing an analysis of their representations, predictions and error types. In particular, our experiments reveal the existence of interpretable cells that keep track of long-range dependencies such as line lengths, quotes and brackets. Moreover, our comparative analysis with finite horizon n-gram models traces the source of the LSTM improvements to long-range structural dependencies. Finally, we provide analysis of the remaining errors and suggests areas for further study.", "pdf": "/pdf/71BmK0m6qfAE8VvKUQWB.pdf", "paperhash": "karpathy|visualizing_and_understanding_recurrent_networks", "conflicts": ["stanford.edu", "google.com"], "authors": ["Andrej Karpathy", "Justin Johnson", "Li Fei-Fei"], "authorids": ["karpathy@cs.stanford.edu", "jcjohns@cs.stanford.edu", "feifeili@cs.stanford.edu"]}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "tmdate": null, "cdate": 1454464564200, "ddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "duedate": 1455833700000, "tcdate": 1454464564200, "id": "ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/-/submission", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"pdf": null, "forum": null, "replyto": null, "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*", "description": "Your displayed identity associated with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"pdf": {"order": 4, "description": "Either upload a PDF file or provide a direct link to your PDF on ArXiv.", "value-regex": "upload|http://arxiv.org/pdf/.+"}, "title": {"order": 3, "description": "Title of paper.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "abstract": {"order": 4, "description": "Abstract of paper.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}, "authors": {"order": 1, "description": "Comma separated list of author names, as they appear in the paper.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "author_emails": {"order": 2, "description": "Comma separated list of author email addresses, in the same order as above.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "conflicts": {"order": 100, "description": "Semi-colon separated list of email domains of people who would have a conflict of interest in reviewing this paper, (e.g., cs.umass.edu;google.com, etc.).", "value-regex": "^([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))+(;[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))*$"}, "CMT_id": {"order": 5, "value-regex": ".*", "description": "If the paper is a resubmission from the ICLR 2016 Conference Track, enter its CMT ID; otherwise, leave blank."}}}, "invitees": [], "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "expdate": 1463609700000}}}], "count": 1}
