As we pointed out in Example 2.5, our framework is fundamentally different from the IB framework, due to the additional variable. \n\nQ: \u201cthe conventional IB could be obtained...\u201d\n\nA: Note that as we mentioned in Example 2.5, the IB formulation is $I(Y; Z) - \\lambda I(X; Z)$, and its goal is to maximize predictive accuracy while compressing the representations as much as possible. As a comparison, we don\u2019t have any constraint on the compression of data, but rather an invariant constraint. \n\nQ: \u201ccan one use \u2026 to verify sub-optimality?\u201d\n\nA: Yes, and we discussed this on page 7 before Section 5. For example, in algorithmic fairness, given a fair representation, we could compute the corresponding information-theoretic quantities, e.g., $I(A; Z)$ and $I(Y; Z)$, and use its distance to the line segment as a certificate of the non-optimality of this representation. \n\nQ: \u201chow can the proposed model be turned into practical algorithms that (nearly) achieve the fundamental limits\u201d\n\nA: For g(X) that achieves the extremal point, e.g., the optimal one, our proof specifies how to construct such g(X) in certain cases (e.g., at the end of page 13 in appendix). But even in these cases, the construction of the optimal g(X) requires knowledge about the underlying population distribution, which is often not available in learning. From this perspective, we view our work as a pioneer one that inspires future algorithmic contributions towards this important open problem. \n\nQ: \u201cdomain index in domain adaptation\u201d\n\nA: Here we mean that the value of A corresponds to the identifier of each domain. For example A = 0 means it\u2019s the source domain and A = 1 means it\u2019s the target domain, etc.\n\nQ: Other minor issues:\n\nA: We will be sure to incorporate these to update our paper.

To be more specific, one immediate corollary of our result is that, given two representations, we could construct a new one by randomizing between these two to achieve a new accuracy-invariance tradeoff, and this would allow us to interpolate between existing invariances and accuracies. \n\nThe extremal vertices also specify the limit of accuracy/invariance under the constraint of the other. As the reviewer has mentioned, this is a fundamental and important problem in representation learning. \n\nQ: Assumption about 4.1 and 5.1\n\nA: Assumption 4.1 and 5.1 are standard assumptions in the original PAC learning theory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probably_approximately_correct_learning), and they correspond to the notion of \u201cconcept\u201d that a learner aims to recover. These correspond to the noiseless setting. In appendix we also provide proof for the general noisy setting.\n\nQ: \u201chow to construct g(X)\u201d\n\nA: As we explained above, for g(X) whose corresponding point is in the interior of the feasible region, i.e., non-optimal representations, such g(X) could be constructed using randomization, provided that two existing representations are provided. For g(X) that achieves the extremal point, e.g., the optimal one, our proof also specifies how to construct such g(X) in certain cases (e.g., at the end of page 13 in appendix). But even in these cases, the construction of the optimal g(X) requires knowledge about the underlying population distribution, which is often not available in learning. \n\nQ: \u201ccould be better if \u2026 experimental justifications\u201d\n\nA: We\u2019d love to, but we are not clear what kind of experimental results could better justify our theoretical results than the proof itself. For example, there is no existing algorithm that provably achieves the optimal extremal points.   \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1827/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1827/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Fundamental Limits and Tradeoffs in Invariant Representation Learning", "authorids": ["~Han_Zhao1", "~Chen_Dan1", "~Bryon_Aragam1", "~Tommi_S._Jaakkola1", "~Geoff_Gordon2", "~Pradeep_Kumar_Ravikumar1"], "authors": ["Han Zhao", "Chen Dan", "Bryon Aragam", "Tommi S.

For example, in algorithmic fairness, given a fair representation, we could compute the corresponding information-theoretic quantities, e.g., $I(A; Z)$ and $I(Y; Z)$, and use its distance to the line segment as a certificate of the non-optimality of this representation. We would also like to point out that our proof of the convexity is constructive. So for example in algorithmic fairness, given two fair representations, the convexity shows that we could construct a randomized fair representation from the given two that achieves a compromise between fairness and accuracy. \n\n\nQ: Mixed discrete and continuous Y/A\n\nA: Our current analysis cannot be straightforwardly extended to this setting. It\u2019s beyond the scope of this work hence left as future work.

In the other words, given the characterization of the feasible region in the information plane, including its boundedness, convexity, and extremal vertices, how can the result in this paper improve representation learning? What is the right balance of classification and invariance? It seems quite vague in the current form of the work.\n\n2. Does Assumption 4.1 and Assumption 5.1 hold in general? Does the mapping f always exist, or under what condition does the mapping f exist? More discussion about the assumptions is needed. It is not how stringent the assumptions are in practice.\n\n3.

Specifically. the paper considers both classification (cross entropy loss) and regressions settings\u00a0(squared loss).The related minimax problem is separable in the sense that for any fixed feature transformation, the optimization for the min and max agent are independent of each other, resulting is a simple, concise representation of the resulting optimization problem.\u00a0 The symmetric nature of this description allows for a geometric description of the feasible set in regards to the actions of both min-max agents and the\u00a0paper goes on to provide some characterizations of external\u00a0points and other properties (e.g. convexity) of this region/set. The paper also derives a tight lower bound that for the Lagrangian form of accuracy and invariance.\n\nThis is an interesting\u00a0theoretical take on the issue of exploring tradeoffs between accuracy and invariance of representations, but I am not sure to what extend this theoretical analysis provides actionable insights about real world problems (e.g. what doe convexity of the feasible set imply for algorithmic fairness?). The paper would be much more convincing if it offered some concrete use of these ideas in examples/applications.\u00a0\n\nAlong these lines, I am not sure about whether some modelling assumptions are always satisfied in practice. For example, it seems to me that in the analysis both Y/A tasks are considered to be either jointly classification or jointly regression tasks but in many of the examples put forward it could be the Y is a continuous variable e.g. salary where A could correspond to a discrete one e.g. gender. What does this framework imply in this case?\u00a0\u00a0How sensitive is it on the choice of the loss functions?\n\nOverall, this geometric approach seems like a cute idea but at least in its current form maybe it is not overly insightful for the concrete applications that it aims to model.\u00a0", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1827/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1827/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Fundamental Limits and Tradeoffs in Invariant Representation Learning", "authorids": ["~Han_Zhao1", "~Chen_Dan1", "~Bryon_Aragam1", "~Tommi_S._Jaakkola1", "~Geoff_Gordon2", "~Pradeep_Kumar_Ravikumar1"], "authors": ["Han Zhao", "Chen Dan", "Bryon Aragam", "Tommi S.

Typical examples include privacy-preserving learning, domain adaptation, and algorithmic fairness, just to name a few. In fact, all of the above problems admit a common minimax game-theoretic formulation, whose equilibrium represents a fundamental tradeoff between accuracy and invariance. In this paper, we provide an information-theoretic analysis of this general and important problem under both classification and regression settings. In both cases, we analyze the inherent tradeoffs between accuracy and invariance by providing a geometric characterization of the feasible region in the information plane, where we connect the geometric properties of this feasible region to the fundamental limitations of the tradeoff problem. In the regression setting, we also derive a tight lower bound on the Lagrangian objective that quantifies the tradeoff between accuracy and invariance.
