The underlying idea is to identify superclasses from the dataset. \nBreeds can be used as a tool to test and improve models and increase their generalization capabilities to distribution shift.\nThe problem is very important and the paper well written. However,  the applicability is limited to domains with class structure. The main application presented is images although the authors claim that the approach could generalize to other ares like nlp. Grouping similar classes may not be possible in many application and a discussion about it could have been helpful.\nThe lack of formalization of the framework makes the paper content hard to read and overall vague. However, with some effort, it is possible to get a clear idea of their contribution.

Authors propose building large-scale subpopulation shift benchmarks wherein the data subpopulations present during model training and evaluation differ. In this regard, their approach is based on leveraging existing dataset labels and use them to identify superclasses to construct classification tasks over such superclasses and repurpose the original dataset classes to be the subpopulations of interest. They train some learning models over the generated benchmarks to evaluate model robustness to subpopulation shift and, finally, they try various learning interventions (from the literature) to decrease model sensitivity to this sort of data perturbations.\n\n\nStrengths:\n\n- Paper is very well-written.\n- The problem addressed is very important (learning model generalisation to data shift) and of interest for the majority of ML/AI research community.\n- The methodology followed is well defined and correct.\n- The authors have performed an excellent work with the comprehensive experimental setting proposed in the paper.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n- It is difficult to characterize what new scientific understanding or knowledge was presented in this paper. The presented approach for identifying superclasses and subpopulations of interests is somehow straightforward. Also, I doubt that manual procedure for hierarchy creation / restructuring process is a trivial task (with relatively little effort) for most benchmarks with no structured organisation. Results in sections 4.3 and 5.1 appear entirely unsurprising (though admittedly, this could be hindsight bias). Results in 5.2 appear to present more interesting insights (e.g.  little effect of train-time interventions on model robustness to subpopulation shift). However, one is left wondering whether this insight generalizes beyond the specifics of this experiments/dataset or whether this will create an isolated ImageNet sub-community for addressing image-classification robustness tasks.\n\n\nComments after author rebuttal:\n\nLooking at the author's comments (as well as the other reviewer's feedback), I think that the authors have made a good job with the responses and I'm now more convinced about the usefulness of this work. I'm increasing my original recommendation to 6 \"Marginally above threshold\".\n\n\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1836/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1836/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "BREEDS: Benchmarks for Subpopulation Shift", "authorids": ["~Shibani_Santurkar1", "~Dimitris_Tsipras1", "~Aleksander_Madry1"], "authors": ["Shibani Santurkar", "Dimitris Tsipras", "Aleksander Madry"], "keywords": ["benchmarks", "distribution shift", "hierarchy", "robustness"], "abstract": "We develop a methodology for assessing the robustness of models to subpopulation shift---specifically, their ability to generalize to novel data subpopulations that were not observed during training.

This is particularly true in the context of subpopulation shifts, for which few (and rather limited) benchmarks exist. Even though the insight of leveraging class structure to create such benchmarks may seem natural in retrospect, we are not aware of any work that actually applies this methodology to study distribution shift. Moreover, we view the simplicity of our approach as a strength---it allows us to semi-automatically create a suite of benchmarks without any additional data collection or synthetic modeling that we believe will be useful for developing similar benchmarks in the future. \n\n**[Manually restructuring the hierarchy]** While we do agree that calibrating the class hierarchy is not trivial in terms of manual effort, it is significantly less tedious and expensive than collecting a new dataset with subpopulation annotations from scratch. In particular, our approach enables us to restrict our focus only to the dataset classes, instead of annotating individual data points (which are orders of magnitude more). It also allows us to repurpose existing widely-used datasets for which subpopulation annotations are absent without _any_ additional data collection. Finally, note that there exist approaches that leverage crowdsourcing (e.g., [this paper](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/files/sun15building.pdf)) or ML (e.g., [this paper](https://ai.stanford.edu/~rion/swn/)) to group semantically similar classes together, thus reducing the manual effort required.\n\n**[Our results]** We view the experiments in section 4.3 as a means to validate that our benchmarks do indeed capture something meaningful---i.e., realistic data variations which are fairly insignificant for humans but disproportionately hamper state-of-the-art models. While this might seem unsurprising in hindsight, we believe it is crucial for establishing the validity of our benchmarks. Our experiments in Section 5.1 further corroborate this and highlight that subpopulation robustness is a concrete axis along which standard models can be improved. Finally, we believe the finding that more accurate models are more robust to subpopulation shift is not obvious/expected---more accurate models could be more prone to overfitting to the distribution they are trained on and thus not generalize as well to a shifted distribution (e.g., see the literature on [adaptive overfitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2664)). \n\n**[Isolated sub-community]** We agree that ImageNet is a small part of ML research. At the same time, the benchmarks we present form a concrete and challenging goal for research on model robustness. Thus, we do not view our works as the single perfect robustness benchmark (such a benchmark is unlikely to exist), but as a first step towards benchmarks for developing subpopulation shift-robust models. In fact, we believe that defining such concrete benchmarks or testbeds for evaluation is the only way for making tangible progress on these questions. Finally, as we discussed in Section 4.2  and in the response to Reviewer 4, we believe that our methodology could be easily extended beyond ImageNet to other image classification tasks and even other domains.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1836/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1836/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "BREEDS: Benchmarks for Subpopulation Shift", "authorids": ["~Shibani_Santurkar1", "~Dimitris_Tsipras1", "~Aleksander_Madry1"], "authors": ["Shibani Santurkar", "Dimitris Tsipras", "Aleksander Madry"], "keywords": ["benchmarks", "distribution shift", "hierarchy", "robustness"], "abstract": "We develop a methodology for assessing the robustness of models to subpopulation shift---specifically, their ability to generalize to novel data subpopulations that were not observed during training.

We focus on images as, arguably, this is one of the canonical settings where new architectures and algorithmic tools are currently being developed. \n\nWe will expand the discussion in Section 4.2 to elaborate on these points and also include examples of benchmarks from other domains where the BREEDS methodology could be readily applied.

The key concept is to create breeds, which is done in a semi-automatic fashion -- it starts from a modified version of the WordNet, and then calibrated by human annotators.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nReasons for score: \n\n\nI tend to accept this work, because this benchmark is a good way to evaluate the model's generalization in terms of subpopulation. Though there were several datasets for domain generalization, I think the view of this benchmark is different and it can be a starting point for another direction.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nPros: \n\n\n1. The benchmark introduced in this paper is very interesting. Roughly speaking, it tries to investigate: if I train a model with the images of \"British shorthair cat\" only (plus some other classes' images of course), and now present it an image of \"American curl\", will the model at least tell me it is a \"cat\".\n\n2. The effort on constructing this dataset and evaluating existing methods is significant.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nCons: \n\n\nI may disagree this benchmark can be viewed as an instance of domain generalization (DG). DG most commonly refers to evaluating a model trained with photo cat only can generalize to carton cat. This study still focus on one domain (one style of images). Therefore, the chosen interventions in Sec 5.2 may not be the best choices.\n\n##########################################################################", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1836/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1836/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "BREEDS: Benchmarks for Subpopulation Shift", "authorids": ["~Shibani_Santurkar1", "~Dimitris_Tsipras1", "~Aleksander_Madry1"], "authors": ["Shibani Santurkar", "Dimitris Tsipras", "Aleksander Madry"], "keywords": ["benchmarks", "distribution shift", "hierarchy", "robustness"], "abstract": "We develop a methodology for assessing the robustness of models to subpopulation shift---specifically, their ability to generalize to novel data subpopulations that were not observed during training.
