The method is a nice contribution to the \"learning to learn\" framework, and actually was developed simultaneously to a few papers that have since already been published. It's definitely a useful addition to this space.\n \n The biggest issue with this paper is that the results simply aren't that compelling. The methodology and proposed approach is nice, and the text is improved upon a previous version posted to Arxiv, but it seems that for most problems the results aren't that much better than some of the more common off-the-shelf optimization approaches that _don't_ require learning anything. Furthermore, in the one domain where the method does seem to (marginally) outperform the other methods, the neural net domain, it's unclear why we'd want to use the proposed approaches instead of SGD-based methods and their like (which of course everyone actually does for optimization).\n \n Pros:\n + Nice contribution to the learning to learn framework\n + Takes a different approach from past (concurrent) work, namely one based upon policy search\n \n Cons:\n - Experiments are not particularly compelling\n \n Overall, this work is a little borderline.

Specifically, we considered classification problems on datasets drawn from mixtures of different numbers of random Gaussians (so that as the number of mixture components increases, the data distributions at test time deviate more and more from those used for training). We found the learned optimizer to be fairly robust and appeared to work well for various numbers of mixture components we tested. We have updated the paper to include these results (see the appendix in the updated paper). \n\nWe tried increasing the number of layers and increasing the number of units in a layer. We found that the former resulted in overfitting and the latter resulted in similar performance. For higher dimensional problems, we found that a similar number of hidden units also suffices. We conjecture that the number of hidden units depends more on how complex the geometry of the objective function is rather than how high the dimensionality of the input is. Indeed, if one were to consider the update rules of most existing optimization algorithms, the complexity of the update rule does not change with the dimensionality. \n\nThanks for the suggestion regarding contour plots. We have added them for random 2D logistic regression problems (see section 6.4 of the updated paper). \n\nGood catch \u2013 \\pi_t^* should have been \\pi^*. \n\nThe state transition given an action is not deterministic because the next state contains the gradient and the objective value at the next iterate, which cannot be determined solely from the current state and action.

I think in the case of training machine learning algorithms, a class would represent a model like \u201clogistic regression\u201d. The authors cleverly cast this as a reinforcement learning problem and use guided policy search to train a neural network to map the current location and history onto a step direction/magnitude. Overall I think this is a great idea and a very nice contribution to the fast growing meta-learning literature. However, I think that there are some aspects that could be touched on to make this a stronger paper.\n\nMy first thought is that the authors claim to train the method to learn the regularities of an entire class of optimization problems, rather than learning to exploit regularities in a given set of tasks. The distinction here is not terribly clear to me. For example, in learning an optimizer for logistic regression, the authors seem to claim that learning on a randomly sampled set of logistic regression problems will allow the model to learn about logistic regression itself. I am not convinced of this, because there is bias in the randomly sampled data itself. From the paper in this case, \u201cThe instances are drawn randomly from two multivariate Gaussians with random means and covariances, with half drawn from each.\u201d It seems the optimizer is then trained to optimize instances of logistic regression *given this specific family of training inputs* and not logistic regression problems in general. A simple experiment to prove the method works more generally would be to repeat the existing experiments, but where the test instances are drawn from a completely different distribution. It would be even more interesting to see how this changes as the test distribution deviates further from the training distribution.\n\nCan the authors comment on the choice of architecture used here? Why one layer with 50 hidden units and softplus activations specifically? Why not e.g., 100 units, 2 layers and ReLUs?\nPresumably this is to prevent overfitting, but given the limited capacity of the network, how do these results look when the dimensionality of the input space increases beyond 2 or 3?\n\nI would love to see what kind of policy the network learns on e.g., a 2D function using a contour plot. What do the steps look like on a random problem instance when compared to other hand-engineered optimizers?\n\nOverall I think this a really interesting paper with a great methodological contribution. My main concern is that the results may be oversold as the problems are still relatively simple and constrained. However, if the authors can demonstrate that this approach produces robust policies for a very general set of problems then that would be truly spectacular.\n\nMinor notes below.\n\nSection 3.1 should you be using \\pi_T^* to denote the optimal policy? You use \\pi_t^* and \\pi^* currently.\n\nAre the problems here considered noiseless? That is, is the state transition given an action deterministic? It would be very interesting to see this on noisy problems.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Optimize", "abstract": "Algorithm design is a laborious process and often requires many iterations of ideation and validation.

RL methods are designed to overcome the problem of compounding errors, which is characterized by the following phenomenon: once a policy encounters gradients that are dissimilar from those seen during training, the step vector it chooses becomes slightly off, causing the next iterate to become more dissimilar from those encountered during training, resulting in more dissimilar gradients. In other words, a policy trained in a supervised fashion often has difficulty in recovering from mistakes, which causes errors to compound over time and leads to divergence. On the other hand, a policy trained using RL learns how to compensate for errors introduced from earlier iterations. In our experience, policies trained using RL tend to be more stable and generalize better to new objective functions, which may induce gradients that have different statistics from those seen during training. \n\n(ii) This is an astute observation. Indeed, because the proposed framework uses RL, it can be extended to discrete action spaces. This could potentially enable us to learn more general optimization algorithms whose update rules contain discrete components. For example, we can learn a block coordinate descent algorithm, where the policy picks the coordinates to descend along, as well as the step that is used to update the coordinates.

If the number of objective functions is too few, the learned optimizer tends to overfit to the objective functions in the training set and does not generalize to new objective functions. If the objective functions correspond to loss functions for training a model, this means that the learned optimizer only learns how to train the model on tasks seen during training and does not learn how to train the model in general. \n\nThe improvement in generalization ability gained by increasing the number of objective functions in the training set gradually diminishes, so we picked a training set size for each family of objective functions that resulted in a learned optimizer that generalizes. We did not do a grid search over the training set size, so it is possible that a slightly smaller training set would still allow the learned optimizer to generalize. However, a much smaller training set than the ones we used results in an optimizer that fails to generalize. We found that using a bigger training set results in an optimizer that generalizes just as well, but not much better. \n\nBy \u201cdataset\u201d, I assume you mean a base-level dataset that defines a loss/objective function, rather than the meta-level dataset of loss/objective functions. It is conceptually somewhat tricky to use real datasets for training the optimizer, since a dataset corresponds to a *single* loss/objective function, and so we would need many diverse datasets to train an optimizer that can generalize. We are looking at collections of datasets that are suitable for this purpose and will explore this in future work.

The contribution of our paper is threefold:\n\n1) To propose learning the optimization algorithm instead of hand-engineering it, \n2) To cast this learning problem as an RL problem and introduce an RL-based formulation, and\n3) To demonstrate that it is possible to learn an optimization algorithm that is better than hand-engineered algorithms using an RL method. \n\nWe certainly intend to extend this approach in various ways, one of which is to handle higher-dimensional optimization problems, such as those encountered when training neural nets. There are straightforward simplifying assumptions one can make in such a setting, like imposing a block diagonal structure on the dynamics. However, in this initial paper, we wanted to keep the formulation as general as possible. We note that both low-dimensional and high-dimensional optimization problems are of interest for different communities. While high-dimensional problems often arise in ML, low-dimensional problems often arise in the natural and social sciences. We wrote this paper with a broad audience in mind and did not specialize to particular optimization problems (like optimizing neural nets), so that researchers in other fields can apply the proposed approach to the optimization problems they encounter. It is also worth noting that high-dimensional problems are also not necessarily harder; for example, in neural nets, it is known that there are more nearly equivalent local optima as the number of parameters increases. Consequently, finding one of these local optima may be easier in high dimensions. \n\nWe currently have four baselines: gradient descent, momentum, conjugate gradient and L-BFGS. We can include ADAM and RMSprop as well. \n\nAs noted previously, because we wanted keep the formulation general, we did not impose connectivity constraints/weight sharing on the architecture of the policy net. The proposed framework is flexible enough to allow for any desired architecture, and so it is certainly possible to use a convolutional and/or recurrent architecture to reduce the number of parameters in the policy net. The optimal architectural choice may depend on the particular optimization problem under consideration. We will explore different architectural choices for various optimization problems of interest in future work. \n\nAlso, we note that the time complexity of each step of the learned optimization algorithm is comparable to that of hand-engineered algorithms. Specifically, existing hand-engineered algorithms and the learned algorithm both take O(N) time to compute the step direction/vector. Because the learned algorithm converges faster, the overall time complexity of the learned algorithm may be lower. The space complexity of the learned optimization algorithm is also comparable, as existing hand-engineered algorithms and the learned algorithm both take O(N) space.

The number of parameters to be optimized is so small (only no more than 10). I suggest you evaluate your method on some standard datasets on middle or large scale network structures. Besides, other popular optimization algorithms, such as Adam, RMSprop, etc. should be compared. \n \nAnother point I was wondering is whether your method is suitable for practical use. Both the value and the gradient of the objective function at the most recent H steps (H=25 in the paper) are encoded as state space. Suppose that the dimension of the parameters to be optimized is N, the dimension of the state space would be (1+N)*H. Then they are fed to a one layer network with 50 hidden units to model the policy (\\pi), yielding N outputs to update parameters. But in practical scenario, the computational complexity and memory used for optimization algorithm should better not exceed the complexity of the training algorithm. Your policy network takes the gradients of all the parameters as input, which means policy network itself has more parameters to learn than the parameters of the problem of interest.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Optimize", "abstract": "Algorithm design is a laborious process and often requires many iterations of ideation and validation.
