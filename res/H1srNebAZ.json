The results seem like they may be very important. However, a few parts were poorly explained, which led to this reviewer being unable to follow some of the jumps from experimental results to their conclusions. I would like to be able to give this paper the higher score it may deserve, but some parts first need to be further explained.\n\nUnfortunately, the largest single confusion I had is on the first, most basic set of gradient results of section 4.1. Without understanding this first result, it\u2019s difficult to decide to what extent the rest of the paper\u2019s results are to be believed.\n\nFig 1 shows \u201cthe histograms of the average sign of partial derivatives of the loss with respect to activations, as collected over training for a random neuron in five different layers.\u201d Let\u2019s consider the top-left subplot of Fig 1, showing a heavily bimodal distribution (modes near -1 and +1.). Is this plot made using data from a single neuron or from  multiple neurons? For now let\u2019s assume it is for a single neuron, as the caption and text in 4.1 seem to suggest. If it is for a single neuron, then that neuron will have, for a single input example, a single scalar activation value and a single scalar gradient value. The sign of the gradient will either be +1 or -1. If we compute the sign for each input example and then AGGREGATE over all training examples seen by this neuron over the course of training (or a subset for computational reasons), this will give us a list of signs. Let\u2019s collect these signs into a long list: [+1, +1, +1, -1, +1, +1, \u2026]. Now what do we do with this list? As far as I can tell, we can either average it (giving, say, .85 if the list has far more +1 values than -1 values) OR we can show a histogram of the list, which would just be two bars at -1 and +1. But we can\u2019t do both, indicating that some assumption above was incorrect. Which assumption in reading the text was incorrect?\n\nFurther in this direction, Section 4.1 claims \u201cZero partial derivatives are ignored to make the signal more clear.\u201d Are these zero partial derivatives of the post-relu or pre-relu? The text (Sec 3) points to activations as being post-relu, but in this case zero-gradients should be a very small set (only occuring if all neurons on the next layer had either zero pre-relu gradients, which is common for individual neurons but, I would think, not for all at once). Or does this mean the pre-relu gradient is zero, e.g. the common case where the gradient is zeroed because the pre-activation was negative and the relu at that point has zero slope? In this case we would be excluding a large set (about half!) of the gradient values, and it didn\u2019t seem from the context in the paper that this would be desirable.\n\nIt would be great if the above could be addressed. Below are some less important comments.\n\nSec 5.1: great results!\n\nFig 3: This figure studies \u201cthe first and last layers of each network\u201d. Is the last layer really the last linear layer, the one followed by a softmax? In this case there is no relu and the 0 pre-activation is not meaningful (softmax is shift invariant). Or is the layer shown (e.g. \u201cstage3layer2\u201d) the penultimate layer? Minor: in this figure, it would be great if the plots could be labeled with which networks/datasets they are from.\n\nSec 5.2 states \u201cneuron partitions the inputs in two distinct but overlapping categories of quasi equal size.\u201d This experiment only shows that this is true in aggregate, not for specific neurons? I.e. the partition percent for each neuron could be sampled from U(45, 55) or from U(10, 90) and this experiment would not tell us which, correct? Perhaps this statement could be qualified.\n\nTable 1: \u201c52th percentile vs actual 53 percentile shown\u201d. \n\n> Table 1: The more fuzzy, the higher the percentile rank of the threshold\n\nThis is true for the CIFAR net but the opposite is true for ResNet, right?\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Discovering the mechanics of hidden neurons", "abstract": "Neural networks trained through stochastic gradient descent (SGD) have been around for more than 30 years, but they still escape our understanding.

I think some formal formulation and specific examples on the relevance of the partial derivative of the loss with respect to the activation of a unit will help to understand better the main idea of the paper. Also, quantitative figures would be useful to get the big picture. For example in Figures 1 and 2 the authors show the behavior of some specific units as examples, but it would be nice to see a graph showing quantitatively the behavior of all the units at each layer. It would be also useful to see a comparison of different CNNs and see how the observation holds more or less depending on the performance of the network.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Discovering the mechanics of hidden neurons", "abstract": "Neural networks trained through stochastic gradient descent (SGD) have been around for more than 30 years, but they still escape our understanding.

Here's part 1 of our answer.", "comment": "Thank you for your comments. We\u2019ve made our best to account for them in the revised version of our paper. Below, we present answers to your specific comments. Moreover, let us bring to your attention that changes have been made in section 4.1, clarifying greatly the experimental approach we used. More information about it can be found in our answers to reviewer 3.\n\n------\n- Could we look at the two distributions of inputs that each neuron tries to separate? \n------\n\nSince the distributions are determined by the sign of the loss function partial derivative (with respect to the neuron activation), the two distributions of inputs in one neuron are currently only available in layers close enough to the output layer, where the partial derivative sign remains constant along training. For such layers, we can get intuitions about the content of the distributions through the following reasoning (added as last paragraph of section 4.2):\nThe average sign of the loss function partial derivative with respect to the activation of a sample determines the category, and seems to be constant along training -at least for layers close to the output (Figure 1). Categories are thus mainly fixed by the initialization of the network's parameters. Moreover, the sign of the derivative signal is heavily conditioned on the class of the input. In particular, in neurons of the output layer, partial derivative signs only depend on the class label, and not on the input. Figure 8 in appendix shows that in dense2-relu, a class is in most cases either entirely present or absent of a category, and is only occasionally split across low and high categories. Category definition is thus approximately a selection of a random subset of classes, determined by the random initial parameters between the studied neuron and the output layer. \n\n------\n- Could we perform more extensive empirical study to substantiate the phenomenon here? Under which conditions do neurons behave like binary classifiers? (How are network width/depth, activation functions affect the results).\n------\n\nThank you for this suggestion. \nTo complete our empirical study, we have considered other activations than the ReLU one.  Networks with sigmoid and linear activations are now considered by our analysis (see Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4). As we expected, the results are the same, even with purely linear networks. This emphasizes a message that was not well enough explained in the original paper: the observations we make are not caused by the thresholding behaviour of activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid), but are deeply linked with the training dynamics of deep neural networks. This observation is now discussed in the last paragraph of section 5.2.\nRegarding the impact of the network architecture (width, depth, connectivity), note that it is reasonably explored in the original paper: the same conclusions emerge from a 512-wide two-layer MLP, from a 12-layer CNN with a width of up to 512 filters, and from a 50-layer ResNet with a width of up to 2048 filters."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Discovering the mechanics of hidden neurons", "abstract": "Neural networks trained through stochastic gradient descent (SGD) have been around for more than 30 years, but they still escape our understanding.

Analyzing the Performance of Multilayer Neural Networks for Object Recognition. 2014\n------\n\nThanks for pointing out this reference. \nWe were not aware of it and will add it in the related work section of our paper. We however consider that our paper brings contributions and makes observations that are different or that significantly complement the ones made by Argawal et al. Argawal et al. analyze the properties of features/activations in a transfer learning framework. In relation with our contribution, Section 5.1 of their paper shows that the binarization of the activation at ReLU threshold (at 0) doesn\u2019t hurt performance on the new task. The claims of our paper go way beyond this observation. We hope that the new version of our paper makes them clearer. Two main differences are as follows:\n\n- Argawal et al. binarize the activations in a very simple manner: according to the threshold of the activation function. In our paper, we show that they missed a key insight: the binary behaviour of features/activation is not related to the thresholding nature of activation functions. The reality is much more subtle: the binary behaviour is deeply linked with the SGD training dynamics of deep networks (whatever their activation function), and the partition threshold systematically lies around 50 percentile rank (and not around the arbitrary zero ReLU threshold). This observation about the partition threshold directly emerges from the comparison between the clear pattern of Figure 4 and the much noisier position of ReLU thresholds (Figure 3 or Table 1). This claim is now made even stronger by our experiments with a linear CNN, without any ReLU (or activation function related) thresholding. Our observations are thus much stronger and unexpected than the one from Argawal et al.\n\n- The dynamics of training are not explored at all in Argawal et al. Our paper shows, for the first time, that the dynamics in neurons that are close enough to the output adopt the ones from binary classifiers. While restricted to a subset of layers (i.e. the ones that are sufficiently close to the output), the simplicity of the dynamics is unexpected, and even appears in MLP networks that have been around for more than 30 years. Moreover, it is possible that similar behaviour appears in early layers, but is hidden by unnecessary noise in the backpropagated gradients. Verifying this hypothesis requires further investigations, but our work makes a first step towards a broader characterization of training dynamics.\n\nWe\u2019ve added a short discussion on the relation of our work with Argawal et al. in the Related work section (Section 2, end of second paragraph) which is further discussed in the last paragraph of section 5.2."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Discovering the mechanics of hidden neurons", "abstract": "Neural networks trained through stochastic gradient descent (SGD) have been around for more than 30 years, but they still escape our understanding.

We hope that it makes clear that our paper provides original work compared to them.\nOn the other hand, the only common point between Tishby et al. and our work lies in the fact that both works analyze the regularity of gradients during training. However, like our paper specifies, \u201cwhile these works (including Tishby et al.) focus on the gradients with respect to parameters on a batch of samples, we analyze the gradients with respect to activations on single samples. This difference of perspective is crucial for the understanding of the representation learned by a neuron, and is a key aspect of our paper.\u201d With Tishby et al.\u2019s results, it is impossible to make a link between hidden neurons and binary classification of individual samples, which is the core observation of our paper.\n\n------\n+ Significance:\nWhile the results are interesting, the contribution is not significant as the paper misses an important explanation for the phenomenon.

The fact that the design and intuitions behind our experiments are not trivial and presenting them is already a challenge makes us believe it deserves to be presented to the community and discussed in an interactive manner. To emphasize the research directions that emerge from our observations, we have updated the \u2018Discussion and future work\u2019 section of our paper.

Thanks to the reviews and comments, we\u2019ve noticed that indeed, some parts were not explained clearly enough, and we have done our best to clarify these in the new version.\n\nThe link with interpretability of neurons is that both works try to understand the role of a neuron inside a neural network. Our approach, however, is different. As stated in the related work section, \u201cour paper leaves interpretability behind, but provides experiments for the validation of a complete description of the encoding of information in any neuron.\u201d Our discussion and future work section emphasizes the impact of our observations on neuron interpretability.\n\nWe modified the text to make it explicit when the activation of a single sample is considered (in contrast to the average on a mini-batch). This implies replacing \u2018the partial derivative of the loss with respect to the activation\u2019 by \u2018the partial derivative of the loss with respect to the activation OF ONE SAMPLE\u2019. While clear in our mind, we now noticed that our initial phrasing was confusing (see also our answer to reviewer 3). We hope that the new version of section 4.1 makes the relevance of the recorded partial derivatives more clear.\n\nWe\u2019ve added quantitative figures aggregating all neurons of a layer. It reveals that the aggregate behavior follows the same pattern than the examples provided in Figure 1. Due to space limitations, we\u2019ve added the new figures to the appendix. Finally, we\u2019ve also added experiments with sigmoid activation function and purely linear networks, revealing the same behaviour.\n\nWe\u2019ve made efforts to reduce the length of the paper (i.e. removing section about ReLU analysis). However, due to the addition of new figures and comments requested by the reviewers, the number of pages has increased in the new version.

Is the last layer really the last linear layer, the one followed by a softmax? In this case there is no relu and the 0 pre-activation is not meaningful (softmax is shift invariant). Or is the layer shown (e.g. \u201cstage3layer2\u201d) the penultimate layer? Minor: in this figure, it would be great if the plots could be labeled with which networks/datasets they are from.\n--------\n\nPenultimate, indeed. It was changed in the paper + we added dataset information to the plot captions\n\n--------\nSec 5.2 states \u201cneuron partitions the inputs in two distinct but overlapping categories of quasi equal size.\u201d This experiment only shows that this is true in aggregate, not for specific neurons? I.e. the partition percent for each neuron could be sampled from U(45, 55) or from U(10, 90) and this experiment would not tell us which, correct? Perhaps this statement could be qualified.\n--------\n\nIndeed, some form of aggregation is done over neurons. The fact that a window centered around percentile rank 50 does not provide random predictions indicates that the percentile at which the two distributions cross each other changes across neurons, as explained in the paper: \u201cWhile the partitions separate the inputs in equally sized categories on average, the size of the categories varies across neurons and is not exactly 50%, which explains the fact that a window center at the 50th percentile does not induce random predictions.\u201d\nHowever, we keep some resolution about the position of the partition thresholds. In the example given in the comment, since \u201cthe performance should decrease when the window is located in fuzzy regions\u201d, if the performance is lower for a (45-55) window, than for a (80-90) window, this means that the binary encoding is on average (across all neurons) more fuzzy in (45-55) window than in (80-90). It is thus more likely that the separation points between the categories are sampled from U(45,55), rather than from U(10,90).\nWe hope that this answers the doubts of the reviewer, and are open to any further discussion. \n\n--------\nTable 1: \u201c52th percentile vs actual 53 percentile shown\u201d. \n--------\n\nIndeed. Thanks!\n\n--------\n> Table 1: The more fuzzy, the higher the percentile rank of the threshold\nThis is true for the CIFAR net but the opposite is true for ResNet, right?\n--------\n\nOur statement is not based on the comparison of ReLU thresholds inside the same network (cifar CNN or ResNet), but across networks. Specifically, we have compared the ReLU thresholds for the penultimate layer in cifar CNN and in ResNet. In both networks, those thresholds correspond to similar percentile ranks for all neurons, indicating convergence to a precise value. Moreover, we observe that this percentile value is larger for ResNet than for the cifar CNN (84% vs 53%). Since ImageNet is a more complicated task, leading to fuzzier intermediate representations (see Figure 4), we state that \u201cthe more fuzzy, the higher the percentile rank of the threshold\u201d. This statement is however not sufficiently supported by experimental evidences to lead to a definitive conclusion. We have decided to remove the ReLU analysis section (previously section 5.3), since it didn\u2019t provide enough conclusive elements.

Here is part 1 of our answer.", "comment": "Thank you very much for these encouraging and involved comments. We\u2019ve done our best to answer them appropriately, and are looking forward to your feedback.\n\n--------\nFig 1 shows \u201cthe histograms of the average sign of partial derivatives of the loss with respect to activations, as collected over training for a random neuron in five different layers.\u201d Let\u2019s consider the top-left subplot of Fig 1, showing a heavily bimodal distribution (modes near -1 and +1.)....\n... As far as I can tell, we can either average it (giving, say, .85 if the list has far more +1 values than -1 values) OR we can show a histogram of the list, which would just be two bars at -1 and +1. But we can\u2019t do both, indicating that some assumption above was incorrect. Which assumption in reading the text was incorrect?\n--------\n\nThanks for your comment, which reveals a lack of clarity in our explanation. When analyzing the derivatives, we treat two dimensions separately: input samples and training step. When recording the partial derivatives of an activation, we keep track of both dimensions, such that we can easily access the derivative signs of the activation of a single sample across the training procedure. To create the histograms of figure 1, we first compute, for each individual sample separately, the average of the derivative signs over all the recorded training steps. This tells us whether an increased activation generally benefits (negative average) or penalizes (positive average) the classification of this sample. To extend the analysis to all samples, the histogram of average signs of derivatives (one scalar per sample) is plotted over all input samples. \n\nWhen reading the manuscript at the light of your comment, we have observed that the confusion is largely induced by the fact that we generally use the term \u2018activation\u2019 to refer to the \u2018activation of a single sample\u2019. Example:\nWhat we have written: \u201cIn particular, we observe that an activation is pushed in the same direction throughout nearly all the training: either up or down\u201d\nWhat we had in mind: \u201cIn particular, we observe that the activation OF A SAMPLE is pushed in the same direction throughout nearly all the training: either up or down\u201d\nSimilarly, when talking about \u201cthe average sign of partial derivatives with respect to an activation\u201d, we had in mind \u201cthe average sign of partial derivatives with respect the activation of a sample\u201d\nThe revised version is much clearer in this regard.\n\n--------\nFurther in this direction, Section 4.1 claims \u201cZero partial derivatives are ignored to make the signal more clear.\u201d Are these zero partial derivatives of the post-relu or pre-relu? The text (Sec 3) points to activations as being post-relu, but in this case zero-gradients should be a very small set (only occuring if all neurons on the next layer had either zero pre-relu gradients, which is common for individual neurons but, I would think, not for all at once). Or does this mean the pre-relu gradient is zero, e.g. the common case where the gradient is zeroed because the pre-activation was negative and the relu at that point has zero slope? In this case we would be excluding a large set (about half!) of the gradient values, and it didn\u2019t seem from the context in the paper that this would be desirable.\n--------\n\nWe indeed analyze post-relu derivatives. Zero derivatives actually emerge for a sample when it is well classified, making the gradients too small to be handled by the float32 precision (smallest number is 1.19209e-07). Since the notion of sign is not relevant anymore for zero values, we compute the average of partial derivative signs for a sample only over the training steps for which the partial derivative is non-zero. We have made the reasoning explicit in the paper! Thanks for pointing it out.\n\nIn particular, the first paragraph of section 4.1 has been revised to account for your first two questions:\n\u201cWe proceed to a standard training of the cifar CNN and the MNIST MLP networks until convergence. During training, but in a separate process, we record the gradient of the loss with respect to the activations of each input on a regular basis (every 100 batches for cifar and every 10 batches for MNIST, leading to 1600 and 2350 recordings respectively). Measures were only performed on a random subset of neurons and samples due to memory limitations (see Appendix for more details). For each (input sample, neuron) pair, we compute the average sign of the partial derivatives with respect to the corresponding activation, as recorded at the different training steps. This value tells us whether an increased activation generally benefits (negative average) or penalizes (positive average) the classification of the sample. Due to the use of float32 precision, zero partial derivatives appear at some point in training when the sample is correctly classified, making the gradient very small. Since the signs of these values are not relevant, they are ignored when the average sign is calculated.\u201d\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Discovering the mechanics of hidden neurons", "abstract": "Neural networks trained through stochastic gradient descent (SGD) have been around for more than 30 years, but they still escape our understanding.

These observations bring to light some of the core internal mechanics of deep neural networks, and have the potential to guide the next theoretical and practical developments.", "pdf": "/pdf/ca36244900d5dbd718b5cba941a19001cf6bc119.pdf", "TL;DR": "We report experiments providing strong evidence that a neuron behaves like a binary classifier during training and testing", "paperhash": "carbonnelle|discovering_the_mechanics_of_hidden_neurons", "_bibtex": "@misc{\ncarbonnelle2018discovering,\ntitle={Discovering the mechanics of hidden neurons},\nauthor={Simon Carbonnelle and Christophe De Vleeschouwer},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1srNebAZ},\n}", "keywords": ["deep learning", "experimental analysis", "hidden neurons"], "authors": ["Simon Carbonnelle", "Christophe De Vleeschouwer"], "authorids": ["simon.carbonnelle@uclouvain.be", "christophe.devleeschouwer@uclouvain.be"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "duedate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "tmdate": 1512791683788, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper576/Public_Comment", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["~"], "reply": {"replyto": null, "forum": "H1srNebAZ", "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*|\\(anonymous\\)"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*|\\(anonymous\\)", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "value-dropdown": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Authors_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Reviewers_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Area_Chairs_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 0, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper576/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper576/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper576/Area_Chair"], "cdate": 1512791683788}}}], "count": 13}
