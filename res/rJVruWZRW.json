The connections are also gated by using a simple gating mechanism. The authors very briefly discusses about the effect of these on the dynamics of the learning. They report results on PTB character-level language modelling task.\n\n\nQuestions:\nWhat is the computational complexity of this approach compared to a vanilla RNN architecture?\nWhat is the implications of these skip connections in terms of memory consumption during BPTT?\nDid you use gradient clipping and have you used any specific type of initialization for the parameters?\nHow would this approach would compare against the Clockwork RNNs which has a block-diagonal weight matrices? [1]\nHow would dense-RNNs compare against to the MANNs [2]?\nHow would you implement this model efficiently?\n\nPros:\nInteresting idea.\nCons:\nLack of experiments and empirical results supporting the arguments.\nHand-wavy theory.\nLack of references to the relevant literature. \n\nGeneral Comments:\nIn general the paper is relatively well written despite having some minor typos. The idea is interesting, however the experiments in this paper is seriously lacking. The only results presented in this paper is on PTB. The results are quite behind the SOTA and PTB is a really tiny, toyish language modeling task. The theory is very hand-wavy, the connections to the previous attempts to come up with related properties of the recurrent models should be cited. The Figure 2 is very related to the Gersgorin circle theorem in [3]. The discussion about the skip-connections is very related to the results in [2]. \n\nOverall, I think this paper is rushed and not ready for the publication.\n\n[1] Koutnik, J., Greff, K., Gomez, F., & Schmidhuber, J.

And doubling recurrent depth is more efficient than doubling of hidden size with same factor. \n\nQ. What is the implications of these skip connections in terms of memory consumption during BPTT? \n\nA. If there is no skip connections, the gradients have to flow with stopping by every hidden states, it makes the parameters being vanished or exploded. The skip connections make the gradients pass the less number of hidden states, it alleviates the vanishing gradient or exploding gradient problems. \n\nQ. Did you use gradient clipping and have you used any specific type of initialization for the parameters? \n\nA. We used gradient clipping with the value 5. We used stochastic gradient optimizer with sceduling the learning rate.\n\nQ. How would this approach compare against the Clockwork RNNs which has a block-diagonal weight matrices?\n\nA. In clockwork RNN, the hidden states are divided into multiple sub-modules, which act with different periods to capture multiple timescales. In dense RNN, all previous states within recurrent depth affect current hidden state every time step. The periods underlying the sequences are automatically selected using the attention gate in dense RNN. In summary, clockwork RNN pre-defines the frequency to capture from the sequence and dense RNN learns the frequency using the attention gate. \n\nQ. [1] How would dense-RNNs compare against to the MANNs [2]? \n\nA. All previous states within the recurrent depth don't always affect the next state. Thus, MANN uses the memory to remember previous states and retrieve some of previous states if necessary. This is similar concept. However, the MANN has only connections between same layers. \n\nQ. How would you implement this model efficiently? \n\nA. In equation (12), there are many weight multiplication. As the number of weight multiplication increases, slower the calculation speed is. \n\nIn theoretical analysis, we analyzed using Gersgorin circle theorem similar to the paper \"Recurrent Highway Network\". \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dense Recurrent Neural Network with Attention Gate", "abstract": "We propose the dense RNN, which has the fully connections from each hidden state to multiple preceding hidden states of all layers directly.
