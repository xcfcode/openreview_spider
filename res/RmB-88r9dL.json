Basically, the idea is to emphasize the importance of the intervention variable by ensuring that it appears not just in every layer but also in every neural of a neural network.  \n\nReviewers mostly agree that this is a good paper with varying degrees, although there are some criticisms on e.g., assuming away the confounders.  However, I believe the authors address the criticisms of R4 satisfactorily. \n\nOverall I find the idea new and interesting and the experimental results strong, hence I happily recommend accepting the paper.\n\nI do have a few quips myself and some comments that may help the authors to further improve the paper.\n\n1. Re: the design that models each parameter as a spline. \nThis is equivalent to introducing additional parameters (coefficients for spline basis) and adding a fixed linear layer (spline basis themselves) to every layer of the neural networks. t is taken as an input in all layers thus it makes sure that the model prioritizes on learning the impact of t. \n\n2. If you use a B-spline basis (that comes with kernels of bounded support), then the proposed method is very similar to stratifying the data according to different bins of t, and then fitting a separate model for each t. The only difference is that the different bins are now smooth kernels and they overlap somewhat. As a side note,  the authors should clearly write out how they are choosing the knots to specify the basis functions. Otherwise the paper will not be reproducible. \n\n3. I am not sure how this method would compare to naive (non-deep) baselines. Maybe this was considered in a prior work? If not, then I tend to side with Reviewer 4 that the evaluations are mostly ablation studies and they are not really comparing to representative work in this domain. Given that there is a large body of work on this before deep learning takes over, it is important to somehow compare with the right baselines.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "VCNet and Functional Targeted Regularization For Learning Causal Effects of Continuous Treatments", "authorids": ["lizhen@uchicago.edu", "~Mao_Ye11", "~qiang_liu4", "nicolae@galton.uchicago.edu"], "authors": ["Lizhen Nie", "Mao Ye", "qiang liu", "Dan Nicolae"], "keywords": ["causal inference", "continuous treatment effect", "doubly robustness"], "abstract": "Motivated by the rising abundance of observational data with continuous treatments, we investigate the problem of estimating the average dose-response curve (ADRF).

Only two baselines are compared with the proposed method. Also the sufficient theoretical discussion is given which however is mainly about the doubly robust estimators. But the design of VCnet needs the numerical results to confirm its effectiveness for ADRF.\n\n**A3**:\nWe respectfully disagree with the noted lack of experimental results.\n\nFirst of all, there are more than two baselines. We improve the estimation of ADRF in two-fold: better architecture and functional targeted regularization. And thus our baselines are previous architectures and different methods for estimation (naive, doubly robust, TMLE). Table 1 can be read both column-wise and row-wise and thus there are altogether 3*4=12 methods implemented for each dataset. In Table 1, each row compares the performance of different versions of estimators under the same architecture, and each column compares the performance of different architectures under the same version of estimator. Besides, the compared architectures are sota for treatment effect estimation.\n\nSecondly, our experiment exactly gives numerical results to confirm the effectiveness of VCNet for estimating ADRF. Every column of Table 1 compares the performance of VCNet against the old architecture in estimating ADRF while holding everything else the same, i.e., the only thing that changes within each column is the network structure. Thus, by comparing within each column of Table 1, we see that VCNet improves over the old network architectures in all three datasets. Besides, our design of experiment also shows that VCNet improves previous architectures for all versions of estimators (by looking at all columns in the table). We believe the current result is sufficient to show the effectiveness of VCNet.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Claudia Shi, David Blei, and Victor Veitch.

Below please find our response. We hope that our responses to your concerns will increase your enthusiasm for our paper. If you believe we haven\u2019t addressed all your concerns, we look forward to further discussions with you.\n\n**Q1**:\nThe author claimed that confounder is one challenge for treatment effect estimation. Some existing deep learning methods resort to balanced learning or reweighting. For the continuous treatment, how the proposed method addresses the confounder factors?\n\n**A1**:\nFirst, we assume there are no unobserved confounders. Under assumption 1, our method is based on the following expression of ADRF: $\\psi(t)=\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{X}}[\\mu(\\boldsymbol{X},t)]$. Notice that the above expectation is taken with respect to the marginal distribution of $X$.\nThis implies that a naive method to estimate ADRF is to obtain an estimator $\\hat\\mu$ for $\\mu(\\boldsymbol{x},t)=E(Y|\\boldsymbol{X}=\\boldsymbol{x},T=t)$ and then use \n\n$\\hat\\psi(t)=1/n\\sum_{i=1}^n\\hat\\mu(\\boldsymbol{x}_i,t)$ \n\nas the estimator for $\\psi(t)$. Here estimating $\\mu=E(Y|\\boldsymbol{X},T)$ does not require reweighting, which is also a common practice in previous literature, see, for example [1, 2]. And since we are directly using the empirical marginal distribution of $X$ (to approximate the population marginal distribution of $X$), reweighting is also not needed. We refer Reviewer 1 to Section 2 and the first paragraph of Section 3 of the main text for more details.\n\n**Q2**:\nAnother big concern is the varying coefficient neural network. Why the VCNet designed to be dependent of treatment information? The dependence is not theoretically discussed in this paper.\n\n**A2**: \nWe are not sure whether we correctly understand your concern on \u2018Why the VCNet designed to be dependent on treatment information\u2019. We believe you inquire why we make the parameters of the network depend on treatment.\nThe treatment is an input to the network but it is put in a special position. The reason we make it special is to prevent it from being lost in high dimensional latent representations as discussed in [3], which also motivates previous network structures such as [1] and [2].  Please note that, as discussed in the last paragraph of Section 3.1 in the main text, the previous structure can also be viewed as VCNet in which the parameters of the network also depend on the treatment. The difference with the proposed VCNet is that they use a suboptimal choice of spline basis, which breaks the continuity structure of ADRF. So if previous lines of work on network structure make sense, we believe the proposed VCNet should also do.\n\nIn terms of a theoretical justification, as discussed in paragraph 3 of introduction and Fig 1 in the original version of the submission, we believe one theoretical advantage of VCNet is that it takes the continuity of ADRF into modeling and thus produces better estimators in practice. In terms of more comprehensive theoretical analysis on why architecture A is better than B, as far as we know, there are no mathematical tools to theoretically study it at the current stage. For example, there are various building blocks proposed in the CV and NLP area but current theoretical tools could not explain why a certain building block is better than another.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2143/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2143/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "VCNet and Functional Targeted Regularization For Learning Causal Effects of Continuous Treatments", "authorids": ["lizhen@uchicago.edu", "~Mao_Ye11", "~qiang_liu4", "nicolae@galton.uchicago.edu"], "authors": ["Lizhen Nie", "Mao Ye", "qiang liu", "Dan Nicolae"], "keywords": ["causal inference", "continuous treatment effect", "doubly robustness"], "abstract": "Motivated by the rising abundance of observational data with continuous treatments, we investigate the problem of estimating the average dose-response curve (ADRF).

This paper is well-written, however, I still have some concerns about the contributions. \n1.\tThe author claimed that confounder is one challenge for treatment effect estimation. Some existing deep learning methods resort to balanced learning or reweighting. For the continuous treatment, how the proposed method addresses the confounder factors?\n2.\tAnother big concern is the varing coefficient neural network. Why the VCnet designed to be dependent of treatment information? The dependence is not theoretically discussed in this paper.\n3.\tThe experimental results are not convincing for me. Only two baselines are compared with the proposed method. Also the sufficient theoretical discussion is given which however is mainly about the doubly robust estimators. But the design of VCnet needs the numerical results to confirm its effectiveness for ADRF.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2143/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2143/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "VCNet and Functional Targeted Regularization For Learning Causal Effects of Continuous Treatments", "authorids": ["lizhen@uchicago.edu", "~Mao_Ye11", "~qiang_liu4", "nicolae@galton.uchicago.edu"], "authors": ["Lizhen Nie", "Mao Ye", "qiang liu", "Dan Nicolae"], "keywords": ["causal inference", "continuous treatment effect", "doubly robustness"], "abstract": "Motivated by the rising abundance of observational data with continuous treatments, we investigate the problem of estimating the average dose-response curve (ADRF).
