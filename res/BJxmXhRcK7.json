We provide totally different perspective of our contribution and novelty.  Please give us one more opportunity by reading the following explanation:\n\n1 ''(1) Novelty is somewhat limited and incremental.''\nThe most significant novelty of our paper is the information sharing mechanisim in deep multitask learning. A major challenging problem in all existing deep multitask learning methods is that they cannot handle heterogeneous dataset and neural network structure (i.e., different dimensions of inputs and all layers) corresponding to the different tasks.  Our method solves this problem by using tensor ring representation of model parameters and then information sharing on the latent space.  As a consequence, our method can also provide more refined control of how much information to be shared and much reduction of model complexity. Therefore, as compared to the existing methods, our method is more effective, efficient, and flexible. \n\n\n2 ''Experimental validation should be performed on a large-scale dataset ...''\nThe contribution of this paper is not applicability in large-scale data and reduction of parameters by using TT/TR.  We discovered another totally different advantages by using TT/TR in deep multi-task learning, which is the refined information sharing control over the latent space rather than the hard-sharing and soft-sharing mechanism. Then we can control how much information is shared between each task in more detailed scales. \n\n\n3  ''Hyper-parameter sensitivity is a crucial issue.''\nIn hard-sharing method,  one hyper-parameter is the number of shared layers. In soft-sharing method, one hyperparameter is the penalty weight of regularization or the rank of task mode factor. As compared to existing deep multi-task learning method, our method also has only one hyperparameter that is how many cores are shared. Therefore, our method does not introduce more hyper-parameters.  \n\nTT/TR is sensitive to the hyper-parameters, because their methods try to find the optimal balance between compression and performance. However, in this paper, we do not focus on the compression ability. We try to achieve the optimal performance when using information sharing on latent space. Thus, we usually fixed the TT/TR ranks to have sufficient representation ability, for example it can be the upper bound of TT/TR ranks. \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1344/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1344/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1344/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "TENSOR RING NETS ADAPTED DEEP MULTI-TASK LEARNING", "abstract": "Recent deep multi-task learning (MTL) has been witnessed its success in alleviating data scarcity of some task by utilizing domain-specific knowledge from related tasks.

However, we like to emphasize that there are four major types of generalizations from DMTRL to our TRMTL. (Please see Section 2). Our TRMTL indeed generalizes or subsumes DMTRL-Tucker in terms of the first three types/aspects, no matter what tensor format (TT or Tucker) DMTRL may use.\n\n\u201cTR-ranks are usually smaller than TT-ranks\u2019\u2019 is presented in tensor preliminaries section just as background knowledge. Besides, this property has already been verified in papers [Zhao16,17], which we added the citation. Verifying this property is not the focus and the objective of our work. \n\n7. ''2.3 Sentences are taken verbatim from other papers, plagiarism. For example: \u201cTR model \u2026 \u2018' \nWe respectfully disagree with the Reviewer that it seems several 'Sentences are taken verbatim from other papers\u2019, and this is clearly not the case. \nOnly in the sentence 'TR model is more flexible than \u2026 ', we use the original expression for the purpose of exactly expressing the meaning that [Zhao16] wants to express in their paper. This sentence is written in the tensor preliminaries section and we added [Zhao16] as citation in that section. However, it would be better if we should have used our own words.\n\n8. \u201c3. Hyperparameters: This paper apparently gains some practical benefit \u2026\u201d\nWe respectfully disagree with the Reviewer. Our TRMTL can effectively deal with all major challenges of current deep MTL. The benefits of TRMTL can totally compensate for the downside of the introduction of the parameter of \u2018c\u2019. Besides, tuning one or two hyper-parameters is quite common in deep learning research. In practical, by using some heuristics, e.g. choosing the right sharing styles such as \u2018bottom-heavy', the searching space of \u2018c' can be greatly reduced. We may also employ a greedy search on \u2018c\u2019 layer by layer, which is much easier for tuning \u2018c\u2019.\n\n9. \u201c4. Hyperparameters+Tuning: Hyperparameters Private proportion \u2026\"  \nWe disagree with the Reviewers that the better performance is because of the additional tuning. In our experiment, the i/o dimension of tensorization is pre-fixed, and the location/order in which the cores of each task are arranged is also pre-fixed. We even tried empirically fixing the TR-ranks and also got fairly good performance. Besides TR-ranks, only the sharing portion \u2018c\u2019 is left to tune. If we are allowed to tune all above hyper-parameters, (a.k.a all the potential flexibility of our method is fulfilled), our performance would be much better than we reported in the paper.\n\nRegarding \u201cWe test different ... with the best accuracies\u201d, the writhing should have been more accurate, we meant that the \u2018c\u2019 is turned, and the best accuracies is reported w.r.t only to this \u2018c\u2019.\n\n10. \u201c5. Insight & Analysis. All the core selection & public/private core selection \u2026\" \nWe respectfully disagree that the core selection are treated as black box optimization. Some insights about the cores selection are shown in our experiments. In MNIST experiment of previous version, Figure 3 demonstrates that the styles of sharing pattern have significant impact on the performance. Within different style categories, our model is very robust to \u2018c\u2019 for the pattern selection. For example, in Table 1, both \u2018410\u2019 and \u2018420\u2019 obtain the similarly good performance, which means small variation in \u2018c\u2019 does not affect a lot on performance, if the right style category is determined. Also In CIFAR experiment, in Table 2, both good patterns \u20184421\u2019 and \u20184431\u2019 belong to \u2019bottom-heavy\u2019 category and achieve similarly good accuracies, but clearly outperform the bad pattern \u20184444\u2019 which belongs to the \u2018balanced\u2019 style category. Some remarks/strategy on core selection are also provided in the revised version, please see Section 4.3 for details.

''Novelty. Existing studies already established the template of different tensor \u2026\u2019'  \nWe respectfully disagree with the Reviewer on this comment. Firstly, to the best of our knowledge, DMTRL is the only framework integrates tensor factorization (TT, Tucker) into deep MTL but with a highly restricted soft-sharing mechanism. Secondly, there is no any good solution or template to plug tensor factorization into different kinds of soft-sharing deep MTL. Most importantly, three major challenges posed by deep MTL remain largely unsolved, which includes: 1) the ineffectiveness of knowledge sharing mechanism; 2) the inefficiency of size of parameters for deep MTL model; 3) the inflexibility of network architectures to handle heterogeneous features and inputs. None of existing deep MTL models (especially DMTRL) can well handle all above difficulties. \n\nOur incorporation of TR into deep MTL serves for special purposes:  1) flexible/finer granularity of knowledge sharing (via tensorization); 2) higher compression ratio of deep MTL model sizes;  3) a generalized expressivity power (of TT);  4) better performance.\n\nThis is why we come up TRMTL, the main novelty/significance of which is that we propose a totally new generalized, highly flexible and latent-subspace knowledge sharing framework that can effectively address all these challenges. It should be noted that by simply combining DMTRL template (A) and TR-format (B), it cannot achieve such goals. \n\n2. ''2.1.1 Paper claims the benefit that each task can have its own I/O dimensionality \u2026\u2019' \nWe agree that the explanation should be more clear. The benefit/flexibility of our TRMTL for heterogenous inputs mainly comes from our proposed architecture and sharing mechanisms, not due to the TR format. In fact, our framework can accommodate more generalized tensor network formats including TT or TR as a special case.\n\n3. ''2.1.2 Paper claims favourable ability to use more private cores than TT \u2026\u2019'  \nThe Reviewer has a misunderstanding about our framework, especially the relations between DMTRL and our TRMTL (Please refer to Section 2 in the revised paper for details). DMTRL has to stack up all the equal-sized weights from different tasks, and hence has the \u2018task\u2019 axis.  In contrast, our TRMTL decomposes each task's own weight individually, then any subset of the cores can be shared among tasks. Therefore, it is not correct to say that TRMTL shares one core at default because our method is even possible to sharing zero core, and there is no such \u2019task\u2019 axis involved. \n\nOur framework is so generalized that TT or other tensor network can also be subsumed into our architecture. However, using TR instead of TT does bring benefits which are very preferable by our framework, e.g., higher compression ratio (lower overall-ranks via tensorization) of TR allows for the sharing among more compact (smaller-sized) cores, which has a big impact on parameter complexity for deep MTL models.\n\n4. ''2.1.3 Statement \u201cTRMTL generalizes to allow the layer-wise weight \u2026 \u2018\u2019 \nThe sentence should have been more clear. We meant to say that our TRMTL framework generalizes DMTRL in terms of 4 major aspects. (Please see Section 2 in revised version), and one aspect of generalization is that TRMTL firstly tensorizes the weight into a much higher order weight tensor before factorizing it (In DMTRL paper, they did not employ tensorization). By doing so, the weight can be factorized into more cores than of just 3 cores for MLP (or 5 cores for CNN ) in DMTRL. \n\n5. \u201c2.1.4 Statements like \u201cTR enjoys the property of circular dimensional permutation \u2026\"  \nWe present the 'circular dimensional permutation invariance\u2019 property only in tensor preliminaries (Section 3). This property is one advantage of TR over TT,  and we introduce this only as a background knowledge, which is not related to our current work.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1344/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1344/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1344/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "TENSOR RING NETS ADAPTED DEEP MULTI-TASK LEARNING", "abstract": "Recent deep multi-task learning (MTL) has been witnessed its success in alleviating data scarcity of some task by utilizing domain-specific knowledge from related tasks.

''As to my knowledge ... it's a very \"simple\u201d extension\u2019\u2019\u00a0\nWe thank the Reviewer for pointing out our main contribution that we propose a new generalized highly flexible latent-subspace based knowledge sharing mechanism.\u00a0\nThere are major challenges in deep MTL that remains largely unaddressed:\u00a0 1) the ineffectiveness of knowledge sharing mechanism\u00a0 2) the inefficiency of size of parameters for deep MTL model\u00a0 3) the inflexibility of network architectures to handle heterogeneous features and inputs.\u00a0\nAlthough DMTRL has used TT/Tucker factorization, their model is rather restricted and unable to solve these issues. None of existing deep MTL models can well handle these difficulties (please see the revised paper for details ). Our extension looks 'simple' but is essentially nontrivial, because by using the proposed architecture, we can provide a fairly nice solution to all three major challenges.\n\n2. ''Though authors called ... is just an indexing scheme so essentially the same idea of TR.\u2019'\u00a0\nWe agree with the Reviewer that TRL is based on and very similar to TR, but we respectfully disagree that TRL is simply an indexing scheme. The reasons are described as follows.\nTensorization ('indexing scheme') in TRL plays a key role in our proposed sharing mechanism. Due to the tensorization, we can share the cores in a much finer granularity. Moreover, tensorization in TRL can lead to more compact tensor network representation (with lower ranks), and thus a higher compression ratio for the parameters. (please see section 5.1 in the revised version for the comparison of model complexity, where DMTRL without tensoriztion versus ours with tensorization)\n\n3. ''I wonder why ... looks very out of the place discussion.\u2019'\u00a0\nWe mention this because this is variant of TRL for CNN setting, since in our experiments, we share the filters/kernels (itself is a 4th order tensor H x W x U x V) in CNN instead of sharing weight matrices in MLP between tasks. The two sharing settings are essentially the same but with slightly different formulation.\n\u2028\n4. ''I suggest ...make the shareable cores not adjacent in Eq. (4) as they claimed\u2019\u2019\u00a0\n\u00a0We thank the Reviewer for the nice suggestion, which is much better to make sharable cores not adjacent, we have updated it in the received version.\n\u2028\n5. ''The experiments are somewhat ''simplistic\" \u2026\u2019' \u00a0\nWe agree with the Reviewer that more experiments should be done on larger dataset, e.g. Taskonomy data. The Taskonomy data is somewhat huge and we have some difficulty to get access to it during this rebuttal, but we will try to add it in the next version. However, in this revised version, we have conducted more experiments to further validate the merits of our TRMTL. In section 5.3, we have tested on tasks with heterogeneous input dimensions. In section 5.4, we applied our method to multiple datasets settings, where tasks could be loosely related.\u00a0\n\u2028\n6. ''Can the authors comment on the number of parameters used?\u2019'\u00a0\nWe reports the number of parameters for different models in section 5.1 to demonstrate the compactness of our model. Overall, STL (6060K) has enormous parameters; MRN (3096K) have huge number of parameters, since they share weights in the original space. DMTRL Tucker (1194K) and TT (1522K) also have large parameters as models does not employ tensorization and just decomposes the stacked weight tensor of original order. In contrast, our TRMTL only uses 13K parameters, which is about 100 times fewer than DMTRL. Our model first tensorizes the weight into a much higher order tensor before factorizing it. By doing so, the weights can be represented into larger number of cores but with much lower ranks via TRL, which yields a highly compact model.\u00a0\n\u2028\n7. ''I wonder if the author can show some RNN \u2026 \u2018' \u00a0\nWe thank the Reviewer for the RNN advice. It would be interesting to see how method works on tasks with sequence data. However, such an experiment is not trial and will take some time,\u00a0 since all the current compared methods are only designed for MLP/CNN. We will try to add this in future version.\n\u2028\n8. ''I believe the authors should comment on \u2026\u2019\u2019\u00a0\nIn the revised version, some remarks or discussions are given in section 4.3. In current work, the location of shared cores are arranged in a left-to-right order, since there is natural intuition on the connection between cores and image resolution [Zhao et al 17], in which the first core mainly controls the small patches while the last core affects the large patches. In this experiment, we preferentially share the features from detailed scale to coarse scale (share the cores from left to right). By fixing that, we only use \u2018c\u2019 to control the fraction of sharing. In future work, we plan to automatically select shared core pairs with highest similarity between tasks."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1344/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1344/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1344/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "TENSOR RING NETS ADAPTED DEEP MULTI-TASK LEARNING", "abstract": "Recent deep multi-task learning (MTL) has been witnessed its success in alleviating data scarcity of some task by utilizing domain-specific knowledge from related tasks.

Prior papers have studied various knowledge sharing approaches for deep multi-task learning including hard and soft sharing schemes. And some soft sharing schemes have used tensor decompositions (including TT, and Tucker). This paper fuses this line of work with the recently proposed Tensor-Ring decomposition in order to obtain Tensor Ring (TR)-based soft sharing for multi-task learning. The results show some improvement over prior deep MTL methods based on other tensor factorisation methods.\n\nStrengths:\n+ Nice extension of existing line of work tensor-factorisation based MTL.\n+ More flexibility for controlling shared/unshared portions of weights compared to DMTRL. \n+ Improves on previous methods results.\n+ Experiments evaluate how MTL methods relate with various amounts of training data on each task.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Novelty/significance is limited. \n- Writing. Many things are not clearly and intuitively explained. Some claims are not adequately justified. \n- Introduces more hyper parameters to tune.\n- Results may rely on hyper parameter tuning. \n\nComments:\n1. Novelty.  Existing studies already established the template of different tensor factorisation methods (TT, Tucker) being possible to plug into deep networks for different kinds of soft-sharing MTL. Meanwhile, TR decomposition is taken off the shelf; (and as it\u2019s been applied for compression before, this is not the first time TR decomposition has been used in a CNN context either). Therefore this is an A+B paper and a high bar should be met for the additional analysis, insight, or performance improvements that should provided.\n2. Lots of writing issues:\n2.1 Many things are not explained transparently enough at best (or major over-claim at worst). For example: \n2.1.1 Paper claims the benefit that each task can have its own I/O dimensionality. However if TR-decomp is \u201ccircularly connected\u201d TT-decomp (Fig 1), then this seems not to happen automatically. So it should be unpacked more clearly how this is achieved. \n2.1.2 Paper claims favourable ability to use more private cores than TT, where only one core is private. However circular TT would also seem to have one private core by default (the core with a task axis). So I suspect something else is going on, but this is completely unclear and should be explained more transparently. Furthermore it should be justified if whatever modifications do enable these properties are definitely a unique property of TR-decomp, or could also be applied to TT-decomp. \n2.1.3 Statement \u201cTRMTL generalizes to allow the layer-wise weight to be represented by a relatively lager number of latent cores\u201d unclear: generalises what? larger number of cores than what? Than TT? The previous presentation suggests TT and TR should have same number of cores.  \n2.1.4 Statements like \u201cTR enjoys the property of circular dimensional permutation invariance\u201d are made without any explanation about what is the implication of this for neural networks and multi-task learning.  \n2.2 Many claims are inaccurate or not adequately backed up by theory or experiment. EG: (i) Paper claims to include DMTRL as a special case. But it only subsumes DMTRL-TT, not DMTRL-Tucker. Because TR-decomp does not include Tucker-decomp as an exact special case.  (ii) Sentences \u201cTR-ranks are usually smaller than TT-ranks\u201d are assertions without verification. \n2.3 Sentences are taken verbatim from other papers, plagiarism. For example: \u201cTR model is more flexible than TT, because TR-ranks can be equally distributed in the cores, but TT-ranks have a relatively fixed pattern\u201d  is verbatim from Zhao\u201916 TR-decomp paper. \n3. Hyperparameters: This paper apparently gains some practical benefit due to the notion of shared/unshared cores. However, this also introduces  additional hyper parameters (E.g., each layers private proportion \u201cc\u201d) to tune besides the ranks. Unlike the rank that can be pre-estimated by reconstruction error, this one seems to require tuning by cross-validation. This is not scalable. \n4. Hyperparameters+Tuning: Hyperparameters Private proportion, \u201csharing pattern\u201d, IO dimension seem to be tuned by accuracy.( \u201cWe test different sharing patterns and report the ones with the best accuracies\u201d). This is even less scalable, and additional tuning makes it unsurprising it surpasses other models performance.\n5. Insight & Analysis. All the core selection & public/private core selection are treated as black box optimisation. No insight is given about what turns out to be useful to share or not, and how consistent this is, etc.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1344/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "TENSOR RING NETS ADAPTED DEEP MULTI-TASK LEARNING", "abstract": "Recent deep multi-task learning (MTL) has been witnessed its success in alleviating data scarcity of some task by utilizing domain-specific knowledge from related tasks. Nonetheless, several major issues of deep MTL, including the effectiveness of sharing mechanisms, the efficiency of model complexity and the flexibility of network architectures, still remain largely unaddressed. To this end, we propose a novel generalized latent-subspace based knowledge sharing mechanism for linking task-specific models, namely tensor ring multi-task learning (TRMTL). TRMTL has a highly compact representation, and it is very effective in transferring task-invariant knowledge while being super flexible in learning task-specific features, successfully mitigating the dilemma of both negative-transfer in lower layers and under-transfer in higher layers. Under our TRMTL, it is feasible for each task to have heterogenous input data dimensionality or distinct feature sizes at different hidden layers. Experiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate our model is capable of significantly improving each single task\u2019s performance, particularly favourable in scenarios where some of the tasks have insufficient data.", "keywords": ["deep learning", "deep multi-task learning", "tensor factorization", "tensor ring nets"], "authorids": ["xinqicham@gmail.com", "ming.hou@riken.jp", "gx.zhou@gdut.edu.cn", "qibin.zhao@riken.jp"], "authors": ["Xinqi Chen", "Ming Hou", "Guoxu Zhou", "Qibin Zhao"], "TL;DR": "a deep multi-task learning model adapting tensor ring representation", "pdf": "/pdf/19401651173ec4c5a3079ea8d96fbd5fd5c3db97.pdf", "paperhash": "chen|tensor_ring_nets_adapted_deep_multitask_learning", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nchen2019tensor,\ntitle={{TENSOR} {RING} {NETS} {ADAPTED} {DEEP} {MULTI}-{TASK} {LEARNING}},\nauthor={Xinqi Chen and Ming Hou and Guoxu Zhou and Qibin Zhao},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxmXhRcK7},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1344/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234250303, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "BJxmXhRcK7", "replyto": "BJxmXhRcK7", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1344/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335926570, "tmdate": 1552335926570, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1344/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 12}
