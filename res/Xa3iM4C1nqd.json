The authors show that this approach empirically can lead to increased accuracy on both corrupted and uncorrupted data simultaneously. Furthermore, the authors propose a regularization procedure which can be used to maintain a robust representation during transfer to arbitrary downstream tasks. \n\nThe studied problem is significant and highly relevant to the ICLR community. The reviewers agreed that the work is timely, and appreciated the clarity of exposition. At the same time, the reviewers remained in disagreement in terms of novelty and significance of the results -- the proposed method is seen as a clear incremental application of existing techniques in the self-supervised setting. The authors argue that it was not clear that such augmentations would improve the robustness as well as accuracy, but these methods were developed and optimised to improve robustness. In fact, in [1] the authors conclude that \u201c...today's supervised and self-supervised training objectives end up being surprisingly similar\u201d as well as point out that SimCLR is more robust than competing self-supervised methods. Hence, establishing that there is indeed some empirical benefit is a step in the right direction, but not sufficient to meet the bar of acceptance. Furthermore, given the recent trend of scaling-up existing approaches, in particular in terms of the neural architectures and the batch sizes, the computational costs of the proposed regulariser in Eq (4) coupled with the additional hyperparameter to optimize make the approach less practical and general than claimed. In addition, the reviewers pointed out the lack of comparison to a proper baseline, as well as the issue with hyperparameter selection for the baseline after the author response. Finally, given access to additional data augmentations and one more hyperparameter to tune the results should substantially outperform the baselines.\n\nFor the reasons outlined above and the incremental nature of the work, I will recommend rejection. That being said, this was a borderline case, and I urge the authors to carefully revise the manuscript with the received feedback.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08377\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Transferable Unsupervised Robust Representation Learning", "authorids": ["~De-An_Huang1", "~Zhiding_Yu1", "~Anima_Anandkumar1"], "authors": ["De-An Huang", "Zhiding Yu", "Anima Anandkumar"], "keywords": ["unsupervised representation learning", "robustness", "transfer learning"], "abstract": "Robustness is an important, and yet, under-explored aspect of unsupervised representation learning, which has seen a lot of recent developments.

A key addition is that,\nwhile fine-tuning on the auxiliary (downstream) task, performance on the\noriginal data is maintained by favoring small differences between original\nrobust representation and the fine-tuned representation.\n\nThe work is well presented, and the main significance is in providing a fast\nway to partially gain some of the robustness available in much more difficult\nadversarial training.

The goal is to improve the robustness of visual representations to image perturbations. A further goal is to maintain the robustness properties of pre-trained representations after fine-tuning the network to downstream tasks.\n\nThe proposed method consist of two components: A scheme for sampling combinations of image augmentations, and a loss that is applied during transfer learning and penalizes deviations of the pairwise similarity between datapoint representations from the similarities before fine-tuning.\n\nThe method is evaluated on clean data performance and adversarial robustness, as well as calibration error.\n\n## Arguments for acceptance\n1. The paper is well written and clear. \n2. The proposed method improves on MoCo-v2 and Augmix in ImageNet accuracy, ImageNet-C corruption error, RMS calibration error and adversarial robustness.\n\n## Arguments against acceptance\n3. The proposed augmentation approach appears to be very similar to the methods used in MoCo, AugMix, and related work. Section 2.1 of the paper argues that these methods represent two different families of augmentation ($\\mathcal{T}_\\text{rep}$ and $\\mathcal{T}_\\text{rob}$). The paper suggests that augmentations need to be sampled from both of these families in a particular way (Eq. 2) to overcome the issue that one of the families affects the color histogram too much. This approach is only a small and heuristic variant of existing methods. It has been known since long before MoCo and AugMix that image augmentations improve unsupervised representation learning and robustness. Formal arguments for the distinction between $\\mathcal{T}_\\text{rep}$ and $\\mathcal{T}_\\text{rob}$ are not given. I am not sure whether the proposed variant is original enough for publication at ICLR. Further, the performance improvement of URRL over MoCov2 is small, less than one percentage point for most metrics.\n\n4. The proposed similarity regularization leads to more significant improvements in fine-tuning performance. However, this method is not compared against baselines. Regularization approaches for improving transfer performance have been proposed before, e.g. see [Li et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01483.pdf). These should be compared to the proposed method. In particular, well-tuned weight decay towards the frozen pre-trained weights ($L^2$-$SP$ in Li et al.) is an essential baseline. I suspect that the proposed similarity regularization may be functionally equivalent to decaying weights towards their initial values.\n\n## Conclusion\nWhile the paper is well organized and clear, in its current form it does not meet the originality and significance standards of ICLR and lacks crucial baselines. Suggestions for improvement: \n\n5. Provide a more formal argument for the proposed augmentation framework to show that it is a significant conceptual advance over the current knowledge that augmentations are important.\n6. Provide a more formal motivation for the similarity regularization, including a formal comparison to $L^2$-$SP$.\n7. Compare the similarity regularization to a well-tuned $L^2$-$SP$-decay baseline.\n\n## Update after rebuttal:\nThe authors provided convincing evidence that the proposed similarity regularization performs better with regards to robustness than $L^2$-$SP$. I adjusted my rating accordingly. I still think the contributions are borderline because the proposed regularization is not backed up by theoretical arguments and the augmentation approach is incremental.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1933/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1933/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Transferable Unsupervised Robust Representation Learning", "authorids": ["~De-An_Huang1", "~Zhiding_Yu1", "~Anima_Anandkumar1"], "authors": ["De-An Huang", "Zhiding Yu", "Anima Anandkumar"], "keywords": ["unsupervised representation learning", "robustness", "transfer learning"], "abstract": "Robustness is an important, and yet, under-explored aspect of unsupervised representation learning, which has seen a lot of recent developments.

We appreciate that the reviewers recognize the contributions of our work and that \u201cit could easily be broadly applicable to the burgeoning area of self-supervised learning\u201d (Reviewer 1).\n\nThe main concerns of Reviewer 2 are: (i) Comparison to a transfer learning regularization baseline ([L2-SP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01483.pdf)), and (ii) The benefit of data augmentation is already known.\n\nWe address both of these concerns in our revised draft and responses by the following: \n\n**L2-SP**: We include a detailed analysis and comparison with L2-SP and show that the proposed similarity regularization still significantly outperforms L2-SP\u2019s robust accuracy by almost 9% on average. \n\n**Contribution of Our Approach (URRL)**: We clarify that much work still remains to be done for applying data augmentations to *unsupervised representation learning*. This challenge is noted by several recent works ([SimCLR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709), [InfoMin](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10243.pdf), [Geirhos et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08377)) and nicely summarized by Reviewer 1. Our work contributes by showing that it is possible to improve both the clean accuracy and robust accuracy at the same time with a simple and general approach.\n\n**Generality of Our Approach**: In addition, we follow Reviewer 1\u2019s advice and apply the proposed URRL to two additional unsupervised learning approaches ([InstDis](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/CameraReady/0801.pdf), [PIRL](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Misra_Self-Supervised_Learning_of_Pretext-Invariant_Representations_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf)), and URRL improves both of these methods (Appendix B).

We followed the publicly available source code released by the author. The proposed similarity regularization significantly outperforms L2-SP\u2019s robust accuracy by almost 9% on average. The hyperparameter analysis for L2-SP on CIFAR-10 is shown in Figure 2 of Appendix A. We see that the best performing hyperparameters in [Li et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01483.pdf) (alpha = 0.1, beta = 0.01) actually hurt both the clean accuracy and robust accuracy in this case. This is due to two key differences between our work and theirs: First, our focus is on *unsupervised* representation learning. Compared to the representations learned from supervised learning on large-scale datasets like ImageNet and Places365, our unsupervised representations typically need further updates in order to do well on downstream classification tasks. In this case, L2 regularization is not enough by itself to improve the performance. Second, *robustness* is not the goal of Li et al., 2018, and L2-SP is not designed to improve the robustness of transfer learning. In contrast, the primary goal of our work is to improve the transferable robustness of learned representations, and the design of our similarity measure loss is motivated by preserving the robustness of learned representations during fine-tuning. As discussed in Section 2.2, the robustness of a feature representation comes from how it measures the similarities between images, and the proposed approach explicitly regularizes it during fine-tuning. Our results in Table 2 also show the importance of the proposed approach.\n\n**Contribution of URRL**: We understand the reviewer\u2019s concern that the benefits of augmentation are already known. While this is the case for supervised learning, we would like to emphasize that our work focuses on *unsupervised representation learning*, where much work remains to be done for augmentations. As noted by Reviewer 1, [recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08377) shows that \u201cmost techniques for self-supervised learning don't improve robustness at all.\" In addition, recent works (e.g., [SimCLR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709) and [InfoMin](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10243.pdf)) also comment on the challenge of selecting proper augmentations for unsupervised learning. In this case, \u201cit was not obvious a priori\u201d that our approach would work (R1). Therefore, a key contribution of our work is to address both of these challenges by improving the clean accuracy and robust accuracy *at the same time*. This upends for unsupervised learning the common assumption that there needs to be a trade-off between clean and robust accuracies ([Zhang et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08573)).\n\n**Generality of Our Approach**: We have included additional results in Table 4 of Appendix B, where we show the generality of our approach. Our approach is not limited to application to MoCo v2 studied in the main paper. Our approach (URRL) improves two other unsupervised learning approaches ([InstDis](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/CameraReady/0801.pdf), [PIRL](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Misra_Self-Supervised_Learning_of_Pretext-Invariant_Representations_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf))."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1933/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1933/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Transferable Unsupervised Robust Representation Learning", "authorids": ["~De-An_Huang1", "~Zhiding_Yu1", "~Anima_Anandkumar1"], "authors": ["De-An Huang", "Zhiding Yu", "Anima Anandkumar"], "keywords": ["unsupervised representation learning", "robustness", "transfer learning"], "abstract": "Robustness is an important, and yet, under-explored aspect of unsupervised representation learning, which has seen a lot of recent developments.

Our regularization is also unsupervised and can be directly applied to the unlabeled test sample jointly with the self-supervised loss update to regularize it. This could prevent the self-supervised loss to drastically update the trained weights with small sample sizes.
