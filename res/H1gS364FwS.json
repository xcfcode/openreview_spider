To this end, authors prepared a novel Amharic corpus and used a hybrid system of rule-based and learning-based systems.\nOverall, while all reviewers admit the importance of addressing low-resource language and the value of the novel Amharic corpus, they are not satisfied with the quality of the current paper as a scientific work. \nMost importantly, although the attempt of even extraction might be new on Amharic, there have been many works on other languages. It should be clearly presented what are the non-trivial language-specific challenges on Amharic and how they are solved, otherwise it seems just an engineering of existing techniques on a new dataset. Also, all reviewers are fairly concerned about the presentation and clarity of the paper. Unfortunately, no revised paper is uploaded and we cannot confirm how authors' response is reflected.

Event extraction has been done on different languages texts but not on one of the Semitic language Amharic. In this study, we present a system that extracts an event from unstructured Amharic text. The system has designed by the integration of supervised machine learning and rule-based approaches together.  We call it a hybrid system. The model from the supervised machine learning detects events from the text, then, handcrafted rules and the rule-based rules extract the event from the text. The hybrid system has compared with the standalone rule-based method that is well known for event extraction. The study has shown that the hybrid system has outperformed the standalone rule-based method. For the event extraction, we have been extracting event arguments. Event arguments identify event triggering words or phrases that clearly express the occurrence of the event.
