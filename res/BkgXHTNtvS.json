Please see below for our responses to the questions.\n\n- Regarding the reference [Soudry and Hoffer(2017)]\n\nYes, [Soudry and Hoffer(2017)] does not mention the descent path property. We will revise the statement in the following form: \u201cPrior to the present work, it was not known whether the \u201cdescent path property\u201d holds for $m<n$. Even for $m\\in (2n/d,n)$, where zero empirical risk is known to be achievable (Soudry and Hoffer, 2017), the existence of descent paths was in question.\u201d\n\n- Regarding the extension of our results to deep networks\n\nThis is an interesting question, to which we do not have a definite answer. Actually, as network depth increases, the loss surface spontaneously transitions from fairly benign to chaotic (Li, et al. 2018). On the plus side, we already know that a $k$-layer network of width $m$ has descent path property if $n\\le m$ (Yun, et al. 2018). This is because in this case, the weights of the last layer suffice to form a descent path to zero loss. To the best of our knowledge, $n\\le m$ is the best known bound for guaranteed existence of descent paths in deep networks. However, chances are that the property carries over to much smaller network widths. This we do not know, and needs to be addressed in future works.\n\n- Regarding applicability of \n\nThis is a very important open problem, as discussed in the Discussion section. We have strong indications that the statement of Corollary 1 holds with high probability over random data sets (the probability tends to 1 as m=n-1 grows large). This claim, on which we are currently working, relies heavily on the intuitions and tools we developed in this work. More specifically, the argument in Appendix A shows that every cupped min is the intersection of $(m-1)d$ differentiable surface. For random datasets, several such intersections emerge in the loss landscape, and with high probability some of them have the shape of a cupped min (i.e. the landscape is locally curved upwards). This we will elaborate on more in an upcoming publication.\n\n\n- Regarding typos\n\nThanks very much for reading our work meticulously.

Please see below for our responses to the questions.\n\n1- Regarding Corollary 1\n\nThe proof in the paper is pretty fast. The corollary is not straight forward. Below is a more detailed proof sketch. Consider a dataset S and denote its corresponding landscape by $F_S$. Note that a continuous change in $S$ results in a continuous change in $F_S$. From Theorem 1, let $w_0$ be a suboptimal cupped min of $F_S$. Then, from the definition of cupped min, there is a $\\delta>0$, such that for any weight $w$ with $\\|w-w_0\\|=\\delta$, we have $F_S(w)>F_S(w_0)+\\epsilon$. In other words, any path that starts at $w_0$ and end up in the set of global minima of $F_S$ would have an uphill climb of at least $\\epsilon$. Therefore, it follows from the continuity of $F_S$ with respect to $S$ that under a small enough perturbation of the dataset, there would still be an ($\\epsilon/2$)-uphill-climb in all paths that start at $w_0$ and end up in a global min. Equivalently, the descent path property remains violated for a small neighborhood of S with non-zero measure. \n\nFollowing the above idea, we actually have a rigorous proof that involves tedious mathematical analysis arguments. As the corollary is not the main point of the paper and the intuition provided in the paper is hopefully pretty convincing, we decided not to include a rigorous proof. However, if the expert reviewer suggests that it will improve the clarity of the paper, we would be happy to include the rigorous proof in the appendix. In any case, we discuss the proof sketch in more details to clarify the idea in the revised version.\n\nAs for the probability that the descent path property is violated, Corollary 1 shows that the probability is non-zero, and provides no further information about the size of the probability. The exact probability of existence of sub-optimal cupped minima is an interesting non-trivial problem. The results of this paper fall short of resolving this problem, however the methodology and ideas in the proofs provide promising grounds to attack the problem. This constitutes a current direction of our research, and we are working on a promising idea to show that for $m=n-1$ as $m$ grows large the probability of existence of suboptimal cupped minima tends to one.\n\n\n2- Regarding to the connection of our work with the literature on convergence of GD\n\nThis paper was actually inspired by the line of work mentioned by the respected reviewer. The best known guarantees for convergence of gradient descent methods in shallow networks require extremely large widths $m>n^8$. Based on our experience with that problem, we think that $m>n/\\gamma$ (for some constant $\\gamma$ that depends on pairwise distances of data points) should suffice for a theoretical guarantee of convergence of GD.\n\nOn the other hand, empirical results show that gradient descent typically achieve zero-loss for networks of widths as small as $m=n/d$ [Oymak and Soltanolkotabi, 2019]. It is also theoretically guaranteed that in this regime there exist parameters that achieve zero loss [Soudry and Hoffer, 2017].\n\nThe above literature is about trying to find the smallest over-parameterization under which optimization is easy. This gives rise to the following question. What exactly is an over-parameterized network? In other words, which regimes among $m=n$, $m=n/d$, and $m=n^8$ should be considered as over-parameterized? This paper addresses this problem from the viewpoint of descent algorithms. We show that the edge of over-parameterization (in the sense of descent path property) lies sharp at $m=n$. \n\nAs for convergence of GD, existence of descent paths from a given starting point is a necessary condition. However, the mere non-existence of descent path is far from sufficient for guaranteed polynomial time convergence of GD. The current paper neither aims to nor does solve the problem of convergence of gradient descent methods. However, we believe that a good understanding of shape and properties of loss landscape will eventually prove useful in performance guarantees of GD. The current work tries to take a step in that direction. \n\nOymak, Samet, and Mahdi Soltanolkotabi. \"Towards moderate overparameterization: global convergence guarantees for training shallow neural networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.04674, 2019.\nDaniel Soudry and Elad Hoffer.

In particular, the authors prove that if the network width m \\leq n - 2d, then there exist training data sets and initial weights such that the square loss on the neural network has no descent path connecting the initial weights and global minima.\n\nOverall, I think this paper is of good quality. The presentation is clear and the logic is easy to follow. I did some high-level check and the theoretical analysis seems reasonable. However, I have the following questions:\n\n1. As is stated in Corollary 1 and discussed below Theorem 1, the training sample sets that lead to suboptimal capped minima are not of measure-zero. However, it seems that no rigorous proof is provided for this result. Perhaps I have missed something, but is Corollary 1 straight forward given Theorem 1 and Lemma 1? How large is the probability? It would be better if the authors could provide a more rigorous proof.\n\n2. A recent line of work has shown convergence of gradient-based algorithms for over-parameterized neural networks. It would be interesting if the authors could provide more comparison between this paper and the results of these works:\n\n- Simon S. Du, Jason D.
