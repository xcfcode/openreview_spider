The authors mention a few times that this work could be interpreted as a negative result, but the authors write in a more positive manner in other parts. Should the work be viewed as an improvement over recent work, or as a negative result that incorporating gradients doesn't improve certificates by much?\u201d: We show both that the maximum increase in certificates attainable using second-order information is modest (Figure 1-b) as well as that the number of samples necessary to use this information is too large to use practically (this has been improved somewhat by Mohapatra et al, as discussed above; and we have removed some language referring to the estimation method as a negative result.) However, the proposed dipole smoothing in Section 4 provides a (still modest) increase in certified robustness without requiring an asymptotic increase in the number of samples by more than a constant factor, so this method may prove practical, even if the magnitude of the improvement is relatively small.\n\n\u201cIt would be useful to plot these results in terms of certified accuracy vs epsilon, as has become standard in this line of work.\u201d: We have included these plots in Appendix C for the data reported in the main text.\n\n\u201cAnalysis does not easily extend to multi-class setting.\u201d: We address this in Section 3.2.

The authors show a number of interesting properties such as (1) that the certificate is tight, by showing, for a linear classifier, the Cohen et al. [1] certificate and the SoS certificate are identical, and (2) certificates are slightly improved if gradient norms are small, but due to poor estimation of these value, sometimes the gains provided by \"second-order information\" are eliminated. The authors then show estimation of the gradient norm is dependent on the dimensionality of the data, and provide alternative methods that do not have a strict dependency. Although, as far as I understand, this alternative method requires computing two new lower bounds and so requires more samples to reach the same level of precision as the Cohen et al. certificate. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show in some cases SoS finds larger certificates.\n\nStrength:\n\n[+] Detailed analysis and theorem.\n\n[+] Interesting use of geometrical information to make gradient norm estimation efficient.\n\n[+] Experiments on large scale datasets.\n\nWeaknesses / Questions:\n\n1. I  am confused about the positioning of this work. The authors mention a few times that this work could be interpreted as a negative result, but the authors write in a more positive manner in other parts. Should the work be viewed as an improvement over recent work, or as a negative result that incorporating gradients doesn't improve certificates by much? If it is the latter, it isn't clear which dimension of the work is responsible for the limitations. Is it simply that, in practice, the gradient norms are substantially larger than zero, and so this new certificate more or less matches the Cohen et al. certificate? Or is it that difficulty in estimation of the gradient norms wipes away any gains? Is it both? A more substantial study of these effects would be most welcome.\n\n2. I found it difficult to interpret the experimental results. How many of the +/- 1% changes are, in fact, decreases? It would be useful to plot  these results in terms of certified accuracy vs epsilon, as has become standard in this line of work. My concern is that if the majority of SoS certificates are marginally smaller than the Cohen et al. certificates, and a few SoS certificates are substantially higher, the overall certified accuracy curve will look worse for some epsilon values in comparison to Cohen et al..\n\n3.

The certificate radius of the proposed method is novel as far as the reviewer knows about. \n \nWeak points:\n\n-W1. The advantage of the certificate radius in Theorem 1 over the existing ones is not clearly justified. Unlike the original randomized smoothing classifiers, there seems no explicit expression available for the certificate radius in Theorem 1. Based on the current bound in Equation 2, it is hard to evaluate the theoretical gain of the proposed method in robustness. \n\n-W2. The proof of Theorem in Appendix Section A.1 looks not correct in general. The current proof argument is only customized for $x=0$ and $x\u2019=[R,0,\u2026,0]^\\top$. It is not clear if the same claim and technique extend to arbitrary $x$ and $x\u2019$ satisfying $\\|x \u2013 x\u2019\\|\\le R$.\n\n-W3. The paper is poorly organized and presented. The main results in Section 3 are somewhat hard to follow for non-expert audiences, mainly due to the lack of a clear statement of method before indulging into theoretical analysis. Also, much of the space was allocated for elaborating a gradient estimation method which in my opinion is mostly incremental as a side contribution. Such a practice of material organization makes the paper unclear and perhaps pointless in presentation. \n\n-W4. As an adversarial learning paper that introduces a new alternative method for robustness certificate, it is desirable to provide a sufficiently detailed experimental study in the main paper (rather than in the appendix) to more convincingly justify the real benefit of method. \n\n-W5.

In particular, it's important to study the certified robustness of the classifier against adversarial perturbations. \n\n2. The proposed second-order smoothing is novel. This paper aims to improve randomized smoothing by incorporating the gradient information of the smoothed classifier, which is novel.  \n\n\nCons:\n1. The evaluation metric is not standard.  Standard randomized smoothing and the follow-up work use certified accuracy as the metric to evaluate the certified robustness.  It's better for the authors to also use certified accuracy as the metric for a fair comparison. \n\nIt's not clear how different parameters (e.g., c, lambda, eta) impact the certified accuracy on CIFAR10 and ImageNet dataset. \n\n2. The improvement of the proposed method (Gaussian dipole smoothing) over the standard randomized smoothing is marginal (most 1% in Figure 5). \n\n\nQuestions during the rebuttal period:\n\nWhy not using certified accuracy? \n\nWhat's the impact of the parameters on the results? \n\nIs it possible to address the issue of marginal improvement? \n\n\nI would be happy to increase my score if the authors can also show results on certified accuracy and improve their results?  \n\nTypos:\n\n1.
