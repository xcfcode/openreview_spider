This paper studies differentially private meta-learning, where the algorithm needs to use information across several learning tasks to protect the privacy of the data set from each task. The reviewers agree that this is a natural problem and the paper presents a solution that is essentially an adoption of differentially private SGD. There are several places the paper can improve. For the experimental evaluation, the authors should include a wider range of epsilon values in order to investigate the accuracy-privacy trade-off. The authors should also consider expanding the existing experiments with other datasets.

We hope to address your comments below. [note: We decided to respond to each reviewer individually, though we note that there is significant overlap in our responses to R1 and R2 since these two reviewers had several similar comments/suggestions]\n\n1) Varying epsilon:\n-Thank you for the suggestion - we agree that observing performance across different privacy budgets is a valuable experiment. Since the submission deadline, we have run each of the language-modelling experiments for two additional privacy budgets. The original choice of 9.2 was somewhat arbitrary, as emphasis was placed on showing that meta-learning could be compatible with a \u201creasonable\u201d level of privacy (using our notion of privacy). However, we hope by including these additional results, more context is provided in terms of the accuracy-privacy trade-off. The new epsilons used, 22.5 and 4.5, were determined by doubling and halving the noise multiplier for the Local DP baseline. We observe, as expected, that higher utility is traded off with lower privacy and vice versa. However, we also see that even when stricter privacy is required (epsilon = 4.5), fairly useful/competitive meta-learned initializations are still obtainable (see the updated Figure 2).\n \n2) Convex experiments:\n-We also acknowledge convex case results as a valuable addition to our experiments. Though we currently do not have updates for these experiments we fully intend to include such results for future revision. Specifically, we have been looking at adding evaluations with linear models on the datasets used by Denevi et al. (2019) and Khodak et al. (2019).\n\n3) Novelty of techniques:\n-We recognize that our method is quite simple and takes advantage of existing single-task privacy methods. However, we see this simplicity as a benefit of our approach, in the same way that non-private methods such as MAML and Reptile are simple extensions of regular single-task gradient descent. This simplicity enables flexible application to a variety of models and settings.\n\nReferences:\n-Denevi, Ciliberto, Grazzi, Pontil.

This is a problem that has been studied recently, although generally not under the exact record-level task-privacy model studied in this paper (what they call global task privacy). The problem is well-motivated: since in meta learning we want to leverage information from similar tasks to increate data efficiency, there may be privacy concerns for each of the task owners about both other task owners and the aggregator (meta-learner). \n\n\nTheir approach is conceptually simple; they use standard private stochastic gradient descent within each task to provide task level privacy. In combination with post-processing and composition guarantees this gives privacy for the overall mechanism. They are able to show theoretical guarantees via the standard accuracy guarantees of private SGD and no-regret\nguarantees of OCO. They show a bound on the expected transfer risk:  \nO(V/sqrt(m) + 1/Tsqrt(m)) + o(1/sqrt(m)) which is close to the non-private bound from Denevi (2019).\n\nThey evaluate the empirical performance of these models via a transfer learning setting  where they are training a deep RNN for next word prediction on two large corpi, and the tasks correspond to individual articles. They show that the private variate of Reptile is competitive with the non-private variant in these settings. \nA few comments \n-\tIt is odd to just fix epsilon = 9.2 instead of showing a Pareto curve. Why this particular value?\n-\tSimpler (convex) experiments to illustrate the theoretical guarantees would improve the paper\n\nOverall I like the motivation and the theory results are solid, if not a bit obvious. However, due to the lack of novelty in any of the applied techniques, and the fact that the experiments could be expanded, I recommend a weak accept.

We conduct the first formal study of privacy in this setting and formalize the notion of task-global differential privacy as a practical relaxation of more commonly studied threat models. We then propose a new differentially private algorithm for gradient-based parameter transfer that not only satisfies this privacy requirement but also retains provable transfer learning guarantees in convex settings. Empirically, we apply our analysis to the problems of federated learning with personalization and few-shot classification, showing that allowing the relaxation to task-global privacy from the more commonly studied notion of local privacy leads to dramatically increased performance in recurrent neural language modeling and image classification.", "keywords": ["Differential Privacy", "Meta-Learning", "Federated Learning"], "paperhash": "li|differentially_private_metalearning", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nLi2020Differentially,\ntitle={Differentially Private Meta-Learning},\nauthor={Jeffrey Li and Mikhail Khodak and Sebastian Caldas and Ameet Talwalkar},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJgqMRVYvr}\n}", "full_presentation_video": "", "original_pdf": "/attachment/18aee80e91d6be224b6152f095fbf8b05142d6cb.pdf", "appendix": "", "poster": "", "spotlight_video": "", "slides": ""}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
