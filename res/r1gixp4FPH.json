Was this also done for SGD+nesterov? Also, I think it is an important implementation detail that should be mentioned outside of the appendix\u201d\n\nThe reported results in our submission is based on SGD+Nesterov without restart (as is the common practice). For comparison, we ran the same experiment (ResNet-32, lr=0.1) using SGD+Nesterov with restart, which gives slightly worse performance (91.65% accuracy, the average of 3 independent runs). We will clarify the setting of SGD+Nesterov in our revision.\n\n>>\u201cAdam didn\u2019t get the same hyper-parameter tuning as MaSS did.

Some experiments in the paper are not representing all scenarios that MaSS may not work.\u201d\n\nWe would like to point out a few key points:\n1. we have rigorous theory to show the following two key results: non-acceleration of Nesterov SGD (Theorem 1) and the guaranteed acceleration of MaSS on quadratic and convex problems (Theorem 3 and 4). \n2. From the practical point of view, we find that MaSS works well (better or at least as well as the standard methods) in all of our experiments, on both synthetic and real data, including  training of deep neural networks. Of course, it is not possible to explore all scenarios in a paper. \n\n\nWe address your concerns one by one, as follows:\n\n>>\u201d4) The result in this paper is quite incremental from the one in Vaswani et al 2019.\u201d\n\nComparison with the work (Vaswani et al 2019). \nKey differences:\n1. The key theoretical result of non-acceleration of Nesterov SGD (Theorem 1) is new and is not known in the literature.\n2. MaSS has provably guaranteed acceleration over SGD (Theorem 3 and 4). In contrast,  the convergence rate in (Vaswani et al 2019) can be significantly slower than that of SGD, even for quadratic problems with Gaussian distributed data. Moreover, in that setting MaSS matches the optimal rate of the original (non-SGD)  Nesterov\u2019s algorithm. This is discussed in the third paragraph on page 3 and a detailed analysis is given in Appendix F.3.\n3. We have analysis of the dependence of convergence rate of MaSS on batch size and the saturation phenomena for accelerated SGD. As far as we know, there is no such analysis in the current literature. \n\n>>\"5) It is true that Nesterov SGD is very efficient for training neural networks and MaSS may have some effect in practice. However, theoretical part needs to be improve. I would suggest to analyze for nonconvex problems or using the assumptions which are verifiable and reasonable for neural network.\u201d\n\nEven for plain SGD, there are very few results in the literature for non-convex problems (including neural networks). There are none, as far as we know, for accelerated/Nesterov SGD. We feel it is not reasonable to hold our paper to such a standard.\n\n>>\"3) The theoretical results in this paper are not strong. The interpolation setting could make all solutions of the component function are the solution of the total loss function. In this situation, we know that stochastic algorithms could take advantage because of \u201cautomatic variance reduction\u201d.\u201d\n\nThe interpolation setting has become a subject of significant interest recently as it appears that many deep models operate at (or close to) interpolation. See our discussion in the first paragraph of related work, as well as the cited papers (5;16;23;2) in our submission. Note that, as we show, even in the interpolation setting, Nesterov SGD does not accelerate over SGD.\n\n>>\"1) In the statement of theorem 1, what do you mean by \u201cwith probability one\u201d and \u201cconvergence in expectation\u201d together?\u201d\n\nActually, we do not use the term \u201cconvergence in expectation\u201d in Theorem 1 or elsewhere in the paper. We noticed the term \u201cdiverges in expectation\u201d in Corollary 1, which will be replaced by \u201cdiverges\u201d in the revision.\n\n>>\"2) Basically, all the results of this paper is based on the (or close to) strongly convex property. However, numerical experiments show for some non-convex functions, specifically for deep learning problems. It is unclear what kind of loss function the author(s) are using for training classification problems on MNIST and CIFAR-10. This could be softmax cross-entropy but not quadratic.\u201c\n\nWe use softmax cross-entropy loss for the numerical experiments on neural networks, as is commonly used, and use quadratic loss for linear regression and kernel regression. Although our theoretical analysis is based on convex functions, our experiments show that MaSS practically works well for non-convex problems, such as training deep neural networks, including ResNet."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper350/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper350/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["liu.2656@buckeyemail.osu.edu", "mbelkin@cse.ohio-state.edu"], "title": "Accelerating SGD with momentum for over-parameterized learning", "authors": ["Chaoyue Liu", "Mikhail Belkin"], "pdf": "/pdf/67006b8932120072903be0eb7bfca6fc324e26c6.pdf", "TL;DR": "This work proves the non-acceleration of Nesterov SGD with any hyper-parameters, and proposes new algorithm which provably accelerates SGD in the over-parameterized setting.", "abstract": "\nNesterov SGD is widely used for training modern neural networks and other machine learning models.

The inequality (7) does not have any random variable anymore after taking the expectation. Need to explain more clearly this part. \n\n2) Basically, all the results of this paper is based on the (or close to) strongly convex property. However, numerical experiments show for some non-convex functions, specifically for deep learning problems. It is unclear what kind of loss function the author(s) are using for training classification problems on MNIST and CIFAR-10. This could be softmax cross-entropy but not quadratic. \n\n3) The theoretical results in this paper are not strong. The interpolation setting could make all solutions of the component function are the solution of the total loss function. In this situation, we know that stochastic algorithms could take advantage because of \u201cautomatic variance reduction\u201d. \n\n4) The result in this paper is quite incremental from the one in Vaswani et al 2019, \u201cFast and Faster Convergence of SGD for Over-Parameterized Models (and an Accelerated Perceptron)\u201d. More discussion is needed if the author(s) think that it has significantly improvement. \n\n5) It is true that Nesterov SGD is very efficient for training neural networks and MaSS may have some effect in practice. However, theoretical part needs to be improve. I would suggest to analyze for nonconvex problems or using the assumptions which are verifiable and reasonable for neural network. \n\nThe work may be potential, but in order to convince people to trust this algorithm, rigorous theory must be provided. Some experiments in the paper are not representing all scenarios that MaSS may not work. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper350/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper350/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["liu.2656@buckeyemail.osu.edu", "mbelkin@cse.ohio-state.edu"], "title": "Accelerating SGD with momentum for over-parameterized learning", "authors": ["Chaoyue Liu", "Mikhail Belkin"], "pdf": "/pdf/67006b8932120072903be0eb7bfca6fc324e26c6.pdf", "TL;DR": "This work proves the non-acceleration of Nesterov SGD with any hyper-parameters, and proposes new algorithm which provably accelerates SGD in the over-parameterized setting.", "abstract": "\nNesterov SGD is widely used for training modern neural networks and other machine learning models.

It's amazing to see the great improvement introduced by the compensation term into the theoretical result of MaSS. Moreover, the authors generalize the setting of square loss function to other convex loss functions.\n2. The encouraging result in Table 1 in EMPIRICAL EVALUATION shows the consistent outperformance of MaSS over SGD and Nesterov SGD regardless of the changing learning rates.\n\nCons\n1. The discussion on why the zero eignvalue can be ignored in Section 4 is insufficient. \"(stochastic) gradients are always perpendicular to W^*\" seems not that obvious.\n2. The empirical result merely involves two settings of learning rate: 0.01, 0.3.

In the full-batch (non deterministic) setting, their algorithm boils down to the classical formulation of Nesterov GD. Their approach is justified by a well conducted theoretical analysis and some empirical work on toy datasets. \n\nPositive points:\n- The approach is elegant and thoroughly justified. The convergence to Nesterov GD when the batch size increase is comforting.\n- The empirical evaluation, even if it is still preliminary and larger scale experiments will have to be conducted before the method could be widely adopted, are suitable and convincing.\n- Some interesting observations regarding the convergence regimes (in respect to the batch size) are made. It would have been interesting to see how the results from fig3 generalize to the non convex problems considered in the paper.\n\nPossible improvements:\n- In H2, it is mentioned that the algorithm is restarted (the momentum is reset) when the learning rate is annealed. Was this also done for SGD+nesterov? Also, I think it is an important implementation detail that should be mentioned outside of the appendix\n- Adam didn\u2019t get the same hyper-parameter tuning as MaSS did. It is a bit disappointing, as I think the superior performance (in generalization) of non-adaptive methods would still hold and the experiment would have been more convincing.
