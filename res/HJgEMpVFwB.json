The update looks good to me. The discussion section looks much better now.\n----------------------------------------\nSummary\nThis paper conducts research on adversarial policy against a fixed and black-box policy (victim). In this setting, the victim has a fixed policy but the adversary has no access to its white-box information. Instead, the adversary can freely access the black-box policy of the victim. The experiments show that the trained adversary outperforms the baseline in some scenarios, with three interesting findings: 1) the adversary successfully found the weakness of the victim. In some scenarios, the adversary wins by doing some weird actions which make no sense, but those weird actions somehow make the victim fail; 2) the victim fails due to the weird (or I should say adversarial) observation from the adversary but not the physical inference. The authors demonstrate this by showing that the victim has a much higher success rate when the observation is replaced with a \u2018normal\u2019 opponent. I am kind of on the borderline, but still lean to accept paper.\nStrengths\n- This paper presents some experiments on adversarial learning when the policy of the victim is fixed and black-box with interesting findings, demonstrates that the adversary can successfully figure out the weakness of the victim.\n- The paper formalizes the problem into an MDP whose dynamics is unknown, which is clear.\n- This paper comes with many experiments supported by great demos, which clearly support the authors\u2019 arguments.\nWeaknesses\n- The paper becomes messy in the end and does not come with a good conclusion. With a lot of experiments conducted, the author fails to summarize them into an (or a few) interesting conclusion(s), but end up with a page-long conclusion paragraph, which makes the paper less focused but like listing miscellaneous experiments. From the reader\u2019s perspective, a (or a few) clear conclusion would be very helpful.\nPossible Improvements\nMy suggestion is to reorganize the second half of the paper, to make a few clear arguments.

We were unaware of this literature but agree it is highly relevant. We have revised the Related Work section in our submission to discuss the papers you mentioned and several others we discovered while reviewing the literature. We would appreciate any further feedback you may have on our revised submission.\n\nYou also highlight the need for training Deep RL to be more robust to these attacks. We wholeheartedly agree: we deferred this to future work only because we felt there was insufficient space to adequately explore defenses in this paper. However, after feedback from yourself and other reviewers we agree it is worth including some simple baseline defenses in this paper. We have started work on a defence based on adversarial training, and will revise the paper early next week after further investigating our results.\n\nOur preliminary results suggest that the efficacy of the adversarial policy can be reduced by finetuning the victim on a mixture of episodes against the adversary and a normal opponent. (Finetuning against just the adversary works even better, but the victim catastrophically forgets how to play against a normal opponent.) Unfortunately, the victim is hardened only against the original adversary: retraining the adversary recovers comparable performance to the original victim.\n\nWe also wanted to clarify that we do not consider the existence of weaknesses in deep RL policies to be in itself surprising. Indeed, any policy not in a global Nash equilibria can be exploited by some worst-case opponent. The result we found striking was that the worst-case opponent is a policy that is manifestly less capable than normal opponents which the victim plays successfully against. This suggests that whatever feature representation the deep RL policy has learnt is quite different from that of human sports players. Apart from being of interest scientifically, we believe this is important for practitioners to be aware of: testing an RL policy against opponents that seem challenging to a human may give a false assurance, as the worst-case opponent may in fact be a policy that humans would dismiss as being of little to no interest."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper409/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper409/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Policies: Attacking Deep Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Adam Gleave", "Michael Dennis", "Cody Wild", "Neel Kant", "Sergey Levine", "Stuart Russell"], "authorids": ["gleave@berkeley.edu", "michael_dennis@berkeley.edu", "codywild@berkeley.edu", "kantneel@berkeley.edu", "svlevine@eecs.berkeley.edu", "russell@cs.berkeley.edu"], "keywords": ["deep RL", "adversarial examples", "security", "multi-agent"], "TL;DR": "Deep RL policies can be attacked by other agents taking actions so as to create natural observations that are adversarial.", "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) policies are known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations to their observations, similar to adversarial examples for classifiers.

We are glad that you find the attack scenario novel and the problem well formulated. You identify two additional experiments: implementation of defences, and testing on a greater range of environments.\n\nWe are working on a defence based on adversarial training, and will revise the paper early next week after further investigating the results. Our preliminary results suggest that the efficacy of the adversarial policy can be reduced by finetuning the victim on a mixture of episodes against the adversary and a normal opponent. (Finetuning against just the adversary works even better, but the victim catastrophically forgets how to play against a normal opponent.) Unfortunately, the victim is hardened only against the original adversary: retraining the adversary recovers comparable performance to the original victim.\n\nThank you for your suggestion of new types of environment to investigate. We are excited to explore adversarial policies in a broader range of settings, and would appreciate it if you could elaborate on what aspects of the proposed environments you feel is most important.\n\nFor property 1), could you clarify what aspect of the environments you think should be low-dimensional? \nIn our experiments the agents directly observe the positions and velocities of their and opponents joints, which is low-dimensional compared to image inputs. Our working hypothesis is that vulnerability to adversarial attack depends on the size of the subspace of observations the adversary can control, which depends on the action space, observation space and environment dynamics. \n\nWith property 2), we agree that cooperative games are both important and common in real-life. However, we believe that it is harder to attack constant-sum (competitive) games than variable-sum (cooperative) games. In a constant-sum game, the victim agent always plays against a competitor during self-play, and so should learn to be robust to a wide range of strategies. By contrast, in a mixed-sum game, strategies that would reduce the payoffs to all actors will rarely if ever be played by an opponent. This makes cooperative victims easy to exploit by an adversary whose only goal is to minimize the utility of the victim. Accordingly, we feel it is premature to investigate variable-sum games while defense remains unsolved for the constant-sum case.\n\nWe would also appreciate any concrete suggestions for environments to investigate. While we are unlikely to have time to perform experiments in new environments during the review period, this is an active direction for our future work. We previously investigated the Carla environment, a driving simulator, which has the benefit of being a safety-critical environment and also has 1) a cooperative element and 2) low-dimensional action spaces. Unfortunately we have found existing controllers in Carla are sufficiently fragile that attacking them is uninformative. We are considering instead attacking agents in simpler top-down car simulators where it may be easier to train a high-performing controller."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper409/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper409/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Policies: Attacking Deep Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Adam Gleave", "Michael Dennis", "Cody Wild", "Neel Kant", "Sergey Levine", "Stuart Russell"], "authorids": ["gleave@berkeley.edu", "michael_dennis@berkeley.edu", "codywild@berkeley.edu", "kantneel@berkeley.edu", "svlevine@eecs.berkeley.edu", "russell@cs.berkeley.edu"], "keywords": ["deep RL", "adversarial examples", "security", "multi-agent"], "TL;DR": "Deep RL policies can be attacked by other agents taking actions so as to create natural observations that are adversarial.", "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) policies are known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations to their observations, similar to adversarial examples for classifiers.

This paper is an empirical exploration of this phenomenon, using as examples trained agents in a Gym environment and involving two humanoid robot simulations interacting with each other in various ways. The original policies are taken from previous training, so the main experimental contribution here is to solve an RL problem on the attacker's side to try to find the bad regions in the victim's control space, going via the means of the observation-based coupling.\n\nI think these are timely issues. I agree that, to the extent that DRL policies are being seriously considered as candidates for various practical problems, we should seriously ask questions about the (lack of) stability of solutions. \n\nI also think that the paper would be stronger if the authors considered the rich history in control design, formal methods and other communities where this approach to counter-example based thinking is fairly standard and in particular where the use of optimization methods to find 'bugs' has been studied in some depth. \n\nSo, for instance, the authors give us useful quantification to support the observation that the process of attacker RL finds ways to put the victim outside its stable region where it is naturally unstable and ineffective. However, they do not observe that there is a literature on systematically performing 'controller testing' via optimization using various techniques. Here are just a few examples to show the diversity:\nGhosh, S., Berkenkamp, F., Ranade, G., Qadeer, S., & Kapoor, A. (2018, May). Verifying controllers against adversarial examples with Bayesian optimization. In 2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) (pp. 7306-7313). IEEE.\nRavanbakhsh, H., & Sankaranarayanan, S. (2016, October). Robust controller synthesis of switched systems using counterexample guided framework. In 2016 international conference on embedded software (EMSOFT) (pp. 1-10). IEEE.\n\nThe authors might find it interesting to note that this approach of viewing the control problem 'backwards' to generate new instances has a deeper history in control theory (of course without discussion of NNs etc), e.g., \nDoyle, J., Primbs, J. A., Shapiro, B., & Nevistic, V. (1996, December). Nonlinear games: examples and counterexamples. In Proceedings of 35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (Vol. 4, pp. 3915-3920). IEEE.\n\nAll that said, I find the results presented here to be plausible and pointing in the desired direction for exploring how to robustify DRL. The authors defer training using these examples to future work but I think the paper would be more self-contained if that were actually demonstrated here already. For reasons I mention above, the existence of this kind of weakness in controllers is not really surprising to people who have thought deeply about control, and it is only to be expected that NN based parameterisations of control would only be even more vulnerable. So, the more satisfying result would be the positive one that shows how to train DRL to be (more) robust under such attacks.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper409/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper409/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Policies: Attacking Deep Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Adam Gleave", "Michael Dennis", "Cody Wild", "Neel Kant", "Sergey Levine", "Stuart Russell"], "authorids": ["gleave@berkeley.edu", "michael_dennis@berkeley.edu", "codywild@berkeley.edu", "kantneel@berkeley.edu", "svlevine@eecs.berkeley.edu", "russell@cs.berkeley.edu"], "keywords": ["deep RL", "adversarial examples", "security", "multi-agent"], "TL;DR": "Deep RL policies can be attacked by other agents taking actions so as to create natural observations that are adversarial.", "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) policies are known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations to their observations, similar to adversarial examples for classifiers.
