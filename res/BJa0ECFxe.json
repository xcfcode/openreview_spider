We would like to address some of the theoretical points which were raised.\n\nThe information bottleneck method is a generalization of the notion of minimal sufficient statistic [TPB99]. Sufficiency and minimality as defining criteria for a representation are no less theoretically grounded than likelihood or posterior since, by definition, a minimal sufficient statistic captures all and only the variability in the data that matters for the task. No more, and no less.\n\nMoreover, unlike a generic Bayesian framework, the IB method further allows making the tradeoff between complexity and fidelity of the representation explicit, and directly models the effect of nuisances (Sec. 3). \n\nThus, from a theoretical standpoint, the IB Lagrangian is our starting point, and defines what we call an optimal representation. The key question now is how to compute it, and how to design and learn representations that optimize it. Our theoretical contribution is to show that this can be done efficiently using a very specific architecture (dropout layer) and, using this result, to establish connections to seemingly unrelated theories such as variational dropout.\n\n>> Bayesian interpretations lend a theoretical basis to parameter noise, but activation noise has no such motivation.\n\nAs shown by [KSW15], and as we briefly mention in Sec. 2, activation noise and parameter noise are equivalent (via the \u201clocal reparameterization trick\u201d). So activation noise can be motivated in a Bayesian setting as well. Our framework has the results derived in [KSW15] from a Bayesian point of view as a special case, and moreover it can address the specific role of nuisances. Finally, we provide an alternative information-theoretic motivation to activation noise.\n\n>> The information bottleneck indeed limits the information that can be passed through, but there is no rigorous argument for why this should improve generalization.\n\nAs argued in the first paragraph, and supported in the subsequent analysis, (a) Information Dropout reduces the effects of nuisance variability. The fact that (b) reducing nuisance variability prevents overfitting is clear, and so is the fact that (c) preventing overfitting improves generalization. Specifically on (a), Information Dropout penalizes the passage of information (second term of the IB Lagrangian); information due to nuisance variability contribute none to the task; therefore, it can be discarded with minimal loss (first term of the IB Lagrangian).\n\n[KSW15] Diederik Kingma, Tim Salimans, and Max Welling, \"Variational Dropout and the Local Reparameterization Trick\", 2015\n\n[TBP99] Naftali Tishby, Fernando Pereira, and William Bialek, \"The Information Bottleneck Method\", 1999"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Information Dropout: learning optimal representations through noise", "abstract": "We introduce Information Dropout, a generalization of dropout that is motivated by the Information Bottleneck principle and highlights the way in which injecting noise in the activations can help in learning optimal representations of the data.

We would like to provide some clarification regarding the experiments in the paper, and address some of the concerns which were raised.\n\n>> The CIFAR-10 results are worse than those in the paper that originally proposed the network architecture they use (Springenberg et al). The VAE results on MNIST are also horrible.\n\nIf we use exactly the same architecture of Springenberg et al., then our results on CIFAR are, as predicted by the theory, comparable asymptotically, and better for smaller nets. We have added experiments that show this in the revised version to be uploaded soon. Also, our results on VAE are comparable to [KW13] for a similar architecture.\n\nNote, however, that the goal of our experiments is not to improve state-of-the-art on CIFAR-10 or MNIST, but to illustrate the effect of Information Dropout when compared to other forms of dropout, and to validate the intuition derived from the theory. For this reason, for the experiments in the paper we chose the simplest empirical settings, and modified the All Convolutional Net to isolate potentially confounding factors: we removed weight decay, increased the batch size to reduce gradient noise, simplified the architecture by removing the initial dropout layer, and used less aggressive learning rates and no fine tuning.  We also replaced ReLU with Softplus to make the results comparable with those of [KSW15]. This also served to validate the theory which applies to both ReLU and Softplus. \n\nMany factors affect empirical performance, only few of which are relevant to validating our theory. To the latter hand, we went to great length to ensure that the experiments are *controlled*. Only under careful control can the experiments be convincing in validating the theory.\n\nNevertheless, as suggested by the reviewers, we are currently exploring other experiments that would further illustrate the tradeoff between invariance to nuisances and sufficiency as mediated by the coefficient \\beta. We will add these along with the further tests using the same architecture of Springerberg, as described above.\n\n>> The results on CIFAR-10 in Figure 3(b) seem to be on a validation set\n\nWe are using the same nomenclature of [KSW15], since we want to make a direct comparison with their experiment. As customary for CIFAR, the data is divided into a disjoint training set (50,000 samples) and validation/test set (10,000 samples).

The basic idea is that when learning a representation z of input x\nwith the aim of predicting y, we must choose a z such that it carries the least\namount of information about x, as long as it can predict y. This idea can be\nformalized using the Information Bottleneck Lagrangian. This leads to an\noptimization problem which is similar to the one derived for variational\ndropout, the difference being that Information dropout allows for a scaling\nfactor associated with the KL divergence term that encourages noise. The amount\nof noise being added is made a parameterized function of the data and this\nfunction is optimized along with the rest of the model. Experimental results on\nCIFAR-10 and MNIST show (small) improvements over binary dropout.\n\nStrengths\n- The paper highlights an important conceptual link between probabilistic\n  variational methods and information theoretic methods, showing that dropout\ncan be generalized using both formalisms to arrive at very similar models.\n- The presentation of the model is excellent.\n- The experimental results on cluttered MNIST are impressive.\n\nWeaknesses\n- The results on CIFAR-10 in Figure 3(b) seem to be on a validation set (unless\n  the axis label is a typo). It is not clear why the test set was not used. This\nmakes it hard to compare to results reported in Springenberg et al, as well as\nother results in literature.\n\nQuality\nThe theoretical exposition is high quality. Figure 2 gives a nice qualitative\nassessment of what the model is doing. However, the experimental results\nsection can be made better, for example, by matching the results on CIFAR-10 as\nreported in Springenberg et al. and trying to improve on those using information\ndropout.\n\nClarity\nThe paper is well written and easy to follow.\n\nOriginality\nThe derivation of the information dropout optimization problem using IB\nLagrangian is novel. However, the final model is quite close to variational\ndropout.\n\nSignificance\nThis paper will be of general interest to researchers in representation learning\nbecause it highlights an alternative way to think about latent variables (as\ninformation bottlenecks). However, unless the model can be shown to achieve\nsignificant improvements over simple dropout, its wider impact is likely to be\nlimited.\n\nOverall\nThe paper presents an insightful theoretical derivation and good preliminary\nresults. The experimental section can be improved.\n\nMinor comments and suggestions -\n- expecially -> especially\n- trough -> through\n- There is probably a minus sign missing in the expression for H(y|z) above Eq (2).\n- Figure 3(a) has error bars, but 3(b) doesn't. It might be a good idea to have those\nfor Figure 3(b) as well.\n- Please consider comparing Figure 2 with the activity map of a standard CNN\n  trained with binary dropout, so we can see if similar filtering out is\nhappening there already.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Information Dropout: learning optimal representations through noise", "abstract": "We introduce Information Dropout, a generalization of dropout that is motivated by the Information Bottleneck principle and highlights the way in which injecting noise in the activations can help in learning optimal representations of the data.
