The proof is as follows:\n1/b \u2211-p_i log(p_i) = 1/b \u2211 ( -e^(b*x_i)/\u2211e^(b*x_j) ) * log( e^(b*x_i)/\u2211e^(b*x_j) )\n                               = 1/b \u2211 ( -e^(b*x_i)/\u2211e^(b*x_j) ) * ( b*x_i - log( \u2211e^(b*x_j) ) ) )\n                               = -\u2211 ( ( e^(b*x_i) * x_i ) / \u2211e^(b*x_j) ) + 1/b * log( \u2211e^(b*x_j) )\n                               = -boltz_b(X) + L_b(X)\n\nAs L_b(X) \u2265 boltz_b(X), we have | L_b(X) - boltz_b(X) | = 1/b \u2211-p_i log(p_i), where the right hand side is equal to the entropy of the Boltzmann distribution.

This time-varying operator replaces the traditional max operator. The authors show empirical performance gains of DBS+Q-learning over Q-learning in a gridworld and DBS+DQN over DQN on Atari games.\n\nNovelty: (1) The error bound of value iteration with the Boltzmann softmax operator and convergence & convergence rate results in this setting seem novel. (2) The novelty of the dynamic Boltzmann operator is somewhat thin, as (Singh et al. 2000) show that a dynamic weighting of the Boltzmann operator achieves convergence to the optimal value function in SARSA(0). In that work, the weighting is state-dependent, so the main algorithmic novelty in this paper is removing the dependence on state visitation for the beta parameter by making it solely dependent on time. A question for the authors: How does the proof in this work relate to / differ from the convergence proofs in (Singh et al. 2000)?\n\nClarity: In the DBS Q-learning algorithm, it is unclear under which policy actions are selected, e.g. using epsilon-greedy/epsilon-Boltzmann versus using the Boltzmann distribution applied to the Q(s, a) values. If the Boltzmann distribution is used then the algorithm that is presented is in fact expected SARSA and not Q-learning. The paper would benefit from making this clear.\n\nSoundness: (1) The proof of Theorem 4 implicitly assumes that all states are visited infinitely often, which is not necessarily true with the given algorithm (if the policy used to select actions is the Boltzmann policy). (2) The proof of Theorem 1 uses the fact that |L(Q) - max(Q)| <= log(|A|) / beta, which is not immediately clear from the result cited in McKay (2003). (3) The paper claims in the introduction that \u201cthe non-expansive property is vital to guarantee \u2026 the convergence of the learning algorithm.\u201d This is not necessarily the case -- see Bellemare et al., Increasing the Action Gap: New Operators for Reinforcement Learning, 2016. \n\nQuality: (1) I appreciate that the authors evaluated their method on the suite of 49 Atari games. This said, the increase in median performance is relatively small, the delta being about half that of the increase due to double DQN. The improvement in mean score in great part stems from a large improvement occurs on Atlantis.\n\nThere are also a number of experimental details that are missing. Is the only change from DQN the change in update rule, while keeping the epsilon-greedy rule? In this case, I find a disconnect between the stated goal (to trade off exploration and exploitation) and the results. Why would we expect the Boltzmann softmax to work better when combined to epsilon-greedy? If not, can you give more details e.g. how beta was annealed over time, etc.?\n\nFinally, can you briefly compare your algorithm to the temperature scheduling method described in Fox et al., Taming the Noise in Reinforcement Learning via Soft Updates, 2016?\n\nAdditional Comments:\n(1) It would be helpful to have Atari results provided in raw game scores in addition to the human-normalized scores (Figure 5). (2) The human normalized scores listed in Figure 5 for DQN are different than the ones listed in the Double DQN paper (Van Hasselt et al, 2016). (3) For the DBS-DQN algorithm, the authors set beta_t = ct^2 - how is the value of c determined? (4) Text in legends and axes of Figure 1 and Figure 2 plots is very small. (5) Typo: citation for MacKay - Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms - author name listed twice.\n\nSimilarly, if the main contribution is DBS, it would be interesting to have a more in-depth empirical analysis of the method -- how does performance (in Atari or otherwise) vary with the temperature schedule, how exploration is affected, etc.?\n\nAfter reading the other reviews and responses, I still think the paper needs further improvement before it can published.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper839/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "A Convergent Variant of the Boltzmann Softmax Operator in Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "The Boltzmann softmax operator can trade-off well between exploration and exploitation according to current estimation in an exponential weighting scheme, which is a promising way to address the exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning.

Although error bounds of value iteration with the traditional max operator is well-established, there\u2019s no results for the Boltzmann softmax operator which violates the property of non-expansion. \n\nIn Theorem 1, we propose a novel analysis to characterize the error bound of the Boltzmann operator when applied in value iteration.

Please find our responses as below, especially for the novelty of the work.\n\nQ1: The novelty of the DBS operator.\nA1: First of all, thank you for viewing our analysis for DBS novel. As we mentioned in the paper and showed by the corresponding title, we mainly aim to enable the convergence of the widely-used Boltzmann operator by a better exploration-exploitation trade-off, which is dispensable for reinforcement learning. As far as we know, it is the first time that we find a variant of the Boltzmann operator with good convergence rate.\n\nAlthough the state-dependent weighting of Boltzmann operator is proposed in (Singh et al. 2000), our DBS operator is state-independent and can scale to high-dimensional state space, which is crucial for RL algorithms. Furthermore, their operator is for on-policy RL algorithm, i.e. SARSA, while our DBS is for value iteration (a basic algorithm to solve the MDP) and Q-learning (a more popular off-policy RL algorithm). Therefore, our Q-learning algorithm with DBS is novel.\n\nDue to the difference of our algorithms and that in (Singh et al. 2000), we develop new techniques to prove the convergence. Specifically, for value iteration, we propose a novel analysis to characterize the error bound of value iteration with the Boltzmann operator, prove the convergence and present convergence rate analysis; for Q-learning, we leverage the stochastic approximation lemma (SA Lemma) presented in (Singh et al. 2000), which is an extension of the classic stochastic approximation theorem proven in (Jaakkola et al. 1994), to relate the process to the well-defined stochastic process in SA Lemma and then we quantify the additional term using similar techniques in our Theorem 1. Our results of value iteration have little relation with (Singh et al. 2000) and are mainly based on our own analysis (Proposition 1, Theorem 1, Theorem 2, and Theorem).\n\nQ2: What is the action selection policy? The states should be visited infinitely.\nA2: In our DBS Q-learning algorithm, the action selection policy is epsilon-greedy. Thus, states will be visited infinitely often. We make it clearer in the updated version.\n\nPlease note that, the exploration-exploitation dilemma here is related to value function optimization (Asadi et al. 2017), rather than the traditional view of exploring the environment and exploiting the action during the action selection process. In stochastic environments, the max operator updates the value estimator in a \u2018hard\u2019 way by greedily summarizing action-value functions according to current estimation. However, this may not be accurate due to noise in the environment. Even in deterministic environments, this may not be accurate either. This is because the estimate for the value is not correct in the early stage of the learning process. We elaborate the effect of exploration and added empirical study in the updated version, please refer to Section 5.1.\n\nQ3: |L(Q) - max(Q)| <= log(A||) / beta is not immediately clear.\nA3: We give more details of the proof in the updated version, please refer to Appendix B.\n\nQ4: Non-expansion is not necessary for convergence.\nA4: Yes, non-expansion is an important and widely-used sufficient condition to guarantee the convergence of the learning problem (Littman 1996, Asadi et al. 2017). In this understanding, we say non-expansion is \u2018vital\u2019 for convergence. (Bellemare et al. 2016) proposed an alternative sufficient condition different from the non-expansion property. However, the condition is still not enough to cover common operators violating non-expansion such as the Boltzmann softmax operator. \n\nQ5: Detailed comments for the experiment. \nA5: Here are our quick feedbacks.\n1) We compare with G-learning and analyze the effect in the updated version (Section 5.1).\n2) We change the score to raw game scores in the updated version (Appendix H). \n3) Please note that our score listed is exactly the same with \u2018Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning\u2019 and \u2018Rainbow\u2019, where the (original) scores for DQN are raw scores. \n4) In our experiments, c is in [0, 1], and we have tuned the value of c in some of the games. This is because different games have different features and should have different values of c.\n5) We have redrawn the plots to make it more reader-friendly and corrected some typos in the updated version."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper839/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper839/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper839/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Convergent Variant of the Boltzmann Softmax Operator in Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "The Boltzmann softmax operator can trade-off well between exploration and exploitation according to current estimation in an exponential weighting scheme, which is a promising way to address the exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning.

The looseness with which this paper uses 'exploration-exploitation tradeoff' is worrying. This paper does not attack that tradeoff at all really, since the tradeoff in RL concerns exploitation of understood knowledge vs deep-directed exploration, rather than just annealing between the max action and the mean over all actions (which does not incorporate any notion of uncertainty). Though I do recognize that the field overall is loose in this respect,  I do think this paper needs to rewrite its claims significantly. In fact it can be shown that Boltzmann exploration that incorporates a particular annealing schedule (but no notion of uncertainty) can be forced to suffer essentially linear regret even in the simple bandit case (O(T^(1-eps)) for any eps > 0) which of course means that it doesn't explore efficiently at all (see Singh 2000, Cesa-Bianchi 2017). Theorem 4 does not imply efficient exploration, since it requires very strong conditions on the alphas, and note that the same proof applies to vanilla Q-learning, which we know does not explore well.\n\nI presume the title of this paper is a homage to the recent 'Boltzmann Exploration Done Right' paper, however, though the paper is cited, it is not discussed at all. That paper proved a strong regret bound for Boltzmann-like exploration in the bandit case, which this paper actually does not for the RL case, so in some sense the homage is misplaced. Another recent paper that actually does prove a regret bound for a Boltzmann policy for RL is 'Variational Bayesian Reinforcement Learning with Regret Bounds', which also anneals the temperature, this should be mentioned.\n\nAll this is not to say that the paper is without merit, just that the main claims about exploration are not valid and consequently it needs to be repositioned.

We also present convergence rate analysis of the algorithm.\nUsing Q-learning as an application, we show that the DBS operator can be applied in a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the DBS operator in a toy problem called GridWorld and a suite of Atari games. Experimental results show that outperforms DQN substantially in benchmark games.", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Boltzmann Softmax Operator", "Value Function Estimation"], "authorids": ["v-lip@microsoft.com", "cqp14@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn", "v-qimeng@microsoft.com", "wche@microsoft.com", "tie-yan.liu@microsoft.com"], "authors": ["Ling Pan", "Qingpeng Cai", "Qi Meng", "Wei Chen", "Tie-Yan Liu"], "pdf": "/pdf/29e7e036064114b61e1574b91a9ed0a5f28f2dd1.pdf", "paperhash": "pan|a_convergent_variant_of_the_boltzmann_softmax_operator_in_reinforcement_learning", "_bibtex": "@misc{\npan2019a,\ntitle={A Convergent Variant of the Boltzmann Softmax Operator in Reinforcement Learning},\nauthor={Ling Pan and Qingpeng Cai and Qi Meng and Wei Chen and Tie-Yan Liu},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1MhpiRqFm},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper839/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234365122, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "B1MhpiRqFm", "replyto": "B1MhpiRqFm", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper839/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335814208, "tmdate": 1552335814208, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper839/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 13}
