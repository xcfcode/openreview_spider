One reviewer complained that experiments were limited to small English datasets PTB and Wikitext-2 and asked why they didn't try \"machine translation or speech recognition\". (The author's note that they did try the Linzen dataset, and while the reviewers found the experiments impressive, the task itself felt artificial) . Another felt that the \"multipop model\" alone was not too large a contribution. The actual experiments in the work are well done, although given the fact that the models are known there was expectation of \"more \"in-depth\" analysis of the different models\".

The second main contribution of the paper is to propose an extension of continuous stacks, which allows to perform multiple pop operations at a single time step.\nThe way to do that is to use a similar mechanism as the adaptive computation time from Graves (2016): all the pop operations are performed, and the final state of the continuous stack is weighted average of all the intermediate states. The different memory models are evaluated on two standard language modeling tasks: PTB and WikiText-2, as well as on the verb number prediction dataset from Linzen et al (2016). On the language modeling tasks, the stack model performs slightly better than the attention models (0-2 ppl points) which performs slightly better than the plain LSTM (2-3 ppl). On the verb number prediction tasks, the stack model tends to outperforms the two other models (which get similar results) for hard examples (2 or more attractors).\n\nOverall, I enjoy reading this paper: it is clearly written, and contains interesting analysis of different memory architecture for recurrent neural networks. As far as I know, it is the first thorough comparison of the different memory architecture for recurrent neural network applied to language modeling. The experiments on the Linzen et al. (2016) dataset is also interesting, as it shows that for hard examples, the different models do have different behavior (even when the difference are not noticeable on the whole test set).\n\nOne small negative aspect of the paper is that the substance might be a bit limited. The only technical contribution is to merge the ideas from the continuous stack with the adaptive computation time to obtain the \"multi-pop\" model. In the experimental section, which I believe is the main contribution of the paper, I would have liked to see more \"in-depth\" analysis of the different models. I found the experiments performed on the Linzen et al. (2016) dataset (Table 2) to be quite interesting, and would have liked more analysis like that. On the other hand, I found Figures 2 or 3 not very informative, as it is (would like to see more). For example, from Fig. 2, it would be interesting to get a better understanding of what errors are made by the different models (instead of just the distribution).\n\nFinally, I have a few questions for the authors:\n- In Figure 1. shouldn't there be an arrow from h_{t-1} to m_t instead of x_{t-1} to m_t?\n- What are the equations to update the stack? I assume something similar to Joulin & Mikolov (2015)?\n- Do you have any ideas why there is a sharp jump between 4 and 5 attractors (Table 2)?\n- Why no \"pop\" operations in Figure 3 and 4?\n\npros/cons:\n+ clear and easy to read\n+ interesting analysis\n- not very original\n\nOverall, while not groundbreaking, this is a serious paper with interesting analysis. Hence, I am weakly recommending to accept this paper.", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Memory Architectures in Recurrent Neural Network Language Models", "abstract": "We compare and analyze sequential, random access, and stack memory architectures for recurrent neural network language models.

Based on your suggestion, we have added examples of mistakes made by competing models in the Linzen experiment instead of just the Venn diagram (Table 3).\n\nAnswers to your specific questions:\n- In Figure 1. shouldn't there be an arrow from h_{t-1} to m_t instead of x_{t-1} to m_t?\nThanks for pointing this out. You are correct, we have updated the figure to fix the arrow. \n\n- What are the equations to update the stack? I assume something similar to Joulin & Mikolov (2015)?\nThe equation to update the stack is given in Equation 1 (page 4).\n\n- Do you have any ideas why there is a sharp jump between 4 and 5 attractors (Table 2)?\nWe think that there are two main reasons that could explain the sharp jump. \nThe first one is because there are much fewer test examples in the dataset with 5 attractors (~150) compared to 4 attractors and above (400, 1100, 3800, ...), so the standard error on the reported accuracy is also higher (e.g., 91.6 +/- 1.2 and 88.0 +- 2.6 for the stack model with 4 and 5 attractors respectively).\nAnother reason could be that sentences with more attractors are much longer than sentences with fewer attractors, so the difficulty increases non linearly as the number of attractors increases.\n\n- Why no \"pop\" operations in Figure 3 and 4?\nThe \"pop\" operations are shown in the x axis (number of pops). Each pair of red and blue bars represents a single pop number.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Memory Architectures in Recurrent Neural Network Language Models", "abstract": "We compare and analyze sequential, random access, and stack memory architectures for recurrent neural network language models.
