Here are some questions:\n\n1. The argument about ALI and ALICE in the second paragraph of the introduction, \u201c\u2026 by introducing a reconstruction loss in the form of a discriminator which classifies pairs (x, x) and (x, G(E(x)))\u201d, however, in ALI and ALICE, they use one discriminator to classify pairs (z, x) and (z, G(z)). Therefore, \u201c\u2026 the discriminator tends to detect the fake pair (x, G(E(x))) just by checking the identity of x and G(E(x)) which leads to vanishing gradients\u201d is problematic. Therefore, the motivation in the introduction may be some modification.\n\n2. The authors failed to compare their model with SVAE [1] and MINE [2], which are improved versions of ALICE. And we also have other ways to match the distribution such as Triple-GAN [3] and Triangle-GAN [4], I think the authors need to run some comparison experiments.\n\n3. The authors should discuss more about the augment mapping a(x), i.e., how to choose a(x). I think this is quite important for this paper. At least some empirical results and analysis, for example, how inception score / FID score changes when using different choices of a(x).\n\n4. This paper claims that the proposed method can make the training more robust, but there is no such experiment results to support the argument.\n\n[1] chen et al.

We will address each your question below:\n\n> There is one theoretical issue for the defined \"reconstruction\" loss (for JS and f-divergences). Because decoder(encoder(x)) is a deterministic function of x, this means p(y|x) is a delta function. With r(y|x) another delta function (even that is not delta(y=x)), with probability 1 we will have mismatched supports between p(y|x) and r(y|x).\n\nIt appears that there is a misunderstanding. In Section 5 we notice that encoder is stochastic and has a fully factorized Gaussian distribution. Therefore, decoder(encoder(x)) is a stochastic function, too. The conditional distribution r(y|x) is not a delta function because we use the stochastic augment mapping a(x) (the combination of reflecting pad and the random crop). As a result, supports of distributions p(y|x) and r(y|x) have non-empty intersection and Jensen-Shanon divergence is defined correctly for them. \n\n> I think another big issue for the paper is the lack of discussion on how to choose r(y|x), or equivalently, a(x).\n\nWe agree with you that there should be more discussion on how to choose the augmentation function a(x) and more experiments with different type of augmentations.\n\nIndeed, the choice of the augment mapping a(x) can significantly impact PAGAN performance. We analyzed another augmentations such as a Gaussian blur and a random contrast normalization before we chose the augment function a(x) mentioned in the paper. As a result, we selected a combination of reflecting pad and the random crop based on the visual judgment of generated samples and reconstructions. We have added a new subsection \"Choice of Augmentation\" to Section 5 where we provide experiments with other types of augmentations as well as with different padding width for the pad-crop augmentation type. We also add some discussion on intuition behind selecting the most efficient augmentation.

We will address each your question below:\n\n1. > Therefore, the motivation in the introduction may be some modification.\n\nIt appears that there is a misunderstanding. It is true that in ALI and ALICE, they use one discriminator to classify pairs (z, x) and (z, G(z)). However, this paragraph was devoted to the ALICE paper where authors introduced an additional cycle consistency term in the eq. (8) in the form of adversarially learned discriminator on pairs (x, x) and (x, G(E(x))). Later in the Proposition 1 they showed the degeneracy of the straightforward approach: the discriminator tends to learn delta(x-G(E(x))) classification rule. One of the motivation of using the augmentation is to avoid this issue and to allow the discriminator to distinguish pairs based not on the raw pixels but on the high level features which capture the perceptual similarity of images.\n\n2. > The authors failed to compare their model with SVAE [1] and MINE [2], which are improved versions of ALICE. And we also have other ways to match the distribution such as Triple-GAN [3] and Triangle-GAN [4], I think the authors need to run some comparison experiments.\n\nThank you for pointing out these recent papers we missed to cite and compare to. We discuss each paper below. \n\nTriple-GAN and Triangle-GAN are semi-supervised generative adversarial models. Triple-GAN allows a class conditional generation, Triangle-GAN is applied for cross-domain joint distribution matching. However, these models do not have an encoder part and are not fully unsupervised. In our paper, we compare the proposed method only with other unsupervised bidirectional GANs. Therefore, we do not consider Triple-GAN and Triangle-GAN as our baselines. \n\nMINE is an improved version of ALICE model. Unfortunately, in the original paper, authors do not provide results for CIFAR10 dataset. It is hard to reproduce them because the source code of the method is not provided. \n\nSVAE is a generative model which improves the variational auto-encoder (VAE). It is closely related to our work. We have added quantitative comparisons with SVAE to a new version of the paper (see Table 1, Table 2). \n\n3. >  The authors should discuss more about the augment mapping a(x), i.e., how to choose a(x). I think this is quite important for this paper. At least some empirical results and analysis, for example, how inception score / FID score changes when using different choices of a(x).\n\nIndeed, the choice of the augment mapping a(x) can significantly impact PAGAN performance. We analyzed another augmentations such as a Gaussian blur and a random contrast normalization before we chose the augment function a(x) mentioned in the paper. As a result, we selected a combination of reflecting pad and the random crop based on the visual judgment of generated samples and reconstructions. We have added a new subsection \"Choice of Augmentation\" to Section 5 where we provide experiments with other types of augmentations as well as with different padding width for the pad-crop augmentation type. We also add some discussion on intuition behind selecting the most efficient augmentation. \n\n4. > This paper claims that the proposed method can make the training more robust, but there is no such experiment results to support the argument.\n\nAs we understand, this question relates to the following quote from the paper: \"To ensure good reconstructions, we introduce an augmented adversarial reconstruction loss ... This enforces the discriminator to take into account content invariant to the augmentation, thus making training more robust.\" So, we claim that the augmented pairs (x, a(x)) in contrast to pairs (x, x) allow the discriminator not to degrade to a delta function, thus making training more robust. We empirically support this argument by the experiment provided in subsection \"Importance of augmentation\" in Section 5 and in Table 3 where we compare the model with augmented pairs (x, a(x)) versus the model with pairs (x, x). \n\n[1] chen et al.

The main concern you raised is about the novelty of the paper. We will address each point of the review below:\n\n> Comparing to the existing works, the main contribution is the introducing of an augmented reconstruction loss by training a discriminator to distinguish the augmentation data from the reconstructed data.\n\nThe summary of our contribution is accurate at a high-level. Just to be sure that there is no misunderstanding we add the key detail: the discriminator distinguishes pairs (x, a(x)) from the pairs (x, G(E(x))) where x is a real object, a(x) is its augmentation and G(E(x)) is its reconstruction. Adding x as the first element in each pair is crucial because it ensures that reconstructions G(E(x)) will correspond to the source object x. Otherwise, if we classify just the augmentation data a(x) from the reconstructions G(E(x)) instead of pairs the auto-encoding model will not be penalized for incorrect reconstructions. \n\n> The techniques used to train a bidirectional GAN are very standard. The only new stuff may be is the proposed reconstruction loss defined on augmented samples and reconstructed ones. But this is also not a big contribution, seems just using a slightly different way to guarantee reconstruction.\n\nIt is true that the key distinction of our method from other algorithms of training a bidirectional GAN is the proposed adversarial reconstruction loss defined on pairs. Despite the simplicity of the concept, to the best of our knowledge it is the first successful attempt of applying the content-aware trainable distance between two images. \n\nOther approaches [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] mainly utilize standard L1 and L2 distances which lead to undesirable artifacts and blurriness in reconstructions. In ALICE [6] paper authors consider a discriminator on pairs (x, x) and (x, G(E(x)) without augmentation and mention that it degrades to a delta function which is even worse than L1 and L2. Our proposed augmentation allows for the discriminator to classify pairs based not on the pixels but on the content of the image which is invariant to the augmentation. \n\nIn the paper, the main motivation of the adversarial reconstruction loss over the standard pixel-wise losses is as follows: the latter match images in the space of pixels which is highly noisy and does not capture perceptual similarity while the proposed loss matches images in the space of high level features learned by the discriminator on pairs. In experiments, we show that introducing the adversarial reconstruction loss instead of L1 distance significantly improves both the visual quality of generated images and reconstructions and standard metrics such as Inception Score and Frechet Inception Distance. Therefore, we argue that the proposed loss is conceptually very different from the standard pixel-wise losses. \n\nAdditionally, we want to notice that in the paper we introduce a novel metric Reconstruction Inception Dissimilarity (RID) as alternative to the standard RMSE. We empirically show that RID is more robust to content-preserving transformations and captures perceptual similarity between source image and its reconstruction rather than a pixel-wise coincidence. \n\n[1] Variational Approaches for Auto-Encoding Generative Adversarial Networks, \\\\ https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04987\n[2] It Takes (Only) Two: Adversarial Generator-Encoder Networks, https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02304\n[3] Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks, https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593\n[4] Neural Photo Editing with Introspective Adversarial Networks, https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07093\n[5] Wasserstein Auto-Encoders, https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01558\n[6] ALICE: Towards Understanding Adversarial Learning for Joint Distribution Matching, https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01215"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper876/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper876/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper876/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "PAIRWISE AUGMENTED GANS WITH ADVERSARIAL RECONSTRUCTION LOSS", "abstract": "We propose a novel autoencoding model called Pairwise Augmented GANs.

To do so, the authors define an auxiliary variable y, and then derive a GAN loss to discriminate between (x, y) and (x, decoder(encoder(x))). The algorithm is completed by combining this adversarial \"reconstruction\" loss with adversarial loss functions that encourages the matching of marginal distributions for both the observed variable x and the latent variable z. \n\nExperiments present quite a lot of comparisons to existing methods as well as an ablation study on the proposed \"reconstruction\" loss. Improvements has been shown on reconstructing input images with significant numbers.\n\nOverall I think the idea is new and useful, but is quite straight-forward and has some theoretical issues (see below). The propositions presented in the paper are quite standard results derived from the original GAN paper, so for that part the contribution is incremental and less interesting. The paper is overall well written, although the description of the augmented distribution r(y|x) is very rush and unclear to me.\n\nThere is one theoretical issue for the defined \"reconstruction\" loss (for JS and f-divergences). Because decoder(encoder(x)) is a deterministic function of x, this means p(y|x) is a delta function. With r(y|x) another delta function (even that is not delta(y=x)), with probability 1 we will have mismatched supports between p(y|x) and r(y|x). \n\nThis is also the problem of the original GAN, although in practice the original GAN with very careful tuning seem to be OK... Also it can be addressed by say instance noise or convolving the two distributions with a Gaussian, see [1][2].\n\nI think another big issue for the paper is the lack of discussion on how to choose r(y|x), or equivalently, a(x). \n\n1. Indeed matching p_{\\theta}(x) to p^*(x) and q(z) to p(z) does not necessarily returns a good auto-encoder that makes x \\approx decoder(encoder(x)). Therefore the augmented distribution r(y|x) also guides the learning of p(y|x) and with appropriately chosen r(y|x) the auto-encoder can be further improved.\n\n2. The authors mentioned that picking r(y|x) = \\delta(y = x) will result in unstable training. But there's no discussion on how to choose r(y|x), apart from a short sentence in experimental section \"...we used a combination of reflecting 10% pad and the random crop to the same image size...\". Why this specific choice? Since I would imagine the distribution r(y|x) has significant impact on the results of PAGAN, I would actually prefer to see an in-depth study of the choice of this distribution, either theoretically or empirically. \n\nIn summary, the proposed idea is new but straight-forward. The experimental section contains lots of results, but the ablation study by just removing the augmentation cannot fully justify the optimality of the chosen a(x). I would encourage the authors to consider the questions I raised and conduct extra study on them. I believe it will be a significant contribution to the community (e.g. in the sense of connecting GAN literature and denoising methods literature).\n\n[1] Sonderby et al.

We train a generator and an encoder jointly and in an adversarial manner. The generator network learns to sample realistic objects. In turn, the encoder network at the same time is trained to map the true data distribution to the prior in  latent space. To ensure good reconstructions, we introduce an augmented adversarial reconstruction loss. Here we train a discriminator to distinguish two types of pairs: an object with its augmentation and the one with its reconstruction. We show that such adversarial loss compares objects based on the content rather than on the exact match. We experimentally demonstrate that our model generates samples and reconstructions of quality competitive with state-of-the-art on datasets MNIST, CIFAR10, CelebA and achieves good quantitative results on CIFAR10.
