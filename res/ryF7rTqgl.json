However, this extreme situation should be very rare, and in practice (so far) we have never encountered a situation where the intermediate layers were useless but the final layer was suddenly very good. It seems to follow a smoother transition instead.\n\nIn fact, one should also look at this the other way around. Let's say that we had a binary classification task, and we conjectured that some intermediate layer (or branch) was useless, that it contained no information. If we measured that we could get 80% correct classification with a linear classifier probe on its features, then we should quickly revise our opinion about that layer. There is basically no way to say that features contain no information when a linear classifier probe gets 80% correct on a (balanced) binary classification task. Regardless of what constitutes \"information\", we claim that it can at least be detected in that way.\n\nNow, we are not claiming that our measurement of \"information\" is absolute in any way. We are trying to illustrate that it's a useful concept to analyze a model and understand what's happening.\n\n\nIn the case of the skip connection (Figure 8), the model was selected to be pathological. It was a case where a model was designed to be too deep, and the skip connection seemed to fix the problem at first, but we can reveal the fact that there is still a problem with the model. Half of the model is dead, and that's not a good use of skip connections.\n\nWe are not trying to undermine skip connections, and certainly not suggest that Resnet is bad. Our point is that *sometimes* skip connections are bad, and then we can diagnose that bad behavior by using linear classifier probes.\n\nThis is a subject in which we want to strive to make the paper clearer. We are indeed showing certain model based on the fact that they are bad, because that's one of the situations where linear classifier probes will shine. We want to talk about linear classifier probes, and all the models shown in the paper are just case studies to illustrate the role of probes."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Understanding intermediate layers using linear classifier probes", "abstract": "Neural network models have a reputation for being black boxes.

More analysis/intuition will come by using the tool (i.e. linear classifier probes).\n\nAs for problem 2. we agree that it would be great to have a case of \"practical use\" where a new counter-intuitive model was discovered based on an analysis with linear classifier probes.

These are good observations. I hope that I can clarify some things about our paper and our motivations.\n\n\nYou are certainly correct in saying that this paper overlaps with the DeCAF paper. I will admit that I missed that paper and I will absolutely make sure that I refer to it in ours. From my reading of the DeCAF paper, it is more about transferability of features from one dataset to another. They compare their features with those of SURF.\n\n\nIn our particular case, we are not seeking to argue that the intermediate features are useful. That has been demonstrated often, as you point out. We are interested in looking at those features at all layers, and at multiple times during training. The DeCAF paper is more interested in finding out which layer has the best features, and it is not concerned the temporal aspect of training.\n\nYou list a collection of other well-known conclusions, and again we are not claiming that those are novel. The contribution of our paper comes from suggesting a tool to observe these behaviours in better light. Visualizing something more clearly should come as pre-requisite for better explanations. The animations showing the \u201cdomino effect\u201d in probe performance are something that we have not seen anywhere else, and we would argue that they help with our intuition about the models.\n\nMany models picked in our paper were pathological by design. Our point is that we can immediately see the pathology by using linear classifier probes. We are not arguing in favour or against skip connections. We are not making suggestions for model design in general. This is not in the scope of the paper. The reason why we use classification instead of other tasks is because it is a good starting point, and it can be entirely sufficient to illustrate the concept. We certainly have ideas about how to apply this to other settings (ex : denoising auto-encoders).\n\n\nWe are suggesting the word \u201cinformation\u201d for the discussion in the context of this paper. But we would certainly not try to overwrite the definition of information as Shannon entropy. We were looking for a useful concept to help with our intuitive understanding of the internal dynamics of deep models, and we though that linear classifier probes were a good way to achieve that. They are certainly not universal / general enough to the point where we could provide a strong theoretical justification to argue that they are \u201cabsolute\u201d. To us, the question was : looking at the plots and the animations, did we feel that we had a better understanding of the model by plotting the probe performances ?"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Understanding intermediate layers using linear classifier probes", "abstract": "Neural network models have a reputation for being black boxes.

They are all well-known conclusions, and more comprehensive discussions have been made in previous work. Can the linear classifier probe provide some new explanations for these phenomena? Based on the paper's observations, can we get some new clues to design better neural network architectures?\nThe analysis in this paper is all for classification network. Can the linear classifier probe be useful for non-classification model, e.g., image generation networks, regression-based localization networks?\nI got a feeling that this paper somewhat wants to overwrite the definition of information, as a particular technical term, using the linear classifier. However, the linear classifier is a particular discriminative formulation driven by particular loss function and particular data. Is it general enough as a measurement for information? And is it possible to provide some theoretical justification.\nIn general, the intro arguments of this paper is reasonable to me, but I have the above questions about the technical soundness and significance.

A lot of people suggested this approach because this is how it's done in some other models with skip connections. The reason why we used concatenation was to make sure that the combination of the two layers was \"equally or strictly more informative\". If the signal from either layer was unusable, then it would not get any kind of feedback. We agree that it's a good idea to use addition instead, or that it would have been interesting to run another experiment with addition. Part of the reason why we included this model in the paper was to demonstrate a pathological behavior that could be debugged properly by using linear classification probes. One could say that the model was meant to be broken in some way. It's not about the models; it's about how you can now see inside the models.\n\n\nConcerning the Inception experiment, this was one of the suggestions that we received. We can either project to a lower dimension by taking a linear transformation, or by taking a random subset of the features. We have to note that we don't want to have \"second-order probes\" where there is a non-linearity inside the probes. This would ruin the convexity of the probes (which is nice to have).\n\nHowever, a trained linear projection to a lower subspace could still be used. Let's say that we have 1.5 million features and 1000 classes. We want to avoid 1.5x10^6 times 1000 classes. If we project to a lower-dimension space this means that it has to be of dimension less than 1000. Otherwise it would be pointless since we would still have the same huge matrices. Can be project down to 100 ? We still have a big-but-manageable matrix in that case. How about down to 10 dimensions ? This is getting ridiculous at this point. One solution would be to have some kind of sparsity so not all inputs would be used. In that case, the projection would be a feasible idea.\n\nWe could project groups of features together, and I believe that this is why you're mentioning pooling. It seems like one way to do it. We would still need to pick some kind of schema to bunch features together into a kind of multi-stage linear operation. In a way, this structure enforces sparsity.
