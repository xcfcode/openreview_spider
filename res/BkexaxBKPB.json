Concretely, the paper looks at two problems: 1) given independently pretrained word embeddings from K corpora, finding a common word embdding, 2) extracting document representations from a discriminator of a GAN trained to generate tf-idf vectors. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed approaches outperform baseline classifiers trained with word2vec.\n\n\nStrengths\n+ The paper clearly mentions all the experimental details\n+ The paper has a nice set of qualitative examples that probe what the proposed model is learning\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\n* It is not clear what problem the paper is trying to solve. Is the goal to get better document representations, in which case why do we think that using a GAN is a good idea. Learning a generative model to use representations for a downstream task seems like a pretty roundabout way of doing things (if we dont care about generating anything in the first place). Further, if better document representations are desired then the paper should compare to works like Bert (Devlin et.al. [1]).\n\n* Sec. 3.1: Calling the proposed weGAN model a GAN seems a bit inconsistent/ wrong. The proposed model is not a generative adversarial network, there is no sampling of a noise or a notion of a generative distribution. The real data, similar to the image case is a bunch of samples from the data distribution (where the stochasticity comes not from the word embeddings but from the tf-idf of thte document), but the generator also uses the tf-idf representation, so essentially both the generator as well as the real world data use the document as an input. Hence it feels like a somewhat odd model formulation, which would be nice to clarify / explain.\n\n* Further, it is not clear why one would want to train \u201ccross-corpus\u201d embeddings in the way describeed in Sec. 3. 1. Why not just train word2vec on the union of all the corpora (instead of per-corpus) and use it as the word representation? What are the conditions in which one would not want to do the common word representation?\n\n* Sec. 3.2: Why not formulate modeling multiple corpora in the spirit of CoGAN (Liu and Tuzel, 2016), by getting M discriminators (potentially with parameter sharing) to solve binary classification tasks as opposed to the 2M way classification problem? Atleast a comparison to an approach like this seems warranted. Further, it is not clear why one would want to generate tf-idf vectors. It seems like all the experiments are around representation learning and classification as opposed to generating or evaluating tf-idf vectors for documents. \n\n* As a side note, for the experiments concerning deGAN vs the baseline, it would be nice to check what happens when the last classification layer is not initialized with LDA parameters. Since that is an additional source of information. \n\nReferences\n[1]: Devlin, Jacob, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova. 2018. \u201cBERT: Pre-Training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding.\u201d arXiv [cs.CL]. arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2561/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2561/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["d-klabjan@northwestern.edu", "baiyang@u.northwestern.edu"], "title": "Generative Adversarial Nets for Multiple Text Corpora", "authors": ["Diego Klabjan", "Baiyang Wang"], "TL;DR": "Constructing robust embeddings by means of GANs from multiple corpora", "abstract": "Generative adversarial nets (GANs) have been successfully applied to the artificial generation of image data.

The first model, weGAN, aggregates multiple sets of single-corpus word2vec embeddings into one set of cross-corpus word representations; document embeddings are a function of these updated word embeddings. The second model, deGAN, side-steps word-level embeddings and directly generates document-level representations. For both models, the real examples come from word2vec and tf-idf, while the artificial examples are the ones generated by the network. The authors show that their document embeddings are better than the word2vec/tf-idf baseline at clustering documents according to the corpus they originate from.\n\nWhile the context in which GANs are used is novel and creative, the reasons for rejection outweigh the positives. The main reason is the fact that the paper is outdated by two/three years. There is no mention of the shift towards contextual embeddings that has been happening in the last few years (InferSent, ELMo, BERT) and that became ubiquitous in NLP.  Instead, all comparisons are against word2vec (published in 2013) that is no longer a relevant baseline, even for non-contextual word embeddings. In fact, the newest cited papers are from 2017. The Github link in the paper was last updated on 23rd December 2017. My objection is not that this work was started a long time ago, but that it has not been updated in years. In the lack of proper comparison against more novel techniques, it is hard to estimate whether the reported gains over word2vec are meaningful.\n\nAnother argument for rejection is the fact that the experimental section does not make a convincing case that the positive results matter beyond the very specific datasets and tasks selected.\n\nBefore commenting in more detail on the selection of datasets, tasks and metrics, I want to document my understanding of the experimental setup; I found it non-trivial to understand what constitutes a \"single corpus\" in the experiments. My mental model is the following: the paper operates on four datasets (CNN, TIME, 20 Newsgroups, and Reuters-21578). These are four different experiments, and the four datasets never interact. The cross-corpus property of the model is exercised within each of these datasets, which have a natural grouping of topics; for instance, CNN is divided into \"US\", \"world\", and \"politics\". In other words, a cross-corpus CNN model is trained on three corpora: US, world, and politics. With this mental model of the experimental setup, the experiments raise a series of questions:\n\n1) Do the selected datasets / classification tasks matter in the grad scheme of NLP?\nThe end-task is to classify the corpus of origin for each document (for instance, for the CNN experiment, the model has to decide between US, world, and politics). If I understand correctly, the weGAN model jointly trained its word embeddings with this objective. As a final step, the classifier was additionally fine-tuned on this task. So it is not very surprising that weGAN is better at clustering documents than word2vec, since it was explicitly trained to do so. It would have been more informative to see weGAN performing better on a task that was solely fine-tuned on (e.g. some sentiment classification task that was not part of the training objective when embeddings were trained). In that case, one could argue that the enhanced embeddings can be used as an out-of-the box tool for a lot of different tasks. Another option would be evaluating on the same document membership task, but on datasets that were not seen during training.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the authors evaluated on *new* datasets with a *new* task distances them even further from any potential comparisons against prior work. Even for the two already-existing datasets with results included in the appendix, there are no references to previous SoTA.\n\n2) Are the reported positive results meaningful?\nAnother problem with not showing results from previous work is that it is hard to understand whether the gains over the word2vec baseline are meaningful. For instance, the classification accuracy for the CNN corpus is increased from 92.05% (word2vec) to 92.29% (deGAN) and 92.36% (weGAN). The authors show that this is *statistically significant*, but is it meaningful? Is a 0.24% or 0.31% increase in accuracy worth the increased complexity of the model? For reference, what ratio of gains/computational cost would BERT incur?\n\n3) What is the message of qualitative evaluation?\nThe authors offer qualitative analysis of their model. For instance, Table 2 shows the top 10 synonyms for words \"Obama\", \"Trump\" and \"US\", as produced by word2vec and weGAN. The lists of synonyms are extremely similar and don't seem to convey much more information besides the fact that weGAN makes minimal changes. I find the particular examples that the authors choose to underline the superiority of their algorithm unconvincing. For instance, the fact that, in the list of synonyms for US, the word British (selected by word2vec as the 9th closest word) is turned into American (on the same 9th position) loses its significance when you also consider the fact that weGAN did not derank any of the arguably less similar terms from higher positions (e.g. Turkish remains the 6th most similar term to US).\n\nOther nit-picks:\n- Formatting issues: In Sections 3.1 and 3.2, the numerical references to equations are broken. Figures 3 and 4 cover the text above. Tables 2, 4, 6, 7 are hard to read. It almost feels like the paper was updated from one conference format to another, without the necessary Latex adjustments.\n- The paper has no \"Conclusion\" section\n- Improper use of singular / plural of \"corpus\" / \"corpora\"\n\nTo end on a more positive note, here are some reasons why I did appreciate the paper:\n- The usage of GANs in this context is very creative; the models do not generate *raw* text, but rather intermediate representations; this might be a promising direction for using GANs in NLP.\n- The description of the models in sections 3.1 and 3.2 is rigorous, with useful explanations that break down the reasoning behind the loss function choices."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2561/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2561/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["d-klabjan@northwestern.edu", "baiyang@u.northwestern.edu"], "title": "Generative Adversarial Nets for Multiple Text Corpora", "authors": ["Diego Klabjan", "Baiyang Wang"], "TL;DR": "Constructing robust embeddings by means of GANs from multiple corpora", "abstract": "Generative adversarial nets (GANs) have been successfully applied to the artificial generation of image data. In terms of text data, much has been done on the artificial generation of natural language from a single corpus. We consider multiple text corpora as the input data, for which there can be two applications of GANs: (1) the creation of consistent cross-corpus word embeddings given different word embeddings per corpus; (2) the generation of robust bag-of-words document embeddings for each corpora. We demonstrate our GAN models on real-world text data sets from different corpora, and show that embeddings from both models lead to improvements in supervised learning problems.", "keywords": ["GAN", "NLP", "embeddings"], "pdf": "/pdf/51a0bcd2b5ebbe1b7218b39ef4a66ae50c5fdf00.pdf", "paperhash": "klabjan|generative_adversarial_nets_for_multiple_text_corpora", "original_pdf": "/attachment/51a0bcd2b5ebbe1b7218b39ef4a66ae50c5fdf00.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nklabjan2020generative,\ntitle={Generative Adversarial Nets for Multiple Text Corpora},\nauthor={Diego Klabjan and Baiyang Wang},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkexaxBKPB}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
