Skim-RNN (d=100, d\u2019=5) obtained an average accuracy of 85.6% (std=0.47%, max=86.4%) with average FLOP reduction of 2.4x, while VCRNN obtained an average accuracy of 81.9% (std=4.91%, max=85.7%) with average FLOP reduction of 2.6x.

While the proposed idea might be too simple, the authors show the importance of it via thorough experiments. It also seems to be easily integrated into existing RNN systems without heavy tuning as shown in the experiments. \n\n* One advantage of proposed idea claimed against the skip-RNN is that the Skim-RNN can generate the same length of output sequence given input sequence. It is not clear to me whether the output prediction on those skimmed tokens is made of the full hidden state (updated + copied) or a first few dimensions of the hidden state. I assume that the full hidden states are used for prediction. It is somehow interesting because it may mean the prediction heavily depends on small (d') part of the hidden state. In the second and third figures of Figure 10, the model made wrong decisions when the adjacent tokens were both skimmed although the target token was not skimmed, and it might be related to the above assumption. In this sense, it would be more beneficial if the skimming happens over consecutive tokens (focus on a region, not on an individual token).\n\n* This paper would gain more attention from practitioners because of its practical purpose. In a similar vein, it would be also good to have some comments on training time as well. In a general situation where there is no need of re-training, training time would be meaningless, however, if one requires updating the model on the fly, it would be also meaningful to have some intuition on training time.\n\n* One obvious way to reduce the computational complexity of RNN is to reduce the size of the hidden state. In this sense, it makes this manuscript more comprehensive if there are some comparisons with RNNs with limited-sized hidden dimensions (say 10 or 20). So that readers can check benefits of the skim RNN against skip-RNN and small-sized RNN.\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Speed Reading via Skim-RNN", "abstract": "Inspired by the principles of speed reading, we introduce Skim-RNN, a recurrent neural network (RNN) that dynamically decides to update only a small fraction of the hidden state for relatively unimportant input tokens.

The model decides whether to send the word to a larger heavy-weight RNN or a light-weight RNN. The heavy-weight and the light-weight RNN each controls a portion of the hidden state. The paper finds that with the proposed skimming method, they achieve a significant reduction in terms of FLOPS. Although it doesn\u2019t contribute to much speedup on modern GPU hardware, there is a good speedup on CPU, and it is more power efficient.\n\nContribution:\n- The paper proposes to use a small RNN to read unimportant text. Unlike (Yu et al., 2017), which skips the text, here the model decides between small and large RNN.\n\nPros:\n- Models that dynamically decide the amount of computation make intuitive sense and are of general interests.\n- The paper presents solid experimentation on various text classification and question answering datasets.\n- The proposed method has shown reasonable reduction in FLOPS and CPU speedup with no significant accuracy degradation (increase in accuracy in some tasks).\n- The paper is well written, and the presentation is good.\n\nCons:\n- Each model component is not novel. The authors propose to use Gumbel softmax, but does compare other gradient estimators. It would be good to use REINFORCE to do a fair comparison with (Yu et al., 2017 ) to see the benefit of using small RNN.\n- The authors report that training from scratch results in unstable skim rate, while Half pretrain seems to always work better than fully pretrained ones. This makes the success of training a bit adhoc, as one need to actively tune the number of pretraining steps.\n- Although there is difference from (Yu et al., 2017), the contribution of this paper is still incremental.\n\nQuestions:\n- Although it is out of the scope for this paper to achieve GPU level speedup, I am curious to know some numbers on GPU speedup.\n- One recommended task would probably be text summarization, in which the attended text can contribute to the output of the summary.\n\nConclusion:\n- Based on the comments above, I recommend Accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Speed Reading via Skim-RNN", "abstract": "Inspired by the principles of speed reading, we introduce Skim-RNN, a recurrent neural network (RNN) that dynamically decides to update only a small fraction of the hidden state for relatively unimportant input tokens.

However, we would like to emphasize that there is a fundamental difference between them: VCRNN partially updates the hidden state (controlling the number of units to update at each time step), while Skim-RNN contains multiple RNNs that \u201cshare\u201d a common hidden state with different regions on which they operate (choosing which RNN to use at each time step). This has two important implications.\n\nFirst, the nested RNNs in Skim-RNN have their own weights and thus can be considered as independent agents that interact with each other through the shared state. That is, Skim-RNN updates the shared portion of the hidden state differently (by using different RNNs) depending on importance of the token, whereas the affected (first few) dimensions in VCRNN are identically updated regardless of the importance of the input. We argue that this capability of Skim-RNN could be a crucial advantage, based on the following initial observation. Instead of having two independent nested RNNs, we experiment with a single RNN and a binary decision function whether to update the hidden state fully (100 dimensions) or partially (first 5 dimensions). On SST, \u201cpartial update\u201d model (similar to VCRNN but binary decision instead) underperformed Skim-RNN by 2.0% with similar skimming rate.\n\nSecond, at each time step, VCRNN needs to make a d-way decision (where d is the hidden state size, usually hundreds), whereas Skim-RNN only requires binary decision. This means that computing exact gradient of VCRNN is even more intractable (d^L vs 2^L) than that of Skim-RNN, and subsequently the gradient estimation would be harder as well.\n\nExperimentally, the two papers focus on different domains. VCRNN experimented on one music modeling task and and two (bit and char level) language modeling tasks, while we experimented on four language classification tasks and two question answering tasks. We would like to also appeal that the reviewers have acknowledged our diverse experiments, analyses, and visualizations that are useful to understand, verify and interpret our model, which we believe is a meaningful contribution towards the community\u2019s effort on reducing the computational cost of RNNs.\n  \nAs it is past the rebuttal period, we would like to know if we can make a revision to the submission, and if so when the deadline is. In the meanwhile, we will do our best to update the paper and/or provide additional results as soon as possible with VCRNN considered.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Speed Reading via Skim-RNN", "abstract": "Inspired by the principles of speed reading, we introduce Skim-RNN, a recurrent neural network (RNN) that dynamically decides to update only a small fraction of the hidden state for relatively unimportant input tokens.

Assuming d/d\u2019=100/20 on SQuAD, memory consumption is only ~5% more than vanilla RNN. Since Skim-RNN needs to compute outputs for both RNNs (big and small) during training, it requires more time for the same number of training steps. For instance, on SQuAD, Skim-LSTM takes 8 hours of training whereas LSTM takes 5 hours until convergence. However, in terms of number of training steps, they both require approximately 18k steps. \n\n- Why Gumbel-softmax and not just temperature: we used Gumbel-Softmax mainly due to its theoretical guarantee shown in Jang et al (2017). We experimented with temperature annealing only, and found that the accuracy is ~0.5% lower on SQuAD and convergence is a little slower. While there is some advantage of Gumbel-softmax, It seems temperature annealing is also an effective technique. \n\n- Typos: thank you for correcting them and we have fixed them in the current revision. \n\n\nClarifications:\n- Sec 4.1 global training step: We meant just \u201ctraining step\u201d, and we fixed it in the most recent revision.\n\n- Sec 4.2 stableness: We actually meant that LSTM accuracy dips (is unstable) when we use smaller hidden state size to reduce FLOP, while Skim-LSTM accuracy does not dip even with high reduction in FLOP.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Speed Reading via Skim-RNN", "abstract": "Inspired by the principles of speed reading, we introduce Skim-RNN, a recurrent neural network (RNN) that dynamically decides to update only a small fraction of the hidden state for relatively unimportant input tokens.

We suspect that this is due to the high variance of REINFORCE, which becomes even worse in our case where the sample space exponentially increases with the sequence length.

For instance, in SQuAD, Skim-LSTM takes 8 hours of training whereas LSTM takes 5 hours until convergence. However, in terms of number of training steps, they both require approximately 18k steps. We will include this in any final version of the paper.\n\n- Comparison with small hidden size: When the hidden size becomes 10 (from 100) for vanilla RNN, there is 3.4% accuracy drop in SST (7.1x less FLOP) and 6.1% accuracy drop in Rotten Tomatoes (7.1x less FLOP). There is a clear trade-off between accuracy and FLOP when smaller hidden size is used.
