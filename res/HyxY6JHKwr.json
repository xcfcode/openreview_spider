How the validation set was chosen? What was the size? The authors need to make all the experiments fully reproducible.\nQ4, Q5) ok\n\nMy concerns were sufficiently addressed in the current revision, and I will increase my score. However, the paper still feels close to a borderline, but probably, tending to \"accept\". \n\nAlso, I agree with Review #4, that also wondering about the application of the proposed method to hyperparameter search (Suggestion 1 in my review). Even if this would not be a sota in hyperparameter search, it feels like missing the opportunity to make the paper much stronger, by adding one more nice property to the proposed model.\n\n-----\n\nGenerative models often use a loss function that is a weighted sum of different terms, e.g., data-term and regularizer. Let's denote these weights as \u03bb. The paper proposes a method for learning a single model that approximates the result produced by a generative model for a range of loss-term weights \u03bb. The method uses the following mechanisms i) \u03bb-conditioned layers ii) training with a stochastic loss function, that is induced by a (log-uniform) distribution over \u03bb. The performance of the model is demonstrated on the following problems learning \u03b2-VAE, image compression, and style transfer. The models clearly demonstrate an ability to approximate problem solutions for a range of coefficients. The paper is clearly written. The experiments, however, need future discussion.\n\n1) The beta-VAE experiments (sec. 4.1)\n\nQ1. While models demonstrate a reasonable behavior on Shapes3d dataset. The samples and reconstructions on CIFAR10 (Figure 8) indicate that all models are not trained well. If this is the case, conclusions might be misleading, since the approximating output of undertrained models might be much simple comparing to well-trained ones. Authors may want to provide a comparison of the trained models with conventional VAEs (with \u03b2=1), the reference figures for CIFAR10 are provided, for example, in https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04934.\n\nQ2. Wider YOTO seems to help a lot, but, what happens to the baseline models of increased size?\n\n\"We select the fixed \u03b2 so that it minimizes the average loss over all \u03b2 values.\"\n\nQ3. Was it done directly on a test set, or were validation-data used?\n\n2) Image compression (sec. 4.3)\n\n\"Finally, a wider model trained with a larger batch size (\u201cYOTO wider batch16\u201d) closely follows the fixed weight models in the high compression regime and outperforms them in the high quality regime.\" (Figure 5)\n\nQ4. How is this compared to the baseline with batch16?\n\nQ5. Authors also may want to provide std for provided metrics. The difference does not look statistically significant. \n\nSuggestion 1: It might also be interesting to see if we can use this technique to perform a hyperparameter search. Train the model, select one the best performing set of hyperparameters, and then train models with this best value.\n\nOverall, the paper proposes an interesting technique, that surprisingly, can work for a range of hyperparameters, and potentially have a high practical impact. However, the empirical evaluation is half-baked, specifically has certain methodological drawbacks e.g., perhaps undertrained beta-VAE model, absence of standard deviations while comparing (close) numerical results, and comparing models with different optimization parameters -- the performance difference might be due to optimization. \n\nI recommend to reject the paper, however, I will appreciate discussions with authors and other reviewers, and will consider changing my score in case of reasonable argumentation.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1997/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1997/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["adosovitskiy@gmail.com", "josip@djolonga.com"], "title": "You Only Train Once: Loss-Conditional Training of Deep Networks", "authors": ["Alexey Dosovitskiy", "Josip Djolonga"], "pdf": "/pdf/4b71d0b19e942323e80951bf63fb2ed630f565bb.pdf", "TL;DR": "A method to train a single model simultaneously minimizing a family of loss functions instead of training a set of per-loss models.", "abstract": "In many machine learning problems, loss functions are weighted sums of several terms.

Below we comment on the raised concerns.\n\nWe respectfully disagree that the focus should always be on maximizing a single metric. While in some applications this may be desirable, in others it is important to obtain a family of models that covers the full loss frontier. For instance, this is the case both for image compression and style transfer: it is desirable to be able to vary the parameters \u2014 the compression rate and the degree of stylization, respectively \u2014 at inference time. We do agree that for some other tasks only a single best-performing model may be of interest, in which case the proposed metric would be useful.\n\nWe agree that it would be interesting to fine-tune a YOTO-trained model with a fixed-weight loss to get a further improvement in performance. We were not able to perform this experiment during the rebuttal time, but will strive to include them in the final paper. However, in the cases we study, even the models trained without such fine-tuning can perform very close to the single-weight models, especially if the YOTO model has higher capacity than the fixed-weight models.\n\nWe are unfortunately unsure about how to exactly interpret the comment about weight sampling. Indeed we have found that sampling from a uniform distribution over the weights does not perform very well, but log-uniform worked well in our experiments, even if the sampling range was quite large, up to 3 orders of magnitude. Re-training with a narrower range could indeed further improve the results, but we are unsure what this has to do with uniformity vs log-unformity of the weight distribution.\n\nComments about the minor points:\n- It would be interesting to also report VAE results on ImageNet, but VAEs are not commonly evaluated on ImageNet, so we choose to stick to more standard datasets and rather perform more in-depth experiments on these.\n- We have done our best making the plots as readable as possible, including plotting both the frontiers and the full losses, subtractive normalization of the full losses, and experimenting with log-scales of the axes (the latter unfortunately did not always improve the readability of the plots). The plots currently presented in the paper are our best attempt. We would be grateful for specific advice on improving the plots.\n- Some images are missing in Fig. 7 because producing each of the images in the bottom row requires training an additional fixed-weight model, and we chose to only train a subset of them to save computation.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1997/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1997/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["adosovitskiy@gmail.com", "josip@djolonga.com"], "title": "You Only Train Once: Loss-Conditional Training of Deep Networks", "authors": ["Alexey Dosovitskiy", "Josip Djolonga"], "pdf": "/pdf/4b71d0b19e942323e80951bf63fb2ed630f565bb.pdf", "TL;DR": "A method to train a single model simultaneously minimizing a family of loss functions instead of training a set of per-loss models.", "abstract": "In many machine learning problems, loss functions are weighted sums of several terms.

We agree that the experimental evaluation had certain shortcomings, and we think the reviewer\u2019s feedback allowed us to substantially improve it. We have uploaded an updated version of the paper addressing the issues raised. Further details are provided below.\n\nQ1. Overall, to our knowledge, vanilla VAEs are known to not perform very well on CIFAR-10. The model the reviewer pointed at, \u201cImproved Variational Inference with Inverse Autoregressive Flow\u201d, involves a few modifications, most notably a ResNet architecture with hierarchical latents, an associated inference scheme, as well as an inverse autoregressive flow posterior. It would be interesting to apply our method with this model, but in this paper for the sake of simplicity we experiment with a usual encoder-decoder convnet with one layer of latents. We verified that the networks are well converged. However, we have found that (perhaps unsurprisingly)  a substantial improvement in performance can be gained by simply increasing the dimensionality of the latent representation and increasing the network capacity: both the reconstructions and the samples become much sharper. We report the results with these higher-capacity architectures in the updated manuscript.\n \nQ2. Thanks for this question, we now performed a controlled experiment on the impact of network capacity on the performance of the method. To this end, we trained a set of networks with gradually increasing widths. The results are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 4. For small-capacity models, fixed-weight networks perform substantially better than YOTO. This is to be expected, since with limited capacity it is difficult for a single YOTO network to cover different parameter settings. However, when increasing the network capacity, YOTO catches up and almost matches the performance of per-weight trained networks. \n\nQ3. We performed this selection on the validation set.\n\nQ4. We agree that the batch16 models were confusing, and we removed them altogether.  Now both the fixed-weight and the YOTO models are trained in exactly the same way.\n\nQ5. We re-trained every model 3 or 4 times, and report standard deviations in most experiments in the updated paper. We found training to be quite stable on most tasks.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1997/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1997/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["adosovitskiy@gmail.com", "josip@djolonga.com"], "title": "You Only Train Once: Loss-Conditional Training of Deep Networks", "authors": ["Alexey Dosovitskiy", "Josip Djolonga"], "pdf": "/pdf/4b71d0b19e942323e80951bf63fb2ed630f565bb.pdf", "TL;DR": "A method to train a single model simultaneously minimizing a family of loss functions instead of training a set of per-loss models.", "abstract": "In many machine learning problems, loss functions are weighted sums of several terms.

While most of the hyperparameters correspond to the choice of architecture and optimization scheme, some influence the loss function. This paper assumes that the loss function consists of multiple weighted terms and proposes the method of finding the optimal neural network for each set of parameters by only training it once.\n\nThe proposed method consists of two aspects: the conditioning of the neural network and the sampling of the loss functions' weights. Feature-wise Linear Modulation is used for conditioning and log-uniform distribution -- for sampling.\n\nMy decision is a weak accept.\n\nIt is not clear to me if the choice of performance metrics is correct. In many practical scenarios, we would prefer a single network that performs best under a quality metric of choice (for example, perceptual image quality) to an ensemble of networks that all are good at minimizing their respective loss functions. Therefore, the main performance metric should be the following: how much computation is required to achieve the desired performance with respect to a chosen test metric.\n\nMoreover, it might be obvious that the proposed method would be the best w.r.t. this metric, compared to other hyperparameters optimization methods, since it only requires a neural network to be trained once with little computational overhead on top. But then its performance falls short of the \"fixed weight\" scenario, where a neural network is trained on a fixed loss function and requires to raise the complexity of the network to achieve similar performance.\n\nTherefore, obtaining a neural network that would match the desired performance in the test time and would have a similar computational complexity requires more than \"only training once\", with more components, such as distillation, required to be built on top of the proposed method. The title of the paper is, therefore, slightly misleading, considering its contents.\n\nAlso, it is slightly disappointing that the practical implementation of the method does not allow a more fine-grained sampling of weights, with uniform weights sampling shown to be degrading the performance. This implies that the method would have to be either applied multiple times, each time searching for a more fine-grained approximation for the best hyperparameters, or achieve a suboptimal solution.\n\nBelow are other minor points to improve that did not affect the decision:\n-- no ImageNet experiments for VAE\n-- make plots more readable (maybe by using log-scale)\n-- some images are missing from fig. 7 comparison"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1997/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1997/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["adosovitskiy@gmail.com", "josip@djolonga.com"], "title": "You Only Train Once: Loss-Conditional Training of Deep Networks", "authors": ["Alexey Dosovitskiy", "Josip Djolonga"], "pdf": "/pdf/4b71d0b19e942323e80951bf63fb2ed630f565bb.pdf", "TL;DR": "A method to train a single model simultaneously minimizing a family of loss functions instead of training a set of per-loss models.", "abstract": "In many machine learning problems, loss functions are weighted sums of several terms.

Since the model is itself conditioned by the weights, it allows to train a single model for all weights values, instead of retraining when the weights change.\n\nExperiments suggest that this methodology does not degrade the performances to much w.r.t. retraining on every weight changes.\n\nThe proposed conditioning of the layers is done via a reparametrization (FiLM, Perez et al. 2018) of the weights with a scale $\\sigma(\\lambda)$ and a bias $\\mu(\\lambda)$ where $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ are MLP. This allows to condition the layer on $\\lambda$, while keeping the number of parameters low.\n\nNovelty\n----------\nThe idea of integrating a family of loss functions with model conditioning has also been proposed by Brault et al. [1], in the context of multi-task kernel learning. Hence I believe this work should be acknowledged.\n\nAs the product of kernels is the tensor product of their feature maps, it would suggest to condition the network's layers by taking the tensor product of the weights with respect to an MLP on $\\lambda$. This could be applied on each layers or simply on the last Fully Connected layer. Note however that it would drastically increase the number of parameters and hence not be a viable solution (or maybe with some channel pooling?).\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Infinite Task Learning in RKHSs; Brault, Romain and Lambert, Alex and Szabo, Zoltan and Sangnier, Maxime and d'Alche-Buc, Florence; Proceedings of Machine Learning Research; 2019.\n\nQuality\n----------\nThe paper is self content and well written.\n\nExperiments are well detailed and seems to be reproducible. I would be a great addition to release the code in a public repository (with a link in the paper or appendices) if the paper is accepted.\n\nI would also suggest the following experiments:\n    * An experiment showing the time penalty induce by training the loss conditional model.
