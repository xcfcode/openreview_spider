That is, the performance comparison of DeepPCM+HP+HC versus DeepPCM+UP+UC seems like a very central quantity to present and discuss, but appears to be missing currently.\n\n\nMinor comments\n\nTable 1 was a bit confusing to me at first, because it appears that UD = UP + UC, and HD = HP + HC, but this wasn't obvious to me initially; I'd change the NIB rows to be NIB + HP + HC and NIB + UP + UC, and then you don't even need to define the UD and HD acronyms, which simplifies the table's cognitive load for me and also makes the relationship between the DeepPCM variants more obvious.\n\n> \"On the low-coverage-split, we also find that our method significantly outperforms the benchmark.\"\n\nIt would be good to add the %improvement inline here to parallel the other dataset splits listed just before so that you can directly compare the magnitudes.\n\n> \"using unsupervised-learned descriptors than when using handcrafted descriptors\"\n\nWould be more compelling if you added the DeepPCM + HC + HP performance to Table 1.\n\n> \"All hyperparameter optimization of our model was performed on the temporal split\"\n\nI think it would improve the paper if the extent to which various architecture choices were optimized over could be included as well; for example, which types, layer sizes, and depths of network architectures were considered in the hyperparam tuning, and any accompanying justification for these design choices.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2534/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2534/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DeepPCM: Predicting Protein-Ligand Binding using Unsupervised Learned Representations", "authors": ["Paul Kim", "Robin Winter", "Djork-Arn\u00e9 Clevert"], "authorids": ["paul.kim@bayer.com", "robin.winter@bayer.com", "djork-arne.clevert@bayer.com"], "keywords": ["Unsupervised Representation Learning", "Computational biology", "computational chemistry", "protein-ligand binding"], "TL;DR": "We report a new methodological framework which uses unsupervised-learned representations of proteins and compounds to significantly outperform methods based on handcrafted features for the impactful protein-ligand binding task.

It uses the learned embedding for protein and legend, separately, from two published papers. Then those two embeddings were inputted to another deep learning model, performing the final prediction. Tested on one dataset, it shows the proposed method can outperform the other baseline methods.\n\nThe paper should be rejected for the following reasons:\n1. The idea of the paper is not interesting and novel enough. It only used the results from two published papers and then applied another deep learning model on them. The novelty of the paper is limited.\n2. The experiment part is not that comprehensive. It indeed performs enough ablation studies. However, all the legendary methods in the computational biology field are not included in the comparison. \n3. The experiments are only performed on one dataset. Usually, for application papers, the experiments should be performed against at least 2 datasets to avoid bias.\n4. The discussion part is not well-developed. For the paper which focuses on only one task, the more in-depth discussion is expected beyond the simple discussion of the performance. For example, the authors may try to explain the result: why the model used embedding from unsupervised learning is better than the hand-crafted features. Since they shared the same model, the unsupervised embedding should contain more information. Then, what is the additional information? \n\n\nSome further questions and comments:\n1. What's the sequence similarity of the 1226 proteins?\n2. Can the model generalize well to a completely new protein? \n3. What's the detailed performance of the model on proteins belonging to different families? \n4. I guess if the authors check the detailed performance, they will find nonuniform performance across different proteins. I think the authors can also further investigate that.\n5. Can the authors train the embedding model as well as the classification model in an end-to-end fashion? This can be more interesting.\n6.

We address the specific comments below. \n\n- The authors claim that there might be similar data items in the random train and test splits (as similar chemicals or proteins might not be accounted for randomly). However, in the temporal splits there is no way of telling that there is no similarity between a compound being analyzed in the past w.r.t. more recently, leading us to believe that temporal splits address only partly the bias between training and testing\n\nWhile the commenters are correct that the temporal split may not fully address the bias between training and testing, we include the temporal split in the results for two reasons\n     1. The temporal split creates a more realistic test set, since in real-world usage of PCM models one would train on all currently available data. This split simulates this case. \n     2. The temporal split was used by Lenselink et al to benchmark their handcrafted-descriptor models \u2013 for the sake of comparability we stick to the same evaluation schema. \nOn revision, we will include these details \u2013 in particular to state that the temporal split may not fully address the bias between train and test, but that we include it because it is a realistic split. \nWe note that we are aware of more rigorous splitting schemes based on protein sequence similarity, and of the contribution of Rost & Sander to these ideas in their seminal work from 1993 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8356056)\n\n\n- Validation set for temporal split: it's not clear how the authors split the temporal splits for validation, training and testing. Especially, as this split will very likely have the same bias as the authors describe for the random split\n\nWe apologize for not clearly explaining the construction of the validation set for the temporal split. We used the same split procedure as Lenselink et al, where the test set contains data generated from assays done in 2013 and later, while the training set and validation set is constructed by randomly splitting the pre-2013 data. By ensuring both training and validation is done on pre-2013 data, we seek to closely mimic the real-world case of training on all currently available bioactivity data, and to avoid the bias from random splitting as much as possible.  We will make this clearer in revision.\n\n\n- It is not clear how the authors try to calculate the standard error and how they apply bootstrapping. This might be due to unclear wording or lack of details \n\nWe apologize for our unclear writing in this section. For the random split, each bootstrap set is constructed by separating a random test set, then separating a random validation set from the remaining data, then resampling with replacement from the training set to create our bootstrap training set. For the temporal split, the test set is fixed, containing all bioactivity data generated from assays done in 2013 and later. Then, in each set we randomly partition the pre-2013 data into a training and validation set, then resample with replacement from the training set to create our bootstrap training set. In all cases, we also save our random seeds for future reproducibility. The standard error we report is then computed from the standard deviation of the performance of the bootstrap samples. In revision we will make this section more clear and include the details in the main body or in the appendix. \n\n\n- Low coverage splits: why wasn't a traditional approach (e.g. homology reduction) used for this? \n\nWe ask the commenter to elaborate what they are referring to as homology reduction, other than the mathematical concept in algebraic topology. Do they mean some technique involving construction of a hold-out set where the hold-out set comprises a distinct family of proteins excluded from the training set?\n\n\n- Table 1: the results on the low coverage splits are missing, making it difficult to easily compare across different approaches \n\nThe low-coverage split does not lend itself to computing standard errors in the same manner as the temporal or random splits, since we already create several splits of the data \u2013 based on which five proteins have been assigned to the test set. Also, in this case, we find the average performance is not as useful as visualizing the difference in performance with respect to each protein.", "title": "Thank you for the helpful comments!
