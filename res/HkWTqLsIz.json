The third point (heavy dependence on the number of pairwise constraints) at first sight seems to correspond with our observation that the method profits from many clusters during training (>> the expected number clusters during application phase).\n\nWe will take up an improved motivation for the choice of RBDLSTM cells in a future version (your remark 2) - it can be well motivated, the explanation unfortunately fell prey to space constraints. It is along these lines: We need to compare any sample in the application phase with every other in order to determine if they belong to the same cluster, regardless of the sequence in which they arrive (this is the foundation of being able to find an arbitrary and not fixed number of clusters). A bi-directional recurrent network layer allows for this and has been chosen especially for this reason.\n\nRegarding the first remark: thank you very much for the link to semi-supervised clustering. We haven't been aware of this literature yet. A first glance at https://doi.org/10.1002/wics.1270 (\"Semi-supervised clustering methods\") however makes me doubt if this is really the right benchmark: In short, training our model is (of course) not part of the cluster analysis - it is better compared to creating a new clustering algorithm in the first place plus selecting it because of its appropriateness for the problem at hand. Instead, semi-supervised clustering as defined in the reference above however uses labels also during the application phase (that we don't). \n\nWe will look further into this matter.\n\n(\nA more detailed, preliminary contribution to the discussion on semi-supervised clustering, more appealing to intuition than rigor: \n\nOur presented method operates in two distinct modes. \n\n1. Training: Here, we train an end-to-end clustering *algorithm* from scratch, based on pairwise labels. For example, we want to have a speaker clustering method. Thus, we feed our general architecture (without any adaptations) any speech segments each spoken by a single speaker, with the information (y_ij) of which segments are uttered by the same speaker. This way, we train an \"algorithm\" that learns to groups by voice similarity (we could, in principle, use the same raw data together with pairwise information which segments are spoken in the same language, in order to train an algorithm to cluster by language). This phase is definitely supervised learning using weak labels. (Let it be noted that the specific data set used for training does not need to have anything in common with the ones expected later during clustering, besides showing the same \"phenomenon\" - i.e., containing different voices or  languages by which we want to group, in the example above. Specifically, we do not expect that any of the clusters observed during training will be present during clustering - i.e., we assume that the voices or languages used in training are disjunct from those in the application phase.) \n\nWe argue that this phase is similar to the original construction of a clustering algorithm like e.g. DBSCAN, plus the choice of this method by the machine learning practitioner for a specific data set because of the well fitting inductive  bias (see Mitchell, 1997) of the method to the phenomena observed in the data set after exploratory analysis: When I for example get a set of points in 2D space that I want to cluster, I will usually visualize them, see (visually) what kind of groups the points form (if any) and pick a suitable algorithm (k-Means if clusters seem spherical, oriented around central points; DBSCAN if clusters seem more to be defined by their relative point density). Our training phase basically automatizes this manual step of selecting the algorithm with a fitting inductive bias, plus the creation of this algorithm, based on examples of the kinds of clusters we want to find. Supervision of any form is used by our method only in this step (as would be necessary as well in the manual approach).\n\n2. Application (clustering): Here we use our trained model and apply it to a new data set in which we expect similar groups as we have trained the method to. Let us point out that \"similar\" here is a very weak assumption: For example, we expect voices in the data if we apply our method trainied to group by voice. We do not expect the same voices used during training. The phase exactly corresponds to the application of any other classical clustering algorithm (the ones mentioned above, or hierarchical clustering): we put a set of data in, and get a complete clustering out (i.e., the number of clusters, plus the cluster membership per input example). Absolutely no supervision is used here, the application phase is purely unsupervised.\n)\n\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Cluster", "abstract": "We propose a novel neural network architecture to learn the task of clustering end-to-end: salient features for any similarity criterion specified through weakly labeled training data are extracted with an embedding network; during evaluation, the network groups similar data of any modality together, by assigning a probabalistic cluster index, and further gives a probabilistic estimate of the number of clusters.
