The method extends the neural relational inference (NRI) (Kipf et al., 2018) by changing the static relations between agents to dynamic relations. This equates to inferring time-varying latent variables $z_t^{ij}$ as opposed to learning time-independent latent variables $z^{ij}$. The paper conducts experiments on physics simulations and basketball trajectories to show the superiority of the proposed method against different variants of NRI.\n\n\n**Pros:**  \n++ The paper is well motivated and clearly written.  \n++ The paper performs detailed experiments and ablation studies to analyze the behavior of the proposed model and the pitfalls of NRI.\n\n\n**Concerns:**  \n-- My major concern of this paper is that the almost same idea has been proposed in prior work [1]. The probabilistic formulation in that paper is essentially the same as this paper, which also introduces time-varying latent variables $z_t^{ij}$ and infers them within a VAE model. This drastically reduces the novelty of this paper. [1] also performs more extensive experiments on simulation, human motion, basketball, and traffic trajectory.\n\n-- My second concern is about the design \u201cthe inference period in our experiments is the same as the dynamic period\u201d. This is a rather strong assumption, which cannot be realized in real applications since the dynamics period is not known. This assumption also seems to defeat the purpose of dynamic relational inference, which is to infer the change in dynamics so the model should be able to have a much longer inferior period than the dynamics change period. From table 3, it becomes evident that the model only performs well when the inference period is shorter than the dynamics period, which means when the relationship between agents stays unchanged during a single inference period. \n\n-- The decoder distribution in Eq. 2 should have multiple $p(x_{t+1}^{(i)}|x_{<t}^{(i)}, z_{t}^{(ij)})$ for different $j$. In the current form, it seems only one $j$ is used and not clear which one.\n\n[1] Dynamic Neural Relational Inference. Graber et al. CVPR 2020.\n\n**Rating Justification:**  \nA very similar idea to this paper has been proposed in prior work [1], which significantly reduces the novelty of this paper. There are also concerns about the model\u2019s design (e.g., inference period). Thus, I vote for a reject.\n\n**Additional Comments:**  \n-- the notation $<t$ is used to denote observations that also include t, which is quite confusing. $\\leq t$ is probably better.  \n-- Fig 2 does not match Eq 2. Since the $x_2^{(1)}$ is generated by  $z_2^{(12)}$ and $z_2^{(13)}$, so $z_t^{ij}$ in Eq 2 should be $z_{t+1}^{ij}$ to match the time index of $x_{t+1}^{(i)}$\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper985/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper985/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dynamic Relational Inference in Multi-Agent Trajectories", "authorids": ["~Ruichao_Xiao1", "~Manish_Kumar_Singh1", "~Rose_Yu1"], "authors": ["Ruichao Xiao", "Manish Kumar Singh", "Rose Yu"], "keywords": ["deep generative model", "relational inference", "trajectory modeling", "multi-agent learning"], "abstract": "Unsupervised learning of interactions from multi-agent trajectories has broad applications in physics, vision, and robotics.

Relational reasoning has received considerable attention in recent year. Predicting the graph structure underlying a system from data in a dynamic way is an great next step, which could help alleviate some of the scalability issue currently afflicting these methods.\n\nThe way I read this paper, there are two distinct high level contributions:\n1. Dynamically infer the graph structure underlying a trajectory, from data and use it to predict the next step\n2. A specific method to accomplish the first contribution.\n\nIt is encouraging to see that DYARI outperforms NRI in the cases presented. However, it is possible to imagine a dynamic version of NRI (where the inferred graph structure is updated every time-step after a burn-in period).\nMoreover, while NRI is a strong baseline, other similar methods have been proposed to tackle relational inference e.g. Graph Attention Networks, Transformers and even straight Graph Networks. Similarly to NRI, with a simple thresholding mechanism these could be used to predict the graph structure as well, both statically and dynamically.\n\nIt would be really helpful to better place this work in the context of existing methods and to try and tease out the two contributions. Is it a good idea to dynamically infer the graph structure, and if so should we use this specific method?\n\nFinally, predicting the graph structure lends itself to really interesting analysis, and the dynamic aspects of this are completely unexplored. Imagine finding that your method infers that particle clouds form disjoint objects that become connected when they collide, wouldn't that be something?\n\nWith a broader outlook, we should note that Relational Inference and Graph-based models have received a lot of attention in recent years. Methods have scaled to thousands of nodes and very complex physics (see e.g. Learning to simulate complex physics with graph networks). The datasets reported in this work include up to 10 interacting objects. Since the dynamic inference of the connectivity structure is especially apt to larger scale experiments, it would be really great to see results on more complicated datasets that include computational cost considerations when compared to static graph baselines, although this might be outside the scope of this initial paper.\n\nThank you very much for sharing these cool ideas. I genuinely believe this is a research direction worth investigating. I look forward to our discussion.\n\nAll the best!\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper985/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper985/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dynamic Relational Inference in Multi-Agent Trajectories", "authorids": ["~Ruichao_Xiao1", "~Manish_Kumar_Singh1", "~Rose_Yu1"], "authors": ["Ruichao Xiao", "Manish Kumar Singh", "Rose Yu"], "keywords": ["deep generative model", "relational inference", "trajectory modeling", "multi-agent learning"], "abstract": "Unsupervised learning of interactions from multi-agent trajectories has broad applications in physics, vision, and robotics.

(2018)\u2019s Neural Relational Inference. In particular, this work introduces a latent variable model which treats the interactions (i.e. relations) between different agents as dynamic and time-varying. As in NRI, the interaction variable between any two agents is conditioned on the history of those agents\u2019 states. An agent\u2019s future state is conditioned on its history of states as well as its interaction variables with other agents.\n\nThe results from DYARI are interesting but I am concerned about the intricacies of setting the \u201cinference period\u201d to be aligned with the \u201cdynamic period.\u201d I would have expected that choosing a smaller inference period (e.g. half the dynamic period) should lead to little to no loss in performance. The authors ascribe the observed loss in performance to \u201cthe extra uncertainty introduced by estimating more latent variables.\u201d I\u2019m not totally convinced. \n\nPhysical systems like springs have an inherent temporal invariance which you don\u2019t seem to be exploiting. Did you consider (a) processing timesteps in a moving window of size T (i.e. z^{ij}_t is conditioned only on the last T observations) or (b) using a recurrent encoder to process observations sequentially, rather than process all timesteps at once with the PSPNet encoder? That might help with the inference challenge you're facing.\n\nMore questions and requests for clarification:\n- What if the inference period is out of sync with the dynamic period (e.g. 3 steps versus 5 steps)? Does the model still perform reasonably?\n- Why not model relations as continuous latents (setting aside the fact that NRI used discrete variables)? That way you can model negative interaction (e.g. competition), zero interaction, as well as the magnitude of interaction.\n- I don\u2019t understand Figure 8 at all. Consider the two blue players who stay on the leftmost side of the basketball court. They have a dotted blue line between them in all the \u201ccoordination\u201d plots and a dotted red line between them in all the \u201ccompetition\u201d plots. Could you please explain what's going on? I would expect only one relation to be on at any time step.\n- In Table 6, you show average pooling leads to higher accuracy but also a higher MSE. Shouldn't you have a lower MSE with a higher accuracy?\n- Could you please add error bars for your reported scores over independent runs?\n- What value of Beta did you use for your loss? What was the effect of varying this hyperparameter?\n\nMinor:\n- In equation 2, I assume the density p(x^(i)_{t+1} | x^(i)_{< t}, z^{ij}_t) was meant to be conditioned on N-1 latents not just a single j? In fact, j is undefined in the equation at that point. \n- Figure 2 shows the hidden interaction nodes z^{ij}_t are not conditioned on any other nodes. That is not true from equation 2: each z^{ij}_t seems conditioned on agent i and j\u2019s past trajectories.\n- Could you please use x_{\\leq t} instead of x_{< t} to denote states up to and including time t?", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper985/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper985/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dynamic Relational Inference in Multi-Agent Trajectories", "authorids": ["~Ruichao_Xiao1", "~Manish_Kumar_Singh1", "~Rose_Yu1"], "authors": ["Ruichao Xiao", "Manish Kumar Singh", "Rose Yu"], "keywords": ["deep generative model", "relational inference", "trajectory modeling", "multi-agent learning"], "abstract": "Unsupervised learning of interactions from multi-agent trajectories has broad applications in physics, vision, and robotics.
