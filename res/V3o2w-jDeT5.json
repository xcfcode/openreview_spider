Basic idea is to use a linear combination of importance sampling estimators. Moreover, the optimal linear combination coefficients are identified in a sense of being optimal in a certain family of convex combination coefficients. This approach has an interesting application that hyperparameters of machine learning deployed on an unseen dataset, importantly, without labels(output) can be optimized as long as the distribution of the input of the unseen dataset is samplable.\n\n\n**Strengths**\n1. The paper provides an algorithm that can estimate an objective computed on data without requiring access to labels in some optimal sense.\n2. Based on the proposed estimator, a transfer hyperparameter optimization algorithm to solve interesting problems is introduced.\n\n\n**Weaknesses**\n1. Maybe the novelty of the paper mainly lies in the combination not on inventing something new, which is, however, not certain since my coverage of relevant literature was not extensive.\n2. I can imagine that someone may ask for more experiments of a large scale or of the type exemplified in the intro. On the other hand, the experiments can be regarded as designed concisely to demonstrate the authors' main points.\n\n\n**Recommendation**\nOverall, I am willing to defend the acceptance of this paper. This combination of transfer HPO and importance sampling estimator seem novel, interesting, and well-demonstrated, with which many interesting applications can be imagined. \n\n\n**Questions**\n- On the line right below eq.(2), the loss function L is assumed to be bounded. Is this condition is necessary in proofs of any theoretical ones? It seems that, in all experiments, all losses are unbounded.\n\n\n**Additional feedback**\n- Explicitly emphasizing that Def 3 is motivated by eq.(6) may guide readers better.\n- While reading the paper, the questions arose were mostly answered after a few lines. The reading was pleasant for me and the paper is well-structured.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1424/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1424/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-Source Unsupervised Hyperparameter Optimization", "authorids": ["~Masahiro_Nomura1", "~Yuta_Saito1"], "authors": ["Masahiro Nomura", "Yuta Saito"], "keywords": ["Hyperparameter Optimization"], "abstract": "How can we conduct efficient hyperparameter optimization for a completely new task?

However I want to challenge the following point \n\n\"the aim of this paper is to obtain the optimal set of hyperparameters\"\n\nHow HPO is generally motivated is: in practice there are many situations where model X or Y is used, but the HPs are suboptimal, or tuning them manually takes a lot of time or effort. So the general aim for supervised ML is to produce a good model according to some metric, and one way to improve many of the best models (the hyperparameters) is by HPO.\n\nWe should not forget the overall goal (providing a good model), when looking at the subgoal (finding good HPs to further improve a model). The final goal in the task described in the paper appears to be to provide a regression model on unlabeled data, where labeled transfer learning data is not available, but labeled source tasks are. I don't understand why it is not simply framed as thus, and then (if it is the case) motivate why HPO is important in that setting.\n\nOnce the problem is framed as such, better baselines (that do not need to use HPO) can come to mind. For example, just train a model for each source task, and predict their average or median, on the target task. A slight variation: train a single model where the source task is one hot encoded as a feature; then at prediction again one can use the mean or median of what would be the prediction for the various source tasks. An even simpler idea: concatenate all source tasks and just train a model on these, use the obtained model directly for predicting on the target. (Or is this Naive?

This setting also appears in socially important social fields, such as medical healthcare [1,2,3,4]. Specifically, you can use our method when you have labeled training data from some (source) hospitals but you want to have a prediction model that works well on a target hospital different from the source hospitals. Our method does not depend on a specific ML model and can be widely applied. We will add such examples that motivate the importance and practicality of the MSU-HPO setting.\n\n[1] Qi Dou, Cheng Ouyang, Cheng Chen, Hao Chen, and Pheng-Ann Heng.

Again, this is a question of clarification and can easily be addressed.\n\nThank you for your comment. Yes, you are true that models are trained using training data with our variance reduced estimator as their objective during HPO. As we discussed in the Introduction part that there are some previous solutions for training predictors under the covariate shift setting. However, we argue that there is no work that explores how HPO should be done in similar settings.  Therefore, in this work, we focus on a new HPO setting we call MSU-HPO. \n\nIn addition, the model training (statistical machine learning) and the hyperparameter optimization are based on completely different formulations (though they seem to be similar).  Therefore, even if there are some similar methods that are known to work well on the model training tasks, developing an HPO method for the corresponding problem setting is of independent interest.\n\n\n> The fact that the Naive method beats the other two baselines and performs comparably to the unbiased proposed method makes me wonder whether (a) these are challenging enough tasks, or (b) those are competitive baselines.\n\nThe poor performances of DistBO and LI are not that strange, as they are the methods for conventional HPO problems, not for MSU-HPO. The HPO experiments are very challenging for the proposed method due to the small number of training data. If the number of data and the number of evaluations are large enough, the proposed method can find the optimal solution, as we analyzed in Appendix C. In contrast, DistBO and LI do not have such a guarantee.\n\nDistBO and LI are not methods for MSU-HPO and are not strong enough as baseline methods. However, as far as we know, there is no method that suits MSU-HPO. We think that MSU-HPO is most close to the DistBO setting, and we believe that the experimental comparisons are reasonable."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1424/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1424/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-Source Unsupervised Hyperparameter Optimization", "authorids": ["~Masahiro_Nomura1", "~Yuta_Saito1"], "authors": ["Masahiro Nomura", "Yuta Saito"], "keywords": ["Hyperparameter Optimization"], "abstract": "How can we conduct efficient hyperparameter optimization for a completely new task?

The naive method performs on part with LI in the synthetic experiments and clearly better than DISTBO in the real-world ones. Is this expected?

While we discuss the reason why their results were poor in Appendix D.3, no further details have been investigated yet.\n\nThere is a possibility that HPO methods other than these methods will work well in MSU-HPO. Hence, a comprehensive comparison between other methods (pointed out by the reviewer) and the proposed methods is included in the future work.\n\n\n> Would it then not be useful to re-run the comparison under a varying number of hyperparameter evaluations available from source tasks?\n\nThank you for the helpful comment. We agree that the suggested experiment is important in confirming the scope of application of the proposed method. We would like to note that the proposed method can unbiasedly estimate the target task objective in the MSU-HPO setting, but LI and DistBO do not. In other words, there is no guarantee that the estimation of LI and DistBO will match the true objective no matter how much the training data and the number of evaluations increase.\n\nNote that we analyze the dependence of the proposed method on the number of data and the number of evaluations of the estimation accuracy in Appendix C.\n\n\n> c.

But to me it appears to mainly be concerned with unsupervised training, when there are related labeled datasets available\n\nFirst of all, thank you for making a significant and interesting point. Let us discuss this point in detail.\n\nWe think that our work lies on HPO because the aim of this paper is to obtain the optimal set of hyperparameters, and the proposed method is general purpose for HPO (, i.e., the proposed method does not depend on any specific machine learning models). However, we completely agree that this work is different from conventional HPO approaches, which formulate HPO as black-box optimization. This means that, even if there are related datasets, the conventional HPO approaches do not use the training data (X, y) *explicitly* and perform optimization using only the information of the hyperparameters and their evaluation values. MSU-HPO cannot be solved without utilizing the information of these training data.\nAs far as we know, for the first time in this study, we put something structure in the related data to streamline HPO explicitly, and perhaps this is what makes this study less like HPO. We agree that our approach is very unique in HPO; however, we strongly believe that this study will narrow the gap between the fields of HPO and statistical machine learning, where it is common to make explicit assumptions about data distributions. We hope that our work opens up new research directions of HPO.\n\n\n> One detail that I do not understand from the text is how the HPs found by the baseline are evaluated, if no available labels are assumed.\n> In Experimental Procedure, What does (1) do?\n\nThe baseline methods such as \u201cNaive\u201d and \u201cLI\u201d perform optimization by using only source tasks, instead of an unlabeled target task. The best hyperparameter found in the optimization of source tasks is used to calculate the final evaluation value.\nThis is described in Step (1) of \u2018Experimental Procedure\u2019 in Section 4.2. DistBO uses the unlabeled dataset of the target task as well as the labeled datasets of the source tasks (please see Appendix D.2 for the details).\n\n\n> As the authors themselves note, the baselines are not well suited for the setting\n\nThank you for pointing it out. We agree that the baseline methods are not suitable for the MSU-HPO setting, as described in Appendix D.3. We appreciate the suggestion of baseline methods, and will compare that baselines in the future revision.\n\n\n> The description of the baseline they call \"Naive\" is also not very clear. If would be good to have more details on this baseline.\n\nIn the MSU-HPO setting, the labeled data of the target task is not available for conventional HPO methods.

More baselines and challenging experiments would help.", "review": "The paper introduces multi-source unsupervised hyperparameter optimization (MSU-HPO), a novel BO framework where a range of related tasks are available but labels cannot be accessed for the target task. As ground truth on the target task is unavailable, the work introduces two estimators to approximate the target task objective. This enables HPO to be run to optimize the hyperparameters on the target task, converging faster to a good hyperparameter configuration.\n\n\nPositive\n\n1. **Significance.** To my knowledge, this is the first paper to investigate a transfer learning setting for HPO where labels are unavailable for the target task. This is of interest in several practical applications (e.g., advertising, as the authors discuss). The exploration of a new problem together with the introduction of principled estimators make both the paper's goal and methodology significant.\u2028\n2. **Clarity.** The paper was a pleasure to read. Very clear and well structured. I am also confident about reproducibility as enough details about the algorithm and experimental setup are provided.\u2028\n3. **Rigorous evaluation.** I appreciated the solid theoretical analysis paired with fully-controlled synthetic experiments where the degree of task similarity can be regulated and results compared against ground truth. All figures are based on multiple runs and have clearly detailed error bars.\u2028\n\nNegative\n\n1. **Easy experiments.** The experiments are run on synthetic data and on real-data with only two ML models (SVM and LightGBM). This is secondary considering that the theoretical analysis is solid, but tuning a wider range of ML algorithms (such as neural networks/NAS) would have made the case even stronger by showing that transfer learning is possible across a diverse class of models. The dimensionality of the optimized hyperparameter spaces is also very small, with respectively two and four tuned hyperparameters for SVM and LightGBM. Applying the method to more challenging scenarios would further demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach.\u2028\n2. **Not many baselines.** The main baselines the method is compared against are LI and DISTBO. While many transfer learning baselines are inapplicable as most assume target labels to be available (as discussed in the related work), this is not the case for all of them. An example is Feurer, et al.: Initializing Bayesian hyperparameter optimization via meta-learning, AAAI, 2015. This is not referenced but should be discussed, as it only uses hyperparameter configurations from previous related tasks to warm-start the new optimization. As this does not look at the labels of the target task, it could be compared against. This is also the case for Perrone et al., 2019, which learn a search space purely based on previous tasks and does not require target labels. Another search space pruning method that is not compared against nor discussed is Wistuba, et al.: Hyperparameter search space pruning\u2013a new component for sequential model-based hyperparameter optimization, in Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, 2015.\n\nOverall, I am inclined towards accepting this paper due to the rigorous theoretical evaluation, the significance of the problem, and the fairly satisfactory experimental evaluation (although more baselines and more challenging experiments would be needed to make a stronger case).\n\nAdditional questions\n\na. Related to the point above, how does the proposed approach compare to the transfer learning baselines references above that are purely based on learning an initialization or a good search space?\n\nb. The naive method performs on part with LI in the synthetic experiments and clearly better than DISTBO in the real-world ones. Is this expected? Does this indicate that the chosen baselines (LI and DISTBO) may be too weak? In appendix D3 the authors discuss that this is probably due to the fact that only 50 hyperparameter evaluations on source tasks are available. Would it then not be useful to re-run the comparison under a varying number of hyperparameter evaluations available from source tasks? If the proposed method only outperforms baselines when a small number of prior evaluations are available, this should be clearly stated and shown.\u2028\n\nc. Considering the relatively poor results of the unbiased estimator, would it not be better to re-frame the narrative to focus on the variance-reduced estimator? The unbiased one is an interesting ablation study, but given the results it might be better to clearly state from the beginning that the variance reduced estimator is the recommended choice.\u2028\n\nd. Will code be made available? \n\nTypos:\n1. Page 12: \"omited\" ---> \"omitted\"\n2.

Instead labels are estimated based on related tasks that do have labels. After this a predictor can be trained on those estimated labels, and can be tuned using a standard Bayesian optimization algorithm.\n\nThe main contribution consist in the description of an estimator for the labels. The paper also provides basic experimental results, both in the form of a naive toy example, and of results on two machine learning datasets. \n\n### Questions / Comments\nThe paper is described (and titled) as a HP tuning paper. But to me it appears to mainly be concerned with unsupervised training, when there are related labeled datasets available, and should thus be described, analysed and tested mainly as such, and compared to other unsupervised learning techniques. The fact that it can be combined with any supervised learning method and can incorporate hyperparameter (HP) tuning is interesting, but the end results is still a unsupervised prediction model.\n\nIn this framing, the comparison only HP tuning algorithms not made for the specific setting does not seem to be the right comparison. Thus I argue that the results are not sufficient to show that the technique proposed can be useful in practice.\n\nThe results are compared to existing HP Tuning warm start algorithms by getting a single suggested HP configuration. One detail that I do not understand from the text is how the HPs found by the baseline are evaluated, if no available labels are assumed. Can the authors shed more light on this aspect?\n\nAs the authors themselves note, the baselines are not well suited for the setting, where we have a very low transfer budget to be split among many source tasks. I would expect much simpler baselines to perform much better, for example: 1) just using the default HPs of the given algorithm 2) running on a single arbitrary source task the whole budget as a simple BO task, and use the best found HPs of this source task. (But it is still not clear how finding HPs is useful if we have no labels, so I might be missing something major here).\n\nThe description of the baseline they call \"Naive\" is also not very clear. If would be good to have more details on this baseline.\n\nIn Experimental Procedure, What does (1) do? How is the ML model tuned if not by MSU-HPO, which seems to be done later. It is not clear to me from the text.\n\nTo summarize, while the method is interesting, it is insufficiently motivated, either as a special type of unsupervised learning, or if it is something different a stronger motivation of why this is worthwhile (you can plug in arbitrary models, use arbitrary HP, tuning algorithms or other reasons). Additionally, the experiments would benefit from clearer descriptions and stronger baselines.\n\n### Typos\nFigure 1b:\nComapring -> Comparing\n\nTable 1 caption:\nperforms almost the same with naive in Parkinson given\ntheir standard errors -> grammar should be improved", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1424/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1424/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-Source Unsupervised Hyperparameter Optimization", "authorids": ["~Masahiro_Nomura1", "~Yuta_Saito1"], "authors": ["Masahiro Nomura", "Yuta Saito"], "keywords": ["Hyperparameter Optimization"], "abstract": "How can we conduct efficient hyperparameter optimization for a completely new task?
