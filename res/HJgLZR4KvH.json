Note, the number of reward function calls for planning with skill-dynamics is no different from those done in conventional model-based planning algorithms.\n\n(b) We believe the concern about high-dimensional state-spaces is valid. We want to point out that we run DADS on Humanoid on the full state-space (47 dimensional state-space), and we were able to discover different gaits and some x-y coverage as well which could be used for goal navigation (limitedly). We believe in high dimensional state-spaces, DADS will continue to discover skills, but the space of skills discovered might not necessarily be useful for the intended set of downstream tasks, as pointed out by the reviewer. However, we believe this problem can be addressed by automatically learning state-representations which encourage skill-discovery relevant for the downstream tasks. We hope that the future work will look into this line of enquiry.\n\n(c) Thanks for pointing out the reference! We have added it to the related work section and updated the manuscript to reflect the changes.\n\n(d) We thank the reviewer for pointing out the missing negative sign in the metric.  The metric was introduced separately from the reward function so that the navigation to different goals (of differing distances from the origin) can be compared more fairly. However, the reviewer is right to note that the metric itself can be used as the reward function. We have changed the manuscript to clear the confusion.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper966/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper966/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills", "authors": ["Archit Sharma", "Shixiang Gu", "Sergey Levine", "Vikash Kumar", "Karol Hausman"], "authorids": ["architsh@google.com", "shanegu@google.com", "slevine@google.com", "vikashplus@google.com", "karolhausman@google.com"], "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "unsupervised learning", "model-based learning", "deep learning", "hierarchical reinforcement learning"], "TL;DR": "We propose an unsupervised skill discovery which enables model-based planning for hierarchical reinforcement learning.", "abstract": "Conventionally, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) aims to learn a global model for the dynamics of the environment.

The proposed approach is convincingly compared in several ways to both previous model-based approaches and model-free approaches.\n\nThis is a very interesting approach, and although I can already think of ways to improve, it seems like an exciting step in the right direction to develop more autonomous and sample efficient learning systems. I suggest to rate this submission as 'accept'.\n\nRegarding the comparison to model-free RL: although it is true that no task-specific training is needed, a possibly large number of calls to the reward functions are needed during planning. It would be good to compare those numbers with the number of rewarded trajectories needed for the model-free approaches.\n\nMy main concern with the proposed method is how it would scale when the state-space becomes substantially larger (than the 2 dimensions x and y used in the experiments). The reason I am concerned is that the proposed method uses brutal sampling to search for good trajectories in z-space and action-space. It looks like the curse of dimensionality will quickly make this approach unfeasible. Also, it would be nice to have the learning system discover the important dimensions in which to plan (the x and y in the experiments), rather than having to provide them by hand.\n\nA minor concern is the following: is it possible that the optimization could end up discovering a large number of highly predictable (and diverse) but useless skills?\n\nIn the related work section, 1st paragraph, in the list of citations, it might be good to also include the work on maximizing mutual information between representation of the next state and representation of the skill (Thomas et al, arXiv:1802.09484).\n\nThe definition of Delta (page 9) is strange: it is said that Delta should be minimized but Delta is defined as proportional to the rewards (which should be maximized). Maybe a sign is missing. Also, why not simply define the rewards as being normalized in the first place, so that the metric IS the accumulated reward rather than this unusual normalized version of it."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper966/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper966/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills", "authors": ["Archit Sharma", "Shixiang Gu", "Sergey Levine", "Vikash Kumar", "Karol Hausman"], "authorids": ["architsh@google.com", "shanegu@google.com", "slevine@google.com", "vikashplus@google.com", "karolhausman@google.com"], "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "unsupervised learning", "model-based learning", "deep learning", "hierarchical reinforcement learning"], "TL;DR": "We propose an unsupervised skill discovery which enables model-based planning for hierarchical reinforcement learning.", "abstract": "Conventionally, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) aims to learn a global model for the dynamics of the environment.

The algorithm works well even in the case of high-dimensional state and action spaces. Their contributions are in four aspects:\n(1)they propose an unsupervised RL framework for learning intermediate-level representations, i.e. skills, based on maximizing the mutual information between the future state and current skill given the current state. This procedure is well-motivated and the mathematics is easy to follow.\n(2)they reformulate model predictive control (MPC) in the latent skill space.\n(3)their method is compatible with the idea of continuous skill spaces, which seems to give rise to more diverse trajectories and hence offers greater utility.\n(4)their method yields low-variance behavior while maintaining enough diversity.\n\nIt\u2019s an accept for me. On one hand, using model-free unsupervised RL methods to learn intermediate-level skills is not a new idea. on the other, approaching this problem via mutual information is, as far as I know, new to this field. Although, the novelty of this approach remains undecided, this method seems to work well enough compared to model-based, model-free and hierarchical RL methods. Their analysis from the perspectives of continuous skill space and skill variance also seem to hold.\n\nNevertheless, the study would benefit from more comparison with other methods using intermediate-level primitives (apart from DIAYN). Moreover it would be interesting to show this method works in scenarios apart from locomotion. I wonder how well the approximation p(z|s) \\approx p(z) works in non-locomotion tasks.

The skills are learned by maximizing the mutual information between the next state s\u2019 and the current skill z conditioned on the current state s. Maximizing this objective corresponds to maximizing the diversity of transitions produced in the environment, while making the skill z be informative about the next state s\u2019. The idea is that using this objective leads to learning a diverse set of skills that are predictive of the environment. The skills z correspond to a set of action sequences, which are represented by a distribution \\pi(a|s,z). Because the above objective is intractable to compute (because it relies on the true dynamics p(s\u2019|s,a)), it is variationally lower bounded using the approximate dynamics q_{\\phi}(s\u2019|s,z), which represents the transition dynamics when using a certain skill and this variational lower bound is optimized to produce the optimal q_{\\phi}(s\u2019|s,z) and \\pi(a|s,z).\n\nIn the second phase, model predictive control is used to do planning for a new test environment where we have access to the reward function. This corresponds to simulating multiple trajectories using the learned transition dynamics and skill function, computing the reward of each trajectory according to the reward function, executing the first action of the most optimal trajectory and repeating. It is mentioned that planning is done in the latent skill space, which enables easier longer-horizon planning.\n\nExperiments are performed to show that: (1) the learned skills exhibit low-variance behavior (which means that the skills have predictable behavior when used for model predictive control); (2) Model predictive control performs favorably compared to other relevant baselines.\n\nOverall, I feel this is a very well-motivated and interesting submission with very thorough experiments."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper966/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper966/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills", "authors": ["Archit Sharma", "Shixiang Gu", "Sergey Levine", "Vikash Kumar", "Karol Hausman"], "authorids": ["architsh@google.com", "shanegu@google.com", "slevine@google.com", "vikashplus@google.com", "karolhausman@google.com"], "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "unsupervised learning", "model-based learning", "deep learning", "hierarchical reinforcement learning"], "TL;DR": "We propose an unsupervised skill discovery which enables model-based planning for hierarchical reinforcement learning.", "abstract": "Conventionally, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) aims to learn a global model for the dynamics of the environment.
