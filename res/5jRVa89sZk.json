Since some entities may not be annotated, the performance of models can be degraded. This paper analyzes the performance degradation by evaluating synthetic datasets and finds that all the unlabeled entities are treated as negative instances is the main factor of the performance degradation. To alleviate the performance degradation, this paper proposes a negative sampling approach that considers only a small subset of unlabeled entities in order to reduce the impacts of unlabeled entities. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better performances compared to previous studies on real-world datasets and achieves competitive performances compared to the state-of-the-art methods on well-annotated datasets.\n\nStrong points:\n+ The analysis using two proposed metrics to find causes of the performance degradation of the unlabeled entity problem is quite interesting.\n+ The idea of using the negative sampling under the data imbalance situation, especially in NER, seems reasonable.\n+ The paper is well-written and easy to follow. It provides comprehensive experiments on several datasets.\n\nConcerns: \n1. The key concern about this paper is the missing of some references. There are some previous studies related to the unlabeled entity problem. Particularity, this problem is quite related to or almost the same as the \u201cIncomplete annotations\u201d at [1] or \u201cPartially annotated training data\u201d at [2]. In addition, the unlabeled entity problem has a little relevance to the data imbalances [3] if we assume that all unlabeled spans are negative instances. Therefore, the proposed method should be compared with these previous studies experimentally and/or theoretically.\n[1] Jie et al., Better Modeling of Incomplete Annotations for Named Entity Recognition, NAACL 2019.\n[2] Mayhew et al., Named Entity Recognition with Partially Annotated Training Data, CONLL 2019.\n[3] Li et al., Dice Loss for Data-imbalanced NLP Tasks, ACL 2020.\n2. In the experiments on the real-word dataset, the proposed method only compared with weak baselines. The reviewer suggests the authors to evaluate with the state-of-the-art NER methods such as BERT-MRC or BERT-Biaffine Model.\n3. At the inference time, every span should be input to the MLP layer to obtain the predicted score. That is, the proposed method takes more time (O(n^2)) to infer new sentences compared to other methods (O(n)). Furthermore, this paper uses heuristic(s) when the spans of inferred entities intersects. However, there is no discussion about them.\n\nMinor comments:\n1. In the section 3.2, the figures and the contents about the figures are inconsistent. That is, the middle parts of the figures are for the change in misguidance rates and the right-hand ones are for the change of the erosion rates.\n2. For batching with sampling, it would be better to provide more details about it.\n3. It would be nice to show a model convergence or loss convergence graph because this paper uses random sampling.\n4. It would be better to show the correlation in numbers between the f1 scores and the proposed rates.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper823/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper823/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Empirical Analysis of Unlabeled Entity Problem in Named Entity Recognition", "authorids": ["~Yangming_Li1", "~lemao_liu1", "~Shuming_Shi1"], "authors": ["Yangming Li", "lemao liu", "Shuming Shi"], "keywords": ["Named Entity Recognition", "Unlabeled Entity Problem", "Negative Sampling"], "abstract": "In many scenarios, named entity recognition (NER) models severely suffer from unlabeled entity problem, where the entities of a sentence may not be fully annotated.

That is, the proposed method takes more time (O(n^2)) to infer new sentences compared to other methods (O(n)). Furthermore, this paper uses heuristic(s) when the spans of inferred entities intersects. However, there is no discussion about them.\n\nAnswer-3: The theoretical time complexity O(n^2) is due to the span selection procedure of our model. In fact, its running time is much less than that of the forward computation of neural networks (even for LSTM). In experiments, we find the latter is 10 times longer than the former. The heuristic used to solve span conflicts is simple yet effective. Empirically, the probability of our strategy making mistakes (the labeled span with higher score is not the true entity) is lower than 0.07%. We will clarify these facts in the revised version of our paper."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper823/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper823/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Empirical Analysis of Unlabeled Entity Problem in Named Entity Recognition", "authorids": ["~Yangming_Li1", "~lemao_liu1", "~Shuming_Shi1"], "authors": ["Yangming Li", "lemao liu", "Shuming Shi"], "keywords": ["Named Entity Recognition", "Unlabeled Entity Problem", "Negative Sampling"], "abstract": "In many scenarios, named entity recognition (NER) models severely suffer from unlabeled entity problem, where the entities of a sentence may not be fully annotated.

A synthetic dataset is constructed from a well-annotated dataset (e.g., CoNLL-2003) as follows.\u00a0Given a probability p (say p=0.3), for each annotated entity in a sentence from a well-annotated dataset, we randomly sample a number \\mu (0<\\mu<1) from the uniform distribution. If \\mu <= 0.3, then we drop this entity for the underlying sentence; otherwise we retain this entity.

I am not quite sure about the procedure. Negative instance candidates are randomly selected from original sentences. You use \\hat{y}, which is a subset of randomly selected span to replace a missed entity set defined in Eq. (2)?\n\nAnswer-1: We are sorry for the confusion. Actually, negative instance candidates denote all spans except manually labeled entities. Since these negative instance candidates may contain some real entities which are just neglected by annotators, we sample a subset \\hat{y} from these candidates as the negative instances for training (see Eq. (7)). \\tilde{y} in Eq. (2) is different from \\hat{y} in Eq. (7). The former denotes a set of named entities neglected by annotators while the latter is a set of negative instances for training. \n\nFor example, x= [Jack is from New York] and y = [(2, 3\uff0cLOC)] is the entity set annotated by human. We can see that human neglected an entity (0, 0, PER) and thus \\tilde{y} = [(0, 0, PER)]. \n\nIn this way, negative instance candidates set include all spans expect (2, 3\uff0cLOC), i.e., it is [(0, 0, O), (0, 1, O), (0, 2, O), (0, 3, O), (0, 4, O), (1, 1, O), (1, 2, O), (1, 3, O), (1, 4, O), (2, 1, O), (2, 2, O), (2, 4, O), (3, 3, O), (3, 4, O), (4, 4, O)]. \n\nIn addition, if we sample four negative instances as \\hat{y}, then \\hat{y} may be [(0, 3, O), (4, 4, O), (1, 1, O), (2, 4, O)].\n\nWe will add this example to explain these notations more clearly in our revised paper. \n\nQuestion-2: Could you expand more about Equation 8 to add more details?\n\nAnswer-2: Eq. (8) theoretically proves that, through negative sampling, the probability of treating a neglected entity as the negative instance is very low. To verify this conclusion in real scenarios, for every synthetic dataset, we calculate the percentage of neglected entities (i.e., the entities in \\tilde{y}) in the set of sampled negative instances (i.e., \\hat{y}).

However, the distant supervision setting suffers from entity ambiguation and unlabeled entity problem simultaneously. How do you think your design to tackle entity ambiguation problem?\n\nAnswer-3: This paper focuses on analyzing and solving the unlabeled entity problem. Experiments show that our proposed method can almost eliminate the misguidance brought by unlabeled entities during training (see Section 6.2 and Figure 4). As for the entity ambiguation problem, a feasible idea is, in the preprocessing stage, using the context information to disambiguate entity labels.\n\nQuestion-4: Moreover, in the distant supervision experiment in Table 3, how will you model compare with other distant supervision models like AutoNER?\n\nAnswer-4: Besides Partial CRF, other related methods mainly include AutoNER [1] and PU Learning [2,3]. AutoNER allows learning from high-quality phrases that may be neglected entities. Because obtaining these phrases demands external resources, we can\u2019t offer direct comparisons. Note that our negative sampling doesn\u2019t rely on any external resource, which is more flexible. PU Learning assigns low weights to false negative instances in the loss function. LexiconNER [2] is based on PU Learning and has released its source code at https://github.com/v-mipeng/LexiconNER.

[even if relevant comparison are made with results from the litterature]\n\nAnswer-1: Mainstream approaches to the problem include AutoNER [1], Partial CRF [2,3], and PU Learning [4,5]. AutoNER supports learning from high-quality phrases that may be unlabeled entities. However, mining these phrases demands external domain-specific corpora, which is not flexible. Partial CRF marginalizes the loss over all possible complete label sequences that are compatible with the incomplete annotation. However, it still demands well-annotated data to be trained with true negative instances. In experiments, our proposed methods have significantly outperformed Partial CRF on both real-world datasets (see Section 6.4 and Table 3). PU Learning assigns low weights to false negative instances in the loss function. However, obtaining these weights relies on prior information and heuristics, which is also inflexible.\n\nA work [4] based on PU Learning has released its source code [https://github.com/v-mipeng/LexiconNER]. We run the code on two real-world datasets to make comparisons with PU Learning.

Section 3.1 is a little bit short on this point.\n\nAnswer-2: We didn\u2019t adopt multi-stage training strategies. On every synthetic dataset, we evaluate the performances of models with adjusted loss (see Eq. (2)) and MLE loss, separately. The two performances are used to show how unlabeled entity problem affects NER models. For example, the left part of Figure 1 demonstrates the results of four different settings (BERT Tagging w/ MLE, BERT Tagging w/ Adjusted Loss, LSTM Tagging w/ MLE, and LSTM Tagging w/ Adjusted Loss) on the synthetic datasets derived from CoNLL-2003. Each model is trained from scratch on a dataset. We will make this more clear in the revised version.\n\nComment-3: Regarding the model, equation (4) is not discussed nor analysed.\n\nAnswer-3: The design of Eq. (4) is inspired by ESIM model (see Eq. (14) in [6]). We also tried other options such as bi-affine scoring [7], but we found Eq. (4) performs the best.

The unlabeled problem is important and some existing works focus on solving the problems using partial CRF setting or data selector. The main observation of this paper lies in two aspects: 1) comparison between the reduction of annotated entities or treating unlabeled entities as negative instances.  Most interestingly, the authors show the observed difference between pre-trained language models and LSTM-based models.  Based on the observations, they propose a general approach to eliminate the misguidance brought by unlabeled entities and such a simple design shows good performances.  \n\nThe Paper is overall well written and easy to follow. But  I still have a few questions and want to get answers from authors. \n\nQuestions:\n\n1) The first question is about 4.2 Training via Negative sampling on page 5. I am not quite sure about the procedure. Negative instance candidates are randomly selected from original sentences.  You use \\hat{y}, which is a subset of randomly selected span to replace a missed entity set defined in Eq. (2)?\n\n2) Could you expand more about Equation 8 to add more details?\n\n3) The unlabeled entity problem is most serious in the distant supervision setting. However, the distant supervision setting suffers from entity ambiguation and unlabeled entity problem simultaneously.  How do you think your design to tackle entity ambiguation problem? Moreover, in the distant supervision experiment in Table  3, how will you model compare with other distant supervision models like AutoNER?\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper823/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper823/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Empirical Analysis of Unlabeled Entity Problem in Named Entity Recognition", "authorids": ["~Yangming_Li1", "~lemao_liu1", "~Shuming_Shi1"], "authors": ["Yangming Li", "lemao liu", "Shuming Shi"], "keywords": ["Named Entity Recognition", "Unlabeled Entity Problem", "Negative Sampling"], "abstract": "In many scenarios, named entity recognition (NER) models severely suffer from unlabeled entity problem, where the entities of a sentence may not be fully annotated.

Section 3.1 is a little bit short on this point.\n\n* Regarding the model, equation (4) is not discussed nor analysed.\n\n* The approach is rather simple but elegant.", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper823/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper823/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Empirical Analysis of Unlabeled Entity Problem in Named Entity Recognition", "authorids": ["~Yangming_Li1", "~lemao_liu1", "~Shuming_Shi1"], "authors": ["Yangming Li", "lemao liu", "Shuming Shi"], "keywords": ["Named Entity Recognition", "Unlabeled Entity Problem", "Negative Sampling"], "abstract": "In many scenarios, named entity recognition (NER) models severely suffer from unlabeled entity problem, where the entities of a sentence may not be fully annotated. Through empirical studies performed on synthetic datasets, we find two causes of performance degradation. One is the reduction of annotated entities and the other is treating unlabeled entities as negative instances. The first cause has less impact than the second one and can be mitigated by adopting pretraining language models. The second cause seriously misguides a model in training and greatly affects its performances. Based on the above observations, we propose a general approach, which can almost eliminate the misguidance brought by unlabeled entities. The key idea is to use negative sampling that, to a large extent, avoids training NER models with unlabeled entities. Experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world datasets show that our model is robust to unlabeled entity problem and surpasses prior baselines. On well-annotated datasets, our model is competitive with the state-of-the-art method.", "one-sentence_summary": "This work studys what are the impacts of unlabeled entity problem on NER models and how to effectively eliminate them by a general method.", "pdf": "/pdf/3caa712b0d1c2caaf7b3578b53b9f9c46e78db74.pdf", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "li|empirical_analysis_of_unlabeled_entity_problem_in_named_entity_recognition", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Poster", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nli2021empirical,\ntitle={Empirical Analysis of Unlabeled Entity Problem in Named Entity Recognition},\nauthor={Yangming Li and lemao liu and Shuming Shi},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=5jRVa89sZk}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
