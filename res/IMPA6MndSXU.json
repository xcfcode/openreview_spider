We address each of the issues that you presented.\n\n### The proposed method seems to be a combination of current works. The main contribution of this work may be leveraging the unsupervised representation learning for semantic features extraction.\n\nThe main thesis of our work is that unsupervised extraction of domain-invariant categorical semantics enables applications in UDT that were not previously possible (e.g. SPUDT and SHDT, discussed in the Introduction). To our knowledge, we are the first to illustrate a working UDT pipeline that succeeds at the SPUDT and SHDT tasks, demonstrating the relevance of domain-invariant categorical semantics. We also demonstrate through a baseline study that the current SOTA methods for UDT do not perform well at those tasks. While we are in the broadest sense \"leveraging unsupervised representation learning for semantic features extraction\", our overall development of a working solution to existing problems in UDT involves several novel technicalities in both the extraction of semantics itself and and the integration of semantics into UDT (both described in Section 3). We empirically demonstrate the relevance of these contributions through comparison and ablation studies in Section 4 (e.g. comparison of our method for extracting semantic features vs. traditional methods in Figure 3.d), ablation of using the semantic loss in UDT in Figure 3.a) and Table 3.a) or comparison of our method for integrating the semantics vs. traditional methods in Table 3.b).) We believe that showcasing such possibilities can also inspire similar applications in other cross-domain unsupervised problems where semantic information is necessary but not readily available through supervision.\n\n### The quality of generated images is still not satisfactory with such rapid development of GANs.\n\nWe used the same architecture of the state-of-the-art method at the time of writing the article which in turn provides a more fair comparison to the baselines. Moreover, the core problem that we tackle in this paper is orthogonal to the generation quality. In other words, we believe that the results we present demonstrates the problems with SPUDT and SHDT. We also believe that the generation quality is sufficient to demonstrate that incorporating semantics resolves these problems.\n\n### The experiment and qualitative evaluation are too limited. Only two image translation tasks are conducted for comparison, and little visual results are given. It will be preferred if some common I2I tasks results are given. Only FID is used, adding other metrics, such as LPIPS, NDB, and JSD, will be more convincing.\n\nWe picked two images datasets that we believed meaningfully highlighted two issues un-tackled by the UDT literature (SPUDT and SHDT). Our experiments focused on demonstrating the issues with the current UDT baselines and how our contributions really tackle and solve those issues. Another image dataset tackling any of the same issues would be redundant, leaving less space for discussion and empirical demonstration. The common I2I tasks are designed to not have the issues that we are concerned with in our paper. For these reasons, we argue that the number of translation tasks that we demonstrate is sufficient.\n\nWe provide extra qualitative results in Figure 6 and 12 for MNIST-SVHN and Sketches\u2192Reals respectively, in Appendix C.\n\nWe added a table with the metrics that you recommended in Appendix C.3 (Table 4). LPIPS quantitatively demonstrates what we can observe in Figure 4: our method produces samples that are less diverse than the baselines. This is expected considering that our method penalizes the model for generating samples that are un-realistic with respect to the semantics of the source sample. This reduces the span of possible generation given a source sample, therefore reducing the diversity.

How does the model solve the two problems according to their differences?\n\nBoth the tasks of Semantic-Preserving Unsupervised Domain Translation (SPUDT) and Style Heterogeneous Domain Translation (SHDT) are described in Section 1.\n\nIn our experiments, we noticed that if a target distribution was \"easy\" to generate (e.g. MNIST or SVHN), then every UDT baselines that we tried discarded any information from the source sample and simply generated the target distribution. \n\nOn the other hand, if a target distribution was \"hard\" to generate (e.g. Real images) and had multiple semantic categories with distinct styles, then the UDT baselines that we tried were able to preserve the pose of the source sample, but failed at generating a style that is consistent with the semantics of the source sample.\n\nTherefore, the two problems are slightly different. On one case, the objective is to learn a translation that preserves the shared semantics. In the other case, the objective is to generate a style that is consistent with respect to the semantics of the source sample. But, these two problems share a central component: they require knowledge about the shared semantics.

This study uses MNIST and SVHN datasets for demonstrating SPUDT and Sketches and Reals samples from the DomainNet dataset for demonstrating SHDT. Although the method uses different components depending on the scenario (or dataset), the presented architecture is essentially the same.\n\nThe method consists of the framework for learning invariant categorical semantics across domains (Section 3.1) and semantic style modulation to make SHDT generations consistent (Section 3.2). Section 3.1 consists of unsupervised representation learning, clustering, and unsupervised domain adaptation. However, this section did not describe the first two components in detail probably because the method uses different components depending on the datasets (described in Section 4). Unsupervised domain adaptation is realized by the minimization problem described in P4. Section 3.2 describes content encoders, semantics encoders (obtained in Section 3.1), mapping networks, style encoders, and generator. The section presents the loss functions (adversarial loss, cycle-consistency loss, style-consistency loss, style diversity loss, and semantic loss).\n\nSection 4 compares the proposed method with UDT baselines under SPUDT and SHDT scenarios. The experiments on MNIST and SVHN show that the proposed method achieved high accuracy in domain translation and high quality in the generation (measured by FID). The experimental results on Sketches and Reals show that the proposed method yields high-quality generations. Overall, the experiments demonstrate the importance of incorporating the semantics category in UDT.\n\nPROS\n\nIt was interesting to see that the performance of UDT was drastically improved by incorporating semantic categories induced by the clustering algorithms.\n\nThe presented method was reasonable and well designed.\n\nCONS\n\nThe main part of this paper is dense. I had to go back and forth between the main body and the appendix a lot.\n\nThis paper does not seem to emphasize the technical novelty of this work. Although Section 3.1 was designed to present a novel framework, it does not explain the detail of the components. Methods for unsupervised representation learning and clustering are explained in Section 4. The component of unsupervised domain adaptation may be a new proposal in this work. However, this paper did not explain this component in the main body; I had to read Appendix B.5 to understand the formula presented in P4.\n\nThe model architecture described in Section 3.2 is mostly based on previous work (e.g., adversarial loss, cycle-consistency loss, etc.). The semantic loss presented in this section may be a new addition to UDT. But again, this is not emphasized in Section 3.2.\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nP4: \"We describe those regularizers in more detail in Appendix B.5.\"\nIf this part is a proposal in this paper, it should be explained as the main content of this paper. If I do not read Appendix B.5., I have no idea how domain 2 is involved in the minimization problem.\n\nMINOR COMMENTS:\n\nP1: \"That are mappings biased toward the identity.\"\n\"That\" -> \"Those\"\n\nIt may be convenient to have equation numbers so that reviewers/readers can locate a formula directly.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper953/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper953/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Integrating Categorical Semantics into Unsupervised Domain Translation", "authorids": ["~Samuel_Lavoie-Marchildon1", "~Faruk_Ahmed1", "~Aaron_Courville3"], "authors": ["Samuel Lavoie-Marchildon", "Faruk Ahmed", "Aaron Courville"], "keywords": ["Unsupervised Domain Translation", "Unsupervised Learning", "Image-to-Image Translation", "Deep Learning", "Representation Learning"], "abstract": "While unsupervised domain translation (UDT) has seen a lot of success recently, we argue that mediating its translation via categorical semantic features could broaden its applicability.

Some failure cases would be good\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper953/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper953/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Integrating Categorical Semantics into Unsupervised Domain Translation", "authorids": ["~Samuel_Lavoie-Marchildon1", "~Faruk_Ahmed1", "~Aaron_Courville3"], "authors": ["Samuel Lavoie-Marchildon", "Faruk Ahmed", "Aaron Courville"], "keywords": ["Unsupervised Domain Translation", "Unsupervised Learning", "Image-to-Image Translation", "Deep Learning", "Representation Learning"], "abstract": "While unsupervised domain translation (UDT) has seen a lot of success recently, we argue that mediating its translation via categorical semantic features could broaden its applicability.
