Models similar to various aspects of the proposed system have been presented in prior works. For example: TLSTM, which the authors use as a baseline. Although some components are novel, like the treatment of sparse features, contributions, in my opinion, are not sufficient to be accepted at ICLR.\n- Presentation: Confusing and not enough information for reproducing results; multiple reviewers raised concerns about presentation of the feature types and experimental results.

This will pose a scalability issue when the number of features are large, e.g., those in electronic medical records where the number of features can go to tens of thousands, and each feature can be very sparse in its own way (e.g., diseases progress differently).\n \nIn our experiments the memory states of each sparse feature were of the same size as the dense state, but it would be possible to make these states smaller as the number of sparse features grows. We did not need to do this for our experiments, but it would probably be necessary in the mentioned medical domain. As for the features being sparse in their own way, STLSTM cells are designed with this in mind.\n\n - As for the ICLR audience, I think it will be informative to explain design choices. For example, maintaining the memory when sparse feature is not observed may implicitly assume that the missingness is uninformative. In medicine, on the other hand, missingness can be informative, e.g., when doctor decides that a measurement is not needed.\n\nFor our test cases, the missingness was uninformative in that the value simply did not change since the last measurement. While we see the issue with informative missingness, it seems like distinguishing this from all other sources is a problem for any model. In the medical domain specifically, it may be possible to indicate from the data whether a test was purposefully omitted, in which case this could be treated as a sparse input.\n\n\n - For evaluation, I had a hard time decoding Figure 5, especially the legend of the lines and the small fonts. May be synthetic datasets will help to shed the light on the performance of the STLSTM better. Also, putting results of two experiments in the same figure in this case makes it harder to read.\n\nThe figures have been updated with a larger font as can be seen in the revision, and while we agree that larger figures would be preferable, we are constrained by the page limits."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper127/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper127/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper127/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unified recurrent network for many feature types", "abstract": "There are time series that are amenable to recurrent neural network (RNN) solutions when treated as sequences, but some series, e.g. asynchronous time series, provide a richer variation of feature types than current RNN cells take into account.

We have responded to your concerns below.\n\nCon 1: TLSTM accounts more for irregular time between samples as opposed to asynchronous feature sampling, where different features are sampled at every time step.  The modification of TLSTM updates is an expansion on that work, but the inclusion of sparse features tackles a completely different problem than TLSTM and in our opinion is novel.\n\nCon 2: The plots do show the percentage gains in score as you guessed. We can modify the figures to make this clearer. We could also include a legend showing which line corresponds to which feature, but it\u2019s not clear how much value this would provide. While there is a disparity in the number of parameters between the models, additional experiments showed that the base model did not improve by adding more parameters. We will add this information to the text.

Sparse features are used in TLSTM but are simply treated as dense features. We can clarify this in the text. In Section 4.1 we mention that static features are present for all experiments, with the exception of the Table 1b which investigates their effectiveness.\n\nCon 4: Static decay and decay features are very similar, however as stated in Section 3.5 \u201cthe static decay features apply to the sequence as a whole rather than an individual time step.\u201d A static decay feature does vary with time and could be the time elapsed between the final time step of the sequence and the prediction time being used for that sequence.\n\nMinor comment 1: We can make the figure/fonts bigger as the length restrictions allow.\n\nMinor comment 2: There are labels for groups of equations on Page 4.\n\nMinor comment 3: More details can be found in the Appendix.\n\nMinor comment 4: We restrict this with \\alpha \\geq 0 so that the function is non-increasing.

Below are our responses to some of your concerns.\n\nComment: However, I had difficult coming up with an example of a \u201cstatic decay feature\u201d. It would be helpful to give a concrete example of one of these in the main text. (It is also not clear to me why the difference in time between the time of the last event in a sequence and the prediction time for that sequence would be considered a \u201cstatic decay\u201d feature rather than just a \u201cstatic\u201d feature.)\n\nIt seems that giving examples of each feature type in the subsections of Section 3 would help explain the motivation for incorporating each type of a feature. There is one \u2018static decay\u2019 feature mentioned in the Appendix, and as you mentioned it is the time between the last event and the prediction time. This is treated differently from \u2018static\u2019 features for the same reason \u2018decay\u2019 features are not \u2018dense\u2019 features, i.e., they are used to decompose the output of the RNN network (or the memory state for \u2018decay\u2019 features) into short and long-term components. The intention is to remove short term contributions in the prediction when there is a long-time gap.\n\nComment: First, the sparsity mechanism is rather simple. In many domains (e.g., the medical domain considered in several of the cited papers), missingness is non-uniform and is often meaningful. While \u201cmeaningfulness\u201d may be difficult to simulate, burstiness (non-uniformity) could be simulated.\n\nThere are actually two sampling mechanisms for the power consumption dataset, random and group sampling, which are detailed in the appendix. We agree that the random method is rather simple and so we also included group sampling to simulate the \u2018burstiness\u2019 you mention. While this may still be missing some information that cannot be simulated easily, we can say that our churn dataset did exhibit natural non-uniformity.\n\nComment: Second, for the groups, it is not clear whether all combinations of, e.g., 2 (informative) feature were sparsely sampled or if only one group of 2 was chosen. If the former, then some measure of variance should be given to help estimate statistical significance. \n\nIt was only one subset of the two, determined by which features most improved predictions individually that are treated as sparse. This clarification will be added to the manuscript. \n\nComment: Third, the particular classification task here is, essentially, forecasting one of the input variables. While that is certainly a relevant problem, many other time series classification or regression problems are not tied so directly to observations. It is not clear if these results are relevant in that setting.\n\nWhile we cannot share much detail on the churn dataset, we can reveal that the labels are not tied directly to the input features. In churn, the prediction is if a customer is likely to churn while the features are for example customer interactions with the company. So the predictions are completely decoupled from input features.  Despite this we still saw performance gains for our model over the base model.  The tie mentioned in your comment is present in the power dataset since the data does not include other possible labels. \n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper127/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper127/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper127/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unified recurrent network for many feature types", "abstract": "There are time series that are amenable to recurrent neural network (RNN) solutions when treated as sequences, but some series, e.g. asynchronous time series, provide a richer variation of feature types than current RNN cells take into account.

The differences in feature types are reflected in the cell state or output state update rules. Experiments on a modified UCI dataset and a proprietary dataset show that the proposed model outperforms the time-variant LSTM (TLSTM).\n\nPros:\n1. By decomposing the cell state into different components for different feature types (dense vs sparse, short term vs long term) and update them in different manners, the model takes advantage of the feature type information.\n2. By updating sparse feature related cell states only when sparse features are present, it could be potentially computationally cheaper than treating everything as dense (although in the paper due to more parameters the proposed model is actually slower).\n\nCons:\n1. The contributions are not significant. It seems that TLSTM already \"accounts for asynchronous feature sampling\" (Sec 1) and the novelty here lies most in how sparse features are treated.\n2. The presentation is sometimes confusing. For example, in Figure 5 which presents the main results, what's the \"relative change in F1 score\" and what's the unit in the plot? If it's percentage the gains seem to be too small and could be potentially due to the additional parameters. Besides, what does \"group sampling\" mean exactly? Furthermore, legend seems to be missing.\n3. Crucial implementation details are missing. The paper mentions that \"the number of features grows\" in the proposed model. Are sparse features and static features used or not in TLSTM? \n4. What's the difference between a static decay feature (Sec 3.5) and decay features (Sec 3.2)? Isn't the static decay feature varying with time as well?\n\nMinor comments:\n1. Figure 1 and 5 are too small and hard to read.\n2. Sec 3.3, \"updated based on Equation 1 and Equation 2\", but none of the equations are numbered in this paper.\n3. Some discussions on the proprietary dataset seem to be irrelevant. I'd rather see how are sparse features generated for the UCI dataset.\n4. The decay function $g= 1 / log (e + \\alpha^T x_t^{\\delta})$, how can we make sure that as time passes it decreases as time passes?\n\n\nOverall, I think explicitly taking into account different feature types in the LSTM cell update rules is interesting, but the contributions of this paper compared to TLSTM are not significant enough for acceptance, and the presentation can be made more clear.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper127/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unified recurrent network for many feature types", "abstract": "There are time series that are amenable to recurrent neural network (RNN) solutions when treated as sequences, but some series, e.g. asynchronous time series, provide a richer variation of feature types than current RNN cells take into account.

In particular, the work combines uniformly sampled observations (\u201cnormal\u201d RNN input), time-decaying observations, non-decaying observations which may change, and static features which are not time-dependent. Empirically, the proposed approach outperforms an RNN with TLSTM cells in some cases.\n\n=== Comments\n\nI found the proposed approach for incorporating the different types of time series reasonable. This work definitely leans heavily on ideas from TLSTM and others, but, to the best of my knowledge, the specific combination and formulation is novel, especially concerning the \u201cnon-decaying time series\u201d observations.\n\n However, I had difficult coming up with an example of a \u201cstatic decay feature\u201d. It would be helpful to give a concrete example of one of these in the main text. (It is also not clear to me why the difference in time between the time of the last event in a sequence and the prediction time for that sequence would be considered a \u201cstatic decay\u201d feature rather than just a \u201cstatic\u201d feature.)\n\nMy main concern with the paper is that the experimental design and results are not especially easy to follow; consequently, they are not as convincing as they might be. First, the sparsity mechanism is rather simple. In many domains (e.g., the medical domain considered in several of the cited papers), missingness is non-uniform and is often meaningful. While \u201cmeaningfulness\u201d may be difficult to simulate, burstiness (non-uniformity) could be simulated. Second, for the groups, it is not clear whether all combinations of, e.g., 2 (informative) feature were sparsely sampled or if only one group of 2 was chosen. If the former, then some measure of variance should be given to help estimate statistical significance. Third, the particular classification task here is, essentially, forecasting one of the input variables. While that is certainly a relevant problem, many other time series classification or regression problems are not tied so directly to observations. It is not clear if these results are relevant in that setting.\n\n=== Typos, etc.\n\nThe plots and figures in the paper are very difficult to read. Larger versions, or at least versions with increased fonts, should be used.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper127/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unified recurrent network for many feature types", "abstract": "There are time series that are amenable to recurrent neural network (RNN) solutions when treated as sequences, but some series, e.g. asynchronous time series, provide a richer variation of feature types than current RNN cells take into account.

The experiments show that the proposed modeling framework does increase performance compared to standard cells.", "keywords": ["sparse", "recurrent", "asynchronous", "time", "series"], "authorids": ["stec@u.northwestern.edu", "d-klabjan@northwestern.edu", "jutke@allstate.com"], "authors": ["Alexander Stec", "Diego Klabjan", "Jean Utke"], "TL;DR": "We introduce a unified RNN that handles five different feature types, each in a different manner.", "pdf": "/pdf/912f7dc2269f50aebb71ca78b195b2073c21c7e7.pdf", "paperhash": "stec|unified_recurrent_network_for_many_feature_types", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nstec2019unified,\ntitle={Unified recurrent network for many feature types},\nauthor={Alexander Stec and Diego Klabjan and Jean Utke},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkxarj09Y7},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper127/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234531927, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "Hkxarj09Y7", "replyto": "Hkxarj09Y7", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper127/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335655164, "tmdate": 1552335655164, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper127/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 14}
