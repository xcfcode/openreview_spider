RIDE is built upon the ICM architecture (Pathak et al. 2017), which learns a state feature representation by minimizing the L2 distance between the actual next state feature and the predicted next state feature while minimizing the cross-entropy loss between the true action and the estimated action from the consecutive state features. Finally, RIDE's intrinsic reward bonus is computed by L2 norm of the difference between the current state feature and the next state feature, divided by the square root of the visitation count of the next state within the episode. Experimental results show that RIDE outperforms the existing exploration methods in the procedurally-generated environments (MiniGrd), and is competitive in singleton environments.\n\n\nComments and questions:\n- In reinforcement learning, the agent should explore the experiment due to uncertainty. If everything in the environment is certain to the agent, then it does not have to explore and just exploiting the past experience would be the best. My major concern about the paper is 'impact-driven' reward bonus may not account for the uncertainty. Constantly encouraging the states that have a high impact would not always good, and it may interfere to converge to an optimal policy.\n- It seems that RIDE assumes that 'high-impact' states are always good, thus rewarded. It could be true on the conducted MiniGrid domains, but this assumption may not hold in general. Could 'impact-driven' exploration be realistic and be applied to more general problems?\n- Similarly, in the problems where high-impact states have to be avoided, can RIDE still work effectively? For example, how about 'Dynamic-Obstacles' domains implemented in MiniGrid? In this task, RIDE may promote to chase obstacles that have to be avoided, interfering with learning optimal policy. It would be great to show the effectiveness of RIDE in such environments.\n- In MiniGrid problems, if the colors of walls and the goal are changed at every episode, does RIDE work well?\n- In Figure 4, why the intrinsic reward heatmaps are drawn only on the straight paths?\n- Minor: In the last sentence of Section 3, \"the current state and the next state predicted by the forward model\" -> \"the actual next state and the next state predicted by the forward model\"\n\n\n---\nafter rebuttal:\n\nThank the authors for clarifying my questions and concerns. Most of my concerns are addressed, and I raise my score accordingly.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1978/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1978/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "RIDE: Rewarding Impact-Driven Exploration for Procedurally-Generated Environments", "authors": ["Roberta Raileanu", "Tim Rockt\u00e4schel"], "authorids": ["raileanu@cs.nyu.edu", "tim.rocktaeschel@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "exploration", "curiosity"], "TL;DR": "Reward agents for taking actions that lead to changes in the environment state.", "abstract": "Exploration in sparse reward environments remains one of the key challenges of model-free reinforcement learning.

We appreciate they consider our work to be a \u201cworthwhile contribution\u201d, our experimental section \u201cvery thorough\u201d and our visualizations \u201cinsightful\u201d. \n\n\n\u201cThe motivation for augmenting the RIDE reward with an episodic count term is that the IDE loss alone would cause an agent to loop between two maximally different states.\nIt would be interesting to know whether this suspected behavior actually occurs in practice, and how much the episodic count term changes this behavior.\u201d\n\nWe thank the reviewer for suggesting to investigate this question in more detail. We carried out additional analyses and updated the draft. We have found that this behavior does occur in practice and can be observed by visualizing the agents\u2019 trajectories. After training on the MultiRoom-N12-S10 task, the NoEpisodicCounts ablation visits two of the states a large number of times going back and forth between them, while RIDE visits each state once on its path to the goal.  \n  \nFigure 10 in the Appendix further supports this claim by showing the number of different states the agent visits within an episode. While the NoEpisodicCounts ablation always visits a low number of different states (~< 10) each episode, RIDE visits an increasing number of states throughout training (converging to ~100 for an optimal policy). From this, we can infer that  NoEpisodicCounts revisits some of the states. \n\n\n\u201cIt is surprising that in the ablation in section A.5, removing the state count term does not lead to the expected behavior of looping between two states, but instead the agent converges to the same behavior as without the state count term.\u201d\n\nThe agent is also encouraged to explore different (state, action) pairs via the entropy regularization term in the IMPALA loss, which can help avoid local optimum in certain cases. During training, the NoEpisodicCounts agent exhibits the behavior of looping between two states, but due to entropy regularization, it can get unstuck once it finds some extrinsic reward. This can explain why the NoEpisodicCounts ablation takes longer to converge than RIDE, which is less prone to this cycling behavior. Note that in the more challenging MultiRoom-N12-S10 environment, NoEpisodicCounts does not learn a useful policy, likely because the extrinsic reward is too sparse, so the agent remains stuck in a cycle. \n\nTo further support the above hypothesis, we have added experiments with the NoEpisodicCounts model without entropy regularization. The results show that without the entropy loss term, NoEpisodicCounts is more likely to completely fail or converge to a suboptimal policy. \n\n\n\u201cAlso, in Figure 9, was the OnlyEpisodicCounts ablation model subjected to the same grid search described in A.2, or was it trained with the same intrinsic reward coefficient as the other models?\u201d\n\nWe ran the same grid search for the OnlyEpisodicCounts ablation.\n\n\n\u201cBased on the values in Table 4, it seems like replacing the L2 term with 1 without changing the reward coefficient would multiply the intrinsic reward by a large value.\u201d\n\nWe are unsure of what you mean by \u201creplacing the L2 term with 1\u201d. Could you kindly clarify the question?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1978/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1978/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "RIDE: Rewarding Impact-Driven Exploration for Procedurally-Generated Environments", "authors": ["Roberta Raileanu", "Tim Rockt\u00e4schel"], "authorids": ["raileanu@cs.nyu.edu", "tim.rocktaeschel@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "exploration", "curiosity"], "TL;DR": "Reward agents for taking actions that lead to changes in the environment state.", "abstract": "Exploration in sparse reward environments remains one of the key challenges of model-free reinforcement learning.

If everything in the environment is certain to the agent, then it does not have to explore and just exploiting the past experience would be the best. My major concern about the paper is 'impact-driven' reward bonus may not account for the uncertainty. \u201d\n\nWhile we agree that uncertainty estimation has been useful for developing exploration methods in the past, one of our main findings is that such methods can in fact be ineffective in certain settings. It seems that existing methods estimate the uncertainty poorly in sparse-reward partially-observed procedurally-generated environments. In such environments, the dynamics can be learned early in training without being helpful in guiding exploration towards extrinsic rewards in the environment. For example, in Fig 7 we demonstrate that the intrinsic reward of the ICM, RND, and Count methods diminishes very fast during training, suggesting that the agent has a good model of the transition dynamics (ICM) or has seen similar states before (RND, Count) so its uncertainty about the world is low, yet it fails to solve the task because it  hasn\u2019t found extrinsic reward. We believe the MiniGrid environments used in our work present a more challenging and realistic setting than previously used environments that are fully observable or do not change across episodes.\n\n\n\u201cConstantly encouraging the states that have a high impact would not always good, and it may interfere to converge to an optimal policy...\u201d\n\u201cIt seems that RIDE assumes that 'high-impact' states are always good, thus rewarded...\u201d\n\nThank you for your question. While we agree that there exist settings in which certain \u201chigh-impact\u201d actions may not help the agent to solve a task, we believe there are a few ways in which this issue is already addressed in our current formulation. First, the agent also learns from extrinsic reward, so if that action is negatively correlated with the extrinsic reward, the agent can learn, in principle, to avoid that action. Second, the agent also explores via entropy regularization, which can help to avoid getting stuck in a local optimum. For example, the MultiRoom-NoisyTV environment contains a high-impact action that is not useful for solving the task and it isn\u2019t penalized by negative extrinsic reward. Even in this more challenging setting, RIDE learns an optimal policy.\n\n\n\u201cSimilarly, in the problems where high-impact states have to be avoided, can RIDE still work effectively? For example, how about 'Dynamic-Obstacles' domains implemented in MiniGrid?...\u201d\n\nWe have updated the paper with experiments on Dynamic-Obstacles. RIDE learns to avoid the obstacles and reach the goal.  \n\n\n\u201cIn MiniGrid problems, if the colors of walls and the goal are changed at every episode, does RIDE work well?\u201d\n\nWe added experiments for answering this question in the revised draft. RIDE learns to solve this task and can even generalize to unseen colors at test time without any further fine-tuning. \n\n\n\u201cIn Figure 4, why the intrinsic reward heatmaps are drawn only on the straight paths?\u201d\n\nFigure 4 shows the trajectories of fully-trained models on MultiRoom-N7-S4. On this task, all agents learn optimal policies, so their behavior follows a shortest path to the goal. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1978/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1978/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "RIDE: Rewarding Impact-Driven Exploration for Procedurally-Generated Environments", "authors": ["Roberta Raileanu", "Tim Rockt\u00e4schel"], "authorids": ["raileanu@cs.nyu.edu", "tim.rocktaeschel@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "exploration", "curiosity"], "TL;DR": "Reward agents for taking actions that lead to changes in the environment state.", "abstract": "Exploration in sparse reward environments remains one of the key challenges of model-free reinforcement learning.

In particular, it focuses on exploration of procedurally generated environments where many states are novel compared to training experiences. It offers an intrinsic reward based on large movement in a state embedding space where this state embedding representation is co-trained on the same data already collected for learning. The paper claims to overcome shortcomings of specific past approaches (e.g. count-based / curiosity).\n\nThe need for intrinsic motivation in exploration is well motivated, and the approach for training a state embedding is anchored in multiple past works. The use of movement in this state embedding as an intrinsic reward is importantly novel and valuable. The problematic propensity for RL researchers to train on the test environments or design agents that are confused by proverbial noisy TVs and/or sacrifice extrinsic rewards in favor of intrinsic rewards is satisfyingly discussed and addressed through detailed experiments.\n\nThis reviewer moves to accept the paper for its contributions to intrinsically motivated exploration with thorough discussion of how the technique addresses shortcomings of past methods. This reviewer is thankful that the authors do not overinterpret the MiniGrid results and that they provide intuition for why the state embedding functions capture what we want them to capture. The fact that this approach makes joint use of the whole (s,a,r,s') tuple feels significant, as does the fact that this approach does not require any changes to the policy network (e.g. presuming that features useful for computing intrinsic rewards are also going to be useful for directly acting to optimize extrinsic rewards).\n \nQuestion:\n- In partially observable environments that require agents to wait for something, should a RIDE-motivated agent consider changes in its own internal clocks (part of the recurrent state) impactful moves?

The method, Impact-Driven Exploration, learns a state representation of the environment separate from the agent to be trained, based on a combied forward and inverse dynamics loss. The agent is then separately trained with a reward encouraging sequences of actions that maximally change the learned state.\n\nLike other latent state transition models (Pathak et al. 2017), RIDE learns a state representation based on a combined forward and inverse dynamics loss. However, Pathak et al. rewards the agent for taking actions that lead to large difference between the actual next state and the predicted next state. RIDE instead rewards the agent for taking actions that lead to a large difference between the actual next state and the current state. However, because rewarding one-step state differences may cause an agent to loop between two maximally-different states, the RIDE loss term is augmented with a state visitation count term, which decreases intrinsic reward for a state based on the number of times that state has been visited in the current episode.\n\nThe experiments compare RIDE to a selection of other intrinsic reward methods in the MiniGrid, Mario, and VizDoom environments. RIDE provides improved performance on a number of tasks, and solves challenging versions of the MiniGrid tasks that are not solved by other algorithms.\n\nDecision: Weak Accept.\n\nThe main weakness of the paper seems to be a limitation in novelty.\nPrevious papers such as (Pathak et al. 2017) have trained RL policies using an implicit reward based on learned latent states. Previous papers such as (Marino et al. 2019) have used difference between subsequent states as an implicit reward for training an RL policy. It is not a large leap to combine these two ideas by training with difference between subsequent learned states. However, this paper seems to be the first to do so.\n\nStrengths:\nThe experiments section is very thorough, and the visualizations of state counts and intrinsic reward returns are insightful.\nThe results appear to be state of the art for RL agents on the larger MiniGridWorld tasks.\nThe paper is clearly-written and easy to follow.\nThe Mario environment result discussed in section 6.2 is interesting in its own right, and provides some insight into previous work.\n\nDespite the limited novelty of the IDE reward term, the experiments and analysis provide insight into the behavior of trained agents and the results seem to improve on existing methods.\nOverall, the paper seems like a worthwhile contribution.\n\nNotes:\nIn section 2 paragraph 4, \"sintrinsic\" should be \"intrinsic\".\nIn section 3, at \"minimizes its discounted expected return,\" seems like it should be \"maximizes\".\nThe explanation of IMPALA (Espeholt et al., 2018) should occur before the references to IMPALA on page 5.\nLabels for the axes in figures 4 and 6 would be helpful for readability.\n\nThe motivation for augmenting the RIDE reward with an episodic count term is that the IDE loss alone would cause an agent to loop between two maximally different states.\nIt would be interesting to know whether this suspected behavior actually occurs in practice, and how much the episodic count term changes this behavior.\nIt is surprising that in the ablation in section A.5, removing the state count term does not lead to the expected behavior of looping between two states, but instead the agent converges to the same behavior as without the state count term.\n\nAlso, in Figure 9, was the OnlyEpisodicCounts ablation model subjected to the same grid search described in A.2, or was it trained with the same intrinsic reward coefficient as the other models?\nBased on the values in Table 4, it seems like replacing the L2 term with 1 without changing the reward coefficient would multiply the intrinsic reward by a large value.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1978/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1978/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "RIDE: Rewarding Impact-Driven Exploration for Procedurally-Generated Environments", "authors": ["Roberta Raileanu", "Tim Rockt\u00e4schel"], "authorids": ["raileanu@cs.nyu.edu", "tim.rocktaeschel@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "exploration", "curiosity"], "TL;DR": "Reward agents for taking actions that lead to changes in the environment state.", "abstract": "Exploration in sparse reward environments remains one of the key challenges of model-free reinforcement learning. Instead of solely relying on extrinsic rewards provided by the environment, many state-of-the-art methods use intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration. However, we show that existing methods fall short in procedurally-generated environments where an agent is unlikely to visit a state more than once. We propose a novel type of intrinsic reward which encourages the agent to take actions that lead to significant changes in its learned state representation. We evaluate our method on multiple challenging procedurally-generated tasks in MiniGrid, as well as on tasks with high-dimensional observations used in prior work. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach is more sample efficient than existing exploration methods, particularly for procedurally-generated MiniGrid environments. Furthermore, we analyze the learned behavior as well as the intrinsic reward received by our agent. In contrast to previous approaches, our intrinsic reward does not diminish during the course of training and it rewards the agent substantially more for interacting with objects that it can control.", "pdf": "/pdf/68bc2411f16aa93f68d856590f15a91041d772d2.pdf", "paperhash": "raileanu|ride_rewarding_impactdriven_exploration_for_procedurallygenerated_environments", "code": "https://github.com/facebookresearch/impact-driven-exploration", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nRaileanu2020RIDE:,\ntitle={RIDE: Rewarding Impact-Driven Exploration for Procedurally-Generated Environments},\nauthor={Roberta Raileanu and Tim Rockt\u00e4schel},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkg-TJBFPB}\n}", "original_pdf": "/attachment/3f39cb9f5d0edea35c18c25649d70ce51ab3fdac.pdf"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
