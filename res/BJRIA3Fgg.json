For example, on the CIFAR10 dataset, for morph110_1c1, the absolute performance improvement is up to 2.66%, and the relative improvement is up to 32.6%. On the CIFAR100 dataset, for morph110_1c1, the absolute performance improvement is up to 5.13%, and the relative improvement is up to 16.1%. These results have been updated in this paper with, a) two newly added tables (Table 2 & 4), b) one newly added paragraph (the second to the last one at the end of Section 4.2).\n\n2) How does the incremental training time after morphing relate to that of the network trained from scratch?\n\nIn this work, we adopted a uniform training procedure for both of these two learning scheme. The setup is the same as [He2015]. Therefore, the incremental training time is the same as training from scratch in this research. But the incremental training time after morphing can be greatly speeded up since the weights are already learned. From experience, the incremental training does not necessarily need a full training. Currently we are inspecting on this topic.\n\n3) Where is the extra computational cost of the morphed networks come from?\n\nThe extra computational cost comes from the newly added parts of the network. More precisely speaking, it is the computational cost of the part that the network morphs to, minus the computational cost of the part that the network morphs from. As an example for ResNet, please refer to Fig. 3 (a) and (b), where the newly added part is shadowed in green.\n\n4) Why is the quality of the baseline ResNet models lag behind those that are reported in the literature and github? (E.g. the github ResNet-101 model is supposed to have 6.1% top-5 recall vs 6.6 reported in the paper)\n\nThere might be some misunderstanding. 6.61% is the top-1 error rate for ResNet-110 on CIFAR10 ([He2015] (Table 6)), while 6.1% is the top-5 error rate for ResNet-101 on ImageNet.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Modularized Morphing of Neural Networks", "abstract": "In this work we study the problem of network morphism, an effective learning scheme to morph a well-trained neural network to a new one with the network function completely preserved.

On the other hand, in this work, we focused more on the model capability, instead of training time. Therefore, for a fair comparison, we adopted a uniform training strategy for both the morphing scheme and the learning from scratch scheme.

While the experiment shows that initializing from ResNet gives better error rate than the ones trained from scratch, it is unclear what the source is.\n\nWhen available, the results were cited from their original papers. For example, the accuracies of ResNet on the CIFAR10 dataset in Table 1 were from [He2015]. For other ones that cannot be found in any existing paper, we trained the models by ourselves.\n\n5) One major advantage of this type of knowledge transfer (Net2Net, NetMorph) is to speedup training and model exploration. There seems to be no experiments demonstrate such advantage (possibly due to the lose initialization of BatchNorm). This is the major drawback of this paper.\n\nIt has been verified in our previous work [Wei2016] that VGG16 could be easily morphed into a 19-layer network (NetMorph-VGG16), with a 15x speedup compared with training from scratch. (NetMorh-VGG16 performed better than both VGG16 and VGG19.) In this work, our focus is to study the macroscopic problem of network morphism, i.e., modularized morphing. Thus we adopted a uniform training procedure for both of these two learning schemes. Therefore, the training time for network morphism is the same as training from scratch in this research. But the training can be greatly speeded up as in [Wei2016], which however is not our focus in this research.\n\nIt is much cheaper to adopt network morphism to explore and design a new effective network architecture. For example, for the network architectures illustrated in Fig. 4, we simply split the branches to compose new modules, which does not require domain-specific knowledge. However, designing such a new network architecture via training from scratch requires significant insight to the network architectures, and it is also hard to tell whether the newly designed network will achieve a better performance until it is fully trained. \n\nAnother advantage when exploring new network architectures with network morphism is that, one can quickly check whether a morphed architecture deserves further exploration by continuing to train the morphed network in a finer learning rate (e.g. 1e-5), to see if the performance is improved. Hence, one does not have to wait for days or even months of training time to tell whether the new network architecture will achieve a better performance. This could significantly save human time for deciding which network architecture is worth for exploring.\n \nFor BatchNorm, it is not a problem in our proposed algorithms. While it will cause the morphed network not to exactly preserve the network function, this small perturbation introduced by BatchNorm actually will not affect the performance of the morphed network. We observed almost identical accuracies for the original network and the morphed network before continual training. This was stated in the last paragraph of Section 3.7.\n\n6) The method proposed by the author can in principle do quite complicated transformation, e.g. transform an entire resnet from a single conv layer, the experiment only consists of simple module transformations, which in some way can be covered by atomic operations. It would be more interesting to see what the results of more complicated transformations are (even if they are not as effective). \n\nThis is a very good suggestion. Theoretically, an entire ResNet could be morphed from a single convolutional layer. However, intuitively, this will not be that effective as the change to the network architecture is too large. Instead, we proposed to grow the network depth in an exponential order by network morphism. It was demonstrated to be very effective. This is not trivial topic, and we have organized the findings in another paper which is under review.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Modularized Morphing of Neural Networks", "abstract": "In this work we study the problem of network morphism, an effective learning scheme to morph a well-trained neural network to a new one with the network function completely preserved.

In the updated version, we also added the results of the original and morphed 34-layer networks on ImageNet.

The results of the 34-layer network were added in the second paragraph of Section 4.4, Table 5, and Fig. 6.\n\nAs for the newly proposed network architectures, definitely, it would be better if we are able to provide comparison results with all state-of-the-art networks beyond residual networks. However, in this paper, we target at introducing a general learning scheme, instead of a specific neural network model. Owning to the strict definition of this learning scheme and the proposed morphing algorithms, it has potential to build a more powerful model based on an (arbitrary) existing parent network. Due to the computational resource limitation, we decided to select the residual networks, the most representative network architecture, as the parent network to morph. \n\n2) \u201cMy biggest issue is that computational time and effort for these techniques is not mentioned in detail.

The paper should include comparisons with state of the art, for example wide residual networks.\u201d\n\nIn this paper, we target at introducing a general learning scheme, instead of a specific neural network model. Owning to the strict definition of this learning scheme and the proposed morphing algorithms, it has potential to build a more powerful model based on an (arbitrary) existing parent network. Definitely, it could be better if we are able to include comparison results with all state-of-the-art networks beyond residual networks. However, due to the computational resource limitation, we decided to select the residual networks, the most representative network architecture, as the parent network to morph. Notice that, almost all recently proposed network architectures, such as wide residual networks, fractal networks, stochastic depth networks, and densely connected networks, are variants of or quite related to the residual networks. The success of the proposed learning scheme on residual network architectures indicates that it is very likely to also work well on other newly proposed state-of-the-art networks related to residual architectures, but more experiments about which are needed and considered as our future work.\n\n2) \u201cTables should also report number of parameters for each architecture, this would help fair comparison.\u201d\n\nWe have added the number of parameters for each architecture in Table 1 & 3. As can be seen, the morphed network architectures have less than 1.2x parameters comparing against the original ones.

It is quite unexpected that this approach yields any improvements over the baseline model at all.\n\nHowever, for some of the basic tenets of network morphing, experimental evidence is not given in the paper. Here are some fundamental questions raised by the paper:\n- How does the quality of morphed networks compares to those with the same topology trained from scratch?\n- How does the incremental training time after morphing relate to that of the network trained from scratch?\n- Where is the extra computational cost of the morphed networks come from?\n- Why is the quality of the baseline ResNet models lag behind those that are reported in the literature and github?
