However, their approaches turn to have issues, pointed out by Locatello et al.-2019 The main point of our paper is to solve these issues of penalizing TC(mu) by adding an additional regularizing term.\n\nEquation (5) is derived in Chen et al. In equation (8), D is a discriminator as stated below equation (8).\n\nIt is a good point that we should explain about our choice of hyperparameter beta and eta. The reason for eta=10 is simple. Since the variance term in equation 4 soon becomes small (close to 0) after training begins, this term will not contribute much compared with L_{beta-TC} term. So, eta=10 is enough to strengthen the penalty at the beginning of training. Higher value cannot bring further improvement since z is close to mu already. And lower values may not guarantee z being close to mu.\n\nIt is a critical yet open question where there is an quantitative indicator of the performance of a VAE. Many people make various efforts in this area, however, there exist all sorts of issues for all of them, and none of them has been widely accepted as a good measurement, see Locatelo et al-2019.

All the VAEs they considered are based on optimizing marginal likelihood, which means their conclusion should be limited to this scope. Note that RTCVAE proposed by us is still one of this kind, and our objective does not introduce inductive biases. It is one of our main points that some issue raised by them can be solved in our paper, hence to challenge their Challenging Common Assumptions\u2026 Thank you for introducing the work about inductive biases done by Ronelik et al., which is very inspiring and helpful.\n\nOn your comments on Theorem 1:\n1.\tRegarding the simplification of the proof, actually we started our proof with these parameters, R, c_0,\u2026 c_4, l, and did not intentionally try to expand the generality of the theorem. Instead, we were surprised to see that there exist such a large class of distributions of z that all have bounded TC(z). When the objective function only penalizes TC(mu), neural networks are so flexible to easily find a distribution with low TC(z), and total correlation estimators like MSS can encourage shutting down latent dimensions, which together cause the disparity of TC(mu) and TC(z). This fact was not noticed until Locattelo et al.\u2019s work, and our investigation gives an explanation of the cause. Hence, Theorem 1 leads to the necessity of penalizing the difference between the distributions of mu and z, e.g. equation (4), simple as it is, yet necessary in our opinion.\n2.\tCan the bound C of TC(z) be arbitrarily close to 0 by tweaking parameters R, c_0,\u2026 c_4, l? No. It is an interesting question whether there exists a distribution of z~ N(mu, Sigma\u2019(mu)) with arbitrarily small TC(z) given mu. However, this question remains open to us for now. \n3.\tSorry we don\u2019t understand what you mean by \u201cC\u2026is lower bounded by (2pi)^{-D/2}\u201d. Does TC(z) have a lower bound greater than 0? This will be the next question, if the answer to the previous question is no. In other words, if TC(z) cannot be arbitrarily small, what\u2019s the lower bound? We leave it to future work.\n4.\tAs for the notation of C, it is a convention that throughout the mathematical analysis, the meaning of C can change to eliminate some redundant work of tracking. For example, in the last two lines of our proof of Theorem 1, C absolves the integral in the front (the 3rd term in the second last line) since the integral is also bounded. We apologize for the confusion and will make some changes to reduce that.\n\nYour concern about our argument of MSS_0 and MSS_1 is valuable to us, and we will revise this part to make it clearer for readers. \n\n1.\tThere is no mathematical difference between MSS_0 and MSS_1 (same formulation), only a difference in implementation. See Appendix A.2\n2.\tFor the part that is difficult for you to accept, we add more explanation, see equation (10). In short, we show that the chance of z^(i) and z^(j) (actually it should be mu^(j)) to be close is very small in high dimensional latent space.\n3.\tWe have observed from experiments that MSS/MWS shut down dimensions, and will list some results in our paper. Shutting down dimension is undesirable firstly due to the reason you mentioned, i.e., latent dimension should not be fewer than ground truth. Moreover, it is very natural for VAE to learn more latent dimensions than ground truth. Take dSprites for example, shape may need more than one dimension to describe as ground truth does. We will address this further in our revision.\n4.\tOn the bottom of Page 5, there is a type, a \u201c)\u201d is missing after the correlation matrix Sigma. We just gave an example of strongly correlated z in the parentheses. We revised this part to make it clearer.\n5.\tWe observed much more stable estimation of TC with the density trick than with MSS/MWS. Though the former is known to have issues, we don\u2019t have further insights to share. Meanwhile, we pointed our some previously unknown issues of the latter that people should consider before using these techniques.\n\nIn addition to dSprites and 3d shapes, we also trained our model on 3d faces. We agree with your opinion that we will included more experiments to this section.\n1.\tChoosing eta=10 is because the variance of z|mu actually decays very fast and then stops around 0. Since our purpose is just to eliminate the disparity of z and mu, eta=10 serves this purpose. Higher value of eta cannot contribute more to the loss function since variance is close to 0, while lower value is insufficient.\n2.\tWe take your suggestion on DIP-VAE-I seriously and plan to do it later. Unfortunately we didn\u2019t have the time to do the comparison before submission.\n\nAll minors are fixed.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper750/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper750/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ze.cheng@cn.bosch.com", "junchenl@cs.cmu.edu", "chenxujwang@gmail.com", "jixuan.gu@sjtu.edu.cn", "hao.xu-1@colorado.edu", "xinjianl@cs.cmu.edu", "fmetze@cs.cmu.edu"], "title": "RTC-VAE: HARNESSING THE PECULIARITY OF TOTAL CORRELATION  IN LEARNING DISENTANGLED REPRESENTATIONS", "authors": ["Ze Cheng", "Juncheng B Li", "Chenxu Wang", "Jixuan Gu", "Hao Xu", "Xinjian Li", "Florian Metze"], "pdf": "/pdf/791065a4afc28b0129574cec055b91961ecf6bd6.pdf", "TL;DR": "diagnosed all the problem of STOA VAEs theoretically and qualitatively", "abstract": "In the problem of unsupervised learning of disentangled representations, one of the promising methods is to penalize the total correlation of sampled latent vari-ables.

They show that optimising marginal likelihood in a generative model (such as a VAE) cannot achieve disentangling without any inductive biases in the model. But there inductive biases in the models used by disentangling methods, along with the loss (that is a variant of the ELBO and not the marginal likelihood), that allow disentangling in practice. There are also theoretical works such as [1] that explain this behaviour.\n\nThe theoretical contribution of the paper is Theorem 1, that claims to show the existence of distributions with arbitrarily large TC(mu) but with small, bounded TC(z). Indeed the proof shows that TC(z) is bounded by C, but looking at Appendix A it seems as though C is a function of c1,c2 and R that is used to define p(z|mu), and is lower bounded by (2pi)^{-D/2} (a constant, which confusingly, is also denoted by C in the appendix). It appears necessary to have another line that mentions how small C can be chosen to be via choice of c1,c2,R. Also it seems as though the proof can be largely simplified by having sigma\u2019_j(mu)=c_1 if |mu|<R and sigma\u2019_j(mu)=c_4/|mu| if |mu|>R, removing free parameters l,c_2,c_3.\n\nThe methodological contribution of the paper is to propose an extra regularisation term that penalises the variances of q(z|x). While this does introduce another hyperparameter to tune, it has the advantage of being simple to implement and having an intuitive explanation of how it can address the problem; if q(z|x) is encouraged to have smaller variance, the distribution of z will be encouraged to be closer to the distribution of mu, hence helping to address the disparity between TC(z) TC(mu). \n\nI like the simplicity of the idea, however the analysis is lacking in rigour. First of all, when comparing the different methods of estimating TC(z), it\u2019s not clear what the mathematical difference of MSS_0 and MSS_1 is. This should be explicitly stated so that one can understand the results in Figure 1. Regarding the following analysis, it\u2019s not clear why the off diagonal elements of the cube (i.e. q(z^(i)_k|n^(j)) when i != j ) should be very small compared to the diagonal elements. For example, it could be the case that z^(i) and z^(j) are close to one another, in which case the (i,j)th entries will be non-negligible compared to the diagonal. Hence the analysis is difficult to accept. Also the claim that MSS and MWS prefer to shut down latent dims should be verified by experiments. Further, it\u2019s unclear why this is undesirable from a disentangling point of view. Of course we don\u2019t want to use fewer number of latent dimensions than the number of ground truth factors, but also we don\u2019t want to use more latent dimensions. Also the at the bottom of page 5 is a Gaussian with a correlated covariance matrix, and it\u2019s claimed that its TC can be arbitrarily large, but surely this is fixed? Finally the authors list lots of reasons why not to use MSS, but there is no discussion about the density-ratio trick method for estimating TC. For example, it is known that this method suffers underestimates of TC (c.f. Kim & Mnih) - it has its own issues, that can be arguably more severe than MSS. This analysis needs a lot more explanation and rigour.\n\nThe experimental results are very weak and sparse, that is nowhere near enough to give a convincing case for the newly proposed method. The method has only been trained on dsprites and 3d shapes, with three choices of beta and a single value of eta, and only estimates of TC(mu) and TC(z) are reported, with no evaluation of disentanglement performance. There is some evidence in the paper that the regularisation makes both TC(mu) and TC(z) close to 0 with eta=10, but it\u2019s unclear how this affects disentangling performance, and whether smaller values of eta can give a sweetspot. The experiments should cover a larger range of datasets, with evaluation on how different disentanglement metrics, TC(mu) and TC(z) change for different values of beta and eta, along with a comparison with other disentangling methods, especially DIP-VAE-1, that directly penalises correlation in mu (for an open source library that facilitates this, see e.g. github.com/google-research/disentanglement_lib). Even the authors acknowledge that \u201cthe scale of our experiments is limited\u201d, and it is clear that the paper is not yet ready for publication.\n\nOverall, the proposed idea is simple and easy to implement, which is the main advantage of the paper, but it is evident that the analysis and evaluation lacks rigour, hence the paper will need to undergo significant revision to be in a publishable state.\n\n[1] Rolinek, M., Zietlow, D. and Martius, G., Variational Autoencoders Pursue PCA Directions (by Accident).

However, we still believe that total correlation could be a key to the disentanglement of unsupervised representative learning, and we propose a remedy,  RTC-VAE, which rectifies the total correlation penalty.   Experiments show that our model has a more reasonable distribution of the mean representation compared with baseline models, e.g.,\u03b2-TCVAE and FactorVAE.", "keywords": ["Total Correlation", "VAEs", "Disentanglement"], "paperhash": "cheng|rtcvae_harnessing_the_peculiarity_of_total_correlation_in_learning_disentangled_representations", "original_pdf": "/attachment/9d8cae7f38213737985b5ec263a2a0a9d0a26387.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\ncheng2020rtcvae,\ntitle={{\\{}RTC{\\}}-{\\{}VAE{\\}}: {\\{}HARNESSING{\\}} {\\{}THE{\\}} {\\{}PECULIARITY{\\}} {\\{}OF{\\}} {\\{}TOTAL{\\}} {\\{}CORRELATION{\\}}  {\\{}IN{\\}} {\\{}LEARNING{\\}} {\\{}DISENTANGLED{\\}} {\\{}REPRESENTATIONS{\\}}},\nauthor={Ze Cheng and Juncheng B Li and Chenxu Wang and Jixuan Gu and Hao Xu and Xinjian Li and Florian Metze},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkeuipVKDH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
