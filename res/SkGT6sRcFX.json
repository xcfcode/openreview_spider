I will try to informally describe the proof in Proposition 1. Kindly clarify if my understanding is correct or not.\n\nFirstly regarding the statement of the proof: You are trying to construct a distribution over the weights connecting two (infinitely wide) hidden layers that will ensure that the inner product between the activations and the weights is well defined. Is this correct?\n\nNow regarding the proof itself: Firstly, you define a distribution over the weights connecting the first and second hidden layer. Since the first hidden layer has infinite width, any weight vector connecting the first hidden layer will be infinite dimensional. We can think of this weight vector as a function of the weights connecting the visible layer and the first hidden layer. Is this correct? To be more specific, a weight vector connecting the first infinite hidden layer to a single unit of the second hidden layer is treated as a function of the weights between the visible and hidden layer? \n\nAssuming the above is indeed correct, you now need to define a distribution over these weights. In particular, you assume that these weights are sampled from a Gaussian Process with 0 mean and covariance function C_1. Now you claim that this choice of C_1 ensures that resultant distribution is a distribution over the RKHS induced by the first hidden layer. This is confusing for me since I am not aware of this result. Can you please point me to the exact result in (Aronszajn) where this result is mentioned? \n\nI think that the entire theoretical aspect of the paper relies on this result (presumably from Aronszajn). Hence, it is surprising that this result is not mentioned in the \"Related Works\" section or anywhere else in the main paper. With this result in mind, the rest of the paper becomes easy to digest.

Using the representer theorem, a proper distribution for weights is constructed in H_{k_i} instead of being learned by \\phi_i, and then is formulated as a GP. \n\nCons:\n\nHowever, there are some key issues.\n1. The so-called \u201cinfinite width\u201d is just yielded by kernels in RKHS for weight initialization. For practical implementation, the authors use this scheme with random Fourier features to construct finite-width network. A key issue is that how to guarantee that the approximated weights are still in the same space? For example, weights can be in RKHS, but their approximation might be not in RKHS. See in [S1] for details.\n \n[S1] Generalization Properties of Learning with Random Features, NIPS 2017.\n \n2. Experimental part is not very convincing. First, the authors just compare different initialization schemes. The used architectures are simple and not representative. Second, the overall performance is not satisfactory, and the compared classification datasets are quite small. Overall, the experimental results are inadequate and unconvincing.\n\nSummary:\nThe paper attempts to proposal a weight initialization scheme to enable infinite deep infinite-width networks. However, there are some key issues not address such as whether the approximated weights are still in the same space and the limited experimental results.\n\nResponse to rebuttal:\nThe authors have addressed my question about the weights being still in the same RKHS. I still think the motivation and experiments are not very satisfactory. \n\nTherefore the paper is very borderline.

Given that our proposed approach is agnostic to the choice of non-linearity, due to the iterative nature of the construction, the derived kernels will in general not be available in closed form and are thus not particularly suited for use within e.g. an SVM. However,  one can examine the structural properties of these kernels. We will clarify this point in the paper. \n\nUnlike Cho & Saul 2009 and Wilson et al 2016 who strive to derive kernels that mimic the computations in deep networks, this paper is motivated by the desire to improve our understanding of neural networks. In particular, we are motivated by the fact that single-layer infinite-width networks have played an important role in helping us acquire a better understanding of single-layer standard, finite-width networks. Until now the construction of infinite-width networks has been limited to at most two layers, while on the other hand we currently use deep finite-width networks. Our paper is an effort towards bridging this gap by enabling the construction of deep infinite-width networks that can then be used for analysing deep finite-width networks. This should help us gain a better understanding of deep, finite-width networks that have transformed the field dramatically over the last decade. Please also note that in this paper kernels are used as tools that enable us to more easily reason about the function spaces induced by the activations of an infinite-width network and are not the main focus of the paper. In particular, the main motivation of our paper is not the derivation of kernels that mimic computations in infinite-width neural networks, but the furthering our understanding of neural networks.\n\nConcerning the experimental results -- The main contribution of this paper is of theoretical nature (see Proposition 1 in our submission). However, we also extensively discuss the practical implication of this results and support the direct practical relevance of our theory with experiments on benchmark datasets in two different domains, classification and regression. Given the motivation for our paper, the experimental results should be seen as showing the practical relevance of the proposed theory and not as an attempt at developing a new training heuristic for achieving state-of-the-art performance.\n\nTo adequately validate our proposed theoretical contribution, we need to disentangle the effect of initialisation on network performance from the effects of other training heuristics. Thus, we purposefully did not use any advanced techniques, such as data augmentation, learning rate scheduling or architecture search, all of which are commonly used to improve state-of-the-art performance. \n\nIn particular, to appropriately validate our theory, we tested Win-Win against commonly used initialisation methods on three benchmarks datasets in classification and regression, thus showing that the performance of Win-Win initialisation is not tied to any particular dataset or task. On all datasets considered in the paper, we have demonstrated that Win-Win either matches or exceeds the performance of the competing approaches for the considered architectures. In particular, for classification on MNIST, we chose the architectures that had the best performance without using advanced preprocessing and training heuristics as recorded on http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. For CIFAR10, we used an architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance and applied the different initialisation approaches in the last fully-connected layer. Note that we didn\u2019t use any advanced training heuristics here, but just made use of the underlying architecture.\n\nWith respect to the reviewer\u2019s comment about our experimental setup, we hope that our reply explains our main motivation for choosing the tasks, architectures and datasets for the experimental studies presented in the paper.\n\nFollowing the reviewer\u2019s suggestion, we have now also implemented Win-Win for convolutional layers and are currently running experiments. We will update this thread and the paper with the results as soon as they are available. \n\nIf you have any further comments, suggestions or questions, we would appreciate them.\nGiven the above explanations, particularly our responses to the raised issues, we would kindly like to ask you to consider raising the rating of this paper.

In particular, our method does not construct kernel mappings between layers and as such does not use these for weight initialisation. Furthermore, the distribution constructed over the RKHS H_{k_i} is not a result of the representer theorem as no objective is being minimised with respect to any training data. Specifically, this distribution is derived by studying the structure of the induced RKHS and is a known result from RKHS theory. Given the constructed weight distribution, this particular form of the weights arises due to the fact that the covariance function of the GP is a convolution of kernels. This can be easily verified by computing the covariance between the weights. Note that although the form of the weights does resemble the result from the representer theorem, it is not based on it, but follows from results on RKHS distributions as discussed above.\n\nBefore addressing the specific issues identified by the reviewer, we would first like to draw the attention of the reviewer to the main contribution of this paper (Proposition 1 in our submission), namely a method for constructing infinite-width networks with arbitrarily many layers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that allows us to go beyond just two layers of infinite width. As single-layer infinite-width networks have historically played an important role in helping us acquire a deeper understanding of standard, finite-width networks, being able to construct deep infinite-width networks should help us gain a better understanding of deep, finite-width networks.  \n\nAlthough the main contribution of this paper is of theoretical nature, we also discuss its immediate practical implications. In particular, we can transfer our findings from the infinite-width to the finite-width case. Specifically, we show how our proposed infinite-width construction approach gives rise to a novel weight initialisation scheme for finite-width networks that we term Win-Win. Furthermore, we conducted experiments with Win-Win on benchmark datasets across two different task domains, classification and regression, thus showcasing that our theoretical contribution has direct and practical relevance.\n\nWe now address the issues raised by the reviewer:\nThe infinite width of the layers is given by the fact that there are infinitely many weights connecting each pair of layers. In particular, the infinite width is not given by any kernel as we define our kernels at the level of individual layers that are of infinite width to begin with. Further, we would like to draw the attention of the reviewer to the fact that, after proposing a construction approach for infinite-width networks with arbitrarily many layers, we examine the implications of this construction for finite-width networks. In particular, the practical implications discussed are motivated by the idea of transferring the findings from infinite-width networks to their finite-width counterparts and thus hopefully enabling a better understanding of finite-width networks in general. Note that this is not done with the idea of practically implementing the proposed infinite-width construction approach.\nFurthermore, we note that we use Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the integrals derived in the infinite-width case. As we discuss in the paper, this can be viewed as a random features expansion of the kernels. Note, however, that in general this will not be a random Fourier features expansion because the underlying kernels are not guaranteed to be shift invariant.\n\nWith regard to the comment about ensuring that the \u201capproximated weights are still in the same space\u201d, we would like to point out that, in the finite-width case, this is automatically ensured as the weights are linear combinations of the activations. In particular, in the finite-width case, the required spaces are all subspaces of R^d , where d is the width of the respective layer. Thus, by examining the dimensionality of the weight vectors, it is straightforward to verify that the weights are indeed in the appropriate space. We understand this potential source of confusion and will provide further clarification in the paper.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper848/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper848/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper848/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Infinitely Deep Infinite-Width Networks", "abstract": "Infinite-width neural networks have been extensively used to study the theoretical properties underlying the extraordinary empirical success of standard, finite-width neural networks.

In order to be able to compute the inner product between activations and weights, these objects need to be in the same function space. If they are not in the same function space, then we cannot compute inner products between these quantities and therefore cannot define infinite-width networks correctly. If we assume that the activations are sufficiently well-behaved then the function space that they span will be a subset of, for example, L_{2}. In that case, we can characterise these functions in terms of their norms.  \n\nWith regard to the comment on the norm issue, in general we do not know how well-behaved activations are and are therefore not able to characterize the space of activations in terms of norms. Thus, in general, we have no way of quantifying the space of activations in terms of norms and cannot further address this issue apart from emphasizing that the activations and weights need to be in the same function space.\n\nThe main contribution of this paper is theoretical, namely a method to construct infinite-width networks with arbitrarily many layers (Proposition 1 in our submission). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that allows us to go beyond just two layers of infinite width. Historically, single-layer infinite-width networks have played an important role in helping us acquire a deeper understanding of standard, finite-width networks. Being able to construct deep infinite-width networks should help us gain a better understanding of deep, finite-width networks that have transformed the field dramatically over the last decade. This summarises our main motivation for developing a construction approach for deep infinite-width networks. \n\nApart from purely theoretical merit, our theoretical contribution also has immediate practical implications. In particular, we can transfer some of our findings from the infinite-width case to finite-width networks. Specifically, we show how our proposed construction approach gives rise to a novel weight initialisation scheme for finite-width networks that we term Win-Win.\n\nDue to the theoretical nature and mathematical complexity involved, we agree that this paper is rather technical. We therefore tried to ease the reader into the challenges of defining deep infinite-width networks (see Section 3.1). We thank the reviewer for the comment about clarity and welcome any further comments on what we could add to the text to make this topic more approachable.\n\nAlthough the main contribution of this paper is theoretical in nature, we also discuss some practical implications of the developed theory. Note that the main motivation of this paper is expanding our understanding of neural networks. Thus, the practical implications discussed should be seen as highlighting the practical relevance of the proposed theory and not as an attempt at developing a new training heuristic for achieving state-of-the-art performance. \n\nTo highlight the implications of the developed theory, we conducted experiments on benchmark datasets across different task domains. In particular, the experimental results are there to demonstrate that our theoretical contribution has direct and practical relevance, and to validate the theory developed in the paper. \n\nFurthermore, in order to adequately validate the developed theory, we needed to disentangle the effect of initialisation on network performance from the effects of other training heuristics. To this end, we purposefully did not use any advanced techniques, such as data augmentation or learning rate scheduling, all of which are commonly used to improve state-of-the-art performance. In the experimental setup, we tested Win-Win against commonly used initialisation methods on three benchmark datasets in classification and regression, thus showing that the advantages of Win-Win are not tied to one particular dataset or even one particular task.\n\nIf you have any further comments, suggestions or questions, we would appreciate them. Given the above explanations, we would also kindly like to ask you to consider raising the rating of this paper.
