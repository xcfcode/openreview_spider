It seems to be an assumption without any support.\u201d\nA1: Actually the term \u201cpretend-to-share\u201d is just used to describe an existing problem and related evidence has been observed in some previous work (Bousmalis et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017).  While we have claimed this in \u201cIntroduction\u201d section, we will make this more clear in our revised version.\n\n\n\nQ2: \u201cTo my best knowledge, meta-learning, including MAML (Finn et al. 2017), can obviously solve both in-task setting and out-task setting. In some sense, I think this work is almost equivalent to MAML\u201d\nA2: \n1) First of all, we don\u2019t claim that meta-learning methods cannot be used for in-task setting and out-of-task setting. The thing we claimed is existing methods about meta learning focus on modelling the dependencies of samples from the SAME tasks.\n2) Most existing meta learning methods are designed for few-shot learning (including MAML), whose motivation is far different from multi-task learning. For multi-task learning, one of the questions we care about is \u201chow to allow different tasks to help each other as more as possible\u201d.\n3) In this paper, one major contribution is that we find an existing problem in multi-task learning can be alleviated by allowing different tasks to pass gradients. \nTo summarize, this paper starts from a real problem existing in multi-task learning, and we propose to solve it by passing gradients between different tasks. Similarly, most existing meta learning methods propose to passing gradient within the same tasks for few-shot learning scenario. \n\nQ3: \u201cseveral state-of-the-art baselines including MAML and cross-stitch networks should be compared\u201d\nA3: As we have described above, MAML has its own training setting(training set, support set, test set), which is hard to use for our tasks. \nAdditionally, there are too many existing methods for multi-task learning, we have chosen existing models as our baselines which also focus on \u201cpretend-to-share\u201d problem.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1197/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1197/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1197/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-task Learning with Gradient Communication", "abstract": "  In this paper, we describe a general framework to systematically analyze current neural models for multi-task learning, in which we find that existing models expect to disentangle features into different spaces while features learned in practice are still entangled in shared space,  leaving potential hazards for other training or unseen tasks.

The framework is general for including some of the current neural models for MTL. Under the framework, the author propose a new method that could allow tasks to communicate each other with explicit gradients. Based on the gradients being communicated, the system could adjust the updates of one task based on the gradient information of the other task. Also, prior task relatedness information could be incorporated to the system. \n\nThe idea of incorporating passing gradients among tasks seems very interesting, which is new as far as I am aware of. Although the idea is simple, but it seems intuitive since purely aggregating gradient updates might have undesired cancelling effects on each other.  \n\nThere are some questions I have about this method. \n1.\tI\u2019m curious about how the sequential update in pairwise task communication affects the performance. \n2.\tAlso, how does sequential update nature of the method affect the training speed, as for now, the parameter update consists of two sequential steps which also involve changes to the traditional update rule. \n3.\tWhat is fast weight for and how it is used in (9)? It would be better if there are more details on how the update is carried out during the gradient communication.\n4.\tRegarding the relatedness for List-wise communication, is it possible to update the relatedness dynamically? Since the pre-computed relatedness might not always make sense. During the learning of the representations, the task relatedness could change in the process.\nThe system framework for MTL introduced by the authors seem to be kind of isolated to the method proposed. I feel that the framework is not quite easy to understand from the way it is presented.  From my perspective, the effectiveness of analyzing MTL methods using the framework seems a bit limited to me, as it serves more like a way of abstracting MTL models instead of analyzing it. Therefore, I feel the content devoted to that part might be too much.\n\nOverall, I think the paper is interesting although the method itself is relatively simple. And the direction of utilizing gradient communication among tasks seem interesting and could be further explored. But I do feel the organization of the paper is a bit too heavy on the framework instead of the methodology proposed.

Besides, the authors summarize existing multitask learning algorithms in a framework called Parameters Read-Write Networks (PRAWN). \n\nPros:\n- The view of putting existing multi-task learning algorithms in a read-write framework is quite intriguing and inspiring.\n\nCons:\n- Motivation: The whole paper is assumed to address the \"pretend-to-share\" problem, while the authors never provide any evidence that such problem really exists for any other algorithm. It seems to be an assumption without any support.\n- Method:  \n   - Though the read-write framework is very interesting, the authors do not clearly present it, so that the readers can be totally get lost. For example, what do you mean by writing {\\Theta^{*r}_k - \\theta^{swr}_k}? In the line of structural read-op, where are \\theta_3 and \\theta_4  in the column of the constituent para. ? What do you mean by writing the equation (4)? How do you define g() in equation (8)? This is a research paper which should be as clear as possible for the readers to reproduce the results, rather than a proposal only with such abstract and general functions defined. \n   - In the list-wise communication scheme, you define the task relationship in equation (11). The problem is how do you evaluate the effectiveness of such definition, since massive works in multitask learning pursue to learn the task relationship automatically to guarantee the effectiveness instead of such heuristic definition. \n- Related works: The authors do not clearly and correctly illustrate the connections between this work and meta-learning/domain adaptation. To my best knowledge, meta-learning, including MAML (Finn et al. 2017), can obviously solve both in-task setting and out-task setting. In some sense, I think this work is almost equivalent to MAML. \n- Experiments: \n   - First, several state-of-the-art baselines including MAML and cross-stitch networks should be compared. Specifically, for the text classification dataset, there have been a lot of domain adaptation works discovering the transferable pivots (shared features) and non-pivots (specific features), which the authors should be aware of and compare in Table 3.  \n   - The Figure 5 is not clear to me, and so is the discussion. The authors try to explain that the updating direction of shared parameters for PGP-SR is an integration of two private updating directions. I tried hard to understand, but still think that Figure 5(a) is even better than Figure 5(b). The updating direction of the shared parameters is almost the same as the cyan line.\n- Presentation: there are so many grammatical errors and typos.

As it is, evidence for this seems to be mostly anecdotal, even though this forms the central thesis of the paper.\n- I found the use of Read and Write ops confusing, as similar terminology is widely used in memory-based networks (e.g. [1]). I would have preferred something that makes it clearer that updates are constrained in some way as \"writing\" implies that the location is constrained, rather than the update minimizing a loss.\n\nQuestions:\n- How is the weight list of task similarities \\beta learned when the tasks don't share the same output space? How useful is the \\beta?\n- Could you elaborate on what is the difference between pair-wise gradient passing (PGP) and list-wise gradient passing (LGP)\n\n[1] Graves, A., Wayne, G., & Danihelka, I.
