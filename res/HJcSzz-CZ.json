One consists in self-labeling the unlabeled data and then updating the prototypes on the basis of the \nassigned pseudo-labels. Another is able to deal with the case of distractors i.e.  unlabeled samples not beloning to\nany of the known categories. In practice this second solution is analogous to the first, but a general 'distractor' class\nis added. Finally the third technique learns to weight the samples according to their distance to the original prototypes.\n\nThese strategies are evaluated in a particular semi-supervised transfer learning setting:  the models are first trained \non some source categories with few labeled data and large unlabeled samples (this setting is derived by subselecting\nmultiple times a large dataset), then they are used on a final target task with again few labeled data and large \nunlabeled samples but beloning to a different set of categories.\n\n+ the paper is well written, well organized and overall easy to read\n+/-  this work builds largely on previous work. It introduces only some small technical novelty inspired by soft-k-means\nclustering that anyway seems to be effective.\n+ different aspect of the problem are analyzed by varying the number of disctractors and varying the level of\nsemantic relatedness between the source and the target sets\n\nFew notes and questions\n1) why for the omniglot experiment the table reports the error results? It would be better to present accuracy as for the other tables/experiments\n2) I would suggest to use source and target instead of train and test -- these two last terms are confusing because\nactually there is a training phase also at test time.\n3) although the paper indicate that there are different other few-shot methods that could be applicable here, \nno other approach is considered besides the prothotipical network and its variants. An further external reference \ncould be used to give an idea of what would be the experimental result at least in the supervised case.\n\n\n\n\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Meta-Learning for Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Classification", "abstract": "In few-shot classification, we are interested in learning algorithms that train a classifier from only a handful of labeled examples.

Based on our preliminary reading, [1] is a journal version that builds on top of [2], with both papers presenting very similar approaches for the application of event recognition in videos. Transductive Multi-View Zero-Shot Learning [3] uses a similar label propagation procedure as ours. However, while [3] uses standalone deep feature extractors, we show that our semi-supervised prototypical network can be trained completely end-to-end. One of the non-trivial results of our paper is that we show that end-to-end meta-learning significantly improves the performance (see Semi-supervised Inference vs. Soft K-means). We would like to emphasize that end-to-end semi-supervised learning in a meta-learning framework is, to the best of our knowledge, a novel contribution.\n\n\u201c...other na\u00efve baselines should also be compared...\u201d\nThe recent literature on few-shot learning has established that meta-learning-based approaches outperform kNN and standard neural network based approaches. For the Omniglot dataset, Mann et al. [4] has previously studied baselines such as KNN either in pixel space or deep features, and feedforward NNs. They found these baselines all lag behind their method by quite a lot, and meanwhile Prototypical Networks outperform Mann et al. by another significant margin. For example, Table 1 summarizes the performance for 5-shot, 5-way classification. Therefore, we will provide supervised nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and neural network baselines for completeness; however, we believe that our work is built on top of state-of-the-art methods, and should beat these simple baselines.\n\nTable 1 - Omniglot dataset baselines\nMethod             Accuracy\nKNN pixel          48%\nKNN deep         69%\nMann et al.

While in 5-shot the improvement is less, this is reasonable since the number of labeled items is larger and the benefit brought by unlabeled items is considerably smaller than in 1-shot settings. We disagree with the comment that our model is not robust under different datasets, since the best settings we found is consistent across all three, quite diverse, datasets, including the novel and much larger tieredImageNet.\n\nReferences:\n[1] \u201cVideo2vec embeddings recognize events when examples are scarce,\u201d IEEE TPAMI 2014\n[2] \u201cVideostory: A new multimedia embedding for few-example recognition and translation of events,\u201d in ACM MM, 2014.\n[3]: Transductive Multi-View Zero-Shot Learning, IEEE TPAMI 2015.\n[4]: One-shot learning with Memory-Augmented Neural Networks.

We\u2019d like to clarify our setup here: The problem as we have defined it is to correctly perform the given N-way classification in each episode (similarly as in the previous work). Distractors are introduced to make the problem harder in a more realistic way, but the goal is not to be able to classify them. Specifically, our model needs to understand which points are irrelevant for the given classification task (\u201cdistractors\u201d) in order to not take them into account, but actually classifying these distractors into separate categories is not required in order to perform the given classification task, so our models make no effort to do this.\n\nFurther, we would like to emphasize that adding distractor examples in few-shot classification settings is a novel and more realistic learning environment compared to previous approaches in supervised few-shot learning and as well as concurrent approaches in semi-supervised few-shot learning [1,2]. It is non-trivial to show that various versions of semi-supervised clustering can be trained end-to-end from scratch as another layer on top of prototypical networks, with the presence of distractor clusters  (note that each distractor class has the same number of images as a non-distractor class). \n\nReferences:\n[1]: Few-Shot Learning with Graph Neural Networks.

This is impactful as follow-up work can use our dataset as a public benchmark. In fact, there are several concurrent ICLR submissions and arxiv pre-prints [1,2] that also introduce semi-supervised few-shot learning. However compared to these concurrent papers, our benchmark extends beyond this work into more realistic and generic settings, with hierarchical class splits and unlabeled distractor classes, which we believe will make positive contributions to the community.\n\nThe fact that our semi-supervised prototypical network can be trained end-to-end from scratch is non-trivial, especially under many distractor clusters (note that each distractor class has the same number of images as a non-distractor class). We argue that our extension is simple yet effective, serving as another layer on top of the regular prototypical network layer, and provides consistent improvement in the presence of unlabeled examples. Further, to our knowledge, our best-performing method, the masked soft k-means, is novel.\n\n\u201cIt would be better to present accuracy\u2026\u201d\nThank you for the suggestion. We will revise it in our next version.\n\n\u201cno other approach is considered besides the prototypical network and its variants.\u201d\nProtoNets is one of the top performing methods for few-shot learning and our proposed extensions each naturally forms another layer on top of the Prototypical layer. To address the concern, we are currently running other variants of the models such as a nearest neighbor baseline, and will report results before the ICLR discussion period ends. In the Omniglot dataset literature, many simple baselines has been extensively explored, and Prototypical Networks are so far the state-of-the-art.

Our experiments confirm that our Prototypical Networks can learn to improve their predictions due to unlabeled examples, much like a semi-supervised algorithm would.", "pdf": "/pdf/0bbc5bd4bf231b441ce95aa2842d6dbfe472b562.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose novel extensions of Prototypical Networks that are augmented with the ability to use unlabeled examples when producing prototypes.", "paperhash": "ren|metalearning_for_semisupervised_fewshot_classification", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nren2018metalearning,\ntitle={Meta-Learning for Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Classification},\nauthor={Mengye Ren and Sachin Ravi and Eleni Triantafillou and Jake Snell and Kevin Swersky and Josh B.
