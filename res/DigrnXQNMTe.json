We have totally remove the part of KSD as we find our proof of theorem 7. in the original version is not correct. In this revision, we mainly focus on polynomial GPK and bring some new results.  From your comment, we noticed that in our first submission, we use K to represents kernel between distributions, kernel between values, and gram matrix. This is confusing, and in this revision we use different terms to denote them. \n\nIn response to your comments. \n1. \"in Definition 1, you defined a kernel, on distributions p and q, that is a k x k matrix; while in definition 2, the notion of K, are on samples and is a scalar output.\"  we define our probability kernel based on a gram matrix, and this gram matrix is produced by a continuous reproducing kernel function as in MMD cases.\n\n\n2. \"it is unclear of how \\phi is defined in general; only examples are given later for specific cases so that we got an conjuncture\", yes in GPK framework, any element-wise mapping function is valid a function, see Definition 2 in this revision. Our idea is firstly define a framework with little constrains which could generalize a lot of cases. And we then narrow down to specific subsets equipped with some interesting properties. see section 4 of this revision for some examples\n\n\n3. \"why is MMD_E^2 an unbiased estimator?\" We find out the plugin-estimator we proposed for GPK framework actually generalize the case of linear time statistics of MMD($MMD_l^2$), and the details of the derivation are in section 6.1 and theorem 2. Also there is a equivalent between the convergence bound of $MMD_l^2$ and our plugin-estimator, see remark3.1 \n\n\n4.  \"we need to know p and q to define k_{prob}; how is this going to be applied to two-sample test?\" We use plugin-estimators to estimate the GPK[p,q], and once it is a unbiased estimator, no matter what kind of p and q we have, given enough samples, we can always get accuracy estimate of GPK[p,q].(thus we don't need to know p and q beforehand). Furthermore, if GPK[p,q]=0 if and only if p=q, the convergence bound of the estimators could be used to provide acceptance region of null hypothesis p=q, see Corollary 3.3.\n\n "}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3560/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3560/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A generalized probability kernel on discrete distributions and its application in two-sample test", "authorids": ["~Le_Niu1"], "authors": ["Le Niu"], "keywords": ["maximum mean discrepancy", "RKHS", "two-sample test", "empirical estimator", "discrete distributions"], "abstract": "We propose a generalized probability kernel(GPK) on discrete distributions with finite support.

We agree our first version is full of typos, and we are sorry for this. In this revision, we have updated the notation section, which provides more precise definitions, and we also checked the typos. \nSince you mentioned citep and citet, we assume ICLR recommend to always use citep instead of citet, is that correct? \nOn the theoretical side, yes in the case of categorical distribution, values of discrete variables does not relate to any notion of distance. However, many natural processes will produce discrete distributions where there\npossibly exists a similarity measure in values which imply the similarity in frequencies of occurrence(\nprobability values). A good example is the word2vec techniques in NLP tasks. Although the words in a vocabulary is apparently a case of categorical distribution, given enough training data, similarity measure\nbetween words could be made which implies their similarity in probability values. This is also exactly the case of MMD in discrete setting. And our works is a direct extension of MMD. We introduced this discussion in section 4.2\n\nFor your comment related to $l=k$ cases of polynomial GPK, we summarize this result as power-MMD(see section 6).

The paper applies the new discrepancy to perform two-sample tests. \nThe new kernel proposed, unlike the previous RKHS kernels that only depend on data-points, incorporate the notion of probability. e.g. kernel K_{p,q} depends on density p and q. also a symmetric version on discrete KSD is discussed.\nDespite the idea is interesting, there are several flaws which can be reviewed.\n\nFirstly, I think the paper is not clearly presented, with some confusing notation.\n--in Definition 1, you defined a kernel, on distributions p and q, that is a k x k matrix; while in definition 2, the notion of K, are on samples and is a scalar output.\nit is unclear of how \\phi is defined in general; only examples are given later for specific cases so that we got an conjuncture.\n--in Definition 5, why is it different from stein operator of KDSD? or it is supposed to say difference operator?\n\nIn addition I have several confusions:\n1. why is MMD_E^2 an unbiased estimator? what happened to k(x_i, x_i)? it is not clear from the Bernstein polynomial introduced in appendix. \n2. in abstract, it claims that the kernels are between distributions instead of samples, but in the main text it is still evaluation at p_i=p(x_i) on samples; I m confused of the difference and novelty claimed.\n3. The above concern brings up the question while applying on two sample test. \n--When the MMD is used to perform two-sample test, it is assumed that both p and q are unknown. however, to my understanding, we need to know p and q to define k_{prob}; how is this going to be applied to two-sample test? \n--for KSD setting, when the symmetric KDSD is introduced, it also seems to require p and q to known for two-sample testing. In the Liu2016 setting, where goodness-of-fit test is proposed with KSD, q is known (up to normalization) while p is unknown with samples; that is a key point why KSD is useful for goodness-of-fit test.\nIn addition, is there any argument on why the symmetric-KDSD might be better than KDSD Yang et.al 2018?\n\nAn additional point is regarding literature review, which is yet throughout  to check; e.g. as\nChwialkowski, et. al  \"A kernel test of goodness of fit.\" proposed independently as Liu et.al for KSD goodness-of-fit test, that might be useful to cite.\n\nIn my point of view, ICLR may not be a venue of fit either.

However, the submission seems to be an incomplete one.\n\nMajor comments:\n1. Definition 2 seems to be the key definition in the work. However, there are multiple issues:\n       a. It is not clear why it is called a kernel? Should not it be called distance? After all, it generalizes MMD-squared!\n       b. \"$K$\" seems to be mixed up with \"$k$\". \"$K$\" seems to be the gram matrix and not the kernel.\n       c. $k(y_i, y_j)$ is from $Y \\times Y\\rightarrow R$, and not from $R^n \\times R^n \\rightarrow R$.\n       d. why should \"\\phi\" belong to RKHS of k? Recall that RKHS of k will contain functions from R^n\\rightarrow R.\n2. I agree with the write-up which states  that results in section 4.2 are trivial.\n3. section 4.3.1 are known results and need to be skipped.\n4. Proof of theorem 5 seems to be completely missing. How is sup over f removed?\n5. In Definition 6, what is $f$? Is a sup over f missing? Because of this and the previous issue, section 5.1 seems very incomplete.\n6. Simulation section seems to be completely missing.\n7.
