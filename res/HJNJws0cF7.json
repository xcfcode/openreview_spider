Did you perform some sort of stability analysis on networks as a function of non linear activations inside of it ?\"\n\nThe time-step size should be small enough to ensure the stability but the time-step size in image classification is unknown. However, to stay in the stability region of a method means that the computed solution remains bounded after many steps of computation. In other words, the stability condition results in a precise approximation. Consequently, if the prediction accuracy of the network model is high enough, then the adopted RK methods and the number of time-steps meet the stability condition.\n\n-->\"Also RK methods a pretty expensive compared to most standard Suzuki-Trotter, can you remark a bit on the computational aspects of you experiments ?\"\n\nThere is a high computational cost in computing derivative at each stage in a time-step. However, the total computational cost is the multiplication of the cost in each time-step and the number of time-steps. According to the experimental results in our paper, RKNets adopting only one time-step can obtain the competitive FLOPs efficiency.\n\n-->\"I think that a big chunk of 3.1 can be either taken out to the appendix or just give a reference to a standard text book and elaborate on training time/resources etc .\"\n\nWe have added more discussions to paper, especially on the reason why the computational cost of IRKNet is reduced remarkably compared to the common implementation of IRK methods.\n\n-->\"As a generic question I wonder how does this approach handle things which are weak perception or non perception methods, did you try this on any NLP problems or generic tabular data ?\"\n\nWe have not tried RKNet on other problems yet. Nevertheless, RKNet should be able to handle other dynamical system identification problems.
