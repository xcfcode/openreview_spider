This is a relevant topic, and some of the ideas on putting this together are original and welcome. \n\nHowever, the paper is quite hard to follow, because some paragraphs are not clear. For instance, the first two paragraphs of Section 1 are very nice, but then the next paragraphs try to explain the main ideas with success. What is really the semantics behind these concepts? What is the intended effect of building new concepts out of arithmetic operations? There are some bold statements concerning how to transfer knowledge, but they do not seem justified. \n\nAlso, I find Figure 1 and related explanations to be quite poor. I could not really understand the main point of the attention mechanism, and could not find a clear definition of it (not a discussion of its intended purpose). \n\nNote that \"events\" as discussed in this paper are often called \"histories\" in the MDP literature. It would be nice to be clear about the temporal aspects from the beginning. And then it is not clear that Expression (2) produces the right thing; is this an expression that yields an inference x? Or it is supposed to produce estimates of x (estimates do not seem to make sense here)? Also, it is not clear that p(x|a,w) is the \"probability that x is in concept w\"... what would be this probability? \n\nFinally, the paper seems really preliminary in that there is no real test, no real example, and no real empirical validation here. Some additional focus on applications and on empirical testing seems necessary.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Concept Learning with Energy-Based Models", "abstract": "We believe that many hallmarks of human intelligence, such as generalizing from limited experience, abstract reasoning and planning, analogical reasoning, creative problem solving, and capacity for language require the ability to consolidate experience into concepts, which act as basic building blocks of understanding and reasoning.\nWe present a framework that defines a concept by an energy function over events in the environment, as well as an attention mask over entities participating in the event.

The approach is based around zero-energy models and execution-time optimization of these models attention (concept recognition/identification) and generation. The aim is to learn models of concepts which are transferable between domains as opposed to the traditional generative models and reinforcement learning approaches which are very domain specific.\n\nThe ideas and the method presented are interesting and appear to be consistent and well founded in the literature. The presented work is to the best of my knowledge novel. The problem under investigation is highly relevant and very important. The paper is further clearly written and of high quality.\n\nThe lack of inclusion of alleged experiments diminish the impact and reduces the possible comprehension of the strengths/drawbacks of the presented approach. Space constraints are blamed but there is at least almost a full page in the appendix that could be fully utilized for providing additional details and/or analysis/discussion of strengths/drawbacks.\n\nI am not very familiar with much of the cited related work so it is hard for me to assess the significants of the contributions in this paper. I do however find the work interesting and would like to see a discussion between the author and others more familiar with the background material.\n\nThe solution appears elegant even though I have some trouble comprehending all the details and motivations. I am however skeptical (without any empirical evaluation) how feasible (and scalable) the approach is for online-usage, including the learning of all(?) parameters, (which is one of the mentioned motivations in the introduction).\n\nMinor language errors exist throughout the paper.
