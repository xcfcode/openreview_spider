The central idea is to frame learning in terms of a new kind of Q-value that attempts to smooth out Q-values by framing them in terms of expectations over Gaussian policies.\n\nTo be honest, I didn't really \"get\" this paper.\n* As far I understand, all of the original work policy gradients involved stochastic policies.  Many are/were Gaussian.\n* All Q-value estimators are designed to marginalize out the randomness in these stochastic policies.\n* As far as I can tell, this is equivalent to a slightly different formulation, where the agent emits a deterministic action (\\mu,\\Sigma) and the environment samples an action from that distribution.  In other words, it seems that if we just draw the box a bit differently, the environment soaks up the nondeterminism, instead of needing to define a new type of Q-value.\n\nUltimately, I couldn't discern /why/ this was a significant advance for RL, or even a meaningful new perspective on classic ideas.\n\nI thought the little 2-mode MOG was a nice example of the premise of the model.\n\nWhile I may or may not have understood the core technical contribution, I think the experiments can be critiqued: they didn't really seem to work out.  Figures 2&3 are unconvincing - the differences do not appear to be statistically significant.  Also, I was disappointed to see that the authors only compared to DDPG; they could have at least compared to TRPO, which they mention.  They dismiss it by saying that it takes 10 times as long, but gets a better answer - to which I respond, \"Very well, run your algorithm 10x longer and see where you end up!\"  I think we need to see a more compelling demonstration of why this is a useful idea before it's ready to be published.\n\nThe idea of penalizing a policy based on KL-divergence from a reference policy was explored at length by Bert Kappen's work on KL-MDPs.

Many are/were Gaussian.\u201d\n\nIndeed, most of the original work on policy gradients uses stochastic policies. In such a setting, Q-value or value functions are used for variance reduction when estimating the policy gradient; that is, the policy is trained using a form similar to Eq. (4) in the paper.\n\nHowever, more recently, several algorithms have been proposed (e.g., DDPG, SVG), which use Q-values in a different way. They use the gradient of a Q-function approximator to train the policy. This results in a large improvement in sample efficiency over traditional policy gradient methods.  The most widely used of these algorithms, DDPG, is restricted to deterministic policies. Our work extends DDPG to general Gaussian policies, showing that 1) we can directly learn the smoothed Q-values to avoid estimating an additional Monte Carlo sampling step necessary for SVG, 2) the gradient and the Hessian of the smoothed Q-values can be used to update the mean and the covariance parameters of a Gaussian policy. Notably, although SVG uses a stochastic policy, it uses a fixed covariance.\n\nR3: \u201cAll Q-value estimators are designed to marginalize out the randomness in these stochastic policies.\u201d\n\nThe smoothed Q-values that we introduce additionally marginalize out the randomness in the first action (a) of a typical Q(s, a) value based on the mean and covariance of the first action. As a result, we avoid an additional Monte Carlo sampling step to draw the first action, as compared to SVG for example.\n\nR3: \u201cAs far as I can tell, this is equivalent to a slightly different formulation, where the agent emits a deterministic action (\\mu,\\Sigma) and the environment samples an action from that distribution. In other words, it seems that if we just draw the box a bit differently, the environment soaks up the nondeterminism, instead of needing to define a new type of Q-value.\u201d\n\nAlthough one could pursue such an approach, it is not equivalent to the direction we pursue in the paper.  Under the above suggestion, where the agent emits an action (\\mu, \\Sigma), the corresponding Q-value function would be a function of both \\mu and \\Sigma. On the other hand, the smoothed Q-value function we consider only takes in \\mu. A key contribution of the paper is showing that even though \\tilde{Q} is not a direct function of \\Sigma, one can still derive an update for \\Sigma based on the Hessian of \\tilde{Q} with respect to mean action.\n\nR3: \u201cI thought the little 2-mode MOG was a nice example of the premise of the model.\u201d\n\nThank you.  We hope our responses contribute to a better understanding of the premise of the approach. We expect that this fundamental smoothing behavior is the source of the improvement over DDPG.\n\nR3: \u201cWhile I may or may not have understood the core technical contribution, I think the experiments can be critiqued: they didn't really seem to work out. Figures 2&3 are unconvincing - the differences do not appear to be statistically significant.\u201d\n\nTo demonstrate the significance of our experimental results more clearly, we have updated Figure 2 to compare the performance of Smoothie with KL-penalty, DDPG, and TRPO on continuous control benchmarks. Figure 2 makes it clear that our results are statistically significant and Smoothie achieves the state-of-the-art by converging faster and/or achieving better final rewards. On the challenging Hopper and Humanoid tasks, Smoothie achieves double the average reward compared to DDPG without sacrificing sample efficiency. Our previous presentation of the results in two separate figures showing the difference between Smoothie without KL penalty and DDPG, and between Smoothie with and without the KL penalty made the significance of our results less clear.\n\nR3: \u201cI was disappointed to see that the authors only compared to DDPG; they could have at least compared to TRPO, which they mention.  They dismiss it by saying that it takes 10 times as long, but gets a better answer - to which I respond, \"Very well, run your algorithm 10x longer and see where you end up!\"\n\nSample-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) is a key challenge for real world applications of RL, and in this paper we focus on the behavior of the algorithms in the practical data regime. That said, we have included a comparison with TRPO in Figure 2, which shows that in this data regime, TRPO is not competitive. Similar conclusions have been made about TRPO by other papers (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347).\n\nR3: \u201cThe idea of penalizing a policy based on KL-divergence from a reference policy was explored at length by Bert Kappen's work on KL-MDPs.  Perhaps you should cite that?\u201d\n\nReference added.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Gaussian Policies from Smoothed Action Value Functions", "abstract": "State-action value functions (i.e., Q-values) are ubiquitous in reinforcement learning (RL), giving rise to popular algorithms such as SARSA and Q-learning.
