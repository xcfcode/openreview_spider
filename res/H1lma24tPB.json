There has also been a line of work on indirect encoding of neural works (i.e. HyperNEAT work of Stanley, and more recent Hypernetworks proposed by Ha et al) which showed promising results of training very large networks (in the case of Stanley), or have network weights that can adapt to the training data (in the case of Hypernetworks), and these approaches have been shown to be useful in applications such as meta-learning or few-shot learning (i.e. [1]). However, as far as I know, there hasn't been any work that looks at a principled way of initializing the weights of a weight-generating network, which this work tries to explore.\n\nMaking the observation (and claim) that traditional init methods don't init hypernetworks properly, they propose a few techniques to initialize hypernetworks (\"Hyperfan\"-family), which are justified in a similar way as original classical init techniques (i.e. preserving variance like in Xavier init), and they demonstrate that their method works well for feed forward networks on MNIST, CIFAR-10 tasks compared to traditional classical init methods, as well for a continual learning task.\n\nI liked the paper as they identified a problem that hasn't been studied, and proposed a reasonable method to solve it. Their method may be able to make Hypernetworks accessible to many more researchers and practitioners, the way classifical init techniques have made neural net training more accessible.\n\nThere are a few things that could improve the paper (and get an improvement score from me). The authors don't have to do all of these, but just a few suggestions:\n\n1) The experiments, to my understanding, are all feed forward networks. How about RNNs or LSTMs?\n\n2) Are there any (interesting) tasks that use Hypernetworks that are not trainable with existing methods, but made trainable using this proposed scheme?\n\n3) Would this method also work with HyperNEAT [2] or Compressed Network Search [3]? (probably should cite that line of work too). In [3], a research group at IDSIA used DCT compression to compress millions of weights into a few dozen parameters, so would be interesting if the approach will work on similar \"learn-from-pixels\" RL experiments.\n\nI'm assigning a score of 6 (it's currently like a \"really good\" workshop paper, but a normal conf paper IMO), but I like this paper and would like to see the authors make an attempt to improve it, so I can improve the score to see it get accepted with a higher certainty.\n\nGood luck!\n\n[1] i.e. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6519722/ https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.03641.pdf https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03400.pdf\n\n[2] http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/hyperNEATpage/\n\n[3] http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/compressednetworksearch.html\n\n*** Revised Score ***\n\nNov20: Upon reading the other reviews, and looking at the changes to the paper with the extra citations, I'm improving the score to 8.

Wouldn`t it be the case for hypernetwork as well: to just add BN layers between main net layers?\n \n - Figure 2. What are is the y axis of the figure? Norm? Variance? Mean? The same question for the most of Figures in appendix \n \n- It would be nice to see how proposed method stands vs mentioned heuristics like M3 and M4. \n \nOverall I like the paper. \n\nMinor comments:\n\n \n > \"This fundamental difference suggests that conventional knowledge about neural networks may not\napply directly to hypernetworks and radically new ways of thinking about weight initialization,\noptimization dynamics and architecture design for hypernetworks are sorely needed.\"\n\nI don`t see anything \"radically new\" in re-derivation of Xavier formula to the new type of network.\n\n\n======\nRevision:\n\nRevised version addressed my concerns and the batchnorm-related experiment is indeed surprising.\nOverall, I like the paper and increase evaluation to strong accept. \n\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper221/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper221/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "Hypernetworks are meta neural networks that generate weights for a main neural network in an end-to-end differentiable manner.

We believe this is an important open problem that deserves attention and we leave it for future work.\n\n2) Hypernetworks are a natural choice for enabling Bayesian neural networks, because they can be used to simulate an expressive prior distribution. This is useful for improving model calibration, providing uncertainty estimation, and doing approximate Bayesian inference or regularization. [1] demonstrated a method to build a Bayesian network using a hypernet, but they mentioned having to use a heuristic method to initialize the weights of their hypernetwork in order to prevent losses from diverging. \n\n[1]\u2019s implementation was unfortunately not publicly available so we could not try our approach on their exact settings. We introduced a similar experiment in Section 5.4 that differed with [1]\u2019s in terms of residual connections in the mainnet.  While all initializations led to trainable networks in this case, our proposed initialization gave superior performance compared to the default initialization in PyTorch. We are confident that an extension of our approach to hypernetworks with residual mainnets should be able to resolve [1]\u2019s initializations issues. This work is an important stepping stone towards this direction.\n\n3) Non-hypernetwork methods like HyperNEAT or Compressed Network Search that generate the weights of some target network would probably also do well to consider if their generated weights might result in exploding activations. Because most of this line of work was done before the advent of deep learning, the networks considered were most likely not deep enough to have caused an issue. We hope that our paper will drive new progress in this line of research as well.

That said, because the normalization happens over the batch dimension, it does not always manage to salvage a bad initialization. For example, [1] remarked that they had to resort to a heuristic method of scaling the hypernetwork weights in order to prevent their loss from diverging, even though their mainnet is already batch normalized.  We added a new experiment in Section 5.4 which uses a batch normalized mainnet, and showed that batch normalization might help correct bad inits with vanishing activations, but not exploding activations. This is a surprising finding. To the best of our knowledge, the interactions between batch normalization and initialization are not well-understood, even in the classical case, and our findings prompt an interesting direction for future research. \n\n- The fan-in version of Kaiming init, which we show causes exploding activations in Section 3, is the default initialization in many deep learning libraries like PyTorch and Chainer. We showed that our proposed initialization scheme resulted in substantially lower losses and faster training, despite the presence of batch normalization.\n\n- In Figure 2, the y axis shows the mean activation value of the hypernet\u2019s output layer (i.e. the mainnet weights), with the bars denoting one standard deviation away from the mean. We added axis labels to all the figures in the paper, and added additional descriptions in the appendix. Thanks for pointing this out.\n\n- The mentioned heuristics were tuned by trial and error for specific architectures and will not work in general. We mention them as examples of ad-hoc ways people initialize hypernets in practice. The principled initialization formulae proposed in this work provide sensible defaults, and thus obviates the need to resort to trial-and-error, saving developers both time and compute.\n\n- We removed the word \u201cradically\u201d.\n\n[1] Hypernetwork-based Implicit Posterior Estimation and Model Averaging of Convolutional Neural Networks.

This new experiment shows interesting findings about the interaction between batch normalization and initialization, which is not well-understood even in the classical case, to the best of our knowledge. Contrary to popular belief, batch normalization is not always sufficient to correct a bad init. In our experiment, we observed that the fan-in version of Kaiming init, the default initialization in many deep learning libraries like PyTorch and Chainer, performs significantly worse than the proposed initialization.\n\nWe also found that in the case of vanishing activations, batch normalization was able to mitigate the problem. It is not clear why this happens, even in the classical case that does not involve hypernetworks, but our experimental findings prompt an interesting direction for future research. This direction of research is even more important for hypernetworks as the large batch sizes required by batch normalization might be prohibitive for applications in Bayesian neural networks (see Section 5.4 for details).\n\nIn Figure 2, the y axis shows the mean activation value of the hypernet\u2019s output layer (i.e. the mainnet weights), with the bars denoting one standard deviation away from the mean.

Standard initialization schemes for deep networks (Glorot, He, Fixup) are based on variance analyses that aim to keep the scale of activations/gradients well-behaved through forward-backward propagation, but using this approach is ill-founded for hypernets where the output is a set of weights rather than e.g. a softmax\u2019d classification output. This paper extends the standard variance analysis to consider the hypernet case by investigating what the choice of hypernet initialization should be if one still wishes to maintain the well-behaved activations/gradients in the main model. The authors present results showing the evolution of hypernet outputs with their scheme are better-behaved, demonstrate that their modification leads to improved stability for hypernet-based convnets on CIFAR  (over a model which, for the standard choice of He init, basically does not train) and improved performance on a continual learning task.\n\nMy take:\n\nThis is an \"aha!\" or an \u201cobvious in retrospect\u201d paper: a simple idea based on noticing something being done wrong in practice with a fairly straightforward fix, coupled with a decent empirical evaluation and analysis. The paper is well-written and reasonably easy to follow (although I am not familiar with Ricci calculus I did not feel that I was flummoxed at any point during the maths), and the potential impact is decent: any future work which employs a hypernetwork would likely do well to consider the methods in this paper. While I would like to see the empirical evaluations taken a bit further, I think this paper is a solid accept (7/10) and would make a good addition to ICLR2020.\n\nNotes:\n\nWhile this is a good paper, I think the impact of the paper could be magnified if the authors were a bit more ambitious with their empirical evaluations. This method seems to enable training hypernets in settings which would previously have been unstable; it would be good to more thoroughly characterize robustness to hyperparameters or otherwise demonstrate additional practical value. Showing results on ImageNet would also be helpful (I\u2019m well aware this is not always in the realm of compute possibility) or just showing progress on a more challenging task outside of CIFAR or a small continual learning problem would, I think, greatly increase the chances that this paper catches on. As this is a \u201cunleash your potential\u201d note, I have not taken this sentiment into account in my review (as should hopefully be evident from my accept score).\n\nMinor:\n\n-Caption for figure 2 should indicate what kind of magnitudes are represented\u2014are these the average weight norms in each layer vs epochs? The axes should be labeled.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper221/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper221/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "Hypernetworks are meta neural networks that generate weights for a main neural network in an end-to-end differentiable manner.
