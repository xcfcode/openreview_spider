Interestingly, the model infers time-dependant\u00a0user/item vectors by applying an RNN to previous histories. Those vectors are used to predict ratings, in a similar fashion to standard matrix factorization methods, and also bias a conditional RNN language model for reviews. The paper is well written and the architectural choices make sense. The main shortcomings of the paper are in the experiments:\n\n1) The full model (rating+text) is only applied to one and relatively small dataset. Applying the model on multiple datasets with more data, e.g. Amazon reviews dataset (https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html) would be more convincing.\n\n2) While modelling order in review text seems like the right choice, previous papers (e.g. Almahairi et al. 2015) have shown that for rating prediction, modelling order in reviews might not be useful. A comparison with a similar model, but with bag-of-words reviews model would be nice in order to show the importance of the RNN-based review model, especially given previous literature.\n\nFinally, this paper is an application paper applying well-established deep learning techniques, and I do not feel the paper offers new insights which the ICLR community in general would benefit from.

All these papers are highly valuable and interesting, but we would like to explain some major distinctions. [3, 5] consider session-based modeling in cases where user responses are scarce and short lived. In our work, we consider a more challenging setting to model both short-term and long-term dynamics, and we jointly model the evolution of both user states and item states, as well as personalized reviews. \n\nVery recent work [4], which is developed independently of this paper almost at the same time, also models the coevolution of states. One important distinction between [4] and this paper is that [4] assumes more specific function forms (Hawkes processes with exponential triggering kernel), while in this paper we use more flexible non-parametric approaches. We will add comparisons to [4] in the future. \n\nWe agree that online metrics such as CTR, user membership retention, top-k performance or profits are more desirable, but these data are not publicly available. In addition, these metrics are not universal in the sense that their importance are different for different applications. What RMSE offers is a standard intrinsic evaluation that directly measures the accuracy of predictions. Also, it is widely used in the academic literature, and as a result, it allows more comprehensive comparisons.  In particular, we have seen in the past that even improvements by 1% in RMSE can be significant (in 2008 SVD++ reported a 1.09% improvement over SVD, and in 2010 Time-SVD++ was published with a 1.26% improvement over SVD++); as such, we believe that our 2% improvement in RMSE is a valuable contribution."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Joint Training of Ratings and Reviews with Recurrent Recommender Networks", "abstract": "Accurate modeling of ratings and text reviews is at the core of successful recommender systems.

Existing papers have captured these aspects previously, but what's novel here is the particular combination of parts and choice of techniques. In particular, the use of LSTMs as opposed to \"bag-of-words\" models that have previously been used when combining the same components.\n\nA criticism is made of existing models that use bag-of-words features as being too \"coarse\" to capture the real dynamics of reviews. This seems a valid criticsm, though it's not clear exactly what features those existing models miss. Something missing from this paper is any interpretation of what the model \"learns\" that may explain its better performance.\n\nI also don't know about the significance of predicting \"future\" ratings as opposed to random splitting of the data. Lots of work on temporal recommender systems uses a variety of hold-out strategies besides random sampling, e.g. holding out the final ratings. Is there a methodological contribution associated with this change?\n\nThe experiments evaluate the extent to which the model achieves good performance due to its ability to capture evolving temporal patterns at the level of items, and the ability of the model to capture additional dynamics from text. Text makes a small but significant contribution; I was surprised by how large an improvement is achieved given how little text was included.\n\nOverall this is a reasonably strong experimental comparison, though could be improved in two dimensions:\n(a) There's no comparison to models that use ratings + text (e.g. CoBaFi, JMARS, etc.). These methods have reported substantial improvements over rating-only models in the past, perhaps even larger improvements than what is reported here. Such an experiment is important given the claim that existing models (in particular bag-of-words models) are too coarse to capture the dynamics of text.\n(b) The restriction to movie datasets is okay, but these datasets are somewhat outliers when it comes to recommendation. In particular, they're extremely dense datasets that support very parameter-rich models. I'd question whether the results would hold on sparser data (though in fact I'd suspect they would hold, since on a sparser dataset the contribution due to using reviews ought to be larger).\n\nOtherwise the experiments are fine. Perplexity results are nice but essentially what we'd expect. It is a shame that unlike other papers that use text to inform recommender systems there's no high-level analysis here of what the model has uncovered.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Joint Training of Ratings and Reviews with Recurrent Recommender Networks", "abstract": "Accurate modeling of ratings and text reviews is at the core of successful recommender systems.

Its biggest flaw is that it only addresses rating prediction and completely forgets about the recommendations themselves. It is well known in the recommender systems research community that rating prediction accuracy doesn't really matter, because it isn't well correlated with recommendation accuracy: algorithms with low RMSE may fall behind in the top-k recommendation task. See [1] for an extensive study on the topic (other papers with both RMSE and accuracy measurements, such as [2], show similar results). Therefore it is crucial that modern recommendation algorithms are evaluated wrt. accuracy (e.g. Precision@K, Recall@K, AUC@K, etc.) or ranking metrics (NDCG@K, MRR@K, MAP@K, etc.).\n\nOther than that, Table2 shows that there is only 2% improvement over PMF, but with a much more complex model. Even if this were in recommendation accuracy (as opposed to RMSE), it raises the question whether using a much more complex model for 2% improvement worths it, considering e.g. training and serving times. In any other field, the answer would be yes. However, with recommender systems it is well known that offline evaluation is a necessary approximation step in the evaluation and improvements there doesn't translate into improvements in online metrics (e.g. CTR, GMV, profit, etc.) directly. There is correlation, but small offline improvements generally don't boost online performance.\n\nThe paper also misses some notable work on using RNNs for recommendations, e.g. [3], [4], [5].\n\n\nReferences:\n[1] P.

We will make sure to add them to our related work, but we want to clarify the significant differences between our contributions and their models.\n\nIn particular, we differ from all of the listed works by modeling temporal dynamics and by modeling personalized reviews. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that jointly models temporal dynamics of both users and items, ratings, and personalized reviews. [1,2,4,5,6] model item-specific content features, sometimes resulting in an RNN model but ignoring personalized reviews ([3] only uses ratings information). Rather, modeling personalized reviews presents unique challenges in integrating user and item knowledge, which we explore in this paper.\n\nOur primary goal in modeling all of these features is to improve the accuracy of ratings predictions. Because of this, when comparing with traditional approaches that do not consider temporal effects, we compare with baselines that have the strongest rating prediction performance on the Netflix and Movielens datasets. [1,2,4,5,6] did not present any such results. [3] shows overall comparable results to I-AutoRec (on MovieLens 1M: U-CF-NADE-S: 0.845, I-CF-NADE-S: 0.829, and I-AutoRec: 0.831; on Netflix [3] outperforms AutoRec.)  We therefore think that I-AutoRec already provides a strong neural network baseline.\n\nWe appreciate your valuable comments and will add these discussions into our next revision to clarify the difference between this paper and previous works."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Joint Training of Ratings and Reviews with Recurrent Recommender Networks", "abstract": "Accurate modeling of ratings and text reviews is at the core of successful recommender systems.
