", "comment": "Thank you very much for comments and suggestions.  We made revisions to reflect the suggestions made and to resolve the concerns raised.  We would also like to provide responses to the comments below: \n\n\"A major issue is, however, that it is unclear from the results whether the gains are due to the novel quantization system, or due to the novel loss. From Fig. 7 it looks like the loss BPP + \\lambda (1-MS-SSIM) (assuming the formula in (6)) is correct, and the legend in Fig. 7 incorrect) that is used in most other works performs essentially on par with  Rippel & Bourdev 2017, Nakanishi et al. 2018. For example at 1 bpp, this loss yields an MS-SSIM of 0.992 which is essentially the same as Rippel & Bourdev 2017, Nakanishi et al. 2018 obtain, cf. Fig. 2. To show that the improvement is due to the learned quantization and not just >because of the loss (8) an ablation experiment should be done. One could e.g. train the proposed method with the same predictor, but without the employing the learned quantization scheme, and compare to the results obtained for the proposed method.\"\n\nThis was in fact a concern for the other reviewers too, and we conducted an ablation study to assess the effect of \u2018dropping\u2019 the adaptive quantization width.  That is, we conducted a set of experiments in which we used a fixed quantization width for all latent features.   As we can see in the newly added figure,  the algorithm with adaptive quantization width was able to perform equally well with the \u2018best\u2019 fixed-width quantization in terms of MS-SSIM.   We also conducted a same set of ablation studies with a smaller model (no resblock, smaller # channels). For this ablation study,  adaptive quantization width worked much better than the fixed quantization.     \n\n\n\"Furthermore, a better understanding of the loss (8) would be desirable. How is the MSE factor justified?\"\n\nUnfortunately, we are unable to provide a solid answer to this question yet.   \nAlthough not too intuitive, the training with the MSE-included multiplicative loss was in fact smoother than the training with MS-SSIM loss. Empirically,  the presence of MSE often seemed to help the training process evade the local minima in the MS-SSIM landscape.

", "comment": "Thank you very much for the comments and suggestions.   We reflected the suggestions on the revisions.\nBelow, we would like to provide responses to the concerns raised: \n\n\n\"There is an inconsistency between section 2.2.2 and Fig. 7. I would expect in Fig. 7 also the result for the objective \nfunction from eq (6). In Fig. 7 could be added also a reference approach (such as BPG or a learned method).\"\n\nThank you very much for pointing this typo. The caption in our original submission was wrong;   we meant BPP + lambda*(1 - MSSSIM) in all places we wrote BP + lambda * MSE.  \nWe fixed the legend in all graphs.\n\n\n\"By comparing Fig.7 and Fig.2  and Nakanishi et al., I suspect that the improvement of ASAP over Nakanishi et al., comes mainly from the change in the objective function and not from the proposed ASAP core?\"\n\nWe shall first note that, as we state in the main article,  the result of our model in Fig.7 was produced by training the model over 0.1M, which is significantly less than the number of iterations used to produce the results for Fig 2 (0.3M).    \nThat being said, to make an assessment for this concern, we conducted an ablation study in which we compared the compression performance of our algorithm against those of the algorithm with fixed quantization width (all trained with the new objective function), and added a new figure illustrating the result.  On the model we trained for the benchmark study,  our ASAP was able to perform equally well as the compression with the \u2018best\u2019 fixed quantization width (best in terms of MS-SSIM).   For the assessment on the benchmark dataset, the benefit of our study turned out to be a relief from the burden of grid search.   We also conducted a separate ablation study with a smaller version of the model we used for a benchmark dataset.   For this second set of comparative experiments, we were able to confirm the benefit of the adaptive quantization size in terms of the rate-distortion tradeoff measured in MS-SSIM.  Adaptive width performed better than all choices of fixed quantization width.\n\n\n\"The paper should include/discuss also the paper of Balle et al., \"Variational image compression with a scale hyperprior\", ICLR 2018\"\n\"The authors target only MS-SSIM, however it is unclear to me why. According to Balle et al, ICLR 2018 and also to the recent CLIC challenge at CVPR18,  learning for MS-SSIM or for PSNR / MSE leads to results that are not necessarily strongly correlated with the perceptual quality. MS-SSIM does not strongly correlate to the perceptual quality, while PSNR / MSE is a measure of fidelity / accuracy towards a ground truth.  I would like to see a comparison in PSNR / MSE terms with BPG and/or Balle et al., ICLR 2018.\"\n\nWe mentioned the work of Balle et al in the script, and added their rate-distortion tradeoff curve in the figures. We also evaluated the performance of our method with PSNR scores,  and compare our method against Balle et al as well.   In terms of PSNR, our method(optimized for the novel loss)  was not able to perform better than Balle et al\u2019s model optimized for PSNR.  In terms of MS-SSIM, our method performed better than Balle et al\u2019s model optimized for MS-SSIM.  \n\n\n\"I would like to see a discussion on the complexity, design, runtime, and memory >requirements for the proposed approach in comparison with the other learned methods.\"\n\nIndeed, making the quantization width adaptive will increase computational cost to a certain extent. \nRoughty speaking, we do not expect much more than 50% increase in the sheer cost  (mu, sig) \u2192 (mu, sig, q).  Also,  as shown in Fig. 5, our computation admits parallel computing (the grids with same color can be computed in parallel). With the aid of GPU, this increase in computational burden shall not be much of a challenge. \n\n\n\"Also, it would be good to see more visual results, also for higher bpp.\"\n\nWe added the visual results for higher bpp.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1350/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1350/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1350/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adaptive Sample-space & Adaptive Probability coding: a neural-network based approach for compression", "abstract": "We propose Adaptive Sample-space & Adaptive Probability (ASAP) coding, an efficient neural-network based method for lossy data compression.\nOur ASAP coding distinguishes itself from the conventional method based on adaptive arithmetic coding in that it models the probability distribution for the quantization process in such a way that one can conduct back-propagation for the quantization width that determines the support of the distribution. \nOur ASAP also trains the model with a novel, hyper-parameter free multiplicative loss for the rate-distortion tradeoff.  \nWith our ASAP encoder, we are able to compress the image files in the Kodak dataset to as low as one fifth the size of the JPEG-compressed image without compromising their visual quality, and achieved the state-of-the-art result in terms of MS-SSIM based rate-distortion tradeoff.

In contrast to most prior methods, which adhere to a fixed quantization scheme (i.e. with fixed number of quantization levels, and fixing the level themselves), the proposed method jointly learns a probability model of the quantized representation (the bottleneck of an autoencoder model) for coding and a corresponding adaptive quantization scheme. The distribution of each entry in the bottleneck before quantization is modeled as a Gaussian, whose mean and variance are predicted by a neural network conditionally on bottleneck entries on a grid at different scales (similar as in Nakanishi et al. 2018). The same network also predicts quantization intervals to adaptively quantize the respective entry of the bottleneck. Together, the predicted means, variances, and quantization intervals are used to obtain an estimate of the code length. The proposed compression networks are trained with a novel multiplicative loss, showing clear improvements over prior methods Rippel & Bourdev 2017, Nakanishi et al. 2018 on the Kodak and Raise1k data sets in terms of MS-SSIM.\n\nPros:\n\nThe results presented in this paper seem to be state-of-the-art, and innovation on quantization, which has not attracted a lot of attention in the context of neural network-based image compression is a welcome contribution. The method also seems to outperform the recent method [1], which should be included for comparison.\n\nQuestions:\n\nA major issue is, however, that it is unclear from the results whether the gains are due to the novel quantization system, or due to the novel loss. From Fig. 7 it looks like the loss BPP + \\lambda (1-MS-SSIM) (assuming the formula in (6)) is correct, and the legend in Fig. 7 incorrect) that is used in most other works performs essentially on par with  Rippel & Bourdev 2017, Nakanishi et al. 2018. For example at 1 bpp, this loss yields an MS-SSIM of 0.992 which is essentially the same as Rippel & Bourdev 2017, Nakanishi et al. 2018 obtain, cf. Fig. 2. To show that the improvement is due to the learned quantization and not just because of the loss (8) an ablation experiment should be done. One could e.g. train the proposed method with the same predictor, but without the employing the learned quantization scheme, and compare to the results obtained for the proposed method.\n\nFurthermore, a better understanding of the loss (8) would be desirable. How is the MSE factor justified?\n\nAlso, it would be good to present visual examples at rates 0.1-1.0 bpp. All visual examples are at rates below 0.08 bpp, and the proposed method is shown to also outperform other methods at much higher rates.\n\n\n[1] Ball\u00e9, J., Minnen, D., Singh, S., Hwang, S.J. and Johnston, N.
