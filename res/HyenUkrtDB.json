The paper build on earlier observations (e.g. by Shen & Sanghavi) to propose this new metric as a concrete solution to the mislabeling problem. \n\nAlthough the reviewers remarked that this is an interesting approach for a relevant problems, they expressed several concerns regarding this paper. Two of them are whether the hardness of a sample would also result in high AUL scores, and another whether the results hold up under realistic mislabelings, rather than artificial label swapping / replacing. The authors did anecdotally suggest that neither of these effects has a major impact on the results. Still, I think a precise analysis of these effects would be critically important to have in the paper. Especially since there might be a complex interaction between the 'hardness' of samples and mislabelings (an MNIST 1 that looks like a 7 might be sooner mislabeled than a 1 that doesn't look like a 7). The authors show some examples of 'real' mislabeled sentences recognized by the model but it is still unclear whether downweighting these helped final test set performance in this case. \n\nBecause of these issues, I cannot recommend acceptance of the paper in its current state. However, based on the identified relevance of the problem tackled and the identified potential for significant impact I do think this could be a great paper in a next iteration.

We hope that we are able to clarify some misunderstanding and address your comments.\n\nW.R.T. \u201chard\u201d clean examples: From our observations, it appears that \u201chard\u201d examples have higher AUL than most clean examples, but lower AUL than mislabeled examples. (Intuitively, this makes sense, because truly mislabeled examples will be the hardest for the network to generalize to.) Therefore, hard samples will be downweighted some, but not as much as noisy examples. We would note that curriculum learning (e.g. Bengio et al, ICML 2019; Hacohen and Weinshall, ICML 2019) similarly down-weights (rather than up-weights) difficult examples until the end of training. To some extent AUL-based downweighting will have a similar effect: the network will not reduce the loss of difficult examples until the high-weight easy examples have sufficiently low loss.\n\nW.R.T. other noise models: Please refer to our \u201cpair flip\u201d experiments in Figure 7 and Table 1. These experiments are exactly the noise model you propose (p probability of being correct, and (1-p) probability of being k). We note that our proposed method is adept at estimating and correcting for label error in this setting as well.\n\nW.R.T. presenting AUL distributions: we observed the bimodal behavior for both CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 on all experiments that we performed - regardless of noise model, noise percentage, or network architecture. We will update the paper with additional plots that demonstrate this bimodality.\n\nW.R.T. real-world datasets: To demonstrate our method\u2019s applicability on real-world (non-image) datasets, we trained a model on a Machine Translation dataset (IWSLT14 German-to-English dataset). AUL determines that roughly 25 training samples have an incorrect target (the English sentence in the translation pair). Typically, these targets are not English and therefore are mislabeled.

We will correct these.)\n\nW.R.T. existing work: We will ensure that appropriate credit is given to Shen & Sanghavi in the revised version. We would note that our contribution goes beyond identifying the differences in training loss (also noted by e.g. Zhang et al., ICLR 2017), but introducing a stable metric (AUL) that is able to transform this observation into a robust method.\n\nW.R.T. normalizing by c: This is a common practice for several re-weighting methods (e.g. Ren et al., ICML 2018). We found that it improves the stability of training as it ensures that the effective learning rate is the same for all datasets regardless of label noise. We would note that in practice it would be incredibly rare for a minibatch to contain only bad examples. Even with 80% label noise, the probability of an all bad minibatch of size 256 is roughly 10^-25.\n\nW.R.T. Pearson\u2019s vs Spearman\u2019s: Spearman\u2019s produces similar results (e.g. ~98% correlation for AUL across networks). We chose to measure the Pearson\u2019s correlation because\u2014-as noted in Figure 4\u2014-the AUL scores from each network fall within very similar ranges.

This work suggests a surprisingly elegant approach to identify data with corrupted labels. The proposed AUL (area under the loss curve) makes intuitive sense, and exploiting the fact that noisy examples are hard to learn at the early stage of training, leading to higher AULs than clean examples.\n2. The paper is well-written, with plenty of visualization to aid the understanding.\n3. Experimental results suggest advantage of the proposal. Evaluation seem to suggest the using AULs is more robust against large corruptions compared with SOTA.\n\nCons:\n1. The biggest concern is the generalizability of AULs to datasets that are more challenging than CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. This has been the concern not only for this work, but also for this general research area. For instance, on Tiny-ImageNet dataset (e.g., used in SELFIE: Refurbishing Unclean Samples for Robust Deep Learning (ICML19), which could btw be used in the benchmark), a clean dataset only gives ~55% test error, compared with about ~10% on CIFAR10 and ~30% on CIFAR100. The robustness of AULs needs to be tested on those harder problems as well. \n2. AULs are based on the assumption of a clear separation of two types of examples -- clean and noisy. It ignores the difficulty of training examples. This raises the question of where to place hard-clean examples between those two modes.\n3. It usually helps to include a real-world noisy datasets where its noisy corruption is unknown. One would be curious to know the noisy level estimate.\n\nQuestions:\n1. It seems from the experiments that MoGs are fit per training example in order to compute weights for the cost?\n2. The computational cost of AUL-based training is not mentioned. Is it 2x, 3x, considering there are distinct stages of training before and after AUL estimation?"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1745/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1745/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["geoff@cs.cornell.edu", "tz58@cornell.edu", "eelenberg@asapp.com", "kqw4@cornell.edu"], "title": "Detecting Noisy Training Data with Loss Curves", "authors": ["Geoff Pleiss", "Tianyi Zhang", "Ethan R.

Specifically, the authors proposed to examine the training loss of each example to identify examples with high training losses. To mitigate the randomness in the training loss, the authors proposed an AUL (area under the loss) metric, which is less noisy that directly examining the loss. The authors proposed to use Gaussian mixture to approximate the AUL distribution, and then estimate the probability of mislabeling. The authors proposed to downweight training examples with high likelihood of being mislabeled. The proposal is examined in numerical studies.\n\nWhile I agree the method has a good potential to be significant, in its current form, I have several concerns that prevent me from recommending acceptance.\n1. How can we be sure that examples with large training loss are mislabeled examples, rather than examples that are inherently difficult to classify? For example, if the dataset consists of 99% bright images and 1% dark images, then it could be possible that dark image training examples have a higher loss. This question becomes more relevant when the model does not have sufficient complexity, or does not have the correct form of complexity.\n2. If we cannot distinguish mislabeled examples with examples that are hard to classify, then it seems to me that a simple downweighting based on AUL could potential lead to the opposite outcome. Intuitively, we should upweight those difficult to classify examples to improve generalizability.\n3. It is somewhat surprising to me that the AUL distribution is a nicely looking bimodal shape. Could it be due to the fact that the wrong labels are randomly generated with equal probabilities from other classes? What it we have a different error distribution, e.g., the label has p probability of being correct, and (1-p) probability of being k, where k is a constant?\n4. Given the above concerns, I feel the numerical studies are insufficient. The authors may consider 1) including more noise distributions, 2) presenting the AUL distributions to check whether they are truly bimodal, and 3) trying more datasets and more model architectures."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1745/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1745/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["geoff@cs.cornell.edu", "tz58@cornell.edu", "eelenberg@asapp.com", "kqw4@cornell.edu"], "title": "Detecting Noisy Training Data with Loss Curves", "authors": ["Geoff Pleiss", "Tianyi Zhang", "Ethan R.
