We circumvent this issue by running new simulations on the STL-10 database (100 000 images divided into a training (90 000 images) and a testing set (10000 images). This simulation is in the updated version of the paper. Note that the additional runs on STL-10 needed to compute the error-bar are still running. As soon as the simulations will be done, we will update the paper accordingly. To keep the paper concise and clear, we replaced the previous experiment an AT&T database (the smaller dataset) by those on STL-10. We put the \u2018old\u2019 simulation an ATT in the supplementary information section. We hope this major update will convince that reviewer that our paper can attract the interest of a broad audience. \n\nReviewer #2 is absolutely right to raise the lack of baseline. A good baseline will consist in an unsupervised hierarchical sparse coding model that has the same number of parameters than the models presented in the paper. This last constraint prevent us to us sparse auto-encoder (which has twice the number of parameters because weights of encoder and not tight to those of the decoder). To the best of our knowledge, the only models that are similar (in terms of number of parameters) are those from the Michael Elad team: The ML-CSC [1] and the ML-ISTA [2]. However, both models shown significant enough difference to make the comparison with the SDPC not relevant. First, the Elad team itself has demonstrated that the ML-CSC was equivalent to a single layer network that was too constrained to leverage hierarchical information [3]. In addition, the inference process of the ML-CSC does not explicitly computes intermediate state-variables. These two points make the comparison with the SDPC irrelevant. Second, the ML-ISTA could have been a good comparison point if the dictionaries were not learned with supervised training. The ML-ISTA uses a back-propagation over of cross-entropy loss function as a training mechanism. However, the reviewer rightly pointed out the fact that we did not justify the absence of baseline.

Note that the state variables are obtained through an inference process that is exactly the same for testing and training. The only difference between training and testing is that the dictionary learning step occurs only during the training (and not during testing). We updated the paper to clarify this crucial point of the paper, and we thank reviewer #3 for raising points that need clarification.\n\n-- The reviewer #3 is absolutely right to raise the lack of baseline. A good baseline will consist in an unsupervised hierarchical sparse coding model that has the same number of parameters than the models presented in the paper. This last constraint prevents us to use a sparse auto-encoder (which has twice the number of parameters because weights of encoder are not tied to those of the decoder). To the best of our knowledge, the only models that are similar (in terms of number of parameters) are those from the Michael Elad team: The ML-CSC [1] and the ML-ISTA [2]. First, the ML-CSC was shown to be equivalent to a single layer network that was too constrained to leverage hierarchical information [3]. Second, the ML-ISTA could have been a good comparison point if the dictionaries were not learned using supervised training. However, the reviewer rightly pointed out the fact that we did not justify the absence of baseline. We thus updated the article to highlight the specificity of the SDPC that makes it complicated to compare to other state-of-the-art algorithms (see conclusion section).\n\nConcerning detailled comments : \n(1) - The reviewer #3 correctly raised the fact that we are calling \u2018deep\u2019 an architecture that has only 2-layers. We propose to renamed our algorithm: 2-Layers Sparse Predictive Coding (2L-SPC) instead of Sparse Deep Predictive Coding (SDPC) to fit the claim of this paper. Focusing on this 2-layer network with and without feedback allows us to observe the performance of this new structure applicable for deeper networks. Indeed, we are now working on deeper architectures, and it would be the subjects of subsequent paper. We propose to better highlight this point in the conclusion\n\n(2) - The reciprocal dictionary is indeed coming from the inference process described in Eq.(3). To remove any ambiguity, we updated the section 2.2 to explicit the origin of the reciprocal dictionary.\n\n(3) - This comment has been clarified using more accurate notation (see section). Note that transforming convolution on 4d tensors into a matrix/vector multiplication requires more than a reshaping. One needs to transform the 4d tensor into a 2d Toeplitz matrix (see introduction of [1], where this transformation is well described). Nevertheless, we have updated the paper to better explained this point (see section 2.1).\n\n\n(4) - We added Eq.6 to clarify the learning loss. \n\n(4) - The reviewer #3 is absolutely right to suggest the use of Coordinate Descent to optimize our Loss function. However, in a convolutional case in which the derivatives of the loss are easily computable, it has been demonstrated that FISTA algorithm is converging faster than coordinate descent [4]. We updated section 2.2 to better motivate our choice for FISTA.\n\n(5) - We thank the reviewer for raising the interesting difference between reconstruction error and global prediction error (i.e. the sum of all local prediction error). In a 2 layer setting, the reconstruction error is equal to norm2(x - D1^{T}.D2^{T}.gamma_{2}). Interestingly, one can easily demonstrate that this reconstruction error is upper-bounded by the global prediction error (using Eq. 1 and then applying triangular inequality). So both notions are tightly linked, and a lower global prediction error implies a lower reconstruction error (the opposite is not necessarily true).\n\n(6) -  We updated the paper according to the reviewer #3 suggestions \n\n\u2014- References\n[1] Sulam, Jeremias, et al. \"Multilayer convolutional sparse modeling: Pursuit and dictionary learning.\" IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing 66.15 (2018): 4090-4104.\n\n[2] Sulam, Jeremias, et al. \"On multi-layer basis pursuit, efficient algorithms and convolutional neural networks.\" IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence (2019).\n\n[3] Aberdam, Aviad, Jeremias Sulam, and Michael Elad. \"Multi-Layer Sparse Coding: The Holistic Way.\" SIAM Journal on Mathematics of Data Science 1.1 (2019): 46-77.\n\n[4] Chalasani, Rakesh, Jose C.

I am wondering if a deeper structure will improve the performance?\n\n(2) For the structure shown in Fig.1, the decoding dictionaries are $D^T_i$, but I am confused why the encoding dictionaries are reciprocal to encoding dictionaries. Does it come from the optimization updates shown in Eq.(3)?\n\n(3) According to Eq.(1), $x$ is a vector and $D$ is a 2d matrix. However, the real inputs in the experiments are images and $D$ is a convolutional filter with 4 dimensions. How are the matrices reshaped?\n\n(4) For section 2.2 and 2.3, the number/index of samples is not shown in the loss function for training. The loss should be over the whole training set. Besides, the test procedure is not clarified.\n\n(4) The number of iterations using FISTA of SDPC and Hi-La networks is shown to compare the rate of convergence. However, considering both models are solving a lasso-type regression problem, I would suggest using coordinate descent for optimization.\n\n(5) For the main result of prediction error, why is the \u201cglobal prediction error\u201d more important than the reconstruction error? Is the first-layer prediction error the reconstruction error? If yes, Fig.2 shows that Hi-La has a lower prediction error compared to SDPC for the first layer.\n\n(6) Two minor comments on writing:\n(a) It would be better to have a separate section for 2.5 since it describes the dataset and is not related to the proposed model.\n(b) A typo of \u201cneuronal implementation\u201d exists in the introduction section. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper570/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper570/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Effect of top-down connections in Hierarchical Sparse Coding", "authors": ["Victor Boutin", "Angelo Franciosini", "Franck Ruffier", "Laurent Perrinet"], "authorids": ["victor.boutin@univ-amu.fr", "angelo.franciosini@univ-amu.fr", "franck.ruffier@univ-amu.fr", "laurent.perrinet@univ-amu.fr"], "keywords": ["Hierarchical Sparse Coding", "Convolutional Sparse Coding", "Top-down connections"], "TL;DR": "This paper experimentally demonstrates the beneficial effect of top-down connections in Hierarchical Sparse Coding algorithm.", "abstract": "Hierarchical Sparse Coding (HSC) is a powerful model to efficiently represent multi-dimensional, structured data such as images. The simplest solution to solve this computationally hard problem is to decompose it into independent layerwise subproblems. However, neuroscientific evidence would suggest inter-connecting these subproblems as in the Predictive Coding (PC) theory, which adds top-down connections between consecutive layers. In this study, a new model called Sparse Deep Predictive Coding (SDPC) is introduced to assess the impact of this inter-layer feedback connection. In particular, the SDPC is compared with a Hierarchical Lasso (Hi-La) network made out of a sequence of Lasso layers. A 2-layered SDPC and a Hi-La networks are trained on 3 different databases and with different sparsity parameters on each layer. First, we show that the overall prediction error generated by SDPC is lower thanks to the feedback mechanism as it transfers prediction error between layers. Second, we demonstrate that the inference stage of the SDPC is faster to converge than for the Hi-La model. Third, we show that the SDPC also accelerates the learning process. Finally, the qualitative analysis of both models dictionaries, supported by their activation probability, show that the SDPC features are more generic and informative.", "pdf": "/pdf/4990a8b8be1bda48709f08f209a7523dd631a831.pdf", "paperhash": "boutin|effect_of_topdown_connections_in_hierarchical_sparse_coding", "original_pdf": "/attachment/23fbbd69d1bf2929c8547e303745384a415b8486.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nboutin2020effect,\ntitle={Effect of top-down connections in Hierarchical Sparse Coding},\nauthor={Victor Boutin and Angelo Franciosini and Franck Ruffier and Laurent Perrinet},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJlcLaVFvB}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
