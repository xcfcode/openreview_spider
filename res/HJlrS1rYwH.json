However, I am voting for \"weak reject\" for the reasons outlined below. If some (or all) of them are address, I'd be happy to raise my score. \n\n- I found the paper hard to understand. In particular, the algorithm PPN on which this work is build is not explained at all, requiring the reader to read the original PPN paper. Including a description of PPN, including it's main features, would greatly help the paper. Second, I am still not sure I correctly undestand when each component is used. As I currently understand it, the main usage of the model during training time is to compute the Advantages in equation (2)? Or are those computed based on rollouts? If so, where is the model actually being used during training?\n- Figure 1 is taken directly from the PPN paper without any reference or citation (as far as I can tell).\n- For the comparison in Figure 5, it would be great if PPN could also be tested with the newly introduced parameter \\beta_i. At the moment, it is hard to tell whether the performance gains are due to \\beta or due to the proposed planning scheme.\n- I'm confused about Theorem 1: Wouldn't we want an upper bound on the difference of means?  Also, what does 'worst-case' mean? Is that for the 'worst' Q-function we could choose? \n\nEdit:\nThank you for your comments and updated manuscript.\n\nI think the writing has improved significantly, but could still be further improved and clarified. In particular, the question of how the model and other components at various points in time could be made more obvious. I found the authors' response to R3 here helpful as well. \nAt least for me some of the confusion arises not due to the complexity of the proposed approach, but just because combining real and 'simulated' transitions can be used and mixed in so many different ways that it's important to be clear about it. Also, at least personally, I found the explanation \"Learning is done with a model-based approach that follows the behaviour policy\u2019s rollout trajectory. However, the test policy follows a model-based approach\" still not very helpful. \nOverall, I think the presentation is on a good way but needs some more work.\n\nWith that being said and now having a better understanding of the algorithm I think this is very interesting work. However, I share R1's concerns about the computation of the \\pi-Q backup, in particular that it seems arbitrary and doesn't handle negative values. I'm also not convinced that adding |min(Q)| is a good solutions as a) we don't always have access to that value and b) If I'm not wrong, than \\pi_F is not invariant under a shift of Q. \nI'm wondering why the authors decided to take the geometric mean instead of following the more typically used approach of using exp(Q/Temperature)*pi to combine Q-function and a policy distribution (see e.g. the \"Control as Inference\" literature, the \"Maximum a Posteriori Policy Optimisation\" or \"Soft Actor Critic\" algorithms, in particular the \"Soft Value functions\". I think this should at the very least be an ablation study, and could be even performing better and at the very least be robust to negative values.\n\nOverall, I think this is very interesting work and could become a very strong paper, but I will remain to recommend a \"weak reject\" because I think it needs some more work to get there.

The purpose of the backup is to choose an action that will lead to max expected returns. If the backup was exclusively using the Q approximations from the reward and value networks then it could be fair to say the backup resembles the Q function. However, we are arguing that both \\pi and the Q composition(from the value and reward networks) are both signals of how \u201cgood\u201d an action is to take. Thus the augmented geometric mean takes both quality scores into account. The argmax of \\pi_F leads to larger expected returns than \\pi or Q does individually and our experiments justify this. \n\nFor the camera ready version we will change the notation in Section 3.2.2 to avoid misleading readers that the \\pi-Q backup resembles the Q function.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1691/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1691/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Policy Tree Network", "authors": ["Zac Wellmer", "Sepanta Zeighami", "James Kwok"], "authorids": ["zac@1984.ai", "szeighami@connect.ust.hk", "jamesk@cse.ust.hk"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning"], "abstract": "Decision-time planning policies with implicit dynamics models have been shown to work in discrete action spaces with Q learning.

We\u2019ve reviewed your points and will respond in line below.\n\n> It seems to me that pi(a|s) is the density of action a, so what does sqrt(value * density) mean? \n\nConsider value and density functions as two different quality scores for an action. We use the geometric mean to provide an average quality score for the action.The geometric mean is useful for when quality scores don\u2019t share the scale. \n\n> What if the value is negative?\n\nThis was rare in our environments(seen early in swimmer). When a negative or zero valued Q exists in the tree, we modify the geometric mean calculation by adding |min(Q) + \\delta| to the Q estimates. Where \\delta is a positive small non-zero term which could be optimized (https://www.arpapress.com/volumes/vol11issue3/ijrras_11_3_08.pdf) to more closely recover the geometric mean.\n\n> Figure 1 looks the same as Figure 1 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07373.pdf, but I don't find any reference in the paper. \n\nGood catch, we will add the proper reference to fix this.\n\n > How is PTN compared to model-based RL algorithms?\n\nWe do, see Section 4.4. We use PPN(background planning) as a baseline and this is considered an implicit model-based method. To the best of our knowledge, PTN is the first work to perform decision-time planning with an implicit dynamics model. We didn\u2019t compare to an explicit model-based(ex: observation prediction network) as this was shown to perform poorly in VPN.\n\nIn the introduction we talk about two categories of model-based reinforcement learning, \u201cExplicit dynamics models are when the observations are directly being reconstructed. The second is implicit dynamics models. Implicit Dynamics models are when the dynamics model is learned indirectly.\u201d This is further expanded on in related works(ex: PPN)\n\n> More importantly, note that the policy in PPO is stochastic, so how is PTN compared to the deterministic policy? \n\nPTN is also stochastic (when b<\\infty) so we don\u2019t see a reason to compare with deterministic variants. It\u2019s common(ex: ATreeC experiments) to compare with the stochastic variant(as opposed to a deterministic version). \n\n> How is the proposed pi-Q-backup method compared to classical control method, e.g. MPC? \n\nSimply put, MPC is when you replan at every step. PTN at evaluation time performs MPC.\n\n> Does the proposed planning algorithm work for model-free algorithms? \n\nThe proposed planning algorithm(w/ depth=1) could work for model-free algorithms if you have access to a Q-function and a policy.\n\n> As this paper talks about planning with implicit dynamics models, how is the proposed method compared with explicit dynamics models? \n\nWe did not test this as Observation Prediction Network(explicit model-based method) was shown to perform poorly in VPN.\n\nMinor comments: \n> In Algorithm 1 Line 11, could you please check the brackets? \n\nThanks, we will fix that for the camera ready version\n\n> Page 4, \"Thus, cumulative density function (cdf) of pi_F is given by ...\": Could you please check the correctness of the equation? \n\nIn the camera ready version we can update the range of the integral to be from -\\infty to z\n\n> What does \"worst-case\" in Theorem 1 mean? \n\nGiven any policy pi (learned by PTN), worst-case is the maximum possible difference between the mean of pi_F and pi over all possible choices of Q-functions.\n\n> How is correlation in Table 2 calculated?\n\nWe calculate correlation from sample covariance divided by the product of sample standard deviations. In Section 4.2 we say, \u201cTo measure correlation we first train a PPN policy for 200 thousand time-steps on the MuJoCo environments. Next we collect trajectories over 10 thousand timesteps. Then at each observation we uniformly sample 100 actions and compute the corresponding Q-values and corresponding PDF points from $\\pi$. This gives us 10 thousand estimates of correlation. From here we fit a normal distribution to the correlation results and report them in Table 2.\u201d\n\n> In Algorithm 1, is the return value a scalar or a vector?\n\nA vector of Q/pi-Q values dependent on the branching factor. We will make this more clear in the camera ready version.\n\n> One can have infinite b but sample a uniformly to optimize Q (and then pi_F becomes maxQ policy), so I don't think b can be simply characterized as the confidence.\n\nThe statement is for when sampling is done based on pi and b is finite. The second paragraph on page 4 states that \u201cwe sample b actions based on pi\u201d. If sampling is not based on pi (e.g., uniform sampling), then pi_F does not depend on pi. Furthermore, if infinite b is used, sampling based on any distribution with non-zero pdf for all the actions will result in pi_F becoming maxQ policy, as mentioned in the second bullet point on page 3 of the paper.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1691/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1691/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Policy Tree Network", "authors": ["Zac Wellmer", "Sepanta Zeighami", "James Kwok"], "authorids": ["zac@1984.ai", "szeighami@connect.ust.hk", "jamesk@cse.ust.hk"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning"], "abstract": "Decision-time planning policies with implicit dynamics models have been shown to work in discrete action spaces with Q learning.

We\u2019ve reviewed your points and will respond in line below.\n\n> why do we care in this work about PPO and not say Q(\\lambda)\n\nPTN focuses on leveraging an implicit dynamics model to perform decision-time planning in continuous action spaces. We specifically went over works related to policy gradient methods and continuous action space(PPO) and implicit dynamics models(ATreeC/TreeQN/VPN/PPN). While Watkins Q(\\lambda) is interesting, it neither relates to operating in continuous action space nor building an implicit dynamics model. However, you bring up a fair point that PPO is not entirely necessary. In the camera ready version we will drop the PPO subsection and use the extra space to provide more details about PPN.\n\n> If PPN is so central it has to be presented before PTN and notation should be introduced there\n\nYou bring up a good point, some explanations are currently in the appendix(ex: clipping and importance sampling ratios) but we can improve. In the camera ready version we will include a more in depth explanation of PPN in related works and additionally will provide extra details in the appendix(ex: PPN\u2019s training algorithm). \n\n> Please separately present how inference works and present the learning all in one place instead of losses in 3.1 and how to construct targets spread out until 3.2.2 \n\nTargets for 3.1(eq 2-4) include observed rewards, bootstrapped n-step returns, and generalized advantage estimates. Q and \\pi-Q backup found in 3.2 are not used as targets in eq(2-4), they are only used for  decision-time planning at evaluation time. \n\nIn the first paragraph section 3 we say:\n\u201cActions during behavior time are chosen by a model-free policy. Learning is done with a model-based approach that follows the behavior policy\u2019s rollout trajectory.\u201d \n\u201ca latent space transition model is embedded into the architecture. The embedded latent space transition model allows us to backpropagate from multiple simulation steps into the future back to a grounded observation. As a consequence, a dynamics model is learned\u201d\n\nThis means that the behaviour policy does not use the model. During training the objectives force us to make use of dynamics model at any point i>0(equation 1). In the camera ready version we can expand on the implications of the above quotes to explicitly say how inference is done.\n\nIn short:\nBehaviour time: no transition model and no decision-time planning\nTraining time: transition model but no decision-time planning(because we follow behaviour trajectory)\nEvaluation time: transition model and decision-time planning planning\n\n> The algorithm was the most useful thing in the paper but even there it should be much clearer e.g. what is Q, how come we can write Q[j] = in consecutive lines. The second one should probably be Q[j] +=.\n\nIt seems there is a misunderstanding, most likely stemming from a poor choice of notation on our part. The value set recursively at the first mention of Q[j] is used in the following line when applying td-\\lambda. To be more clear we will replace the first mention with a temporary variable. \n\n> To me if you have a network that takes in previous step and action and produces a latent next step that is an explicit transition model. How is it not?\n\nWe talk about this in the introduction, \u201cExplicit dynamics models are when the observations are directly being reconstructed. The second is implicit dynamics models. Implicit Dynamics models are when the dynamics model is learned indirectly.\u201d This is further expanded on in related works(ex: PPN)\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1691/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1691/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Policy Tree Network", "authors": ["Zac Wellmer", "Sepanta Zeighami", "James Kwok"], "authorids": ["zac@1984.ai", "szeighami@connect.ust.hk", "jamesk@cse.ust.hk"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning"], "abstract": "Decision-time planning policies with implicit dynamics models have been shown to work in discrete action spaces with Q learning.

We\u2019ve reviewed your points and will respond in line below. \n\n> Including a description of PPN, including its main features, would greatly help the paper.\n\nGood point. In the camera ready version we will include a more in depth explanation of PPN in related works. There currently exists details in the appendix regarding PPN\u2019s approach to clipping but we will expand on this(ex: PPN\u2019s training algorithm). \n\n > the main usage of the model during training time is to compute the Advantages in equation (2)?\n\nGood question, this is our fault for not being explicitly clear. The model is not used to compute the advantages. In the camera ready version we will fix this. At training time the model helps with feature learning(via background planning). The main purpose of the implicit dynamics model is to be used at evaluation time to perform decision-time planning. \n\n> Or are those computed based on rollouts? \n\nYes, when we expand the related work section on PPN we will make this more clear and reference that PTN follows the same approach to generating advantage estimates. \n\n> If so, where is the model actually being used during training? \n\nIn the first paragraph of section 3 we say:\n\u201cActions during behavior time are chosen by a model-free policy. Learning is done with a model-based approach that follows the behavior policy\u2019s rollout trajectory.\u201d \n\u201ca latent space transition model is embedded into the architecture. The embedded latent space transition model allows us to backpropagate from multiple simulation steps into the future back to a grounded observation. As a consequence, a dynamics model is learned\u201d\n\nThis means that the behaviour policy does not use the model. During training the objectives force us to make use of dynamics model at any point i>0(equation 1). We will make this more clear in the camera ready version.\n\n> Figure 1 is taken directly from the PPN paper without any reference or citation (as far as I can tell).\n\nGood catch, we will add the proper reference to fix this.\n\n > For the comparison in Figure 5, it would be great if PPN could also be tested with the newly introduced parameter \\beta_i. At the moment, it is hard to tell whether the performance gains are due to \\beta or due to the proposed planning scheme. \n\nFair point, we will include this comparison between PTN(no decision-time planning) and PPN in the appendix. An image of a preliminary table is linked(https://imgur.com/kIIrDNW), notice that these returns are worse than PTN(with decision-time planning) shown in Figure 5. This shows performance benefits from the modifications shown in Section 3.1(ex: \\beta). The point of \\beta is to stabilize returns over different values of training depth. In PPN the authors showed that optimal depth is highly dependent on the environment and returns can drastically differ. While the modifications certainly do not entirely fix this, we find that it mitigates large differences in returns from different training depths.\n\n> I'm confused about Theorem 1: Wouldn't we want an upper bound on the difference of means? \n\nAs mentioned in the second paragraph of page 5, the goal of the theorem is to show that \u201cThe final policy pi_F can become significantly different from pi \u2026. even when b = 2\u201d (emphasis added). That is, the difference can be at least sigma/sqrt(pi), which is significantly large and not desirable. However, an upper bound would aim at showing the opposite. Another way to state the theorem is that there exist Q functions for which the difference between mean of pi_F and pi is at least sigma/sqrt(pi). Linked figure(https://imgur.com/FF4o2IS) shows that, as b increases, there exist Q functions for which pi_F and pi become increasingly different. We will add this to the appendix in the camera ready version.\n\nIn the paper, we mention that \u201cFor smaller values of b, pi_F is more similar to pi and as b increases pi_F becomes similar to Q0.\u201d That is, generally, because pi and Q are correlated (as shown in Table 2), we expect that on average, pi_F to be similar to pi (it may be interesting to study this theoretically, but we have not shown it). However, the theorem shows that there exists Q functions for which pi_F and pi are very different.\n\n> Also, what does 'worst-case' mean? \n\nGiven any policy pi (learned by PTN), worst-case is the maximum possible difference between the mean of pi_F and pi over all possible choices of Q-functions.\n\n> Is that for the 'worst' Q-function we could choose?\n\nYes, the worst-case is over all the possible Q-function. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1691/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1691/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Policy Tree Network", "authors": ["Zac Wellmer", "Sepanta Zeighami", "James Kwok"], "authorids": ["zac@1984.ai", "szeighami@connect.ust.hk", "jamesk@cse.ust.hk"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning"], "abstract": "Decision-time planning policies with implicit dynamics models have been shown to work in discrete action spaces with Q learning.

The experiments show that the proposed method performs better than the underlying model-free RL algorithm in standard MuJoCo environments. \n\nThe writing quality is low and I don't understand the proposed method, especially the backed-up Q-value. The notation is also confusing. It seems to me that pi(a|s) is the density of action a, so what does sqrt(value * density) mean? What if the value is negative? \n\nBesides, I have some questions.\n1. Figure 1 looks the same as Figure 1 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07373.pdf, but I don't find any reference in the paper. Could you please state the difference between two figures, or explain why you want to put this figure here without any description or reference? \n2. How is PTN compared to model-based RL algorithms? The only baseline here is PPO, which is model-free. More importantly, note that the policy in PPO is stochastic, so how is PTN compared to the deterministic policy? \n3. How is the proposed pi-Q-backup method compared to classical control method, e.g. MPC? Does the proposed planning algorithm work for model-free algorithms? \n4. As this paper talks about planning with implicit dynamics models, how is the proposed method compared with explicit dynamics models? \n\nMinor comments:\n1. In Algorithm 1 Line 11, could you please check the brackets? \n2. Page 4, \"Thus, cumulative density function (cdf) of pi_F is given by ...\": Could you please check the correctness of the equation? \n3. What does \"worst-case\" in Theorem 1 mean? \n4. How is correlation in Table 2 calculated? \n5. In Algorithm 1, is the return value a scalar or a vector? \n6. The paper states that \"Intuitively, the branching factor b can be thought of as interpolating how much confidence we have in pi and Q0\". One can have infinite b but sample a uniformly to optimize Q (and then pi_F becomes maxQ policy), so I don't think b can be simply characterized as the confidence. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1691/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1691/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Policy Tree Network", "authors": ["Zac Wellmer", "Sepanta Zeighami", "James Kwok"], "authorids": ["zac@1984.ai", "szeighami@connect.ust.hk", "jamesk@cse.ust.hk"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning"], "abstract": "Decision-time planning policies with implicit dynamics models have been shown to work in discrete action spaces with Q learning. However, decision-time planning with implicit dynamics models in continuous action space has proven to be a difficult problem. Recent work in Reinforcement Learning has allowed for implicit model based approaches to be extended to Policy Gradient methods. In this work we propose Policy Tree Network (PTN). Policy Tree Network lies at the intersection of Model-Based Reinforcement Learning and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning. Policy Tree Network is a novel approach which, for the first time, demonstrates how to leverage an implicit model to perform decision-time planning with Policy Gradient methods in continuous action spaces.
