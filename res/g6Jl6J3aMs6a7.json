The lookup table that was previously used for state transitions is replaced by a feedback, output-to-input loop that somewhat resembles a recurrent neural network. However so little information is provided about the original system that it is difficult to tell if this is an advantage or not. The paper would be a lot clearer and more self-contained if it described and motivated DeSTIN before introducing the new algorithm.\r\n\r\nThe method is first applied to binary classification with toy sequences. The sequences are not defined, except that the two classes differ only in the first element - making it a memory recall task. The results suggest that the architecture has difficulty retaining information for long periods, with accuracy close to random guessing after 30 timesteps. They also seem to show that the number of centroids controls the underfitting/overfitting of the algorithm.\r\n\r\nThe paper claims 'state-of-the-art-results on the MNIST classification benchmark'; but the recorded error rate (1.29%) is a long way from the current benchmark (0.23%) - see http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. Only 15,000 of the training cases were used, which somewhat mitigates the results. However the statement in the abstract should be changed. The experimental details are very scarce, and I doubt they could be recreated by other researchers."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"decision": "reject", "title": "Recurrent Online Clustering as a Spatio-Temporal Feature Extractor in\r\n    DeSTIN", "abstract": "This paper presents a basic enhancement to the DeSTIN deep learning architecture by replacing the explicitly calculated transition tables that are used to capture temporal features with a simpler, more scalable mechanism.
