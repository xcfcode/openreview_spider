In this work, we are the first to consider employing deep neural networks toward tackling this problem. We observe that program translation is a modular procedure, in which a sub-tree of the source tree is translated into the corresponding target sub-tree at each step. To capture this intuition, we design a tree-to-tree neural network as an encoder-decoder architecture to translate a source tree into a target one. Meanwhile, we develop an attention mechanism for the tree-to-tree model, so that when the decoder expands one non-terminal in the target tree, the attention mechanism locates the corresponding sub-tree in the source tree to guide the expansion of the decoder. We evaluate the program translation capability of our tree-to-tree model against several state-of-the-art approaches. Compared against other neural translation models, we observe that our approach is consistently better than the baselines with a margin of up to 15 points. Further, our approach can improve the previous state-of-the-art program translation approaches by a margin of 20 points on the translation of real-world projects.", "pdf": "/pdf/2902870e84a4aa6a946a0315bf37b5b0f13d24fb.pdf", "paperhash": "chen|treetotree_neural_networks_for_program_translation", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nchen2018treetotree,\ntitle={Tree-to-tree Neural Networks for Program Translation},\nauthor={Xinyun Chen and Chang Liu and Dawn Song},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkxY-sl0W},\n}", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Xinyun Chen", "Chang Liu", "Dawn Song"], "authorids": ["xinyun.chen@berkeley.edu", "liuchang@eecs.berkeley.edu", "dawnsong.travel@gmail.com"]}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 1, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "tags": [], "original": {"tddate": null, "ddate": null, "tmdate": 1521494254630, "tcdate": 1509106039829, "number": 365, "cdate": 1518730180175, "id": "rkxY-sl0W", "invitation": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Blind_Submission", "forum": "rkxY-sl0W", "original": "S1yYbjxR-", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "content": {"title": "Tree-to-tree Neural Networks for Program Translation", "abstract": "Program translation is an important tool to migrate legacy code in one language into an ecosystem built in a different language.
