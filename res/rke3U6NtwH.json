The authors empirically show that for several data sets, the approach outperforms quite a few recently proposed strong competitors.\n\nThe proposed approach is reasonable, but is not much innovative. The prior work DiffPool uses GCNs to parameterize the node embedding matrix Z and the cluster assignment matrix S. This paper computes a number of Zs and Ss, each of which result from a different hyperparameter choice of GCN, and then combines them through concatenation and feed forward transform. Significance of the contribution is a bit marginal.\n\nThe experimental results appear to be exciting, in light of the substantial boost in classification accuracy on the D&D data set. However, the experiment design and the reporting of results are doubtful. A major concern is the copying of results reported by prior work to Table 2. It is unclear whether these numbers were obtained from the same experiment setting. For example, the number for SAGPool + D&D comes from Lee et al., 2019, but the DiffPool number in that paper is 66.95, which is significantly different the one shown here, 80.64, copied from Ying et al., 2018.\n\nAnother concern is the missing numbers for SAGPool. Although the authors explain the difficulty of obtaining these numbers, a lack of them does not complete the empirical evaluation.\n\nMinor comments/questions:\n\n- In the first sentence of 4.2, the word \"ter90o8ims\" is a typo of \"terms\".\n\n- What are the neural networks f_c in (3) and f_p in (5)?\n\n- Texts after (5) read f_g instead of f_p.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper574/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper574/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "MxPool: Multiplex Pooling for Hierarchical Graph Representation Learning", "authors": ["Yanyan Liang", "Yanfeng Zhang", "Fangjing Wang", "Qian Xu"], "authorids": ["13354227340@163.com", "zhangyf@mail.neu.edu.cn", "inggraph@qq.com", "xuqian1286@163.com"], "keywords": ["GNN", "graph pooling", "graph representation learning"], "abstract": "Graphs are known to have complicated structures and have myriad applications.

It builds upon the diffpool method. Specifically, the authors propose the multiplex convolution and the multiplex pooling operation. The multiplex convolution learns multiple graph convolution operations (potentially with different parameters) and merges them using a neural network. Similarly, the multiplex pooling learns multiple assignment matrices utilizing diffpool and merges them using a neural network. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated with experiments in several standard benchmark datasets for graph classification. \n\nStrengths\n\nThe overall architecture of the proposed method can be regarded as an extension of diffpool method by using multiple convolution and pooling operations. An analysis on how the number of convolution and pooling operations can affect the performance of the model shows the effectiveness of the proposed multiplex convolution/pooling operations. The effectiveness of the proposed model is further verified by the experimental results on 5 standard benchmark datasets.\n\nWeakness \n\nThe novelty of the paper is limited. The major contribution of this paper is to utilize multiple convolution/pooling operations and merge them with neural networks. \n\nIt is not clear how issues mentioned in the motivational examples shown in Figure 1 can be solved by the proposed model. As discussed in Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b), small graphs may prefer small embedding while large graphs may prefer large embedding. However, it is unclear how the proposed model achieves this goal as the combination of the embeddings from different convolution operations is through a neural network that is shared by all graphs. Similarly, for Figure 1(c) and Figure 1(d), it is not clear how the proposed model can focus more on one type of information than the other. It would be helpful if there are some empirical results to demonstrate this.\n\nRecommendations\n\nIt would be better if the authors can provide some analysis on time complexity of the proposed model. The major concern of the efficiency is the introducing of fully connected graph after each pooling as mentioned in Section 3.3. \n\nMinor comments\n\nIn section 3.3, \u201cis a GCN different\u201d -> \u201cis a GCN variant\u201d?\nIn Section 3.3, should there be a softmax function after Eq.(5)? \nIn section 4.2, \u201cin ter90o8ims\u201d -> \u201cin terms\u201d?\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper574/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper574/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "MxPool: Multiplex Pooling for Hierarchical Graph Representation Learning", "authors": ["Yanyan Liang", "Yanfeng Zhang", "Fangjing Wang", "Qian Xu"], "authorids": ["13354227340@163.com", "zhangyf@mail.neu.edu.cn", "inggraph@qq.com", "xuqian1286@163.com"], "keywords": ["GNN", "graph pooling", "graph representation learning"], "abstract": "Graphs are known to have complicated structures and have myriad applications.

In this paper, we propose a simple but effective approach, MxPool, which concurrently uses multiple graph convolution networks and graph pooling networks to build hierarchical learning structure for graph representation learning tasks. Our experiments on numerous graph classification benchmarks show that our MxPool has marked superiority over other state-of-the-art graph representation learning methods. For example, MxPool achieves 92.1% accuracy on the D&D dataset while the second best method DiffPool only achieves 80.64% accuracy.", "pdf": "/pdf/0d49c4938bf60046bf5bcf07d8b9833fbdcfbb75.pdf", "code": "https://github.com/JucatL/MxPool", "paperhash": "liang|mxpool_multiplex_pooling_for_hierarchical_graph_representation_learning", "original_pdf": "/attachment/0d49c4938bf60046bf5bcf07d8b9833fbdcfbb75.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nliang2020mxpool,\ntitle={MxPool: Multiplex Pooling for Hierarchical Graph Representation Learning},\nauthor={Yanyan Liang and Yanfeng Zhang and Fangjing Wang and Qian Xu},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rke3U6NtwH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
