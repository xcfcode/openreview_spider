The proposed method uses ensembles to build a better model of environment dynamics and suggests some rules to optimize the new ensemble-based dynamics and to estimate the intrinsic reward.\n\nI am torn on this paper. I like the derivation of the method and the ideas behind it. I think it is an interesting direction of research. However, the experiments are limited to one domain and the paper needs proofreading. I will vote \"weak accept\" for this paper, as I think it is incremental and the experiments are too limited.\n\nAs I said above, the paper could use some proofreading. Some sections (like pages 1-2) are well written, but others are full of grammatical mistakes. There is also a lot of redundant information.\n\nIt is often stated that the ensemble model has better capacity than the single model. Some experimental proof of this better modelling capacity could help convince a reader that the ensemble is indeed beneficial and warranted (e.g., show that P_K is better than the single model P).\n\nSome evaluation or discussion on the computational costs of the method would be beneficial. I assume the ensemble-based method is more computationally intensive. Would it perform better than single surprise if they were compared according to wall clock time?\n\n\nExamples of minor issues:\n\n- Page 3, after equation 7, sentence beginning with \"In addition to the advantage that the mixture model (4) has the increased model order for modelling\" is confusing, contains redundant elements, and is not bringing useful information. It should be revised\n- page 4, in paragraph after eq. 11: the following sentence is grammatically incorrect, please revise: \"Propositions 1 and 2 suggest a way to intrinsic reward design under the mixture model for tight gap between \u03b7(\u03c0 \u0303\u2217) and \u03b7(\u03c0\u2217)\"\n- in the same sentence, revise: \"be close to the true \u03b7(\u03c0\u2217) of the true optimal policy \u03c0\u2217, as desired.\",\n- page 6 text above Figure 1: \"single-modal\" should be unimodal\n\n\nPOST REBUTTAL \n\nThanks for writing your rebuttal. I have read it, as well as the other reviews. I think reviewer 1 touches on some important points, especially regarding the engineered sparse rewards. It seems the method is not properly justified given the environments used for its evaluation. Based on this, and the fact that the method is rather incremental, I would like to change my score to a weak reject.

As you mentioned, we need intrinsic rewards during exploration, but we observed that intrinsic rewards of large values did not necessarily help training policy when extrinsic reward was sparse. In other words, the difference between P and P_K should be \"different but not too much.\" Minimum selection can prevent overestimation of surprise as well as reduce the gap in Proposition 1. Preventing overestimation using minimum selection was in fact shown to be valid in previous works such as Twin delayed DDPG, or TD3* (although the goal and basic setting of our paper are different from TD3).\n\nThe accumulated intrinsic rewards approach 0 meant that we initially got a lot of positive intrinsic rewards and a relatively small amount of negative intrinsic rewards. Then we started getting positive and negative intrinsic rewards of small absolute values to bring the cumulative sum of intrinsic reward close to 0. As you mentioned, we needed intrinsic reward for exploration, but then we got nonzero extrinsic reward after exploration and the role of intrinsic reward should be reduced, which was accomplished by training our model P_K close to true P.\n\n* Fujimoto et al., \"addressing function approximation error in actor-critic methods\", 2018."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper544/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper544/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Model Ensemble-Based Intrinsic Reward for Sparse Reward Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Giseung Park", "Whiyoung Jung", "Sungho Choi", "Youngchul Sung"], "authorids": ["gs.park@kaist.ac.kr", "wy.jung@kaist.ac.kr", "sungho.choi@kaist.ac.kr", "ycsung@kaist.ac.kr"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Intrinsic Reward", "Dynamics Model", "Ensemble"], "TL;DR": "For sparse-reward reinforcement learning, the ensemble of multiple dynamics models is used to generate intrinsic reward designed as the minimum of the surprise.", "abstract": "In this paper, a new intrinsic reward generation method for sparse-reward reinforcement learning is proposed based on an ensemble of dynamics models.

For a particular ensemble element, an intrinsic reward is defined as a log-term that measures the deviation in prediction between a Gaussian mixture over all ensemble elements and the particular ensemble element (at the previous update period). The intrinsic reward signal applied in practice is the minimum of the aforementioned quantity w.r.t. all ensemble elements. The authors provide some theoretical motivation for their approach and validate their method in sparse-reward continuous robotics domains (Mujoco), using PPO as reference algorithm. Experiments are averaged over 10 seeds and compared against various other intrinsic reward baselines including PPO without intrinsic motivation. In these experiments, the method provided by the authors seems to dominate over competing approaches.\n\nQuality\n\nI find the quality low. First, while I appreciate that the authors try to provide some theoretical motivation for their method, there is quite a gap from theory to practice. The theory assumes that the world model is known and considers a stationary reward signal. In practice, the world model is approximated with the current network ensemble, a quantity that is changing over time yielding a non-stationary signal. Second, the experiments are conducted in a sparse-reward modification of Mujoco-type environments that are non-sparse by construction. Sparsity is introduced by accumulating instantaneous rewards over some time window before \"releasing\" them. This way of sparsifying rewards yields weird partial observability issues, e.g. the same state-action pair observed at the right moment in time yields significant reward whereas at the wrong moment in time yields no reward at all. Additionally, it is always guaranteed that there will be a reward signal at a certain frequency. There are probably better environments for studying the approach, like Atari for example. I do understand that the authors cite Oh et al. 2018 who apply the same technique of sparsification, but Oh et al. also conduct additional experiments in ALE.\n\nClarity\n\nThe paper is clearly written and easy to follow. On a side note, it could be stated more clearly that the presented approach is not model-based because no forward prediction is required for constructing intrinsic rewards (merely probability values are queried for observed transitions). There is one question I have though regarding the experiments where different intrinsic reward approaches are compared against each other. The paper states that all approaches normalize intrinsic rewards according to Equation (17)---why do all of them then need a different weighting factor \\beta as stated in the second paragraph of Section 3.3? Furthermore, since \\beta is fine-tuned for each intrinsic reward approach and each environment, can the authors please elaborate in detail how exactly this is accomplished (to ensure correct interpretability of the results)?\n\nOriginality\n\nThe originality is low. As stated by the authors, the proposed method is an incremental extension of Achiam and Sastry 2017 who proposed a similar method for non-ensemble methods.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe significance is low as well. The method's improvement over other intrinsic reward approaches is minor (the environments chosen by the authors are also not ideal). I feel the significance is reduced further by the fact that there are other model-based approaches that use models of the proposed kind for increasing sample-efficiency and performance considerably in non-sparse environments (e.g. Kurutach et al.2018).\n\nUpdate\n\nAfter reading the other reviews and the rebuttal, the concerns I have raised remain. I still feel this paper shouldn't be accepted to ICLR. However, given the extensive experimental analysis conducted by the authors, I feel a score of 1 from my side was too harsh.

The maximum and average method cannot give this tightest upper bound.\n\nAn intrinsic reward of 0 would provide the theoretically tightest bound in Proposition 1 (c=0), but our setting is that extrinsic reward is zero at the beginning of our training, so we cannot train our policy in this sparse-reward setting if we do not give any intrinsic reward.\n\nThe mean curves of accumulated intrinsic reward for our approach converge to 0 at the end. This observation is valid since as our ensemble models are trained, we get smaller expected KL divergence between true P and the ensemble P_K and its corresponding intrinsic reward.\n\nWhether a certain type of intrinsic reward is helpful for non-sparse reward environments depends on the intrinsic reward coefficient tuning as well as the type of certain intrinsic reward. Too big hyperparameter hindered the performance, and some fine-tuned hyperparameters can improve the performance in a non-sparse reward setting, as shown in the recent work (Leibfried, Pascual-Diaz, and Grau-Moya, \"A unified Bellman optimality principle combining reward maximization and empowerment\", 2019).\n\nWe did not use model-ensemble TRPO (Kurutach et al., 2018) in Figure 3 since this paper has a model-based setting while our paper proposes an intrinsic reward for model-free reinforcement learning. In other words, as Reviewer 1 pointed out, we do not require any forward prediction for constructing auxiliary reward as well as training policy. \n\nWe read the recommended paper (Hester and Stone, 2015) and we would like to appreciate your kind suggestion. We liked the idea of using two kinds of different intrinsic rewards as well as training our model with a random-forest based method.

The paper's results demonstrate that this approach out-performs other benchmark approaches across a set of continuous control tasks.\n\nI'm curious about the motivation for taking the min surprise across the ensemble. Eqs 8-11 seem to motivate that this will make a tighter gap between the expected cumulative returns of the optimal policy and the policy with additional intrinsic rewards. This implies that this will converge to the same policy in the end, but I'm not sure that it implies that this is a good exploration strategy, an intrinsic reward of 0 would provide an even tighter bound. When you used the max or average return, was the problem that there was still too much intrinsic reward for the agent to converge? Or that it wasn't exploring enough or in the right places?\n\nFor the experiments, it would be very interesting to see the intrinsic rewards accumulated over time for each approach. That plot could be very enlightening as to what is going on. \n\nIt would also be great to see the results on these tasks when they're not modified to be sparse reward. Is your method a big hindrance in that case? Or does it still help?\n\nYour intro claims that typical model-free RL is about the circumstance where the agent receives non-zero reward for every time step. This is not true, many model-free RL papers look at tasks that have sparse reward on some or many steps.  I would agree that in many continuous control problems, shaping rewards are added to ease the exploration problem. \n\nFor Figure 3, how does the model-ensemble TRPO (Kurutach et al) fit in? Is that algorithm represented by one of the curves?\n\nHere's one more related work deriving intrinsic rewards from an ensemble of trained dynamics models:\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370215000764"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper544/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper544/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Model Ensemble-Based Intrinsic Reward for Sparse Reward Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Giseung Park", "Whiyoung Jung", "Sungho Choi", "Youngchul Sung"], "authorids": ["gs.park@kaist.ac.kr", "wy.jung@kaist.ac.kr", "sungho.choi@kaist.ac.kr", "ycsung@kaist.ac.kr"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Intrinsic Reward", "Dynamics Model", "Ensemble"], "TL;DR": "For sparse-reward reinforcement learning, the ensemble of multiple dynamics models is used to generate intrinsic reward designed as the minimum of the surprise.", "abstract": "In this paper, a new intrinsic reward generation method for sparse-reward reinforcement learning is proposed based on an ensemble of dynamics models.
