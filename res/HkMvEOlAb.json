Pipeline: -Data are augmented with domain-specific transformations. For instance, in the case of MNIST, rotations with different degrees are applied. All data are then labelled as \"original\" or \"transformed by ...(specific transformation)\". -Classification task is performed with a neural network on augmented dataset according to the pseudo-labels. -In parallel of the classification, the neural network also learns the latent representation in an unsupervised fashion. -k-means clustering is performed on the representation space observed in the hidden layer preceding the augmented softmax layer. \n\nDetailed Comments:\n(*) Pros\n-The method outperforms the state-of-art regarding unsupervised methods for handwritten digits clustering on MNIST.\n-Use of ACOL and GAR is interesting, also the idea to make \"labeled\" data from unlabelled ones by using data augmentation.\n\n(*) Cons\n-minor: in the title, I find the expression \"unsupervised clustering\" uselessly redundant since clustering is by definition unsupervised.\n-Choice of datasets: we already obtained very good accuracy for the classification or clustering of handwritten digits. This is not a very challenging task.\nAnd just because something works on MNIST, does not mean it works in general. \nWhat are the performances on more challenging datasets like colored images (CIFAR-10, labelMe, ImageNet, etc.)?\n-This is not clear what is novel here since ACOL and GAR already exist. The novelty seems to be in the adaptation to GAR from the semi-supervised to the unsupervised setting with labels indicating if data have been transformed or not.\n\n\nMy main problem  was about the lack of novelty. The authors clarified this point, and it turned out that ACOL and GAR have never published elsewhere except in ArXiv.  The other issue concerned the validation of the approach on databases other than MNIST. The author also addressed this point, and I changed my scores accordingly.

Given that in many applications such parent-class supervised information is not available, the authors of this paper propose domain specific pseudo parent-class labels (for example transformed images of digits) to adapt ACOL for unsupervised learning.

We added the results of IMSAT (Hu et al., 2017) in Table 3 (Quantitative unsupervised clustering performance in terms of ACC score) for the comparison and revising the corresponding comments about this table. That is,\n\n\"Our approach statistically significantly outperforms all the contemporary methods that reported unsupervised clustering performance on MNIST except IMSAT (Hu et al., 2017) displaying very competitive performance with our approach, i.e. 98.32%(\u0006+/-0.08) vs. 98.40%(\u0006+/-0.40). However, results obtained on the SVHN dataset, i.e. 76.80%(\u0006+/-1.30) vs. 57.30%(\u0006+/-3.90), show that our approach statistically significantly outperforms IMSAT on this realistic dataset and defines the current state-of-the-art for unsupervised clustering on SVHN.\"\n\n2. We removed Table 4 (Quantitative unsupervised clustering performance in terms of NMI score) because, out of 9 approaches used for the performance comparison, only one of them reported NMI score. So, this table has been removed for the sake of simplicity as it introduces no further information than Table 3. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Hu et al., 2017] : Learning Discrete Representations via Information Maximizing Self-Augmented Training, \nauthor    = {Weihua Hu, Takeru Miyato, Seiya Tokui, Eiichi Matsumoto, Masashi Sugiyama},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning,\n               {ICML} 2017, Sydney, NSW, Australia, 6-11 August 2017}"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Latent Representations in Neural Networks for Clustering through Pseudo Supervision and Graph-based Activity Regularization", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised clustering approach exploiting the hidden information that is indirectly introduced through a pseudo classification objective.

We wanted to address the two specific comments on the approach being incremental and the number of datasets.\n\nBoth methods described in the article, ACOL and GAR are completely novel and this paper, if chosen for publication, will be the very first time they appear in peer-reviewed literature (a major reason why we chose ICLR).  Their adaptation to unsupervised settings \u2013 is also completely novel by extension with domain specific transformation a key factor in clustering performance.  \n\nIn this paper, we have actually used three (not one as suggested by the reviewer) image datasets MNIST, USPS and SVHN for comparison chosen primarily for uniformity and clarity between this article and many other recent ones published in conferences just like this one, ICLR, ICML, NIPS etc. MNIST and USPS datasets (hand-written digits) might be seen as simple datasets since the existing methods in the literature of clustering have already achieved very good performances on these two datasets. However, they are still used very commonly for benchmarks, especially on significantly different approaches such as the one proposed here.  More importantly, unlike semi-supervised and supervised settings, SVHN (a more realistic dataset with colored street view house numbers) still constitutes a very challenging task for unsupervised settings. This difficulty might be hard to observe in the first version of our paper as at the time of submission for ICLR 2018 we weren\u2019t able to find any other work studying this dataset.\n\nThanks to one of the commenters on the paper, we looked at IMSAT[1] as the previous state-of-art approach for clustering on SVHN, which was very recently published in ICML 2017 (a month before the submission deadline for ICLR \u2013 a reason why it wasn\u2019t included in the first version). They have also presented the performances of other approaches, such as DEC[2], on the challenging SVHN dataset. Please see the clustering performances of two approaches reported by IMSAT[1] compared to the proposed approach below:\n\nDEC: 11.9%(\u00b10.40) \nIMSAT: 57.3%(\u00b13.90) \nOur Approach: 76.8%(\u00b11.30) \n\nWe will include this new article and believe this comparison would further reinforce the state-of-the-art capability and accurateness of our approach on a multitude of datasets. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[1]: Learning Discrete Representations via Information Maximizing Self-Augmented Training, \nauthor    = {Weihua Hu, Takeru Miyato, Seiya Tokui, Eiichi Matsumoto, Masashi Sugiyama},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning,\n               {ICML} 2017, Sydney, NSW, Australia, 6-11 August 2017}\n\n[2]: Unsupervised Deep Embedding for Clustering Analysis},\n  author    = {Junyuan Xie, Ross B.

We wanted to address the comments where we thought the reviewer could use some clarification especially in regards to the novelty of the approach.\n\nIn response to choice of wording in title:\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that the word unsupervised can be removed from the title while preserving the same meaning.\n\nIn response to the choice of datasets: \n\nWe believe the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach on the SVHN dataset may not have been properly emphasized in the article.\n\nIn this paper, we used three image datasets (not just MNIST as suggested by the reviewer) MNIST, USPS and SVHN for comparison chosen primarily for uniformity and clarity between this article and many other recent ones published in conferences just like this one, ICLR, ICML, NIPS etc. MNIST and USPS datasets (hand-written digits) might be seen as simple datasets since the existing methods in the literature of clustering have already achieved very good performances on these two datasets. However, they are still used very commonly for benchmarks, especially on significantly different approaches such as the one proposed here.  More importantly, unlike semi-supervised and supervised settings, SVHN (a more realistic dataset with colored street view house numbers) still constitutes a very challenging task for unsupervised settings. This difficulty might be hard to observe in the first version of our paper as at the time of submission for ICLR 2018 we weren\u2019t able to find any other work studying this dataset.\n\nThanks to one of the commenters on the paper, we looked at IMSAT[1] as the previous state-of-art approach for clustering on SVHN, which was very recently published in ICML 2017 (a month before the submission deadline for ICLR \u2013 a reason why it wasn\u2019t included in the first version). They have also presented the performances of other approaches, such as DEC[2], on the challenging SVHN dataset. Please see the clustering performances of two approaches reported by IMSAT[1] compared to the proposed approach below:\n\nDEC: 11.9%(\u00b10.40) \nIMSAT: 57.3%(\u00b13.90) \nOur Approach: 76.8%(\u00b11.30) \n\nWe will include this new article and believe this comparison would further reinforce the state-of-the-art capability and accurateness of our approach. \n\nFinally, to the best of our knowledge, clustering on the datasets such as CIFAR-10, labelMe, ImageNet based on their raw pixel values is not a very common practice in the literature of clustering as raw pixels are not suited for this goal with color information being dominant [1]. Existing approaches perform the clustering on the extracted features from these datasets. However, this approach doesn\u2019t fit the proposed clustering technique in this paper, because transformations generating the pseudo classes are domain-specific and so they are directly applied on the input space. Therefore, generalizing the proposed clustering technique to these datasets requires an orthogonal challenge which we already identified as future work to study how to apply these domain-specific transformations that will present rich information for the clustering task at hand. \n\nIn response to the comments about novelty: \n\nWe don\u2019t think this comment \u2013 quote \u201cThis is not clear what is novel here since ACOL and GAR already exist. The novelty seems to be in the adaptation to GAR from the semi-supervised to the unsupervised setting with labels indicating if data have been transformed or not\u201d  reflects the reality as both methods ACOL and GAR are completely novel and this paper, if chosen for publication, will be the very first time they appear in peer-reviewed literature (a major reason why we chose ICLR).  Their adaptation to unsupervised settings \u2013 is also completely novel by extension with domain specific transformation a key factor in clustering performance.  \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[1]: Learning Discrete Representations via Information Maximizing Self-Augmented Training, \nauthor    = {Weihua Hu, Takeru Miyato, Seiya Tokui, Eiichi Matsumoto, Masashi Sugiyama},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning,\n               {ICML} 2017, Sydney, NSW, Australia, 6-11 August 2017}\n\n[2]: Unsupervised Deep Embedding for Clustering Analysis},\n  author    = {Junyuan Xie, Ross B.

MNIST and USPS datasets (hand-written digits) might be seen as simple datasets since the existing methods in the literature of clustering have already achieved very good performances on these two datasets. However, unlike for semi-supervised and supervised settings, SVHN (street view house numbers - more realistic) is still a difficult and unsolved problem for the clustering task.

But I think revisions are currently not allowed as the review process is ongoing. \n\nSo as a quick answer to your comment,  I can say that it's hard to observe any statistically significant differences between the performances of these two models on the MNIST dataset. That is, 98.4 (0.4) for IMSAT vs. 98.32%(\u00b10.08) for our approach. But the SVHN dataset provides a more solid basis of comparison. While IMSAT achieves 57.3 (3.9) clustering accuracy on SVHN, our approach outperforms IMSAT by achieving 76.80%(\u00b11.30). I think it's also worth noting the mechanical differences between these two approaches. For example, while IMSAT uses 960-dimensional GIST features for SVHN, our approach employs raw pixels (32x32x3). Besides, IMSAT uses VAT based (or RPT based) regularization while we adopt graph-based regularization.\n\nI think citing this work will further be helpful for the evaluation of our approach, as it also provides the performances of other approaches (like DEC) on the SVHN dataset.\n\nThank you very much for your feedback.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Latent Representations in Neural Networks for Clustering through Pseudo Supervision and Graph-based Activity Regularization", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised clustering approach exploiting the hidden information that is indirectly introduced through a pseudo classification objective.
