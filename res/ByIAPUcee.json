The authors propose to separate the attended vectors into key, value and prediction parts. The results suggest that this helps performance. The authors also found that a simple model which which concatenates recent activation vectors performs at a similar level as the more complicated attention-based models.\n\nThe experimental methodology seems sound in general. I do have some issues with the way the dimensionality of the vectors involved in the attention-mechanism is chosen. While it\u2019s good that the hidden layer sizes are adapted to ensure similar numbers of trainable parameters for all the models, this doesn\u2019t control for the fact that key/value/prediction vectors of a higher dimensionality may simply work better regardless of whether their dimensions are dedicated to one particular task or used together. This separation clearly saves parameters but there could also be benefits of having some overlap of information assuming that vectors that lead to similar predictions may also be required in similar contexts for example. Some tasks may also require more dimensions than others and the explicit separation prevents the model from discovering and exploiting this. \n\nWhile memory augmented RNNs and RNNs with attention mechanisms are not new, some of these architectures had not yet been applied to language modeling. Similarly (and as acknowledged by the authors), the strategy of separating key and value functionality has been proposed before, but not in the context of natural language modeling. I\u2019m not sure about the novelty of the proposed n-gram RNN because I recall seeing similar architectures before but I understand that novelty was not the point of that architecture as it mainly serves as a proof of the lack of ability of the more complicated architectures to do better. In that sense I do consider it an inventive baseline that could be used in future work to test the ability of other models that claim to exploit long-term dependencies. \n\nThe exact computation of the representation h_t was initially not that clear to me (the terms hidden and output can be ambiguous at times) but besides this, the paper is quite clear and generally well-written.\n\nThe results in this paper are important because they show that learning long-term dependencies is not a solved problem by any means. The authors provide a very nice comparison to prior results and the fact that their n-gram RNN is often at least competitive with far more complicated approaches is a clear indication that some of those methods may not capture as much context information as previously thought. The success of the separation of key/value/prediction functionality in attention-based system is also noteworthy although I think this is something that needs to be investigated more thoroughly (i.e., with more control for hyperparameter choices). \n\n\nPros:\nImpressive and also interesting results.\nGood comparison with earlier work.\nThe n-gram RNN is an interesting baseline.\n\n\nCons:\nThe relation between the attention-mechanism type and the number of hidden units weakens the claim that the key/value/prediction separation is the reason for the increase in performance somewhat.\nThe model descriptions are not entirely clear.\nI would have liked to have seen what happens when the attention is applied to a much larger context size.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Frustratingly Short Attention Spans in Neural Language Modeling", "abstract": "Current language modeling architectures often use recurrent neural networks.

We reduced the cell state vector dimensionality to maintain a stable number of total parameters. Note that it is not the case that standard attention mechanism is allowed to work with vectors that have three times more dimension, because we increase the number of dimension of h_t for Key-Value and Key-Value-Predict models. However, then we divided this vectors into key-value vectors (k, v) and into key-value-predict (k,v,p) vectors respectively. For example, in Figure 2c we have reported results on Wikipedia dataset. The hidden dimension for baseline LSTM model is 300, for Attention model is 296. The hidden dimension for Key-Value model is 560, but it is divided into key and value vectors which both have size 560/2 = 280. The hidden dimension for Key-Value-Predict model is 834 and it is divided into key, value and predict vectors. Each of them has size of 834/3 = 278. We chose the size of hidden dimension to ensure the same number of model parameters for a fairer comparison. \n\nWe also compared with higher dimensional hidden size of context vectors and found improvements with the same relative results.

Output vector h is divided into three equal parts: k, v, p (see Equation 11). Actually, there are two ways of implementing it. We can create 3 separate vectors k, v, p (each of them has dimension k), or create one output vector h which is a concatenation of k, v, p. To make this more clear, consider this example: The hidden dimension reported in the Figure 2c (denoted by k) is a dimension of the hidden output of the network. For example, the hidden dimension of the Key-Value-Predict models is 834 - which means that the dimension of vector h is 834 and the dimension of vectors k, v and p is 834/3 = 278. To ensure a comparable number of parameters for all models, we adjusted the hidden size of the networks such that all models have approximately the same number of parameters. \n\nRegarding the N-gram model description, we made a modification to clarify the model architecture. The idea is basically to split the output vector into N-1 different parts and use each of these for a different future time step. As you point out, a natural consideration is to compare this with attention models over the full past output vectors. The language modeling experiments on the Wikipedia corpus (Figures 2a, 2b) showed quite clear improvements in terms of perplexity when comparing this N-gram separation with a standard attention model over the full previous output vectors.\n\nThank you for pointing out these papers.

The maximum attention window of only length 15 also seems quite small (Figure 2a). Was there a reason you trained for only that many timesteps? Generally I've seen attention mechanisms work better the more history they have access to.\n\nIs it also possible to release your Wikipedia corpus earlier than later? Being able to view that would be useful as there's only so much about the pre-processing and set-up that can be described in the paper. It may also provide an insight into some of the behaviour of the models. The WikiText dataset, used in the Pointer Sentinel Mixture Model and Neural Language Models with a Continuous Cache papers, are based on Wikipedia as well and has shown that models effective in exploiting long range dependencies do better, though those works use a history of hundred or more and access memory using a pointer rather than weighted summation.\n\nFor the Wikipedia corpus, you cut the vocabulary to 77k words - was 77k an arbitrary number or a result of a certain frequency cut-off?\n\nYou also state in the conclusion that the results on the Wikipedia corpus and CBT show that key-value-predict decomposition outperform simpler attention mechanisms. While the results on your Wikipedia corpus show that, the results on the CBT corpus don't seem as definitive. The results of the attention model for example are quite similar to the key-value-predict model (though slightly better for named entities, slightly worse for verbs). Am I misreading those figures? I'd generally not consider the deltas between the models significant but also don't have substantial experience with the CBT dataset in the past."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Frustratingly Short Attention Spans in Neural Language Modeling", "abstract": "Current language modeling architectures often use recurrent neural networks.
