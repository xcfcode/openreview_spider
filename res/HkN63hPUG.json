Experiments show that the RNN approach, which considers the full SERP jointly, outperforms an approach that considers each result independently.\n\nThe paper is interesting and I think people at the conference would enjoy learning about this application of RNNs.  However, the paper is very densely packed, and the presentation of the methods is some combination of very hard to understand and erroneous.  Figure 1a says it is depicting an RNN, but it isn't (there is no RNN in that figure).  So I gather that Figure 1a is the \"featurizer\" shown on the lhs of Figure 1b.  This took me awhile to understand (and I may still be mistaken, because of course the figure captions say a completely different thing and never make the relationship between Figure 1a and 1b explicit).  I had a hard time following the description of the model, had to read it multiple times.  These issues with clarity make me lean toward the reject side unfortunately.\n\nMinor:\nI was unsure what the DNN baseline consisted of...does it use the same featurization as the RNN, just without the RNN?\nI found the explore/exploit discussion confusing, is this clickthrough model also being used to select and rank search results for the engine?\nReferences to figures in the text need parens around them, or some other kind of context.

The experimental results show the bidirectional network helps increase performance on both SERP level and document level. However, it is not verified whether the multi task objective improves performance on the separate task.\n\nOriginality:\nThe paper uses a standard featurizer for (query,doc) featurizing, but I have not seen Click and SERP click trained simultaneously. I am unaware if the approach of considering the whole SERP, when computing click probabilities, has been done before, but it is a very good idea and seems like a good way forward.\n\nSignificance:\nThere is potential to improve ranking models.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nPros:\nAppropriate model for problem.\nIt seems very likely that the use of multi task learning can provide an improvement in this area.\nNot looking at documents in isolation, but considering the whole SERP is a good idea.\n\nCons:\nExplanation of the figures should be redone.\nNo evaluation of whether the multi task learning actually improves the individual tasks.\nA better overview of the size of the data set used.\n\n \n\n\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "User-SERP Interaction Prediction through Deep Multi-task Learning", "abstract": "User behavior signals such as clicks are strong indicators of a search engine\u2019s performance.
