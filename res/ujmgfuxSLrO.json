DeLight is a deeper MLP of partially group-wise linear layers, which leads to parameter and potential compute savings. The authors show that their approach outperforms other transformer-like architectures with more parameters on machine translation and language modeling.\n\nThe results of the paper look encouraging at first glance but I have a couple of major concerns with this paper as it is right now: \n\n1) The paper's motivation is that parameter rich, wide and shallow models are problematic to train due their requirement of large training data or strong regularization. However, the authors use the same training setup for both delight and standard transformers on the same datasets, and results for standard transformers are just fine, though lacking a bit behind delight. In particular, the authors do not show that using delight significantly alleviates any of the mentioned problems. They do not show that it needs less data, nor that it is \"easier\" to regularize.\n\n2) The paper seems to suggest that using less parameters is better per-se, which I strongly disagree with. Especially with huge amounts of data the main driving factors for performance are compute + number of parameters. Making networks wider (instead of deep) has the advantage of massive parallel computation, which is always faster than deeper networks. That's one of the main reasons why RNNs are not used anymore in language. Furthermore, deeper models will have other issues such as storing many more activations which can result in memory bottlenecks.\n\n3) The paper misses to discuss the most important factor which is train efficiency. In other words, how much faster can delight lead to better results than standard transformers? Note, that \"larger models [can] train faster\" [1], which is especially the case given large enough datasets which is definitely the case for language modeling. Unfortunately, this study optimizes for and normalizes by number of parameters. However, it should normalize by on-device training time or at least the idealized training time in flops or MACS. Right now there are some MACS comparisons but they are just for a single forward pass, not total training, which is a bit meaningless. I would like to see a proper comparison of performance to training time/flops. The best way to do this study would be to control for total training time/flops.\n\nFinally, without showing a clear advantage in terms of training speed it is hard to judge the significance of this architectural block. I would also like to see how the differences progress when increasing the total compute equally for the vanilla transformer and delight. Will the gap between those widen or narrow the larger the models become? From my experience, the larger the models and datasets it is mostly the total compute that decides the performance, so I would actually expect the gap to become narrower.\n\nNow I realize that the operations required by DeLight are not well supported by current accelarators (and they probably won't be in the near future), because memory shuffling is very expensive on these devices. And that's why most of the significance of this work would rely on custom kernels or even hardware. The results presented by the paper, though good, are not convincing enough for me to suggest that this customization is necessary.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11794\n\n== UPDATE after rebuttal ==\n\nI am willing to update my recommendation to weak accept after the rebuttal. Some of my main concerns remain, but added experiments, comparisons and discussions alleviate some of those. I still believe that there is too much focus on fairly useless metrics such as number of parameters which might lead to future work that will follow this trend, but the results are overall strong enough to warrant acceptance.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2100/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2100/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DeLighT: Deep and Light-weight Transformer", "authorids": ["~Sachin_Mehta1", "~Marjan_Ghazvininejad1", "sviyer@fb.com", "~Luke_Zettlemoyer1", "~Hannaneh_Hajishirzi1"], "authors": ["Sachin Mehta", "Marjan Ghazvininejad", "Srinivasan Iyer", "Luke Zettlemoyer", "Hannaneh Hajishirzi"], "keywords": ["Transformers", "Sequence Modeling", "Machine Translation", "Language Modeling", "Representation learning", "Efficient Networks"], "abstract": "We introduce a deep and light-weight transformer, DeLighT, that delivers similar or better performance than standard transformer-based models with significantly fewer parameters.

DeLighT differs from the original transformer in the following ways:\n- a DeLighT transformation is performed before the self-attention \n- the self-attention is performed in a vector space with fewer dimensions and with only 1 head\n- the MLP\u2019s hidden layer is 16 times smaller \n- The DeLighT transformation, as far as I understand, is a sequence of block-sparse linear layers and permutations. The number of intermediate layers in DeLightT transformations is higher in the upper layers of the whole model. \n\nThe key claims of the paper are that DeLight performs as well as or better than Transformer, while being deep, having less parameters and involving fewer floating point operations. With regard to depth, I don\u2019t think that depth can be the goal in and of itself, it is the means for achieving good performance. I think the paper puts too much emphasis on DeLight depth. I also find it rather controversial that the depth in the paper counts all linear layers, and not just the number of nonlinearities between the input and the output.\n\nDeLighT does seem to have a consistent edge over the original Transformer model in terms of both performance and memory footprint. Compared to TransformerXL and EvolvedTransformer, DeLighT performs on par, but has less parameters. The set of experiments performed to assert DeLighT strengths is quite extensive.  The experimental side of paper appears technically sound. \n\nIt is important to build more efficient and compact models, but I find the paper\u2019s analysis of models computational demands rather incomplete. If computational efficiency is the main focus of the paper (and it appears to be), it would be great to see some analysis of how much time and memory is required for model training and inference. Is the model size the dominating factor here? \n\nOverall, the architecture ends up being quite complicated. The supplementary material contains an extensive set of ablations justifying many of the complexities, but I find that a few straight-forward remain unanswered:\n- how does DeLighT compare to a Transformer with one head\n- how does DeLighT compare to a Transformer with a narrow MLP\n- what about both above modifications? \nI think it is important for the paper to justify the use of the DeLighT layer. \n\nWith regard to writing, the paper is generally quite clear and accurately done. A few places raised my eyebrows: \n- \u201cSince the DeLighT block learns wider representations of the input using the DeLighT transformation, it enables us to replace multi-head attention with single-head attention\u201d - I think the causation here is not obvious and needs to be proven. Or the wording should be changed to illustrate that this is just your intuition.\n- \u201cThis is likely because scaling model width and depth allocates parameters uniformly across blocks, which may lead to learning redundant parameters.\u201d - same, I think it is important to state that this is a hypothesis\n- I think the \u201cinput mixer\u201d layer and how it widens the state should be discussed in the main text. Otherwise the role of w_m is completely unclear. \n\nThe paper\u2019s novelty appears quite limited. DeLightT layers seem similar to the DeFINE layer. The difference is not sufficiently explained neither in the main text nor in the appendix. Overall it seems that the paper takes existing components and does a lot of tweaking to yield a better model with good performance. \n\nIt is hard to make a call in the case of this paper. \nPros:\n- the final moment model does deliver some improvement\n- the execution is quite accurate\nCons:\n- the paper feels very incremental \n- the papers leaves an impression that its key goals could be achieved in a simpler way\n- compute time and runtime memory footprint are not discussed. \n\nUPD: the score was updated after the rebuttal stage.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2100/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2100/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DeLighT: Deep and Light-weight Transformer", "authorids": ["~Sachin_Mehta1", "~Marjan_Ghazvininejad1", "sviyer@fb.com", "~Luke_Zettlemoyer1", "~Hannaneh_Hajishirzi1"], "authors": ["Sachin Mehta", "Marjan Ghazvininejad", "Srinivasan Iyer", "Luke Zettlemoyer", "Hannaneh Hajishirzi"], "keywords": ["Transformers", "Sequence Modeling", "Machine Translation", "Language Modeling", "Representation learning", "Efficient Networks"], "abstract": "We introduce a deep and light-weight transformer, DeLighT, that delivers similar or better performance than standard transformer-based models with significantly fewer parameters.

The work [1] that you are referring to uses a large training set. However, many NLP applications do not have such large corpora.

This layer uses matrix multiplication operations to transform a N-dimensional vector to M-dimensional vector. There has been a significant effort from industry, especially NVIDIA, to optimize this operation and in general, hardware specific kernels are also released to support architectural changes in hardware (e.g., matrix multiplication on tensor cores). Please see CUTLASS and cuBLAS library, for example. Though these efforts are generic, NLP models, especially Transformers, significantly benefited from them.\n\n**Optimizing multi-head attention:** There is a significant effort from industry to optimize multi-head attention unit. For example, see the APEX library from NVIDIA.\n\n**Scaling transformer models:** Again, there is a significant effort from industry in scaling the transformer models and allowing training on extremely large corpora. Examples include Megatron from NVIDIA, Fairseq from Facebook, and DeepSpeed from Microsoft. Note that training such large models (e.g., Megatron) is yet infeasible in academic environment.\n\nSuch engineering efforts won't be noticeable with existing deep learning frameworks, which integrates most of these developments in the backend and allows users to access these structures using simple APIs (e.g., torch.nn.MultiheadAttention). For example, multi-head attention kernel from APEX is part of PyTorch v1.7.0 now.\n\n[R1] CUTLASS and cuBLAS Library: https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass and https://developer.nvidia.com/cublas\n\n[R2] APEX: https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex/tree/master/apex/contrib/multihead_attn\n\n[R3] Megatron from NVIDIA: https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM\n\n[R4] Fairseq from Facebook: https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00187\n\n[R5] DeepSpeed from Microsoft: https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed\n\n=========================================================================================\n\n**Regarding DeLighT**: The basic building block of DeLighT is a group linear transformation and at the core of it is also a dense matrix multiplication. In these transformations, small fully-connected layers are applied to non-overlapping subset of inputs. In our experiments (for research purposes), we used a solution that reshapes and transposes the tensor and is shown below (all operations are supported by current frameworks and hardwares). However, in a dedicated CUDA kernel, each subset can be processed in parallel and would increase the work done per thread, leading to faster computation. Let us assume that we want to transform a 512-dimensional input to 1024-dimensional. In case of a standard fully connected layer, this involves multiplying a 512-dimensional vector with a large dense matrix of size 512x1024. In case of a group linear transformation with 8 groups, this means we need to use 8 ``dense matrices\" of size 64x128. All of these matrices can be processed using the same CUDA kernel. This would lead to (1) increased work done per thread, which will improve the GPU occupancy, (2) reduced memory footprint because reshape and transpose operations will no longer be required, and (3) faster training and inference because of fewer kernel launches.\n\n```python\n\nimport torch\n\ndef glt_function(x, n_groups, weights, bias=None):\n    '''\n    :param x: Input tensor of size [B x N], where B is batch size and N is input dimension\n    :param n_groups: number of groups in GLT\n    :param weights: glt weights [g x N/g x M/g]\n    :param bias: GLT bias (optional) of size [g x B x M/g]\n    :return: output tensor of size [B x M]\n    '''\n    bsz = x.size(0)\n    # [B x N] --> [B x g  x N/g]\n    x = x.contiguous().view(bsz, n_groups, -1)\n    # [B x g x N/g] --> [g x B  x N/g]\n    x = x.transpose(0, 1)  # transpose so that group is first\n    # [g x B  x N/g] x [g x N/g x M/g] --> [g x B x M/g]\n    x = torch.bmm(x, weights)  # multiply with Weights\n    # add bias\n    if bias is not None:\n        x = torch.add(x, bias)\n    # [g x B x M/g] --> [B x g x M/g]\n    x = x.transpose(0, 1)  # transpose so that batch is first\n    # [B x g x M/g] --> [B x M]\n    x = x.contiguous().view(bsz, -1)\n    return x\n\n```"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2100/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2100/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DeLighT: Deep and Light-weight Transformer", "authorids": ["~Sachin_Mehta1", "~Marjan_Ghazvininejad1", "sviyer@fb.com", "~Luke_Zettlemoyer1", "~Hannaneh_Hajishirzi1"], "authors": ["Sachin Mehta", "Marjan Ghazvininejad", "Srinivasan Iyer", "Luke Zettlemoyer", "Hannaneh Hajishirzi"], "keywords": ["Transformers", "Sequence Modeling", "Machine Translation", "Language Modeling", "Representation learning", "Efficient Networks"], "abstract": "We introduce a deep and light-weight transformer, DeLighT, that delivers similar or better performance than standard transformer-based models with significantly fewer parameters.

However, we disagree with your statement ``\"With huge amounts of data the main driving factors for performance are compute + number of parameters\". As an example, ALBERT shows that BERT-level performance can be achieved with fewer parameters. For example, on the SQUAD dataset, ALBERT improves the performance of BERT-Large by about 2 points, yet with fewer parameters (ALBERT: 235 M; BERT: 334 M). Similarly, there is a lot of work in other ML related sub-fields, especially computer vision where it has been shown that deeper networks with better transformation functions (depth-wise convolution in MobileNets vs. standard convolution in ResNets) yields similar or better performance compared to heavy-weight and wider networks (e.g., ResNet and Wide-ResNet), that too with fewer parameters and low latency. \n\nSimilar to these related fields, we also show that better transformation functions can help achieve better performance with fewer parameters and operations. Also, some NLP corpora are low-resource (e.g., En-Ro dataset that was studied in the paper). Therefore, it is important to have networks that scales well on low-, medium-, and high-resource corpora. Also, we hope that our efforts in designing light-weight and efficient models would be impactful and valuable to the community, especially resource constrained devices. \n\nWe would like to highlight that there is a significant ENGINEERING effort that has led to the scalability of Transformers and we believe that DeLighT would also benefit from such efforts. \n\n[r1] ALBERT: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11942\n\n[r2] MobileNetv2: https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381\n\n[r3] ResNet: https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385\n\n[r4] Wide-ResNet: https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07146\n\n[r5] BERT: https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2100/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2100/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DeLighT: Deep and Light-weight Transformer", "authorids": ["~Sachin_Mehta1", "~Marjan_Ghazvininejad1", "sviyer@fb.com", "~Luke_Zettlemoyer1", "~Hannaneh_Hajishirzi1"], "authors": ["Sachin Mehta", "Marjan Ghazvininejad", "Srinivasan Iyer", "Luke Zettlemoyer", "Hannaneh Hajishirzi"], "keywords": ["Transformers", "Sequence Modeling", "Machine Translation", "Language Modeling", "Representation learning", "Efficient Networks"], "abstract": "We introduce a deep and light-weight transformer, DeLighT, that delivers similar or better performance than standard transformer-based models with significantly fewer parameters.

We used the hyper-parameters in the Fairseq repository for training attention-based models (as noted in Section 4.1; Architecture), with an exception to learning rate. Following Vaswani et al., we also scaled learning rate linearly to train models at different model dimension. We will clarify this in the paper.

Most reviewers commented on the computational efficiency. We first address the comments related to computational efficiency here and then address reviewer specific comments.\n\nFor an apples-to-apples comparison, we implemented transformer unit without NVIDIA's dedicated CUDA kernel, and trained both transformer and DeLighT full-precision networks for 30K iterations on 16 NVIDIA V100 GPUs. **The transformer (67M parameters; 39.2 BLEU) and DeLighT (54M parameters; 40.5 BLEU) models took about 37 and 23 hours for training, respectively**. Significant engineering efforts from industry, such as dedicated CUDA kernels, have enabled very fast training of Transformers. DelighT doesn't yet benefit from dedicated CUDA kernels. For the same set-up, the transformer model with dedicated CUDA kernel took around 16 hours. \n\nThe main building block of DeLighT is group linear transformation, which can be parallelized. Similar to depth-wise convolutions in computer vision, group linear transformations (GLTs) can be parallelized. The solution that we used to implement GLT in this paper first splits the input into groups using reshaping and transpose functions (grouping function). Batch-wise matrix multiplication is then applied on each group to learn representations. Those groups are then combined with reshaping and transpose function (ungrouping function). To demonstrate that dedicated CUDA kernels can help improve the speed of DeLighT network, we implemented grouping and ungrouping functions with dedicated CUDA kernels. This decreased the training time from **23 hours to 19 hours**. Note that grouping, linear transformation, feature shuffling, and ungrouping can be implemented efficiently using a single CUDA kernel (e.g., ShuffleNetv2 uses a single CUDA kernel for shuffling and grouping). In future, we plan to implement a dedicated CUDA kernel for GLT using NVIDIA's general matrix multiplication library (CUTLASS). We believe that with a dedicated CUDA kernel for GLT, DeLighT would be much faster both during training and inference. \n\n[r1] ShuffleNetv2: https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11164\n\n[r2] CUTLASS: https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2100/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2100/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DeLighT: Deep and Light-weight Transformer", "authorids": ["~Sachin_Mehta1", "~Marjan_Ghazvininejad1", "sviyer@fb.com", "~Luke_Zettlemoyer1", "~Hannaneh_Hajishirzi1"], "authors": ["Sachin Mehta", "Marjan Ghazvininejad", "Srinivasan Iyer", "Luke Zettlemoyer", "Hannaneh Hajishirzi"], "keywords": ["Transformers", "Sequence Modeling", "Machine Translation", "Language Modeling", "Representation learning", "Efficient Networks"], "abstract": "We introduce a deep and light-weight transformer, DeLighT, that delivers similar or better performance than standard transformer-based models with significantly fewer parameters.

While much effort has been spent on up-scaling, it is also important to question these basic design heuristics.\n\nThis work does just that and presents a more parameter-efficient Transformer variant by combining existing techniques (GLT, Mehta et al, 2018; Channel Shuffling, Zhang et al. 2018) and exploring some known trade-offs (feedforward net ratio, nheads vs dhead) under the new architecture. The resulting model, DeLighT, while more complicated to describe, performs on par with the original Transformer with far fewer trainable parameters. The ablation studies seem thorough and most design choices are more or less accounted for.\n\nMy main concern is the complete absence of any discussions on time-efficiency, or latency. The only reference I could find is in the conclusion: \u201cwe expect a dedicated CUDA kernel for DeLighT units to be much more efficient, both in terms of speed as well as memory during forward and backward passes.\u201d This implies that the current implementation might not be efficient speed-wise. However, even after excluding the benefits from CUDA kernels, this new architecture appears to be less parallelizable as it is significantly deeper than other Transformer variants. This is crucial as neural network accelerators are becoming increasingly available, even in edge devices. Before fully recommending this paper for acceptance, I\u2019d like to see more discussions on how the proposed changes affect latency, a latency benchmark against other relevant Transformer variants, especially with parallelism, and some concrete statements regarding latency in the abstract and the conclusion. I would still consider this work valuable even if the result on latency is not strongly positive, but the work seems incomplete without any discussions of it.\n\nMinor issues:\n1)     In table 4, Delight has a context length of 480.

Stacked group-linear-transformation (GLT) are applied on input of each layer to perform dimension growth and then reduction. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. Experiments demonstrate the propose architecture matches or improves the performance of baseline Transformers with fewer parameters.\n\nAlthough the proposed architecture has fewer MACs, it would be interesting to know the real decoding time. Deep models could reduce model size or improve performance, but layers have to be executed consecutively and may slow down decoding in practice especially when using deep decoders. I\u2019m also curious about the performance when keeping decoders unchanged.\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2100/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2100/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DeLighT: Deep and Light-weight Transformer", "authorids": ["~Sachin_Mehta1", "~Marjan_Ghazvininejad1", "sviyer@fb.com", "~Luke_Zettlemoyer1", "~Hannaneh_Hajishirzi1"], "authors": ["Sachin Mehta", "Marjan Ghazvininejad", "Srinivasan Iyer", "Luke Zettlemoyer", "Hannaneh Hajishirzi"], "keywords": ["Transformers", "Sequence Modeling", "Machine Translation", "Language Modeling", "Representation learning", "Efficient Networks"], "abstract": "We introduce a deep and light-weight transformer, DeLighT, that delivers similar or better performance than standard transformer-based models with significantly fewer parameters. DeLighT more efficiently allocates parameters both (1) within each Transformer block using the DeLighT transformation, a deep and light-weight transformation and (2) across blocks using block-wise scaling, that allows for shallower and narrower DeLighT blocks near the input and wider and deeper DeLighT blocks near the output. Overall, DeLighT networks are 2.5 to 4 times deeper than standard transformer models and yet have fewer parameters and operations. Experiments on benchmark machine translation and language modeling tasks show that DeLighT matches or improves the performance of baseline Transformers with 2 to 3 times fewer parameters on average.
