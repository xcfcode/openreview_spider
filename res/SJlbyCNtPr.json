I will keep my score.\n----------------------------------------\nSummary\nIn this paper, the author proposes LLQL (Locally Linear Q-Learning), which separates the action design from prediction models, such that the model can have short-term and long-term goals. The short-term network takes the current state and the action, and predicts the next state (to be specific, the status change) under the assumption that the output is linear to the action. The long-term network takes the current state as input, controls the controller to take action, and also optimizes a Q-function. I lean to vote for accepting this paper, though the experiment part can be further improved.\nStrengths\n- The proposed model is novel, which can take a trajectory or a constraint as a short-term goal. As a result, we can control the behavior of the model easily. Otherwise, we have to design a new reward function to guide our model indirectly. As the authors showed in Tables 1 & 2, LLQL outperforms this approach.\n- The paper is clearly written. The author provides clean formulas throughout the paper, which makes the paper easy to understand.\nWeaknesses\nMore experiments can be conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of LLQL.\n- Only tested in one scenario. In the main text, though it is already very long, there are still only experiments in one scenario (i.e., Mountain Car).\n- Only compared to one baseline. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of LLQL taking a short-term trajectory or constraint, the authors compared it to only one method (i.e., DDPG) with a few manually designed reward function.\nMinor\nEquation 6 looks incorrect to me.\nPossible Improvements\nAs mentioned before, it would be great to include more experiments in the main text, comparing LLQL to more baselines, testing LLQL in more scenarios, or doing some ablation studies (removing one part of LLQL to demonstrates the effectiveness of that part).", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper883/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper883/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Long-term planning, short-term adjustments", "authors": ["Hamed Khorasgani", "Chi Zhang", "Chetan Gupta", "Susumu Serita"], "authorids": ["hamed.khorasgani@hal.hitachi.com", "chi.zhang@hal.hitachi.com", "chetan.gupta@hal.hitachi.com", "susumu.serita@hal.hitachi.com"], "keywords": ["Deep Reinforcement Learning", "Control"], "TL;DR": "This paper proposes a new deep reinforcement learning algorithm that can be easily adjusted to achieve new short-term goals without retraining the network.

We modified the paper based the comments as follows.", "comment": "1- We agree with the reviewer that the short-term model is our estimation of the system dynamic, and the long-term model is our estimation of value function + advantage function. We name these models in our approach \u201cshort-term prediction model\u201d and \u201clong-term prediction model\u201d to emphasize on their role in our hybrid solution, which are realized as deep neural networks. With the purpose of naming each model with the functionalities, we do not aim to claim they are novel networks. The novelty and contribution of our work is to propose a new framework which combines the system dynamic model (short-term predictive model) and the Q-learning (long-term predictive model) to achieve short-term and long-term goals simultaneously. We clarified this point in the paper as \n \u201cIn this paper, we present a Locally Linear Q-Learning (LLQL) algorithm for continuous action space. The LLQL includes a short-term prediction model, a long-term prediction model, and a controller. The short-term prediction model represents a locally linear model of the dynamic system, while the long-term prediction model represents the value function + a locally linear advantage function. The controller uses the short-term prediction model and the long-term prediction model to generate actions that achieve short-term and long-term goals simultaneously. It adopts a policy that maximizes Q-value while achieving short-term goals. The LLQL algorithm has the following advantages:\n\u2022 It does not require designing sensitive reward functions for achieving short-term and long-term goals concurrently.\n\u2022 It shows better performance in achieving short-term and long-term goals compared to the traditional reward modification methods.\n\u2022 It is possible to modify the short-term goals without time-consuming retraining.\u201d\n\n2-We chose the Mountain Car to evaluate our approach because it clearly shows the necessity of considering long-term goals as the car must go in opposite direction in the beginning to gain enough momentum to reach the top of the mountain. In many other examples, a simple MPC method which only considers short-term gains can also deliver long-term goals.  We added an experiment based on model-based reinforcement learning to show this in the revised version of the paper. \nThe second case study in the paper (the crane system) is based on a simulator developed for real world applications in our company, and based the LLQL promising results, we plan to apply it in the operation. We had to put the crane case study in the appendix as we were out of space and we did not want to cut more important theoretical parts of the paper.\nThe motivation of our work comes from industrial applications such as crane control, where the emphasis is not exactly the same as cases such as MuJoCo where the most interesting cases are often in high DoFs and complicated system dynamics, but relatively simpler goal. In our cases, we aim to have complicated goals while the system dynamics are relatively straightforward. We agree that it will be interesting to apply our proposed method to MuJoCo environment where both the system and the goal are complicated. Unfortunately, when we were writing the paper our company did not have purchased the commercial licenses for MuJoCo, and therefore, we couldn\u2019t test our algorithm on MuJoCo tasks. We have started the process to gain the license to further test and validate our solution. \n\n3- We have updated Figure 3-5 to include DDPG as a model-free reinforcement learning baseline, and a model-based reinforcement learning baseline presented in (Nagabandi et al 2018). We also updated Table 1 and Table 2 to include the model-based RL baseline.\nThe model-based reinforcement learning baseline struggles to achieve the long-term goal as for the mountain car immediate gains does not guarantee long-term success, and the model-free reinforcement learning baseline cannot deliver short-term goal as they are hard to be captured in a solution highly rewarded by the long-term goal.  The advantage of the LLQL is that by using both the system dynamic model (short-term predictive model) and the Q-learning (long-term predictive model), it can bring us the best of both worlds.  \nOur solution algorithm is fundamentally different with safe-exploration problems, as they are designed for the training phase to guarantee safe exploration, but our proposed solution is applied during the application without retraining the model.  \n\n4- We have fixed equation (6).\n\n5-We have fixed the references based on the conference template. \n\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper883/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper883/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Long-term planning, short-term adjustments", "authors": ["Hamed Khorasgani", "Chi Zhang", "Chetan Gupta", "Susumu Serita"], "authorids": ["hamed.khorasgani@hal.hitachi.com", "chi.zhang@hal.hitachi.com", "chetan.gupta@hal.hitachi.com", "susumu.serita@hal.hitachi.com"], "keywords": ["Deep Reinforcement Learning", "Control"], "TL;DR": "This paper proposes a new deep reinforcement learning algorithm that can be easily adjusted to achieve new short-term goals without retraining the network.

It uses a short-term prediction model and a long-term prediction model to generate actions that achieve short-term and long-term goals simultaneously. The problem the paper seeks to solve is important. However, this paper has several issues.\n\nFirst, there seems to be an over-claim of the contribution. The proposed method is more like hybrid of model-based and model-free RL method. Specifically, the short-term prediction model is in fact the linearized dynamic system with system parameters modeled by deep neural networks, while the long-term prediction model is in fact different (state- and action-) value functions. For this reason, it is probably unnecessary to name them as \u201cshort-term network\u201d or \u201clong-term network\u201d, since they are simply the system model (or the model-based part) and the value functions (the model-free part).\n\nSecond, the proposed method is not sufficiently evaluated. It is only evaluated on the toy Mountain Car task (and the Crane system in supplementary material). In order to justify the performance of an RL algorithm for continuous action space, it should be at least evaluated on the set of MuJoCo tasks. \n\nThird, the proposed method is not sufficiently compared with different baselines. In Figures 3-5, the proposed LLQL algorithm is never compared to any baseline method, leaving it open whether it is actually better than earlier methods like DDPG. In Table 1, LLQL is compared to DDPG (a model-free method), and is shown to achieve better performance. However, this seems to be unfair because the proposed method is in fact a model-based RL algorithm. Therefore, it should at least compare to other model-based algorithms (and also other riche set of safe-exploration RL methods).\n\nOther comments:\n\u2022\tIn eqn. (6), \\gamma should be \\gamma^{i-k}?\n\u2022\tIn the paragraph after (8), \u201cQ-learning algorithms (16)\u2026\u201d is referring to a wrong equation (16) for Q-learning.

RL algorithms have shown promising results\nin solving complicated problems in recent years. However, their application on\nreal-world physical systems remains limited. Despite the advancements in RL\nalgorithms, the industries often prefer traditional control strategies. Traditional\nmethods are simple, computationally efficient and easy to adjust. In this paper,\nwe propose a new Q-learning algorithm for continuous action space, which can\nbridge the control and RL algorithms and bring us the best of both worlds. Our\nmethod can learn complex policies to achieve long-term goals and at the same time\nit can be easily adjusted to address short-term requirements without retraining.\nWe achieve this by modeling both short-term and long-term prediction models.\nThe short-term prediction model represents the estimation of the system dynamic\nwhile the long-term prediction model represents the Q-value. The case studies\ndemonstrate that our proposed method can achieve short-term and long-term goals\nwithout complex reward functions.", "pdf": "/pdf/fdc38b30158f0fba0f1704d2df1d77d2aeaedd23.pdf", "paperhash": "khorasgani|longterm_planning_shortterm_adjustments", "original_pdf": "/attachment/4158c859e3eb6bce467e7a36dfa7eea5115c0714.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkhorasgani2020longterm,\ntitle={Long-term planning, short-term adjustments},\nauthor={Hamed Khorasgani and Chi Zhang and Chetan Gupta and Susumu Serita},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJlbyCNtPr}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
