Yes apologies for the confusion. So there are 20 capsules with a dimension from 16 output channels in the last layer. The weights for the last fully connected layer are then W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{320x128}. I forgot to update the description and I will also amend the diagram to show that there is 20 capsules which output 16 dimensions each.\n\n\nQ2.  Table 1 is the contrastive loss for each model. Equation 3 used for AT&T and double margin loss from Equation 4 for LFW results.  \n\nQ3. I did try something like this. I used a weighted average between each pose vector where the weights are set by normalising pose activation parameters in 0-1, but it did not perform as well as using a fully-connected layer with dropout (with or without a learnable dropout rate).

The pose vectors of final capsule layers for each tower is concatenated and passed through a fully connected layer to calculate the embedding for each tower's input. Then a contrastive loss based on a distance metric is optimized for the embeddings. An interesting regularizer (?) is used which is a dropout based on Capsule activation for connecting last layer capsules to the fully connected layer. \n\nPros:\n\nThe literature review is rich and complete. In general authors explain details of the previous techniques as they use them too which is a good writing technique and improves the readability.\n\nBy utilizing Capsules authors avoid a rigorous preprocessing as it is common with the community. As I understand they do not even use face landmarks to align images.\n\nMeasured by the optimized loss, the proposed method achieves significant improvement upon baseline in the small At&t dataset.\n\nCons:\n\nThe contribution of this work is not on par with ICLR standard for conference papers. Specially since SDropCapsNet (the added dropout) is seems to be auxiliary (gives a slight boost only in LFW without double margin).\n\nThe method used for reporting results is unjustified and not compareable to prior work. For face verification, identification one should report at least an ROC curve based on a threshold on the distance or nearest neighbor identification results which are standards in the literature. Where as they only report the contrastive loss of their model and their own implementation of baselines and Figure 3 which does not clearly show any advantage for CapsNet Siamese networks.\n\n\nQuestion:\nThe architecture description for last layer is vague. In text 512 is mentioned as the input dimmension, 512 is 16*32, Figure 1 shows 9 features per capsule or 3x3 kernels over capsules where it has to be fully connected? Also it says last layer is 128 dimmension where the text implies it should be 20. Could you please explain the role of 20?\n\nIs table 1 the final contrastive loss achievable for each model?\n\nHave you tried just gating the pose parameters of last layer by their activation (multiply to the tanh) rather than using a stochastic dropout?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper429/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Siamese Capsule Networks", "abstract": "Capsule Networks have shown encouraging results on defacto benchmark computer vision datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR and smallNORB.

Results are reported on the small AT&T dataset and the LFW dataset. \n\nI like the direction that this paper is taking. The original Capsules work has been looking at fairly simple and small scale datasets, and the natural next step for this approach is to start addressing harder datasets, LFW being one of them. Also face verification is a natural problem to look at with Capsules.\n\nHowever, I think this paper currently falls short of what I would expect from an ICLR paper. First, the results are not particularly impressive. Indeed, SCN doesn't outperform AlexNet on LFW (the most interesting dataset in the experiments). Also, I'm personally not particularly compelled by the use of the contrastive loss as the measure of performance, as it is sensitive to the scaling of the particular representation f(x) used to compute distances. Looking at accuracy (as in other face verification papers, such as DeepFace) for instance would have been more appropriate, in my opinion. I'm also worried about how hyper-parameters were selected. There are A LOT of hyper-parameters involved (loss function hyper-parameters, architecture hyper-parameters, optimizer hyper-parameters) and not much is said about how these were chosen. It is mentioned that cross validation was used to select some margin hyper-parameters, but results in Table 1 are also cross-validation results, which makes me wonder whether hyper-parameters were tuned on the performance reported in Table 1 (which of course would be biased).\n\nThe paper is also pretty hard to read. I recognize that there is a lot of complicated literature to cover (e.g. prior work on Capsule Networks has introduced variations on various aspects which are each complicated to describe). But as it currently reads, I can honestly say that I'm not 100% sure what exactly was implemented, i.e. which components of previous Capsule Networks were actually used in the experiments and which weren't. For example, I wasn't able to figure out which routing mechanism was used in this paper. The paper would strongly benefit from more explicitly laying out the exact definition of SCN, perhaps at the expense of enumerating all the other variants of capsules and losses that previous work has used.\n\nFinally, regardless of the clarify of the paper, the novelty in extending Capsule Networks to a siamese architecture is arguably pretty incremental. This wouldn't be too much of a problem if the experimental results were strong, but unfortunately it isn't the case.\n\nIn summary:\n\nPros\n- New extension of Capsule Networks, tackling a more challenging problem than previous work\n\nCons\n- Novelty is incremental\n- Paper lacks clarity and is hard to read\n- Results are underwhelming\n\nFor these reasons, I'm afraid I can't recommend this paper be accepted.\n\nFinally, I've noted the following typos:\n- hinton1985shape => use proper reference\n- within in => within\n- that represent => that represents\n- a Iterated => an Iterated\n- is got => is obtained\n- followed two => followed by two\n- enocded => encoded\n- a a pair => a pair\n- such that to => such as to\n- there 1680 subjects => there are 1680 subjects\n- of varied amount => of the varied amount\n- are used many => are used in many\n- across the paper: lots of in-text references should be in parenthesis\n\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper429/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Siamese Capsule Networks", "abstract": "Capsule Networks have shown encouraging results on defacto benchmark computer vision datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR and smallNORB.
