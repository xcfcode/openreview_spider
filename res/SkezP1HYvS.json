This is achieved by adding a left diagonal matrix P and a right diagonal matrix Q to the standard message passing of GCN H\u2019 = sigma(AHW), as H\u2019(PAQHW); P and Q are parameterized based on the HW part (node features). Multihead attention and multi-hop versions are also derived. Connection of this formulation to the existing GAT method is also discussed. Empirical results on transductive node classification and inductive node classification are reported against state-of-the-arts.  \n\nOverall I feel that the novelty of the proposed method is quite limited. Adding a rescaling on each node seems a minor structural change based on existing GCN framework. Although the authors claim that the GAT method can be deemed as a special case of the proposed methods, the main contribution of inductive attention in GAT should not become a credit of the proposed method. Actually the empirical performance of the proposed method has only a small margin compared with the GAT, on the three node classification benchmark datasets, where the accuracies are around 80%, the improvement of the best version of the proposed methods is only around 0.3%, 0.7%, and 0.1%, respectively. This is somehow predictable since the proposed method does not exploit any extra useful information (such as graph structure) but simply base the new parameters on the existing components of the GCN message passing procedure. \n\nThe motivation of the paper is that the diffusion process on the graph should depend on the nodes\u2019 status and influence (for example, some opinion leader nodes should have an amplified spread than other nodes), while existing GCN dies bit examine such ``difference\u2019\u2019 between the nodes. However, the roles or status of the nodes in a network are usually unavailable in practice; and if they can be ever be inferred, one has to use structural clues, Unfortunately, the extra parameters added here, namely the matrix P, Q, are dependent only on the features of the nodes (namely HW part), but not the graph structures,  therefore I do not think such parametrization would lead to significant benefit in improving the diffusion process. Indeed,  the original Gat method (graph attention network) has already achieved adaptive aggregation of the neighborhood information, by learning an inductive attention function  based on the node features; therefore the authors claim that existing GCN \u201cignores the difference between nodes\u201d sounds very vague, since their new parameters are not capable enough to reflect \u201cnode differences\u201d either (as a function of the node features).\n\nSome minor comments \n(1)\tFigure~1 is not easy to read while it is supposed to visualize the main idea clearly in one picture\n(2)\tIs there proof that if multi-hop version is used, the results can be improved?\n(3)\tWhat is the extra number of parameters compared with the standard GCN message passing\uff1f"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1757/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1757/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Diagonal Graph Convolutional Networks with Adaptive Neighborhood Aggregation", "authors": ["Jie Zhang", "Yuxiao Dong", "Jie Tang"], "authorids": ["zhangjie.exe@gmail.com", "yuxdong@microsoft.com", "jietang@tsinghua.edu.cn"], "keywords": ["data mining", "graph convolutional networks"], "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and their variants have generalized deep learning methods into non-Euclidean graph data, bringing a substantial improvement on many graph mining tasks.

In this work, we present a new method named Diagonal Graph Convolutional Networks (DiagGCN) based on this idea. Importantly, one of the adaptive aggregation techniques\u2014the permutations of diagonal matrices\u2014used in DiagGCN offers a flexible framework to design GCNs and in fact, some of the most expressive GCNs, e.g., the graph attention network, can be reformulated as a particular instance of our model. Standard experiments on open graph benchmarks show that our proposed framework can consistently improve the graph classification accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.", "pdf": "/pdf/650c86ca5743103cc6445d224f8c96d2e791e48b.pdf", "paperhash": "zhang|diagonal_graph_convolutional_networks_with_adaptive_neighborhood_aggregation", "original_pdf": "/attachment/650c86ca5743103cc6445d224f8c96d2e791e48b.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nzhang2020diagonal,\ntitle={Diagonal Graph Convolutional Networks with Adaptive Neighborhood Aggregation},\nauthor={Jie Zhang and Yuxiao Dong and Jie Tang},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkezP1HYvS}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
