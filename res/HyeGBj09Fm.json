Given densely registered 4D implicit surfaces (volumes over time) for a structured scene, a neural-network based model is used to interpolate simulations for novel scene conditions (e.g. position and size of dropped water ball). The interpolation model composes two components -- given these conditions, it first regresses weights combining a set of precomputed deformation fields, and then a second model regresses dense volumetric deformation corrections -- these are helpful as some events are not easily modeled with a set of basis deformations. \n\nI found the paper hard to read at first, since the paper is heavy on terminology, only really understood what is going on when I went through the examples in the appendix, which are helpful and then on a second read the content was clear and appears technically correct. I would advise considering defining in more detail early the problem setup (e.g. Fig 13 was helpful), explain some of the variables in context. \n\nThis is primarily an application paper on simulating liquids in controlled scenes using nets and appears novel in that narrow domain. The specific way deformations are composed -- using v_inv to backwards correct basis deformations, following up the mixing of those with a correction model -- is intuitive and is also something I see for the first time. \n\nThe experimental results are sufficient for simulating liquids/smoke, except I would like to also see a comparison to using deformation field network only, without its predecessor. This was done for Fig 6, but would be nice to also see it numerically in ablation in Fig. 4. Another useful experiment would be to vary the number of bases and/or the resolution of the deformation correction network and see the effects. \n\nMore importantly, it would be very helpful is to try this approach for modeling deforming object and body shapes for which there are many datasets (e.g. Shapenet). Right now the implicit surface deformation model is only tested on liquids examples, which limits the impact to that specialist domain -- it's a bit more of a SIGGRAPH type of paper than ICLR. \n\n---- Post author feedback comment ---- \nI raised my rating to 7 as the paper itself is solid, main concern as another reviewer points out is it may be a bit too specialist for ICLR. If the AC decides to reject based on this fact I am ok with that as well. \n\nI think it would be helpful to add more ablation (deformation-only results for all cases) and experiments with different numbers of bases in the final version. If that's added it will strengthen the paper. \n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper70/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Generating Liquid Simulations with Deformation-aware Neural Networks", "abstract": "We propose a novel approach for deformation-aware neural networks that learn the weighting and synthesis of dense volumetric deformation fields.

While this is a good applied paper with a large variety of experimental results, there is a significant lack of novelty from a machine learning perspective. \n\n1. The primary novelty here is in the problem formulation (e.g., defining cost function etc.) where two networks are used, one for learning appropriate deformation parameters and the other to generate the actual liquid shapes. This is an interesting idea to generate the required training data and build a generalizable model. \n\n2.

The approach combines two networks for synthesizing 4D data that represents 3D physical simulations. Here the first network outputs an initial guess, and the second network adds details. The first network utilizes a set of precomputed deformations, while the weights can be set to generate different output shapes. The precomputed deformations are applied in a recurrent manner. The second network is a variant of STN. \n\nThe results are impressive from the perspective of the current abilities of deep neural networks. The synthesized simulations are not physically accurate, but with certain visual realism. Experimental results are sufficient. \n\nHowever, it is also necessarily to add more intuitions to the current approach. First, it would be good to discuss why the current network design is desired. For example, when designing the first network, can we also design another neural network that applies the deformation backwards and enforce some consistency to improve the results? Also, many simulations use adaptive sampling (high-resolution near the surface and low-residual in the interior). Can we use an adaptive grid-structure (say Octree) to increase the resolution? \n\nAlso, is there a simple setting so that the current network design generates accurate results. If not, would increase the number of pre-computed deformations improve the approximation. If so, what would be the optimal basis for $u_i$? What is the tradeoff between using more basis for the first network and increasing the complexity of the second network?\n\nFor visualization, it would also good to show the 3D grid.\n\nOverall, it is good paper to see at ICLR.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper70/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generating Liquid Simulations with Deformation-aware Neural Networks", "abstract": "We propose a novel approach for deformation-aware neural networks that learn the weighting and synthesis of dense volumetric deformation fields.
