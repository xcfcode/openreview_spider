The framing of this problem is a Lagrangian relaxation of a constrained minimization problem which takes the form of an RL problem itself, where the attacking agent\u2019s reward is the negative reward of the target agents plus a penalty (lambda, hyper-parameter) for choosing to attack. The attacking agent\u2019s action space is binary, attack or no attack.\n\nThe RL approach is compared with a random attack policy and two heuristic methods for attacking agents in games on the Atari benchmark.\n\nThe setting addressed in this work, where the attacker only learns whether/when to attack or not is a greatly simplified version of the full problem. It is (in my opinion, but feel free to correct me) likely that the type of perturbation also being learned has even greater potential, but is (obviously) much harder.\n\nAdditionally, although the authors mention this as future work, I think the co-training setting is particularly interesting. As the authors suggest, this could lead to more robust target agents, but additionally I wonder if the type and difficulty of attacks would vary as the target agent trains.\n\nBesides the (picky) complaints, I think the problem formulation is quite reasonable. Again, I find the larger problem extremely interesting, but perhaps this is far too intractable right now. The formulation is straightforward, so while I recognize it as a contribution, it is not a particularly large one.\n\nOn the other hand, the experimental results appear somewhat weak to me. \n\nIf you vary the lambda parameter (as in Table 1, but for all games) you should be able to get similar line plots in Figure 5&6 for the RL approach, which would give a much better comparison for the trade-offs as you get for the heuristic methods. I think this comparison would be very interesting and strengthen the existing results in those figures.\n\nThe results, currently, do not appear very significant because (1) the gap between the RL solution and the heuristics is very small and (2) these *appear* to be single runs without standard deviations displayed. Can you argue for why these results *are* in fact significant (statistically or otherwise)?\n\nAnother question raised by the results is how performance of the attacking policy varies with training. The authors point out that the training is quite small compared to the target policy, but is that because it has already found the best solution it can in that time? How would it improve with more training?\n\nSmall note on Figure 7, I think the point for these would be better made by normalizing the respective histograms.\n\nUpdate:\n\nThank you for your responses and updating with new results. I think these provide a much better picture of the performance of the RL-based system. Although I am revising my score upward, I still think this is generally a rejection. Obviously I still think the full problem is interesting, but even the key step identification problem would be publishable if the performance was improved or further analysis helped me understand why RL is not doing better (since the heuristics are after all just heuristics).

[. . .] but additionally I wonder if the type and difficulty of attacks would vary as the target agent trains.\n**Response**\nWe agree that learning the type of perturbation is an interesting direction and may lead to stronger attacks. Our work focuses more on the learnability of key steps, which is unexplored in previous studies. In order to have fair comparisons against previous methods, we fix the perturbation generation part as a subroutine. We would consider further generalizations in the future.\n\n\n**Comment**\nIf you vary the lambda parameter (as in Table 1, but for all games) you should be able to get similar line plots in Figure 5&6 for the RL approach, [. . .] The results, currently, do not appear very significant because (1) the gap between the RL solution and the heuristics is very small and (2) these appear to be single runs without standard deviations displayed. Can you argue for why these results are in fact significant (statistically or otherwise)?\n**Response**\nThank you for the suggestion. We have run more experiments with different $\\lambda$, and updated the results in Section 4.2 and 4.3. Figure 5 and Figure 6 plot the mean score with one standard deviation.\n\nOut method do not incorporate human knowledge, but is able to perform comparably to heuristics across different attack ratios consistently, and achieves superior performances in some environments. For example, we observe significant improvements in Pong. These results demonstrate that the attacker trained by our framework learns effective key steps and has the potential to outperform human-designed heuristics.\n\n\n**Comment**\nAnother question raised by the results is how performance of the attacking policy varies with training. The authors point out that the training is quite small compared to the target policy, but is that because it has already found the best solution it can in that time? How would it improve with more training?\n**Response**\nWe choose a rather small training budget due to limited computation resources. Empirically, we observe that if $\\lambda$ is set in an appropriate range, the attack policy often converges in 10M training steps. We have provided more details during training in Appendix (Figure 8). We do not exclude the possibility that the attack policy might improve if given more training steps."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1568/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1568/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["r07922080@csie.ntu.edu.tw", "htlin@csie.ntu.edu.tw"], "title": "Learning Key Steps to Attack Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents", "authors": ["Chien-Min Yu", "Hsuan-Tien Lin"], "pdf": "/pdf/1a61553c45bb2e8d51ccdb700d8921e2984ea1a0.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a novel reinforcement learning framework where an attacker can learn more effective key steps to attack the reinforcement learning agent.", "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning agents are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks.

We have run more experiments and updated a new version. Responses to your comments are listed below:\n\n**Comment**\nOne major limitation of the work is that the attack rate is not readily modifiable. [. . .]\nMore importantly, there is no clear relationship between the value of lambda and the attack rate. With the same lambda, depending on the game, the opponent settles on attack rates varying between 10% (on pong) and 70% (on Riverraid).\n**Response**\nWe agree that our framework does not have direct control on the attack rate, since we replace the hard constraint with a soft penalty parameter. However, we do observe some similar trends in the new experiment results:\n- In the same environment, training with smaller $\\lambda$ usually would find attack policies with higher attack rates.\n- Across different environments, setting $\\lambda$ around the same order of magnitude as *potential reward loss* (see Section 4.3) tends to produce stable results.\n\nOur results suggest that we should choose $\\lambda$ carefully in order to learn effective key steps. We will consider the problem of controlling attack rates as a direction for future improvements.\n\n**Comment**\nThe results themselves show only marginal improvement over the baselines, and in the absence of clear error bars / confidence intervals, it is difficult to state the significance of the method. In the particular case of Space Invaders (figure 5b), the proposed method seems tied to the best heuristic (at attack-rate 70%), but the said heuristic reaches the same performance level for much lower attack-rate (as low as 40-50%), [. . .]\n**Response**\nThank you for the suggestion. We have tested more $\\lambda$ and provided the confidence bounds. By setting an appropriate penalty parameter $\\lambda$, our method is also able to find attack policy with low attack rate (40-50%) in Space Invaders (see Figure 5b). Although the amount of improvement depends on the environment, we find that\n- Key steps are learnable.\n- Our approach shows comparable performance to competitors across different attack ratios consistently.\n- It is possible to learn more effective key steps using our approach.\n\n\n**Comment**\nIn equation (2), you present a target objective function designed using Lagrange relaxation. However, the RL algorithm uses decay (\\gamma = 0.99), which means that the resulting function that is effectively minimized is different. Could you clarify the impact of the decay on the lagrange-relaxed objective function?\n**Response**\nThank you for pointing this out. We agree that the decay changes the minimization problem a little bit. The added decay has similar effects as in the original RL setting. Since the uncertainty of the future may not be fully captured by the current state, the decay could make the attacker emphasize short-term reward loss (of the target agent) more than delayed reward loss. We would consider investigating the decay more in future work.\n\n**Comment**\nCould you clarify a bit the section 4.3 on black-box attacks? [...] Is the attack robust to differences in the algorithm?\n**Response**\nThank you for the question. We take the substitute agent from pretrained DQN agent in Dopamine. They are trained with the same architecture as the target agent but with different random seeds. We have updated the paper to clarify these details.\n\nI'm a bit unsure about what you mean by \u201cIs the attack robust to differences in the algorithm\u201d. If you mean the robustness of black-box attack in different scenarios, this problem has been studied in [1]. Our setting is the same as \"Transferability Across Policies\" in their work (Section 5.3.1). While not tested, we believe that our framework is applicable in other black-box settings, since we do not have any assumption on the adversarial attack algorithm.\n\n[1] Sandy Huang, Nicolas Papernot, Ian Goodfellow, Yan Duan, and Pieter Abbeel. Adversarial attacks on neural network policies. 2017.\n\n**Comment**\nFinally, I'm a bit surprised by the choice of DQN as the base algorithm, especially since the chosen framework (Dopamine), offers significantly stronger algorithms (Rainbow or IQN). [. . .] Did you try to apply this method on more robust policies?\n**Response**\nThe main reason that we choose DQN is for computation efficiency. Another reason is that we do not want to complicate the perturbation generation procedure. Given that the network structure of Rainbow/IQN is different from traditional classifiers, applying adversarial attacks on them takes additional considerations.\n\nWe haven't tried applying to other agents. While evaluating the robustness of stronger agents is indeed an interesting problem, we focus more on the learnability of key steps as an initial work.

In many (the majority) of the environments, the proposed algorithm has only trivial improvement and even worse performance under the same attack rate.\n**Response**\nWe have performed more experiments, and revised the overly strong claim.

We have tested more $\\lambda$ and updated the paper. Figure 5 and Figure 6 plot the mean score with one standard deviation across different attack rates.\n\n\n**Comment**\n3) Related to 2), it seems the Lagrange relaxation makes it hard to control the attack rate in the proposed algorithms. How sensitive it is to control the attack rate?\n**Response**\nSince we replace the hard constraint with a soft penalty parameter, how to control the attack rate is indeed a tricky problem. Empirically, we observe that training with smaller $\\lambda$ tends to produce attack policies with higher attack rates (see Table 1 and Table 3). However, we do not have direct control of the attack rate in the current framework. We will consider this problem as a direction for future improvements.\n\n\n**Comment**\n3) Can the authors elaborate on why the algorithms is not too sensitive to the value of penalty in section 4.5? [. . .]\n**Response**\nOriginally, by \"not too sensitive to $\\lambda$\" we mean that our framework is able to learn effective key steps for a number of different $\\lambda$. To avoid confusion, we removed this statement in the updated version. Also, based on the new experiments, we add more analysis on how to choose an appropriate $\\lambda$.

In many (the majority) of the environments, the proposed algorithm has only trivial improvement and even worse performance under the same attack rate.\n\n2) It is not very convincing when only one result sample is plotted in Figure 5 and Figure 6.\nI think it is necessary to show the performance of the proposed algorithm under different attack rate.\nA wide range of candidate penalty parameter lambda should be tested, so that a curve can be fitted for the proposed algorithm similar to the baselines (similar to the one shown in Table 1, but with much more test values).\n\n3) Related to 2), it seems the Lagrange relaxation makes it hard to control the attack rate in the proposed algorithms. How sensitive it is to control the attack rate?\n\n3) Can the authors elaborate on why the algorithms is not too sensitive to the value of penalty in section 4.5?\nTable 1, where the performance is almost the same for different penalty parameter, does not necessarily show that the algorithms is not too sensitive to the choice of the penalty parameter.\nAs mentioned by the author, -21 is the minimum reward (or random reward) an agent can get from Pong.\n\n\nIn general, given the current status of the paper, where there is a lot of room for improvement of experiment section, I will vote for a rejection.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1568/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1568/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["r07922080@csie.ntu.edu.tw", "htlin@csie.ntu.edu.tw"], "title": "Learning Key Steps to Attack Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents", "authors": ["Chien-Min Yu", "Hsuan-Tien Lin"], "pdf": "/pdf/1a61553c45bb2e8d51ccdb700d8921e2984ea1a0.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a novel reinforcement learning framework where an attacker can learn more effective key steps to attack the reinforcement learning agent.", "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning agents are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In particular, recent studies have shown that attacking a few key steps is effective for decreasing the agent's cumulative reward. However, all existing attacking methods find those key steps with human-designed heuristics, and it is not clear how more effective key steps can be identified. This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning framework that learns more effective key steps through interacting with the agent. The proposed framework does not require any human heuristics nor knowledge, and can be flexibly coupled with any white-box or black-box adversarial attack scenarios. Experiments on benchmark Atari games across different scenarios demonstrate that the proposed framework is superior to existing methods for identifying more effective key steps.", "keywords": ["deep reinforcement learning", "adversarial attacks"], "paperhash": "yu|learning_key_steps_to_attack_deep_reinforcement_learning_agents", "original_pdf": "/attachment/ff99c31aa0571a29051502804510a6d0d4172fdb.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nyu2020learning,\ntitle={Learning Key Steps to Attack Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents},\nauthor={Chien-Min Yu and Hsuan-Tien Lin},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkxbz1HKvr}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
