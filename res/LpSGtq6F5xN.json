While I believe that this paper can be turned into a good ICLR paper, it doesn\u2019t meet the standard of ICLR in its current form.\n\nMore specifically:\n1) The quality of the writeup is poor, containing many typos but more problematically many unclear/confusing statements which are either vague/unclear, not supported by citations and/or substantiated in other parts of the paper (Examples: \u201eThis might result in inferior clustering performance, degenerated generative model, and stability issues during training.\u201c Or \u201cHowever, this objective seems to miss the clustering target, since the reconstruction term of is not related to the clustering and actual clustering is only associated with the regularization term optimization.\u201c). An important contribution of the paper could be to substantiate these statements and I argue that achieving better performance alone is not sufficient therefore.\n\n2) From a theoretical perspective, it would be interesting whether there is any justification for statements like the ones references above. Furthermore, the authors\u2019 approach involves several approximations whose implications are neither studied nor explained. The authors responded only partially to questions in that regard by reviewers leaving certain concerns unanswered. \n\n3) From an empirical perspective, an extended study of the proposed approach would help t better understand its benefits over existing approaches. Commonly considered settings like mismatch in the number of specified clusters are not studied at all. The proposed approach also seems to be initialized by VaDe (mentioned in Section 4) and it would be interesting to understand to which extend this is necessary and why (and how does performance change/degrade if this is not done). It also makes statements regarding stability unclear as training VaDe itself can be quite challenging. Furthermore, the overall algorithm for training the proposed model should be presented in a compact form in the paper. The paper should also be self-contained in the sense of containing information on the important hyper-parameters needed for training the proposed model.\n\nIn summary, the proposed approach is potentially interesting but the paper should not be accepted in its current form.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Mixture of Variational Autoencoders for Deep Clustering", "authorids": ["~Avi_Caciularu1", "~Jacob_Goldberger1"], "authors": ["Avi Caciularu", "Jacob Goldberger"], "keywords": ["deep clustering", "variational auto encoder", "VAE"], "abstract": "In this study, we propose a deep clustering algorithm that utilizes a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework with a multi encoder-decoder neural architecture.

The results are rather convincing and the idea is worth exploring, however the paper contains many weaknesses that should be addressed and improved.", "review": "1) Quality of the writing.\n\nThe paper is rather difficult to read because of many typos and confusing statements. The authors should spend more time in refining the clarity of the presentation. Some suggestions: run a spell checker, avoid sloppy statements, be more meticulous in the description of related works and improve Figure 1.\nTo give some examples, here are two sentences from the Introduction:\n\n\u201cAs a result, the respective methods have provided new opportunities for clustering. These methods incorporate the ability to learn a (non-linear) mapping of the raw features in a low-dimensional vector space ...\u201d. Here I struggle to understand which are the respective methods and which are these methods. The only models described before are the K-means and the Gaussian Mixture Model. They surely do not incorporate the ability to learn a mapping of the raw features into a latent representation.\n\n\u201cHowever, this objective seems to miss the clustering target, since the reconstruction term of is not related to the clustering and actual clustering is only associated with the regularization term optimization.\u201d  Besides some typos, this seems a rather strong statement as VaDE and GMMVAE indeed are quite good at clustering and the fact that the clustering objective is enforced by the prior distribution in the latent space does not result in \u201cmissing the clustering target\u201d. A reference or a more systematic description could help.\n\n\n2) Hard clustering and K-DAE.\nThe title and the first chapters (till Chapter 3.2) are unfortunately quite misleading. The authors state that they propose a novel Variational Bayesian framework with K encoder-decoder architecture and they derive the corresponding ELBO in Chapter 3.2. However, they then choose to retain a deterministic approach. The latter is nothing else than a mixture of K Autoencoders with an L2 regularisation in the latent space. Hence, the proposed approach does not differ much from the k-DAE approach and I believe it cannot be described as a \u201cnovel Variational Bayesian framework\".\n\n3) Latent space.\nOne of the advantages of the VaDE method is that the latent space is nicely clustered following a Mixture of Gaussians distribution. The proposed method, on the other hand, chooses a unit normal distribution instead. As a result, the latent space cannot be used to visually investigate the data and there is no principled method to measure the uncertainty of the clustering prediction.\n\n3) Comparison with related work.\nThis paper reminded me of [1] which seems quite similar. I would find the paper more persuasive if it stated what the authors do over and above.\n[1] Kopf, A. et al. \u201cMixture-of-Experts Variational Autoencoder for clustering and generating from similarity-based representations.\u201d ArXiv abs/1910.07763 (2019): n. pag.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper335/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper335/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Mixture of Variational Autoencoders for Deep Clustering", "authorids": ["~Avi_Caciularu1", "~Jacob_Goldberger1"], "authors": ["Avi Caciularu", "Jacob Goldberger"], "keywords": ["deep clustering", "variational auto encoder", "VAE"], "abstract": "In this study, we propose a deep clustering algorithm that utilizes a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework with a multi encoder-decoder neural architecture.

This is NOT what we are doing. This actually appears as one of the baselines that we compared to - k-DAE. The whole point of the paper is showing that this is not the preferred way for deep clustering. \n\nWe follow here the VAE paradigm. We have a generative model, and we use an amortized variational approximation for the posterior distribution implemented by a network. We further use (nondeterministic) sampling to approximate the expectation in the ELBO expression. We do not use L2 parameter regularization. The KL term in the ELBO expression (1) is commonly interpreted as a regularization.   \n\nRegarding data visualization, we are interested here primarily in clustering (and data generation). If the goal would be data visualization in the latent space, we could replace the simple Gaussian model z ~  N(0,I) with a different Gaussian for each cluster, namely, z|y=i  ~  N(\\mu_i,\\Sigma_i).\n\nWe were not aware of [1] since it is not a published paper, which seems interesting and relevant. The idea there is quite different - In contrast to our method, they use one decoder to reconstruct the samples, and the clustering is performed in the latent space, like in the VaDE architecture.

The method is different from the existing VAE-based deep clustering method (VaDE), which uses only one VAE but employs a Gaussian mixture prior to achieve the clustering goal. The difficulties of the proposed model lie at how to train the model efficiently. To this end, some approximations are made to the ELBO by using the MAP value to replace the expectation as well as dropping some KL term. The approximations are the key to the training, but not justified well. Experiments are conducted on several image and text datasets, and show superior performance comparing to existing deep clustering methods.\n\nStrength:\n\n1. The idea of using K different VAE\u2019s to perform clustering is interesting, and is a good complementary to existing deep clustering methods.\n\n2. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing ones.\n\nWeakness:\n\n1. The approximation to the ELBO by dropping one KL terms is somewhat unreasonable.\n\n2. Using MAP value to approximate the expectation is acceptable. But here, what you need is not the expectation value, but the gradient of the expectation w.r.t. model parameters \\lambda. So, when you replace the MAP value with the expectation in (5), the gradient computed from the MAP expression will be much different from the exact gradient.

The proposed method adopts a k-decoders architecture with a separate decoder for each cluster.  The proposed method was shown to achieve better clustering accuracy over several other recent deep clustering methods on four real-world data sets.\n\nThe paper is good that it provides relatively detailed explanation of the proposed method.  On the other hand, the proposed method basically combines the ideas of two previous works.  It uses a variational Bayesian estimation to estimate the autoencoders in k-DAE method.  The derivation looks straightforward., and the novelty and contribution look incremental.  The paper may perhaps emphasise more on the non-trivial parts.\n\nThe proposed method has been compared with a reasonable collection of baseline methods and data sets.  Although the proposed method produced the best results on all the selected data sets, the improved clustering accuracy is relatively small (less than 1) over the best methods. Besides, the empirical results are not very interesting.  It would be better if more results could be demonstrated.  For example, could any difference between the autoencoders for the different clusters be identified in data sets other than the MNIST digit data set?\n\nThe paper does not seem to provide the source code.  So there is concern on the reproducibility of the results and whether the proposed method can be easily used by practitioners.\n\nOverall, the proposed method has been shown have state of the art performance.  However, the paper is not very exciting as the proposed method appears to have limited novelty and the improvement in clustering accuracy is relatively small.  \n\nMinor comment:\n\n- Figure 1 looks too large proportionally.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper335/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper335/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Mixture of Variational Autoencoders for Deep Clustering", "authorids": ["~Avi_Caciularu1", "~Jacob_Goldberger1"], "authors": ["Avi Caciularu", "Jacob Goldberger"], "keywords": ["deep clustering", "variational auto encoder", "VAE"], "abstract": "In this study, we propose a deep clustering algorithm that utilizes a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework with a multi encoder-decoder neural architecture.
