Though our framework is different, connections with these refs are worthy of attention and we now cite these papers in the introduction.\n\n\u2022 \u201cIn order to show that the EVT indeed helps empirically in the way that an adversarial classifier enforces the inf-norm of vectors follow the Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) [...] supporting evidence.\u201d\n\u279c    Selecting the logistic distribution is not the central point since we apply a standardization whose purpose is to place ourselves in the framework where the considered tail index is equal to 1. \n\u201cFrom the perspective of learning representations with structured priors, there exists an interesting work on decomposing vector representations into lengths [...]. It would be interesting to see if the proposed method is indeed better than the way that structured priors are enforced in [2].\u201d\n\u279c We thank  AnonReviewer3 for mentioning article [2]. In the newest version  we mention that future work will implement a comparison with this work which we have not done yet due to time constraints. \n\n\u2022 \u201cLinguistically, given the distributional hypothesis, the length of learnt vectors tends to be highly correlated with the frequency information of available concepts and the direction of them matters more. [...] would be applicable in fine-grained sentiment analysis, such as Stanford Sentiment Treebank [3].\u201d\n\u279c We make no claim that the proposed method would be applicable in fine-grained sentiment analysis such as [3]. We would like to mention that the extreme values in [3] correspond to annotation labels with sharp and strong sentiment. Such extremes are not the same as the extreme embeddings that we thoroughly study in this paper.\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe construction of the two datasets seems to be very arbitrary given that there exists a large number of sentiment analysis datasets and many with lots of samples, I am not sure that the results on the chosen constructed two datasets are sufficient enough to support the claim.\u201d\n\u279c The datasets are commonly used datasets for binary classification of text data (see [5, 6]). What are the datasets that  AnonReviewer3 seems to have in mind?\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe size of the datasets is too small. Given that, the marginal improvement against the NN baseline could be a result of a specific initialisation, which doesn't generalise to other random initialisations.\u201d\n\u279c The mentioned datasets are commonly used datasets for binary classification of text data. We have tried different initializations and obtained similar results. We do not report each initialization in this paper. Concerning the sizes of datasets, we work with a limited amount of GPU time and we cannot go upscale in our experiments as R2 suggests. We want to raise that we have more than 200 extreme samples thus the improvement on the extreme samples is far from marginal. Note that the embeddings are not learnt from scratch: they are built to perform a classification task on top of (frozen) BERT embeddings, please refer to the GLUE benchmark (https://gluebenchmark.com/) for similar system.\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe dimension of vector representations is also too small. [...] it is in a very high dimensional space.\u201d\n\u279c In the original BERT paper, the size of the embedding used is 768. The size of the learnt embedding in the present work  is a hyperparameter which varies from 10 to 768.  the value 50 was automatically chosen by cross-validation. We now mention this fact in the additional experiment settings for real data section in the Appendix. \n\n\u2022 \u201cThere are many straightforward distributions [...] a prior on the norm of high dimensional vectors.\u201d\n\u279c As mentioned earlier in our response, In this paper, we do not use an explicit prior on the radius; Instead our target (=prior) is a multivariate extreme value distribution called the Logistic distribution in the EVT setting. It happens that the radial component of this distribution is heavy tailed but this constraint does not need to appear (and does not) in our algorithm. \n\n---\n[1] Siffer, Alban, et al. \"Anomaly detection in streams with extreme value theory.\" Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.

Such invariance, provided by the approach detailed in the paper, allows generating new text data based on labeled inputs while preserving the same label. To the best of our knowledge, no other embedding provides a framework to generate new text data with a label preserving approach.\n \n\u2022 \u201cWhy not instead present an explicit theorem providing some statistical guarantees for the proposed methodology in Sec 3.1 based on the constant-along-rays result (which would be nice to have regardless), and then follow up the theorem with background math from 2.1-2.2 which is necessary to understand the proof?\u201d\n\u279c  Following your suggestion we have added an explicit statement of the statistical guarantees that can be obtained with such constant-along-rays embeddings, citing theorem 1 of [1] in Section 2.1.\n\n\u2022 \u201cWhy did the authors never evaluate the overall sentiment prediction performance of Orthrus + Hydra used together vs other classifiers + data augmentation strategies?\u201d\n\u279c We point out that the performance of Orthrus is compared to a MLP classifier on similar input (see Table 1 of the new version of the paper). Hydra relies on the regularly varying representation provided by Orthrus. Therefore, the performance of Hydra + Orthrus is compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of data generation (see Table 2a and Table 2b).\n\n\u2022 \u201cIf the goal of dilation invariance is to help the classifiers better generalize to out-of-distribution test sentences, then why not verify this happened, eg. by training on Yelp and testing on Amazon?\u201d\n\u279c Although there are works addressing learning a task on a given dataset and testing on a different dataset which relates to transfer learning, we make no claim that the regularly varying embedding allows to do this. The added value of our approach is that it allows: \n1. Generalization for points which lie out of the envelope of the training inputs,\n2. A label preserving (text) data augmentation.\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe authors should better justify the assumption of Jalalzai et al, and why this is appropriate for the MLP classifier used later in the paper.\u201d\n\u279c Following your suggestion we now provide some intuition about the regular variation assumption of Jalalzai et al. in Section 1 and Section 2. In Section 3, we emphasize  that in the present work we do not assume that the original representation (from BERT) satisfies this assumption. Instead we construct a new representation that does, via the GAN machinery with a target with the desired property. Also we have added a few sentences concerning the advantage of using this representation for text document classification, namely the probability ratio between the two classes, conditionally on the input x, solely depend on the angle theta(x) above large radial thresholds, which allows to classify the most extreme test  points using information from a given fraction of the training set corresponding to inputs with largest norm. \n\n\u2022 \u201cThis statement needs to be clarified and have citation: \u201cSuch classifier whose output solely depends on the angle \u0398(x) of the considered input, with provable guarantees concerning the classification risk in out-of-sample regions scaling as the square root of the number of extreme points used at the training step\u201d\n\u279c The information that helps to understand this statement is provided in Theorem 2 from [1]. But, indeed, it is not clear as it was explained and we clarified the paper accordingly, by adding the aforementioned theorem in Section 2.2.\n \n\u2022 \u201cThe authors should explain Equation (1) in English rather than referring to it so early on the paper (pg 1: \"satisfying Equation 1\"). I had no idea what this was supposed to mean as a first time reader.\u201d\n\u279c We have updated the paper accordingly and explain Equation (1) in the introduction as a homogeneity property above large radial thresholds. \n\n\u2022 \u201cA figure demonstrating an example of the phenomenon explained in Sec 2.2 would be helpful to aid reader's intuition.\u201d\n\u279c We have added  a figure (Figure 1) to illustrate the angular classifier in Sec 2.2.\n\n---\n[1] Hamid Jalalzai, Stephan Cl\u00e9mencon, and Anne Sabourin.

However, I could not follow what such guarantees the proposed method offers, if any.\u201d\n\u279c Paper [1] precisely details why the tails deserve a specific treatment. The mentioned paper also provides theoretical guarantees (theorem 2). As advised by R2, we will explicitly state the results from [1] that are relevant for the present paper. \n\n\u2022 \u201cExperiment 4.1 is impossible to follow without reading the appendix. This section should be expanded, or completely moved to the appendix.\"\n\u279c Experiment 4.1 has been moved to the Appendix.\n The authors claim without evidence that a baseline of a neural network trained on top of the \"BERT embedding\" is state-of-the-art for sentiment classification. While there isn't enough information to know what was done, most state-of-the-art approaches involve fine-tuning BERT.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cNo comparisons are made with any other work, despite the method attempting a very general and well-studied problem of text classification.\u201d\n\u279c Our aim is to show that learning a regularly varying representation on top of a baseline representation (such as BERT) improves the classification performance of a standard classifier (such as MLP) compared to applying the same  standard classification algorithm (MLP) to the baseline representation. Table 1 from the new version of the paper precisely gathers the experimental results with regards to this claim. \nOur choice of BERT+MLP as baseline was merely guided by the state of the art approaches when we started working on this project. \n\n\u2022 \u201c The submission claims that \"Applying a dilation is equivalent to assess the generalization of classifiers outside the envelope of both training and testing samples.\". It isn't obvious to me that dilation captures the variation in embeddings you'd get from out-of-domain training samples.\u201d\n\u279c This sentence has been removed from the newest version for the sake of clarity.\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe authors compare their data augmentation results to \"backtranslation\". The citation for the method appears to be a class project, and in fact does round-trip translation for paraphrasing, and not back translation.\u201d\n\u279c The author of the [2] used the word \u201cbacktranslation\u201d along their article. We will modify our paper and replace \u201cbacktranslation\u201d with \u201cround-trip translation\u201d.\n\n\u2022 \u201cNo attempt is made to show if the data augmentation approach actually improves end task performance.\u201d\n\u279c Please refer to the last experiment:  we observe that Hydra outperforms all other methods in terms of distinct 1 and distinct 2. Table 1b shows that improvement in F1 score induced by dataset augmentation by Hydra beats all other methods and is only equaled by EDA.\n\n---\n[1] Hamid Jalalzai, Stephan Cl\u00e9mencon, and Anne Sabourin.

I have a couple concerns about this choice:\n\n1.1) In order to show that the EVT indeed helps empirically in the way that an adversarial classifier enforces the inf-norm of vectors follow the Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution, at least three plausible distributions from each form of the GEV distribution needs to be checked. The logistic distribution is interesting, but the marginal improvement gained by enforcing the lengths of the produced vectors to follow the logistic distribution could be a result of hyper-param tuning, which shouldn't be a piece of supporting evidence.\n\n1.2) From the perspective of applying the EVT, recent successful work from the best of my knowledge is on Anomaly Detection [1], where the EVT enables the system to learn from samples in only one class and also adjust the threshold for detecting the abnormal behaviour of samples. It is also theoretically grounded as the error variable of a logistic regression follows a Gumbel distribution which is one form of the GEV distribution, therefore, applying EVT for binary classification case makes sense.\n\n1.3) From the perspective of learning representations with structured priors, there exists an interesting work on decomposing vector representations into lengths and directions and enforcing lengths to follow a uniform distribution and directions a Von Mises\u2013Fisher (vMF) distribution as in [2]. It would be interesting to see if the proposed method is indeed better than the way that structured priors are enforced in [2].\n\n1.4) Linguistically, given the distributional hypothesis, the length of learnt vectors tends to be highly correlated with the frequency information of available concepts and the direction of them matters more. The argument is also presented by the paper. However, in sentiment analysis, the length could contain the information about how strong the sentiment of the input sentence is, so I am not convinced that the proposed method would be applicable in fine-grained sentiment analysis, such as Stanford Sentiment Treebank [3]. \n\n\n--\n2) A soft approximation over the inf-norm of a set of iid samples is log-sum-exp function, and it is the cdf of softmax function, which is also theoretically grounded in EVT for classifications. It could be a nicer story than the current one as the choice of the logistic distribution seems to be too intend. \n\n\n--\n3) The construction of the two datasets seems to be very arbitrary given that there exists a large number of sentiment analysis datasets and many with lots of samples, I am not sure that the results on the chosen constructed two datasets are sufficient enough to support the claim.\n\n3.1) The size of the datasets is too small. Given that, the marginal improvement against the NN baseline could be a result of a specific initialisation, which doesn't generalise to other random initialisations.\n\n3.2) The dimension of vector representations is also too small. Normally, commonly used word embeddings are of 300 dimensions, and contextualised ones are of higher than 1200 dimensions. The chosen 50 dimension could prevent the NN baseline model to perform well and IMO, it is helpful for picking a suitable logistic prior than it is in a very high dimensional space.\n\n3.3) There are many straightforward distributions that could be applied as a prior on the lengths of vector representations, e.g. the Rayleigh distribution in 2D and the Chi-squared distribution in higher-dimension. Then again, the distribution gets flatter and becomes similar to a uniform distribution when the dim goes higher, which is a common issue. It goes back to my concern or doubt on the usability of a prior on the norm of high dimensional vectors.\n\n\n--\n4) I am still interested in seeing EVT being applied in various domains, but I'd be in favor of more justifiable approaches. \n\n[1] Siffer, Alban, et al. \"Anomaly detection in streams with extreme value theory.\" Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.

Much of the methodology is justified by results for extremal point classification under particular assumptions, and then the authors try and encourage these assumptions to be met via penalty terms introduced in their embeddings/augmentation models.  However, while the proposed methodology seems interesting/novel, it remains conceptually unclear why it should be superior to standard text classification methods (ie. exactly what assumptions are being exploited to improve performance and how exactly do those assumptions help should be made more explicit). In particular, why is dilation invariance even a good idea?\n\nOverall, I find the paper a bit mathematically dense in Secs 2.1-2.2, which would not be a bad thing if the math were necessary to justify why the proposed methodology works well, but it in this case seems mainly presented as background material (as if it were a prerequisite to understand the method itself, which it is certainly not).\n\nWhy not instead present an explicit theorem providing some statistical guarantees for the proposed methodology in Sec 3.1 based on the constant-along-rays result (which would be nice to have regardless), and then follow up the theorem with background math from 2.1-2.2 which is necessary to understand the proof?\n\nAs it is currently written the paper is a bit too dense in terminology, and opaque names like Hydra and Orthrus used to describe straightforward concepts that are essentially a neural classifier (of a particular form) and a seq2seq-based data augmentation procedure (which would be good to describe in language more familiar to the ML audience). In particular, the goals of Hydra and Orthrus should first be intuitively described before delving into their various components.\n\n- Why did the authors never evaluate the overall sentiment prediction performance of Orthrus + Hydra used together vs other classifiers + data augmentation strategies?\n\n- If the goal of dilation invariance is to help the classifiers better generalize to out-of-distribution test sentences, then why not verify this happened, eg. by training on Yelp and testing on Amazon?\n\n- The authors should better justify the assumption of Jalalzai et al, and why this is appropriate for the MLP classifier used later in the paper.\n\n- This statement needs to be clarified and have citation: \"Such classifier whose output solely depends on the angle \u0398(x) of the considered input, with provable guarantees concerning the classification risk in out-of-sample regions scaling as the square root of the number of extreme points used at the training step\"\n\n- The authors should explain Equation (1) in English rather than referring to it so early on the paper (pg 1: \"satisfying Equation 1\"). I had no idea what this was supposed to mean as a first time reader.\n\n- The way figure 4 is presented is a bit opaque and took me a while to understand (have to look closely at Fig 4a to see the columns are not monochromatic). \n\n- \"We also compare Hydra to a Vanilla Sequence to Sequence to demonstrate the validity of our approach\" How \"Vanilla Sequence to Sequence\" (word 'model' is missing) is used for dataset augmentation needs to be clarified here.\n\n- A figure demonstrating an example of the phenomenon explained in Sec 2.2 would be  helpful to aid reader's intuition.  \n\n- Typo: \"eugmentation\""}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2186/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2186/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Regularly varying representation for sentence embedding", "authors": ["Hamid Jalalzai", "Pierre Colombo", "Chlo\u00e9 Clavel", "Eric Gaussier", "Giovanna Varni", "Emmanuel Vignon", "Anne Sabourin"], "authorids": ["hamid.jalalzai@telecom-paris.fr", "pierre.colombo@telecom-paris.fr", "chloe.clavel@telecom-paris.fr", "giovanna.varni@telecom-paris.fr", "emmanuel.vignon@fr.ibm.com", "anne.sabourin@telecom-paris.fr"], "keywords": ["extreme value theory", "classification", "supvervised learning", "data augmentation", "representation learning"], "abstract": "The dominant approaches to sentence representation in natural language rely on learning embeddings on massive corpuses. The obtained embeddings have desirable properties such as compositionality and distance preservation (sentences with similar meanings have similar representations). In this paper, we develop a novel method for learning an embedding enjoying a dilation invariance property. We propose two algorithms: Orthrus, a classification algorithm, constrains the distribution of the embedded variable to be regularly varying, i.e. multivariate heavy-tail. and uses Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to tackle the classification task on two separate regions: the tail and the bulk. Hydra, a text generation algorithm for dataset augmentation, leverages the invariance property of the embedding learnt by Orthrus to generate coherent sentences with controllable attribute, e.g. positive or negative sentiment. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real text data demonstrate the relevance of the proposed framework.\n", "pdf": "/pdf/9413c0fc775b82b57796ebd63820d3ed14109eda.pdf", "paperhash": "jalalzai|regularly_varying_representation_for_sentence_embedding", "original_pdf": "/attachment/82d8bb9cb9e844f3ebea5aecdd882c59fb7a0542.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\njalalzai2020regularly,\ntitle={Regularly varying representation for sentence embedding},\nauthor={Hamid Jalalzai and Pierre Colombo and Chlo{\\'e} Clavel and Eric Gaussier and Giovanna Varni and Emmanuel Vignon and Anne Sabourin},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyljzgHtwS}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
