In detail, the authors suggest that for any algorithm, its generalization error can be bounded by $O(1/(n\\beta))$ plus the optimization error of the algorithm, where $\\beta$ is the gradient dominance parameter. The main idea for the authors to obtain such an improved bound is an advanced analysis based on a weaker on-average stability measure. \n\nHere are my detailed comments. \n- It seems that to do a comparison, the authors need to \u2018translate\u2019 previous complexity results such as stability results (Charles & Papailiopoulos, 2018) to generalization results, considered in this paper. To do such a translation, Theorem A.1 is proposed. However, I did not find the proof to Theorem A.1 except its part c. Since the translation is crucial for a fair comparison, the authors may want to complete the proof to Theorem A.1 or point out some relevant references about that. \n- Assumption 1 and 2 suggest that $L$ and $\\beta$ are two parameters about $F$ itself, in other words, independent of any specific data set $S$. However, in Example 1 and 2, the authors suggest that $L/\\beta$ is in the order of $\\sigma_{max}(\\Sigma_S)/\\sigma_{min}(\\Sigma_S)$, which depends on the random data $S$. Can the authors explain more about that? Shall we need some more assumptions about the data distribution (for instance, the support set of $x$ is finite) to support such a claim?\n- $O(1/(n\\beta))$ generalization gap is standard for the case where $F$ is convex, and this work tries to extend it from convex to nonconvex with PL condition, just as the authors suggest in Remark 3. Does the $O(1/(n\\beta))$ gap still hold under other nonconvex relaxing conditions such as one-point strongly convexity or quadratic growth [1]? \n\n[1] Necoara, Ion, Yu Nesterov, and Francois Glineur. \"Linear convergence of first order methods for non-strongly convex optimization.\" Mathematical Programming 175.1-2 (2019): 69-107.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper546/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper546/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Sharper Generalization Bounds for Learning with Gradient-dominated Objective Functions", "authorids": ["~Yunwen_Lei1", "~Yiming_Ying1"], "authors": ["Yunwen Lei", "Yiming Ying"], "keywords": ["generalization bounds", "non-convex learning"], "abstract": "Stochastic optimization has become the workhorse behind many successful machine learning applications, which motivates a lot of theoretical analysis to understand its empirical behavior.

We have added more explanation on the expectation w.r.t. $A$. Here is the added sentence \"Here $\\mathbb{E}_A$ denotes the expectation w.r.t. the randomness of the algorithm $A$. For example, if $A$ is SGD, then $\\mathbb{E}_A$ denotes the expectation w.r.t. the random indices of training examples selected for the gradient computation.\" Please see the first paragraph of Section 3.\n\n**Q: In the related work, I care more about how previous literature shed lights on this work.** \\\n**A:** Accordingly, we have re-organized the related work on algorithmic stability. In this revision, we group the discussions according to stability measures. We first discuss the related work on uniform stability. Then we move onto several other stability measures. Finally, we emphasize the on-average stability by indicating its advantage in exploiting either the strong convexity or the relaxed exp-concavity in the existing analysis. This motivates us to use the on-average stability for learning with the PL condition, which is another relaxed condition of strong convexity.\n\nWe have separated the related work on generalization analysis in two paragraphs. The first paragraph is on the stability approach, and the second paragraph sketches some other approaches. In the end of the first paragraph, we put more discussions on the most related work (Charles \\& Papailiopoulos, 2018) by presenting some defects. We explain that these defects are due to the use of pointwise hypothesis stability and the ignorance of smoothness property, which motivate us to refine their results by considering the weaker on-average stability and exploiting the smoothness of loss functions.\n\nPlease see Section 2 for details.\n\n**Q: How widely is the PL condition applicable? Are there any examples when the PL condition does not hold?** \\\n**A:** PL condition is widely used in the non-convex learning setting (Zhou et al., 2018b; Reddi et al., 2016; Karimi et al., 2016;\nWang et al., 2019; Lei et al., 2017, Charles \\& Papailiopoulos, 2018; Yuan et al., 2019). It is shown to hold for strongly convex functions composed with piecewise-linear objectives (Karimi et al., 2016, Charles \\& Papailiopoulos, 2018), and non-convex learning problems including generalized linear models, robust regression (Foster et al., 2019) and linear neural networks (Charles \\& Papailiopoulos, 2018, Hardt \\& Ma, 2016).\n\nPL condition can fail for very simple functions. For example, consider the one-dimensional function $f(x)=x^4$. Then $f'(x)=4x^3$ and the minimal value is $0$. Furthermore, we have\n$$\n\\frac{f(x)-0}{|f'(x)|^2}=\\frac{x^4}{16x^6}=\\frac{1}{16x^2}\\to\\infty\\text{ as }x\\to0.\n$$\nTherefore, the PL condition does not hold.\n\n**Q: The difference between the condition $L\\leq n\\beta/4$ and $L<n\\beta/2$.** \\\n**A:** Under the condition $L<n\\beta/2$, our analysis in the proof of Theorem 1 can actually imply the bound\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\big[F(\\mathbf{w}_S) - \\hat{F}_S\\big]\\leq\n\\frac{8L\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{F}_S]}{n\\beta-2L} + \\frac{L\\mathbb{E}\\big[F_S(\\mathbf{w}_S)-\\hat{F}_S\\big]}{2\\beta}.\n$$\nThis implies the bound in Theorem 1 by taking a further assumption $L\\leq n\\beta/4$. In Corollary 2, we assume $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{F}_S]=0$ and therefore we can get $\\frac{8L\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{F}_S]}{n\\beta-2L}=0$ under the condition $L<n\\beta/2$. We have added a note below the proof of Theorem 1 to make this clear (the top of Page 17).\n\n**Q: I see no experimental results to support their theory.** \\\n**A:** We have added two experiments to support our theory. The first experiment shows that the condition $L/\\beta\\leq n/4$ can be violated if $n$ is small, and holds if $n$ is large. We observe no overfitting for learning with gradient-dominated functions in the second experiment, which is consistent with Theorem 1 on the resistance of SGD to overfitting under the PL condition.

The authors may want to complete the proof to Theorem A.1 or point out some relevant references about that.** \\\n**A:** Yes, you are right. We need Theorem A.1 to translate previous bounds in the comparison. We agree it is important to either prove or give the exact reference to these crucial results. The proof of Part (a) can be found in Hardt et al., (2016, Theorem 2.2). Part (b) was first proved for deterministic algorithms (Bousquet \\& Elisseeff 2002, Theorem 11), and then extended to randomized algorithms (Elisseeff et al. 2005, Theorem 12). We have added these references in the proof of Theorem A.1.\n\n**Q: $L,\\beta$ in Assumptions 1, 2 are parameters about $F$, while $\\Sigma_S$ depends on random $S$ in Examples 1, 2.  Shall we need some more assumptions about the data distribution?** \\\n**A:** Sorry for the confusion. The parameter $L$ reflects the smoothness of individual loss functions, while $\\sigma_{\\text{max}}(\\Sigma_S)$ is related to the smoothness of $F_S$. In our discussion of examples, we assume $L$ and $\\sigma_{\\text{max}}(\\Sigma_S)$ are of the same order (Appendix E). Note $L$ can be small in practice, e.g., least square loss and logistic loss. For the PL condition, the parameter $\\beta$ is more related to $F_S$ instead of $F$ since Assumption 2 involves the term $\\inf_{\\mathbf{w}}F_S(\\mathbf{w})$ and $\\|\\nabla F_S(\\mathbf{w})\\|_2^2$. We take an expectation w.r.t. $S$ in Assumption 2 since we only study generalization bounds in expectation. In Examples 1, 2, we show that the gradient-dominance parameter of $F_S$ is related to $\\sigma_{\\text{min}}(\\Sigma_S)$. We have modified these examples by replacing \"$L/\\beta$ is of the order of\" with \"the empirical counterpart of $L/\\beta$ is of the order of\" to avoid the confusion.\n\nOur analysis does not require more assumptions on the data distribution. Indeed, our bounds are distribution-free.\n\n**Q: $O(1/(n\\beta))$ is standard if $F$ is convex. Does the gap still hold under other nonconvex relaxing conditions such as one-point strongly convexity or quadratic growth?** \\\n**A:** Firstly, we would like to clarify that convexity is not sufficient to guarantee the generalization gap $O(1/(n\\beta))$. An additional assumption like strong convexity is needed for the $O(1/(n\\beta))$ generalization gap.\n\nThe $O(1/(n\\beta))$ gap also holds under the one-point strong convexity assumption. Indeed, one-point strong convexity and smoothness imply the PL condition (Yuan et al., 2019, Lemma 2). Therefore, all our results apply to one-point strongly convex functions.\n\nFor functions satisfying the quadratic growth condition (Necoara et al., 2019), we need another realizability assumption to enjoy generalization. We have added new generalization bounds in Theorem 3 on the quadratic growth condition. Note that the realizability condition is also required in Charles \\& Papailiopoulos (2018) to study the generalization gap for functions satisfying the quadratic growth condition."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper546/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper546/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Sharper Generalization Bounds for Learning with Gradient-dominated Objective Functions", "authorids": ["~Yunwen_Lei1", "~Yiming_Ying1"], "authors": ["Yunwen Lei", "Yiming Ying"], "keywords": ["generalization bounds", "non-convex learning"], "abstract": "Stochastic optimization has become the workhorse behind many successful machine learning applications, which motivates a lot of theoretical analysis to understand its empirical behavior.

It is also important to verify the condition $L\\leq n\\beta/4$.** \\\n**A:** We agree it is important to verify the condition $L/\\beta\\leq n/4$. Theoretically, the empirical covariance matrix $\\Sigma_S$ would converge to the covariance matrix $\\Sigma=\\mathbb{E}[xx^\\top]$ as $n$ increases, which is independent of $n$. Therefore, we would expect that $\\sigma_{\\text{max}}(\\Sigma_S)/\\sigma_{\\text{min}}(\\Sigma_S)$ would be close to some constant for large $n$. The constraint $L/\\beta\\leq n/4$ would then be easy to satisfy for large $n$, and may violate if $n$ is small or moderate.\n\nWe have added two experiments to support our theory. In the first experiment, we aim to verify how the assumption $\\sigma_{\\text{max}}(\\Sigma_S)/\\sigma_{\\text{min}}(\\Sigma_S)\\leq n/4$ would hold in practice. Experimental results show that this assumption may be violated if $n$ is small or moderate, and hold trivially for sufficiently large $n$.\n\nIn the second experiment, we aim to verify Theorem 1 on the resistance of stochastic optimization to overfitting under the PL condition. We consider generalized linear models, which are nonconvex and are shown to satisfy the PL condition (Foster et al., 2019). Our experimental results show that there is no overfitting even if we run SGD with $100$ passes, which is consistent with our bound in Theorem 1.\n\nPlease see Section 5 for details."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper546/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper546/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Sharper Generalization Bounds for Learning with Gradient-dominated Objective Functions", "authorids": ["~Yunwen_Lei1", "~Yiming_Ying1"], "authors": ["Yunwen Lei", "Yiming Ying"], "keywords": ["generalization bounds", "non-convex learning"], "abstract": "Stochastic optimization has become the workhorse behind many successful machine learning applications, which motivates a lot of theoretical analysis to understand its empirical behavior.

It provides a generalization bound instead of the hypothesis stability or uniform stability in previous discussions. The result explains generalization even under overparameterized model.\n\n\nStrength:\n+ The theoretical result is novel, according to the authors this is the first paper to model the generalization bound in terms of a $O(1/n\\beta)$ term plus the convergence rate of the optimization algorithm\n+ The authors applies the main theorem on practical algorithms and derive convergence rate on generalization error while previous literature on those algorithms are mainly on  training error.\n\n\nWeakness:\n- Some of the background description and preliminaries are vague, for example the $E_{S, A}$ concerning taking an expectation over an algorithm A are not explained.\n- The relation of related works with this work is not clear enough. The two paragraphs, \"Algorithmic Stability\" and \"Generalization Analysis\" all ends up with areas that stability/generalization is applicable, while I care more about how previous literature shed lights on this work.\n- I see no experimental results to support their theory\n\nI think it is a good paper that provides novel aspects of understanding. It provides new insights in understanding important phenomenons in training deep neural networks whose Lipchitz constant might be very large. The bound removes the Lipchitz constant and uses training error of the best model instead. It explains why interpolation does not lead to overfitting. However the first part of this paper is a little bit rash while the experimental support is insufficient.\n\nQuestion:\n\nHow widely is the PL condition applicable? Are there any examples when the PL condition does not hold?\n\nIn Theorem 1 the assumption is $L \\leq n\\beta/4$, while in Corollary 2 the assumption becomes $L < n\\beta/2$, what makes the difference?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper546/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper546/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Sharper Generalization Bounds for Learning with Gradient-dominated Objective Functions", "authorids": ["~Yunwen_Lei1", "~Yiming_Ying1"], "authors": ["Yunwen Lei", "Yiming Ying"], "keywords": ["generalization bounds", "non-convex learning"], "abstract": "Stochastic optimization has become the workhorse behind many successful machine learning applications, which motivates a lot of theoretical analysis to understand its empirical behavior. As a comparison, there is far less work to study the generalization behavior especially in a non-convex learning setting. In this paper, we study the generalization behavior of stochastic optimization by leveraging the algorithmic stability for learning with $\\beta$-gradient-dominated objective functions. We develop generalization bounds of the order $O(1/(n\\beta))$ plus the convergence rate of the optimization algorithm, where $n$ is the sample size. Our stability analysis significantly improves the existing non-convex analysis by removing the bounded gradient assumption and implying better generalization bounds. We achieve this improvement by exploiting the smoothness of loss functions instead of the Lipschitz condition in Charles & Papailiopoulos (2018). We apply our general results to various stochastic optimization algorithms, which show clearly how the variance-reduction techniques improve not only training but also generalization.
