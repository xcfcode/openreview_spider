A\nstandard memory network architecture is trained on both bAbI and a version of\nthe WikiMovies dataset (as in Weston 2016, which this work extends). Numerous\nexperiments are performed comparing the behavior of different training\nalgorithms under various experimental conditions.\n\nSTRENGTHS: The experimentation is comprehensive. I agree with the authors that\nthese results provide additional useful insight into the performance of the\nmodel in the 2016 paper (henceforth W16).\n\nWEAKNESSES: This is essentially an appendix to the earlier paper. There is no\nnew machine learning content. Secondarily, the paper seems to confuse the\ndistinction between \"training with an adaptive sampling procedure\" and \"training\nin interactive environments\" more generally. In particular, no comparisons are\npresented to the to the experiments with a static exploration policy presented\nin W16, when the two training can & should be evaluated side-by-side.\nThe only meaningful changes between this work and W16 involve simple\n(and already well-studied) changes to the form of this exploration policy.\n\nMy primary concern remains about novelty: the extra data introduced here is\nwelcome enough, but probably belongs in a *ACL short paper or a technical\nreport. This work does not stand on its own, and an ICLR submission is not an\nappropriate vehicle for presenting it.\n\n\"REINFORCEMENT LEARNING\"\n\n[Update: concerns in this section have been addressed by the authors.]\n\nThis paper attempts to make a hard distinction between the reinforcement\nlearning condition considered here and the (\"non-RL\") condition considered in\nW16. I don't think this distinction is nearly as sharp as it's\nmade out to be. \n\nAs already noted in Weston 2016, the RBI objective is a special case of vanilla\npolicy gradient with a zero baseline and off-policy samples. In this sense the\nversion of RBI considered in this paper is the same as in W16, but with a\ndifferent exploration policy; REINFORCE is the same objective with a nontrivial\nbaseline. Similarly, the change in FP is only a change to the sampling policy.\nThe fixed dataset / online learning distinction is not especially meaningful\nwhen the fixed dataset consists of endless synthetic data.\n\nIt should be noted that some variants of the exploration policy in W16 provide a\nstronger training signal than is available in the RL \"from scratch\" setting\nhere: in particular, when $\\pi_acc = 0.5$ the training samples will feature much\ndenser reward. However, if I correctly understand Figures 3 and 4 in this paper,\nthe completely random initial policy achieves an average reward of ~0.3 on bAbI\nand ~0.1 on movies---as good or better than the other exploration policies in\nW16!\n\nI think this paper would be a lot clearer if the delta from W16 were expressed\ndirectly in terms of their different exploration policies, rather than trying to\ncast all of the previous work as \"not RL\" when it can be straightforwardly\naccommodated in the RL framework.\n\nI was quite confused by the fact that no direct comparisons are made to the\ntraining conditions in the earlier work. I think this is a symptom of the\nproblem discussed above: once this paper adopts the position that this work is\nabout RL and the previous work is not, it becomes possible to declare that the\ntwo training scenarios are incomparable. I really think this is a mistake---to\nthe extent that the off-policy sample generators used in the previous paper are\nworse than chance, it is always possible to compare to them fairly here.\nEvaluating everything in the \"online\" setting and presenting side-by-side\nexperiments would provide a much more informative picture of the comparative\nbehavior of the various training objectives.\n\nON-POLICY VS OFF-POLICY\n\nVanilla policy gradient methods like the ones here typically can't use\noff-policy samples without a little extra hand-holding (importance sampling,\ntrust region methods, etc.). They seem to work out of the box for a few of the\nexperiments in this paper, which is an interesting result on its own. It would\nbe nice to have some discussion of why that might be the case.\n\nOTHER NOTES\n\n- The claim that \"batch size is related to off-policy learning\" is a little\nodd. There are lots of on-policy algorithms that require the agent to collect a\nlarge batch of transitions from the current policy before performing an \n(on-policy) update.\n\n- I think the experiments on fine-tuning to human workers are the most exciting\npart of this work, and I would have preferred to see these discussed (and\nexplored with) in much more detail rather than being relegated to the\npenultimate paragraphs.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dialogue Learning With Human-in-the-Loop", "abstract": "An important aspect of developing conversational agents is to give a bot the ability to improve through communicating with humans and to learn from the mistakes that it makes.

As the authors state in the comments, it is closely related to the question answering problem with the exception that a teacher provides a response after the model\u2019s answer, which does not always come with a positive reward. Thus, the model must learn to use the teacher\u2019s feedback to significantly improve performance.\n\nOverall, the paper is written clearly, and several interesting models are tested. It is certainly only a limited form of dialogue that is considered (closer to question answering, since the questions do not require the agent to look further back into the context), but investigating in this direction could prove fruitful once the tasks are scaled up to be more difficult.\n\nMy main concern is with the paper`s novelty. In the words of the authors, this paper has two primary differences with the work of Weston:\n\n\u201c(i) That earlier work did not use the natural reinforcement learning/online setting, but \u201ccheated\u201d with a fixed policy given in advance. It is important to address the realistic online setting and assess whether the methods, particularly FP, still work, or else what changes (e.g. exploration, balancing, see Fig 4 and Table 1) are needed. (ii) That earlier work had only simulated data, and no real-language data, so was only toy. This work uses Mechanical Turk to do real experiments, which again is important to assess if these methods, particularly FP, work on real language.\u201d\n\nPoint (ii) is very much appreciated, but adding additional human testing data is not sufficient for a conference paper. Thus, the main point of the paper is that \u201cthe model also works if we collect the data online (i.e. the agent\u2019s policy is used to collect data rather than a fixed policy beforehand)\u201d. While this is a step in the right direction, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s significant enough for an ICLR paper. Little model novelty is required to solve this additional requirement on these tasks beyond using epsilon greedy exploration. Thus, the paper is borderline accept/reject. \n\nEDIT: I have updated my score slightly in light of the author's response, where they make a good point that real-world implementation should be more strongly considered as part of the contribution.\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dialogue Learning With Human-in-the-Loop", "abstract": "An important aspect of developing conversational agents is to give a bot the ability to improve through communicating with humans and to learn from the mistakes that it makes.

If we construct a policy that guesses actions randomly, it is always as good as an omniscient labeler for some value of acc%\n\nThat is correct. \n\nHowever, in the statements below that we think there are some misunderstandings.\n\nLet's consider Table 1, which reports test accuracy for the dataset batch size case over several iterations (1 to 6). On each iteration the policy that generated the predictions is fixed, but is updated on the next iteration after learning. \nOn the first iteration you have to start with some kind of policy so we start with a random one. There exists a  \\pi_acc% policy from Weston'16 that would obtain the same error rate as that chosen random policy on iteration 1. Values of acc% higher would be getting better accuracy and lower acc% lower accuracy.  However, in Weston'16 the policy is never updated while training, this is like stopping after the first iteration (column 1, Table 1) and that is the final error rate you get (which is why in Weston'16 on page 5 it is stated explicitly \u201cNote that because the policies are fixed the experiments in this paper are not in a reinforcement learning setting.\u201d). However, in the setting in *this * paper we do update the policy and you get iterations 2, 3 and so on. What we want to show is that the accuracy gets *better* on subsequent iterations. And that is indeed the case, see Table 1, 2nd column (RBI), the accuracy goes from 0.74 to 0.87 to 0.90 to 0.96 and so on. Hence, our approaches are doing better than the original policy they started with. So if you started with one of the fake labelers from Weston'16, regardless of the value of the initial \\pi_acc, you would improve over them as well. \n\n>My concern here is the following: experiments in the paper suggest that \"real\" random guessing is actually _stronger_ than 2 of the 3 \"fake\" teaching policies considered in the earlier paper.\n\nSo we hope the above has explained that your concern/issue is actually exactly the thing that we are trying to show.\nThe point is that real random guessing isn't stronger, not initially, but after training and updating/learning the policy one would hope for it to be stronger. Our experiments showed this was the case, which is a positive result. This is a key contribution of the work.\n\n>(This isn't stated explicitly anywhere, and I'm pulling it off of the y axes of the top-right charts in Figs 3 & 4---let me know if I'm misreading.)\n\nEven though we just explained this for Table 1 because we think it is clearer, the same argument also follows for Figs 3&4 and all the other experiments as well. (The Figs 3&4 experiments can be understood similarly to Table 1, except they use small online batches, see Sec 4.2).  So, we hope we have convinced you why it does not make sense to compare to the \\pi_acc% policies from Weston'16.\n\n> I want to emphasize that my overriding concern with this paper is about substance rather than this particular presentation issue.\n\nWe believe because you didn't understand this point, you are missing some of the substance of the paper. Hopefully now you have a clearer picture of the contribution, that shows that a reinforcement learning actually works with these new approaches (especially forward prediction, which is a new algorithm never tried before in a reinforcement learning setting for text).\n \nWe will also update the related work section to make this contribution more clear compared to previous work.\n\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dialogue Learning With Human-in-the-Loop", "abstract": "An important aspect of developing conversational agents is to give a bot the ability to improve through communicating with humans and to learn from the mistakes that it makes.

This is only the first paper after Weston'16. This paper tries to investigate whether you can learn in an online fashion with humans in the loop using their responses, not just rewards, which has never been done before. \n\nIn retrospect, several findings may seem evident; however, when we started this investigation we did not know the answer to the following questions: can one learn from textual feedback alone when training from scratch (without an oracle policy)? What does it take to make methods working in the off-line setting perform well in the online one? Does it matter to make training more off-policy (increase the amount of data collection using the current policy)? Are these algorithm stable in practice? Can our training algorithms adapt to the richness of natural language spoken by humans? What's a setting that can work with humans in the loop? Our work provides a variety of simple and practical extensions for making the algorithms proposed by Weston NIPSP'16 work in a setting that matters for real applications. Of course, we hope that somebody will improve upon these results with entirely new algorithms in the future, but the analysis of the strong baseline methods we analyzed here is a required stepping stone.

To the best of my knowledge, this is a new quality of result that was achieved - in particular as close to full supervision results are reached in some cases in this less constraint setting.\n\nseveral points were raised that were in turn addressed by the authors:\n1. formalisation of the task (learning dialogue) is not precise. when can we declare success? \nThe answer of the authors is partially satisfying. For this particular work, it might make sense to more precisely set goals e.g. to be as good as full supervision.\n\n2. (along the line of the previous question:) dialogue can be seen as a form of noisy supervision. can you please report the classic supervision baselines for the particular model used? this would give a sense what fraction of the best case performance is achieved via dialogue learning.\nThe authors provided additional information along those lines - and I think this helps to understand how much of the overall goal was achieved and open challenges.\n\n3. is there an understanding of how much more difficult the MT setting is? feedback could be hand labeled as positive or negative for an analysis (?). or a handcrafted baseline could be tested, that either extracts the reward via template matching \u2026 or maybe even uses the length of the feedback as a proxy/baseline. (it looks to me that short feedback is highly correlated with high reward / correct answer (?))\nThe authors replied - but it would have been clearer if they could have quantified such suggested baseline, in order to confirm that there is no simple handcrafted baseline that would do well on the data - but these concerns are marginal.\n\n4. relation to prior work Weston\u201916 is not fully clear. I understand that this submission should be understood as an independent submission of the prior work Weston\u201916 - and not replacing it. In this case Weston\u201916 makes this submission appear more incremental. my understanding is that the punch line of this submission is the online part that leads in turn to more exploration. Is there any analysis on how much this aspect matters? I couldn\u2019t find this in the experiments.\nThe authors clarified the raised issues. The application of reinforcement learning and in particular FP is convincing.\n\nThere is a incremental nature to the paper - and the impression is emphasised by multiple concurrent contributions of the authors on this research thread. Comparison to prior work (in particular Weston'16), should be made more explicit. Not only in text but also in the experiments - as the authors partially do in their reply to the reviewers question. Nevertheless, this particular contribution is assessed as significant and worth sharing and seems likely to have impact on how we can learn in these less constraint setting.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dialogue Learning With Human-in-the-Loop", "abstract": "An important aspect of developing conversational agents is to give a bot the ability to improve through communicating with humans and to learn from the mistakes that it makes.

Evaluation of dialogue is an active research area, see e.g. \"Towards an Automatic Turing Test: Learning to Evaluate Dialogue Responses\" of Lowe et al, and beyond the scope of this work. One approach we think is worthwhile is for the community to collect a set of tasks, as has been done for games (Atari games, OpenAI universe, etc.) but for dialogue. The paper ''Evaluating Prerequisite Qualities for Learning End-to-End Dialog Systems'' of Dodge et al., takes a step towards this. \n2) For the MTurk experiments we already did this, see Table 5 in the appendix. For the simulation, we did not report that but\n we use the same datasets as Weston'16 which reported supervised baselines, so we can report them here too. We have updated the paper with that.\n3) In the simulated data both positive and negative template responses are between length 1 and 4, so there is no length information and the methods work. For MTurk, the idea of hand labeling text rewards as positive or negative (with 100% accuracy) is exactly like using RBI or the numerical rewards, which is what we compared to. The results show that RBI+FP is better than that\u2014  that is because there can be much more rich information in the text than just positive/negative reward. This is shown in Table 4 in the appendix which compares performance of different amounts of information in synthetic responses, where richer responses give better results.\n4) Please also see the answer to the 2nd question from AnonReviewer5. We consider this a followup work that fixes two big missing things: Weston'16 (i) didn't do a reinforcement learning setting, so it wasn't clear the methods even worked in the realistic online case, and (ii) they only tried on simulated data, so it wasn't clear it would work on real language. And yes, it turns out exploration for RBI and FP and balancing for FP are very important,  see Fig 3 (top left) and Fig 4 (top left) and Table 1. For example, eps=0 is no exploration, the algorithm used in Weston'16, and it completely fails. Finally, we also showed that online batch learning can work well, comparably to fully online learning, which is important for real experiments with MTurk, as it greatly simplifies data collection.\n\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dialogue Learning With Human-in-the-Loop", "abstract": "An important aspect of developing conversational agents is to give a bot the ability to improve through communicating with humans and to learn from the mistakes that it makes.

Much less studied is MemN2N with Forward Prediction (FP method) which we think is the more interesting case as rewards are not always available, but textual feedback is.  However, numerical rewards and textual feedback should be compared in the same setting. \nOnly one paper has studied MemN2N+FP so far (\u201cDialog-based Language Learning\u201d, J. Weston, NIPS '16). We consider this paper a followup to that paper that addresses two large missing pieces in that work: (i) That earlier work did not use the natural reinforcement learning/online setting, but \u201ccheated\u201d with a fixed policy given in advance. It is important to address the realistic online setting and assess whether the methods, particularly FP,  still work, or else what changes (e.g. exploration, balancing, see Fig 4 and Table 1) are needed. (ii) That earlier work had only simulated data, and no real-language data, so was only toy. This work uses Mechanical Turk to do real experiments, which again is important to assess if these methods, particularly FP, work on real language. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dialogue Learning With Human-in-the-Loop", "abstract": "An important aspect of developing conversational agents is to give a bot the ability to improve through communicating with humans and to learn from the mistakes that it makes.

Questions:\n\n1. How much discourse context is actually necessary here? The examples in Figure\n1 and Figure 2 suggest that almost all of the questions are one-off, and don't\nrequire the user to refer to earlier portions of the dialogue. (An example of an\nexchange _requiring_ dialogue context might be \"Q1: When was Forrest Gump\nreleased? Q2: Who is the lead actor?\".) If there are questions requiring\ndiscourse context, it would be great to see examples of them! If there are not,\nthen the task in this work is basically the same as the (large) literature on\nquestion answering in NLP. Comparable approaches should be cited at the very\nleast, and compared to where relevant. I know the BABI questions involve reasoning\nover multiple history steps, but many of the standard NLP question answering datasets\nalso involve this kind of extended reasoning and are not called \"dialogue\", which involves\na separate set of phenomena.\n\n2. I'm a little confused about positioning---can you clarify the intended contribution of\nthis paper? It seems like this work takes a well-studied model (MemN2N) combines it \nwith well-studied training procedures (REINFORCE and supervised training) and applies \nit to slightly new training data. Is the intended contribution of this paper an empirical \nevaluation of the ability of existing dialogue models to fine-tune on new domains? Or is there \na technical contribution as well?"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dialogue Learning With Human-in-the-Loop", "abstract": "An important aspect of developing conversational agents is to give a bot the ability to improve through communicating with humans and to learn from the mistakes that it makes.
