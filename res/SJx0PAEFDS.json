The paper proposes actdiff regularizer and demonstrates that it prevents such overfitting phenomenon on synthetic data.  However, there was no success on real data. This is important as it shows that the improvement reported in some saliency-map based approaches in the literature may be due to other regularization effects such as cutout.\n\nThis was a unique submission in my batch, as it embraces its negative results. Among our internal discussions, all reviewers that and we all believe that negative results are important and should be encouraged. However, in order for the negative results to be sufficiently insightful for the entire community, they need to be examined under well-organized experiments. This is the aspect that the reviewers think the paper needs to improve on.  In particular, R2 believes the paper could consider a larger set of possible regularizations as well as a broader range of  applications.

authors considered a situation where task relevant parts of the images are annotated as masks by the human experts.\nThe authors then proposed using Actdiff loss, Reconstruction loss, and Gradmask loss that are designed to suppress the effect of irrelevant features. \n\nI think the problem considered in this paper is interesting and important.\nAs the authors pointed out, the medical images taken from different hospitals may contain hospital-specific features which is irrelevant to the targeting task.\nThus, we need a way to train image classifiers that can ignore such irrelevant features.\n\nMy major concern on this study is the experiments.\nThe authors mention that part of their methods sometimes did not work (see below).\nThis makes the effectiveness of the proposed losses a bit questionable.\nIf I understad correctly, in practice, the users need to tune the weights of several losses carefully until they can obtain a good model.\nIf this is the case, I am not very sure if the proposed losses are essential, or tuning a right weight can occasionally provide good models.\n\n* (Sec4) \"Gradmask proves to be too powerful a regularizer for this task, and never produces a model with good generalization performance.\"\n\n* (Sec5) \"For the Cardiac dataset, the best performing method was classification with gradmask for the Convolutional AutoEncoder and with actdiff for the UNet, and each achieve similar performance.\"\n\n* (Sec5) \"The gradmask and combination actdiff and gradmask models improved over baseline, but there is no clear reason why this would be true from the saliency maps.\"\n\n* (Sec6) \"Both actdiff and gradmask improve performance of the model, but only actdiff scores above chance, and performs similarly to a model trained with the areas outside of the mask completely removed.\"\n\n### Updated after author response ###\nThe authors have tried to address my concern by re-running the experiments, which I greatly appreciate.\nHowever, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is not convincing enough.\nI expect the authors to design the more effective experiments in the future version.\nIt would be great if the authors can clarify and demonstrate which regularization is helpful under which circumstances and why, and when it is not.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures":

Please see Figure 4 for evidence that these regularizers are having powerful control over the saliency maps while barely changing generalization performance.", "comment": ">  The presentation of this paper is not clear. For example, in Table 1, the experiment name is so confusing. The authors mention that \u201cConv AE Actdiff\u201d is the one using both actdiff loss and reconstruction loss. Then what does \u201cConv AE Reconstruct Masked\u201d mean? \n\nThank you for pointing out this omission! We have clarified these issues in a dedicated section (Page 3; \u201cControl Experiments\u201d).\n\n>  Does Conv AE means they implicitly contain reconstruction loss? The authors should elaborate them clearly. The corresponding double quotation marks should be revised.\n\nThank you for this suggestion, we have clarified this point on Page 3 in the Reconstruction Loss section: \u201c In our experiments a reconstruction term is helpful for guiding the network toward building useful representations of the data while employing $\\mathcal{L}_{act}$. All auto-encoder models presented in this paper employed this loss term.\u201d.\n\n>  Figure 3 is also confusing. At first, I thought different lines represent different input data (one without mask and one with mask) and different columns represent different methods. However, this is not the case. Furthermore, the fourth column is more confusing. I do not see any red circles in the fourth column. Why the reconstruction of distractor is far away from the original one. Does the right top picture show the advantages of UNet Reconstruction or its drawbacks?\n\nThank you for pointing out the challenges with Figure 3. The individual images in the figure are meant to be read independently, there is no row or column logic, hence their individual titles that correspond to the results in the tables. We have clarified this in the caption: \u201cThese images correspond to the rows of Table \\ref{table:synthendresults}\u201d. We have clarified the meaning of the red arrows and fixed the mention of the circle. We also elaborate on the observation about the distractor flipping locations in the reconstruction .\n\n>  In fact, the training data with masking is not sufficient (may only available in some medical images). It is hard to utilize these data to generalize to various other tasks including large amounts of images without masking.\n\nWe agree that the requirement of masks limits the application of this method, but even more importantly, our results suggest that controling feature attribution in this method is unlikely to produce improved generalization performance in general, so this becomes a moot point. As an aside, we have some preliminary results suggesting that the method works if only some of the inputs are masked (see the Appendix, Section B). \n\n>  From the experiments on real tasks, I barely see improvements by the proposed method, which makes the conclusion unconvincing. \n\nWe are confused by this comment. Our conclusion is that controlling saliency (which our results clearly show) has a negligible impact on improving generalization. In other words, it appears you agree with our assessment of the results.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1193/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1193/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Underwhelming Generalization Improvements From Controlling Feature Attribution", "authors": ["Joseph D Viviano", "Becks Simpson", "Francis Dutil", "Yoshua Bengio", "Joseph Paul Cohen"], "authorids": ["joseph@viviano.ca", "becks.simpson@imagia.com", "francis.dutil@imagia.com", "yoshua.bengio@mila.quebec", "joseph@josephpcohen.com"], "keywords": ["interpretability", "medical", "generalization", "saliency"], "TL;DR": "There is hope that one can diagnose and fix overfitting in classifiers by studying and guiding their saliency maps, but we developed multiple methods to do this well and only see a minor positive effect on generalization.", "abstract": "Overfitting is a common issue in machine learning, which can arise when the model learns to predict class membership using convenient but spuriously-correlated image features instead of the true image features that denote a class.

We agree that it would have been better to run an extensive hyperparameter search for all models presented, but we did not have the time or computational resources available to support such a search. As a proxy, we tuned the hyperparameters on baselines and then applied those hyperparameters to our newly presented model.

We would also refer you to our response to reviewer 1, who covers many of the same concerns.\n\nIn the case of the blur, we tuned this using gradmask, since it is the less-novel of the approaches presented here, and we wanted to treat it as a baseline relative to actdiff. We suspect that if we properly tuned the hyperparameters of the models presented, we would get a small boost in performance for our actdiff and gradmask models, but we find it implausible that the performance boost would be so great that it would undermine the conclusion of our paper, namely, that large changes in feature attribution on the inputs (Figure 4, now updated with many more examples from the test set) of a classification network change the resulting performance of a model in underwhelming ways.

So here we are adding prior knowledge about what a doctor would want to look at to make a decision, evaluate whether this is happening, and the impact on classification performance.\n\n>  The paper's novelty is somewhat limited. The idea of regularizing using saliency maps has been explored and even applied to medical data like the MSD used here in Gradmask ... \n\nWe would like to point out that the original Gradmask reference is a workshop paper, and this is the first paper presenting that approach in detail. We used MSD for consistency: https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syx2z2aMqE  \n\n>  Activation matching is also common (e.g. [1]), though it has not been combined with masking before.\n\nThank you for this paper, we didn\u2019t realize that our method had the same construction as $L_{content}$ in this paper, and we have now cited it (Page 3). Our method uses the same image twice (one masked), which means the model does not learn any representations from regions outside of the mask.\n\n>  While the weights applied to the various losses are provided, it's not clear how they were tuned...\n\nExtensive hyperparameter searches were run for all baselines (e.g., Gaussian blur, learning rate) as stated in the text, and the same hyperparameters were used for all new methods, with no tuning done on their specific lambdas (i.e., the gradmask lambda, the Actdiff lambda). We agree that our new models would have achieved higher test scores if we ran full hyperparameter searches for each new proposed model, but we cannot run these experiments during the rebuttal period (due to the number of configurations presented and the number of seeds averaged over).\n\n>  The results (and the conclusions) suggest Actdiff is not very effective at increasing generalization...\n\nYes, while Actdiff clearly changes the saliency map dramatically (Figure 4, now updated to be much more comprehensive), it does not affect generalization performance, negatively or positively, in a consistent way. Given how interested people are in using saliency maps for model interpretability and for detecting overfitting, we believe this is an interesting empirical result.\n\n>  Missing experiments: In the Multi-Site experiment, compare to what happens when the circular mask is applied to all images and not just those from one site...\n\nThis was the experiment that we performed. The mask was applied to all images in the training set, which drew examples from both sites. We have made this clearer in the paper (Page 8).\n\n> Presentation weaknesses: In the synthetic dataset the model cannot tell the difference between correct and incorrect signals at train time...\n\nThe model always has access to the correct predictive signals (the crosses), so all models could learn the task if it also built features using the crosses. However, due to the dynamics of gradient descent, this never happens in practice without the actdiff regularizer.\n\n>  What is the Conv AE? I assume it is a CNN based autoencoder of some sort...\n\nYes, this is specified at the bottom of page 4, which is now more explicit. The full model is detailed in section B of the appendix (page 11).\n\n>  What are the lambda hyperparameters?..\n\nThank you for pointing out this oversight. They are indeed the weights of the loss terms, which we now make explicit.\n\n>  How does f(.) relate to the function o_l(.)?..\n\nf(.) the encoder of all models. o_l(.) is the preactivation outputs of layer l in f(.). This is general since an encoder is used in all experiments. This has been made clearer in the text (Page 3).\n\n>  * The MSD dataset is not clearly described...\n\nThank you, please see revised text (Page 5).\n\n>  I think only Conv AE and UNet contain reconstruction losses...\n\nYes, this is right. We now explicitly state \"All auto-encoder models presented in this paper employed [$L_{recon}$].\u201d (Page 3).\n\n> For me this paper requires special scruitiny because it presents a negative result.  ... Overall I think this paper is close but fails to meet the bar because it does a bit worse than expected on most criteria above.\n\nWe believe you like this paper, but are _underwhelmed_ with our execution. We believe we addressed all the concerns you raised except the issue of not extensively tuning the hyperparameters on the new methods we proposed. We share your disappointment that we did not have the resources to run these experiments, but are currently running them and would be happy to include these results in the camera-ready version. We stand by our finding that the regularizers (particularly actdiff) control the saliency maps, so we feel our conclusion is nevertheless justified (\"controlling saliency is a bad target for improving generalization performance\")."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1193/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1193/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Underwhelming Generalization Improvements From Controlling Feature Attribution", "authors": ["Joseph D Viviano", "Becks Simpson", "Francis Dutil", "Yoshua Bengio", "Joseph Paul Cohen"], "authorids": ["joseph@viviano.ca", "becks.simpson@imagia.com", "francis.dutil@imagia.com", "yoshua.bengio@mila.quebec", "joseph@josephpcohen.com"], "keywords": ["interpretability", "medical", "generalization", "saliency"], "TL;DR": "There is hope that one can diagnose and fix overfitting in classifiers by studying and guiding their saliency maps, but we developed multiple methods to do this well and only see a minor positive effect on generalization.", "abstract": "Overfitting is a common issue in machine learning, which can arise when the model learns to predict class membership using convenient but spuriously-correlated image features instead of the true image features that denote a class.

Then what does \u201cConv AE Reconstruct Masked\u201d mean? Does Conv AE means they implicitly contain reconstruction loss? The authors should elaborate them clearly. The corresponding double quotation marks should be revised. Figure 3 is also confusing. At first, I thought different lines represent different input data (one without mask and one with mask) and different columns represent different methods. However, this is not the case. Furthermore, the fourth column is more confusing. I do not see any red circles in the fourth column. Why the reconstruction of distractor is far away from the original one.

It extracts features from\nthe original input image and its masked version then encourages the two features\nto be similar at every layer of the CNN using an L2 loss.\n\nActdiff is compared to 5 other methods including a reconstruction loss and Gradmask (previous work).\n\n(evaluation - synthetic dataset)\nA synthetic dataset is constructed for a simple binary classification task based on the presence of simple shapes.\nTwo patterns can predict the correct class at train time, but one of the patterns is removed at test time so additional information (masks in this case)\nis required to specify which pattern the classifier should use.\nAll the losses except Actdiff achieve at best 50% accuracy on the val set, but Actdiff gets 80% or more accuracy on 3 of 4 tested model variations.\nThis shows that Actdiff can effectively introduce the relevant masking information.\n\n(evaluation - Medical Segmentation Decathalon)\nThis dataset provides 3 segmentation tasks (Liver, Cardiac, Pancreas), including ground truth masks for those images.\nAll 6 methods outperform all the others at least some of the time.\nThe conclusion is that adding mask information using Actdiff doesn't improve segmentation performance.\n\n(evaluation - Multi-Site dataset)\nA final task tries to construct another synthetic dataset out of real X-ray images\ncollected at two different places.\nThe train set is largely from one place and the test set is mostly from the other place, and masks are constructed so Actdiff can try to eliminate this bias.\nActdiff causes a negligible increase in performance.\n\nThe paper concludes that signals CNNs tend to fit to in this type of data are not very spatially distinct.\n\n\nStrengths\n---\n\nThere is some novelty in the approach. The actdiff loss makes sense and masking + activation mapping have not been tried together before to my knowledge.\n\nExperiments follow a logical progression, starting by verifying the idea on a synthetic dataset, then moving to real data, and then evaluating on a half-synthetic dataset designed to debug the approach.\n\nExperiments average over many random initializations.\n\nThe paper embraces its negative result.\n\n\nWeaknesses\n---\n\nThe approach is not very compelling to me:\n* Implicit in this paper is that any information outside the mask is a distractor and any information inside is not a distractor. Why should the particular masks chosen for the experiments have this property? How can an expert know which features a model will find useful?\n\nThe paper's novelty is somewhat limited. The idea of regularizing using saliency maps has been explored and even applied to medical data like the MSD used here in Gradmask (one of the strong baselines this paper compares to). Activation matching is also common (e.g. [1]), though it has not been combined with masking before.\n\nWhile the weights applied to the various losses are provided, it's not clear how they were tuned. In this case there may be lots of competing losses, so it's important to tune the weights somehow to ensure the tradeoff between losses is optimal.\n\nThe results (and the conclusions) suggest Actdiff is not very effective at increasing generalization. Table 2 reports test results on all datasets. In that table, each loss outperforms all the other losses in at least two cases (a case is a model-dataset pair).\n\n[1]: Gatys, Leon A. et al. \u201cA Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style.\u201d ArXiv abs/1508.06576 (2015): n. pag.\n\n\nMissing experiments:\n\n* In the Multi-Site experiment, compare to what happens when the circular mask is applied to all images and not just those from one site. This is a necessary control to be sure that any benefits from masking are due to domain transfer and not other regularization effects. Either conclusion could be useful, but it would be nice to know.\n\nPresentation weaknesses:\n\n* In the synthetic dataset the model cannot tell the difference between correct and incorrect signals at train time. Therefore, I think there's no way for some of the baselines (plain classifier, autoencoder) to generalize correctly. Is that right? If so, it should be clear that comparisons to these baselines are not fair when discussing the synthetic evaluation in section 4.\n\nMissing details / points of clarification:\n\n* What is the Conv AE? I assume it is a CNN based autoencoder of some sort. A detailed description of the non-standard architectures would be useful for reproducibility, though probably only in the appendix.\n\n* What are the lambda hyperparameters? I assume these are weights on the corresponding loss terms, but this is never made explicit.\n\n* How does f(.) relate to the function o_l(.)? Is o_l(.) an intermediate step in f(.)?\n\n* The MSD dataset is not clearly described. Is this a classification dataset where classes are different diseases? What do the ground truth masks capture?\n\n* I think only Conv AE and UNet contain reconstruction losses. This presentation is a bit confusing since reconstruction loss was presented as another loss and it shows up in the tables implicitly based on the architecture being compared.\n\n\nSuggestions\n---\n\n* This paper would be a bit more convincing if it started with a concrete example of the problem illustrated on some dataset (e.g., maybe an example from Gradmask). That may also help drive intuitions later on in the paper.\n\n\nPreliminary Evaluation\n---\n\nClarity: The paper is fairly clear.\nQuality: Quality is mixed. Lots of relevant experiments are reported but they don't support clear conclusions and I'm not sure how well the models were tuned.\nOriginality: There is some novelty, but it is limited as discussed above.\nSignificance: I see limited significance.\n\nFor me this paper requires special scruitiny because it presents a negative result. Here are some factors that come to mind when thinking about whether to publish a negative result:\n* Is the approach compelling? - This approach is not very compelling (e.g., comments about limited novelty and lack of concrete examples to boost intuition).\n* Are the experiments thorough? - The experiments could be significantly more thorough (e.g., comments about tuning lambda).\n* Will readers learn something useful? - This paper may help researchers trying to leverage similar intuitions, but it won't be very useful outside this audience.\n* Does the paper present experiments that promote deeper understanding of why the approach failed? - This paper makes significant reasonable steps in that direction with sections 4 and 6, but I was still a bit dissapointed with the conclusions of these sections.\n* Does the paper discuss alternative approaches that were investigated? - Many alterantive approaches were considered and their performance reported.\n\nOverall I think this paper is close but fails to meet the bar because it does a bit worse than expected on most criteria above.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1193/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1193/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Underwhelming Generalization Improvements From Controlling Feature Attribution", "authors": ["Joseph D Viviano", "Becks Simpson", "Francis Dutil", "Yoshua Bengio", "Joseph Paul Cohen"], "authorids": ["joseph@viviano.ca", "becks.simpson@imagia.com", "francis.dutil@imagia.com", "yoshua.bengio@mila.quebec", "joseph@josephpcohen.com"], "keywords": ["interpretability", "medical", "generalization", "saliency"], "TL;DR": "There is hope that one can diagnose and fix overfitting in classifiers by studying and guiding their saliency maps, but we developed multiple methods to do this well and only see a minor positive effect on generalization.", "abstract": "Overfitting is a common issue in machine learning, which can arise when the model learns to predict class membership using convenient but spuriously-correlated image features instead of the true image features that denote a class. These are typically visualized using saliency maps. In some object classification tasks such as for medical images, one may have some images with masks, indicating a region of interest, i.e., which part of the image contains the most relevant information for the classification. We describe a simple method for taking advantage of such auxiliary labels, by training networks to ignore the distracting features which may be extracted outside of the region of interest, on the training images for which such masks are available. This mask information is only used during training and has an impact on generalization accuracy in a dataset-dependent way. We observe an underwhelming relationship between controlling saliency maps and improving generalization performance.", "code": "https://github.com/bigtrellis2222/activmask", "pdf": "/pdf/5bbab21af0d591c439a435e5649193e8bf595936.pdf", "paperhash": "viviano|underwhelming_generalization_improvements_from_controlling_feature_attribution", "original_pdf": "/attachment/6b43e6bf77562b7b97778eae28c4b8c6f5e1e01a.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nviviano2020underwhelming,\ntitle={Underwhelming Generalization Improvements From Controlling Feature Attribution},\nauthor={Joseph D Viviano and Becks Simpson and Francis Dutil and Yoshua Bengio and Joseph Paul Cohen},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJx0PAEFDS}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
