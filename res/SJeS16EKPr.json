This is addressed in the revised submission.\n\n> I would suggest to give a clear definition of the problem before delving into the theory in section 2. In its current version, it is difficult to assess how the parts of section 2 relate to the overall objective.\n\nI hope the my new introduction and theory section clarifies these aspects.\n\n\n> The objective function needs to be clearly stated and related to the loss function in eq. (7). \n\nThe objective function is precisely Eq. (7). I changed the terminology; assuming this was the source of your doubts.\n\n\n> ... the double blind review process is compromised as the paper links to code in the author\u2019s public github account. \n\nSorry for that. My reasoning was that the anonymity was compromised anyway by the paper being on the arxiv, but I see now that would have still required an active search at least.\n\n\n> Finally, the empirical results are quite incomplete. It is not clear how the results compare to generative methods like VAEs, which are referenced as a motivation for this work in this work.\n\nI agree that more comparisons would be useful.\n\nThe reason I didn't do any heads-on comparison about the quality of the latent variables so far stems from the actual differences between the two approaches. My approach doesn't work as an autoencoder for instance, which prevents the more objective benchmarks (unsupervised pretraining). Moreover, it also doesn't naturally produces samples, which also prevents standard qualitative tests. Although I tried to go around this by using noisy images in my last experiments, I thought the result wasn't good enough to pursue this route. But I am exploring different ideas at the moment.\n\nAlso I'm not sure yet how to directly compare the ability of this approach to model the full conditional distribution against other methods.\n\n\n> The improvement in convergence from RFA for supervised learning is interesting and this aspect deserves more analysis. It would be useful to look at the total amount of computation required to reach a given loss. \n\nYes I should have specified that the amount of computation, or clock time, is essentially the same for all approaches. Indeed, only the objective is different, and the computational cost is dominated by the forward and backward passes through the neural net. This may not be the case for larger number of classes, however, mainly because this may require larger batches. I added a paragraph explaining this.\n\n\n> I also wonder how this differs from simply mapping the output of the first network to a low-rank space via PCA. Is the dual-view really necessary in this case since the information content in the label space must be very limited, beyond simple class balance statistics?\n\nI tried to explain this in the first paragraph of that section. The dual view is not necessary in the sense that we need only one neural net, with the exact same architecture as for standard supervised learning (with one tanh output per category). The second network can be replaced by the one-hot encoding function on the labels, which is optimal. The DCCA objective doesn't simplify very much if this is hand-coded into it, and I'm not sure how it would relate to PCA. Also, a second (fast) inference step is still needed. \n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper299/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper299/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "We introduce an new technique to learn correlations between two types of data.\nThe learned representation can be used to directly compute the expectations of functions over one type of data conditioned on the other, such as Bayesian estimators and their standard deviations. \nSpecifically, our loss function teaches two neural nets to extract features representing the probability vectors of highest singular value for the stochastic map (set of conditional probabilities) implied by the joint dataset, relative to the inner product defined by the Fisher information metrics evaluated at the marginals.\nWe test the approach using a synthetic dataset, analytical calculations, and inference on occluded MNIST images. \nSurprisingly, when applied to supervised learning (one dataset consists of labels), this approach automatically provides regularization and faster convergence compared to the cross-entropy objective.\nWe also explore using this approach to discover salient independent features of a single dataset.

The second sentence of the introduction lists possibilities such as time series and multi-modalities that I would have been very interesting.\n\nI agree, but that's still work in progress. I thought that the theoretical contribution was sufficiently interesting to warrant this submission.\n\n\n> * The first claim that there is no tunable variable in the objective function is a little hard to parse. Clearly, the rank of the low-rank approximation must be set, and the features of the two spaces need to be learned. Some clarification here would be helpful. \n\nThe objectives for VAE and related variational algorithms are linear combinations of two or more competing losses. I was referring to the \"Lagrange parameters\" in these linear combinations. They complicate the learning process, as they must be set to carefully balances to different losses, and there have no known correct theoretical values.\n\nThe rank cutoff has a known theoretical best value: the larger the better. Also it is rather easy to see from the obtained spectrum whether it is too small or unnecessarily large (by checking if the spectrum reaches zero). \n\n\n> * There are a number of unfortunate typos/grammar issues/presentation choices that really impact clarity...\n\nThanks, I fixed those in the latest draft.\n\n\n> * How should the low-rank parameter k_0 be selected generally given that the singular value distribution may not always be useful in selecting it?\n\nIn the latest revision, I added a graphs of the singular values obtained after 150 epochs for different values of the cutoff k_0. I think it gives a good idea of the typical behaviour I've observed so far. We can see that the spectrum converges, with typically less reliability on the smallest eigenvalues.\n\n\n> * Can anything be said quantitatively or qualitatively about the sample complexity required to estimate the matrices of (8) well enough to estimate the features?\n\nThat's an important question, but I haven't done a theoretical analysis of this aspect so far. In doi:10.1093/imaiai/ias001  the authors state that the number of sample needed to estimate a covariance matrix (as measured in spectral norm and assuming a Gaussian distributions) goes as k_0/eps^2, where k_0 is the dimension and eps a bound on the spectral distance.  But I'm not sure what value of eps is adequate for DCCA.  In my experiments, it appeared to work as long as the batch size were at least 10-20 times larger than the dimension k_0. \n\n> * Is there an interpretation for why both spaces require the same feature dimension, k_0?\n\nYes: the rank of the effective representation of the channel N is bounded by the smallest of the dimensions, so the difference between the two ranks would just yield as many zero singular values.\n\n\n> * Consider placing a concrete, motivating example prior to the theory section as it is hard to digest\n\nThe new version of the introduction should be more clear.\n\n\n> * The last statement of the paragraph under (3) needs a reference.\n\nSee for instance https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition. \n\n\n> * It seems strange to have the supervised learning experiment of 4.1 as the first experimental result of the paper since it is an unintended and unexplained side-effect of the approach. Also, the claim of \"faster convergence\" should be demonstrated in wall-clock time.\n\nI changed the order in the new draft.\n\nI added a comment to the effect that epoch is a fair proxy for clock time in that case. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper299/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper299/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "We introduce an new technique to learn correlations between two types of data.\nThe learned representation can be used to directly compute the expectations of functions over one type of data conditioned on the other, such as Bayesian estimators and their standard deviations. \nSpecifically, our loss function teaches two neural nets to extract features representing the probability vectors of highest singular value for the stochastic map (set of conditional probabilities) implied by the joint dataset, relative to the inner product defined by the Fisher information metrics evaluated at the marginals.\nWe test the approach using a synthetic dataset, analytical calculations, and inference on occluded MNIST images. \nSurprisingly, when applied to supervised learning (one dataset consists of labels), this approach automatically provides regularization and faster convergence compared to the cross-entropy objective.\nWe also explore using this approach to discover salient independent features of a single dataset.

This is performed by modeling features with neural networks and optimizing an objective function that maximizes a measure of correlation between the features versus learning a generative model such as a CVAE. Some illustrative examples using MNIST are provided.\n\nMy decision is to reject. I think there is value in the approach, but it is hard to see clearly at the moment given that the exposition is difficult to follow and the experiments aren't very compelling. If these issues could be addressed (concrete suggestions below), and some of the follow-on work in the last section could be performed, I think there could be a pretty interesting contribution here.\n\n***\n\nDecision-related suggestions/questions:\n\n* Include more datasets in the experimental section. The second sentence of the introduction lists possibilities such as time series and multi-modalities that I would have been very interesting.\n\n* The first claim that there is no tunable variable in the objective function is a little hard to parse. Clearly, the rank of the low-rank approximation must be set, and the features of the two spaces need to be learned. Some clarification here would be helpful. \n\n* There are a number of unfortunate typos/grammar issues/presentation choices that really impact clarity. Some examples:\n\t* In the third paragraph under theory, \"...linear spaces spanned by the probability distributions...\" should probably be \"...linear spaces spanned by all probability distributions...\" (?)\n\t* The following sentence is a run-on. \n\t* In (8), occurrences of g_*(x_n) should be replaced with g_*(y_n).\n\t* The replacement of the (low) rank symbol, k_0, with the sample size symbol, n, in the second paragraph of section 4.1.\n\t* Introducing a \"Bayesian estimator for an l^2 distance\" w/o explanation. What does this mean?\n\n* How should the low-rank parameter k_0 be selected generally given that the singular value distribution may not always be useful in selecting it?\n\n* Can anything be said quantitatively or qualitatively about the sample complexity required to estimate the matrices of (8) well enough to estimate the features?\n\n* Is there an interpretation for why both spaces require the same feature dimension, k_0?\n\n***\n\nComments not related to decision:\n\n* It is generally good to avoid sweeping statements such as the first sentence of the introduction. Perhaps consider replacing with a simple statement on the intended goal of the paper: \"...produce a useful model of correlations... for the task of data generation...\"\n\n* Consider placing a concrete, motivating example prior to the theory section as it is hard to digest (from an ML perspective) without a clear context. The analytical example with the Gaussian from the supplementary material is one option.\n\n* The last statement of the paragraph under (3) needs a reference.\n\n* It seems strange to have the supervised learning experiment of 4.1 as the first experimental result of the paper since it is an unintended and unexplained side-effect of the approach.

A theoretical exposition is given and some empirical results are provided showing that the approach speeds up convergence on supervised MNIST and can be used for image completion (again on MNIST).\n\nThe paper should be rejected for the following reasons. First, the approach looks very similar to deep CCA, but the connection is never mentioned. This connection needs to be clarified. The objective function needs to be clearly stated and related to the loss function in eq. (7). In particular, I would suggest to give a clear definition of the problem before delving into the theory in section 2. In its current version, it is difficult to assess how the parts of section 2 relate to the overall objective. The paper severely lacks in relation to relevant related work. Half(!) of the 14 referenced papers are by the author himself. This can be verified since the double blind review process is compromised as the paper links to code in the author\u2019s public github account. Finally, the empirical results are quite incomplete. It is not clear how the results compare to generative methods like VAEs, which are referenced as a motivation for this work in this work.\n\nThe improvement in convergence from RFA for supervised learning is interesting and this aspect deserves more analysis. It would be useful to look at the total amount of computation required to reach a given loss. I also wonder how this differs from simply mapping the output of the first network to a low-rank space via PCA. Is the dual-view really necessary in this case since the information content in the label space must be very limited, beyond simple class balance statistics?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper299/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper299/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "We introduce an new technique to learn correlations between two types of data.\nThe learned representation can be used to directly compute the expectations of functions over one type of data conditioned on the other, such as Bayesian estimators and their standard deviations. \nSpecifically, our loss function teaches two neural nets to extract features representing the probability vectors of highest singular value for the stochastic map (set of conditional probabilities) implied by the joint dataset, relative to the inner product defined by the Fisher information metrics evaluated at the marginals.\nWe test the approach using a synthetic dataset, analytical calculations, and inference on occluded MNIST images. \nSurprisingly, when applied to supervised learning (one dataset consists of labels), this approach automatically provides regularization and faster convergence compared to the cross-entropy objective.\nWe also explore using this approach to discover salient independent features of a single dataset.
