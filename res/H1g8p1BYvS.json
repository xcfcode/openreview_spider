The central claim of the paper is that existing datasets on which models are trained are potentially biased, and are not reflective of real world scenarios. By discarding samples that add to this bias, the idea is to make the model perform better in the wild. The authors propose a method to do so, and then refine it so that the resulting solution is tractable. They implement the method on several datasets and show that by finding these adversarial samples, they indeed hurt model performance. \n\nCOMMENTS:\n- Overall the method seems to be something like what is done in k-fold CV, except here we want to find a subset that is the worst at predicting model performance. To this end, I find the introduction of terms like \"representation bias\" and \"predictability scores\" unnecessary. Why not model the entire problem in terms of classification error? \n\n- Page 3 : the last 2 paragraphs are repeated from above. \n\nE: i read the author responses and they addressed my concern about model performance in the wild. I have updated my score to reflect this. \n\n- eqn (3) and the set of equations above: for the math to work, you need q(i) to have non-zero support on all samples. To that end, the sentence that says it works for \"any\" q() is incorrect. \n\n- The experiments back your claim that your method makes the data more challenging to train on. But that does not address the central idea, that the resultant models do better in the wild. If the aim is to make the models robust to real world, you have provided no evidence that your method does so. \n\n- Table 1: the D_92k column is good comparison to have.

They introduce an algorithm that selects more representative data points from the dataset that allow to get a better estimate of the performance\u00a0in the wild. The algorithm ends up selecting more difficult/confusing instances.\n\nThis paper is easy to read and follow (apart from some hickup with a copy of three paragraphs), but in my opinion of limited use/impact.\n\nComments:\n1) There is a repetition of the \" while this expression\u00a0formalizes..\" paragraph and the next paragraph and the paragraph \"As opposed to ..\" is out of place. Please fix\n2) I am not sure \n- What applications the authors suggest. They seem to say that benchmark authors should run their algorithm and make benchmarks harder. To me it seems that benchmarks become harder because you remove most important instances from the training data (so Table 4 is not surprising - you remove the most representative instances so the model can't learn)\n- how practically feasible it is.  Even if in previous point I am wrong, the algo requires retraining the models on subsets (m iterations). How large is this m?\n3) Other potential considerations:\n-  When you change the training size, the model potentially needs to be re-tuned (regularization etc) (although it might be not that severe since the size of the training data is preserved at t)\n- How do u chose the values of hyperparams\u00a0(t, m,k eta), how is performance of your algorithm depends on it\n4) I don't see any good baselines to compare with - what if i just chose instances that get the highest prediction score on a model and remove these.

Training on the filtered subset prevents models from overfitting to such correlations, hence yields decreased benchmark performance [as noted by R3]. This, in itself, is an important finding because a significant fraction of empirical, applied ML research is evaluated off of these benchmarks. \n\nIn addition, in response to R1 and R3, we have now explicitly tried to address this question: \n- Do models trained on AF-Lite filtered data generalize better to data in the wild?\n\nWe found the answer to be \u201cyes\u201d! More concretely, we provide new experimental results on three additional benchmarks: zero-shot evaluation on two diagnostic Natural Language Inference (NLI) datasets  (HANS; McCoy et al., 2019, NLI Diagnostics; Wang et al., 2018) as well as transfer learning on the newly released Adversarial-NLI dataset (Nie et al., 2019).

This does not necessarily involve removing the most important instances from the training data, but those which are spuriously correlated with the ground truth, making the overall task trivially easier. Once such correlations are minimized (i.e. after filtering with AFLite), the performance reduces. \n\nImpact 2: Do models trained on AFLite-filtered data generalize better? YES! :\nA second contribution of our work is demonstrating that the presence of instances with spurious correlations with the ground truth prevents models from generalizing to real world data. Our new results on three additional benchmarks show that a model trained on the AFLite-filtered dataset generalizes better than a model trained on the full SNLI dataset (Sec 3.2.1; also please see overall response: https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1g8p1BYvS&noteId=rJeVCr85sS ).\n\nComputational Overhead: \n[R1 (2)] Our approach operates on precomputed representations of the instances and relies on inexpensive logistic regressions. As a result, it is very efficient, scalable and parallelizable. It can efficiently run on CPU machines as well, and an effective value for m is a multiple of the number of available cores (e.g., 64 or 128).\n\nHyperparameters:\n[R1 (3)] We have updated the draft to provide more information about the different hyperparameters (Sec 2; Implementation). These were selected based on the learning curves observed when training the model that we use to generate feature embeddings for the rest of the data, as well as the available computational budget (#CPU cores etc.). The training size, t, is kept constant throughout the algorithm, as R1 correctly points out; hence we do not modify the hyperparameters across iterations.\n\nNew Baselines:\n[R1 (4)] As Reviewer 1 suggested, we have now provided a baseline (Sec 3.2 paragraph 6) which filters out the most predictable examples in a single pass. This corresponds to a non-iterative version of AFLite. For the SNLI task, this baseline (dev acc = 72.1%), however, is not as powerful as the full AFLite model (dev acc = 62.6%). This demonstrates the need for an iterative procedure involving models trained on multiple partitions in each iteration.\n\nRetraining post-AFLite:\n[R1 (5)] We do indeed completely retrain models after creating the filtered dataset. With the exception of finetuning the same pretrained representations such as RoBERTa (publicly available), there is no sharing of parameters between the older model trained on the full dataset, and the newer model trained on the filtered dataset. Moreover, the parameters used during the AFLite filtering are not reused when reporting benchmark performance. As shown in our experiments, these new representations, however, are unable to recover the original performance.\n\nOthers:\n[R1 (1)] We apologize for the duplicates, and have fixed the issue in the updated draft.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1989/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1989/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Filters of Dataset Biases", "authors": ["Ronan Le Bras", "Swabha Swayamdipta", "Chandra Bhagavatula", "Rowan Zellers", "Matthew Peters", "Ashish Sabharwal", "Yejin Choi"], "authorids": ["ronanlb@allenai.org", "swabhas@allenai.org", "chandrab@allenai.org", "rowanz@cs.washington.edu", "matthewp@allenai.org", "ashishs@allenai.org", "yejinc@allenai.org"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Large-scale benchmark datasets have been among the major driving forces in AI, supporting training of models and measuring their progress.

We apply it to popular benchmarks that are practically solved --- ImageNet and Natural Language Inference (SNLI, MNLI, QNLI) --- and present filtered counterparts as new challenge datasets where the model performance drops considerably (e.g., from 84% to 24% for ImageNet and from 92% to 62% for SNLI), while human performance remains high. An extensive suite of analysis demonstrates that AFLite effectively reduces measurable dataset biases in both the synthetic and real datasets. Finally, we introduce new measures of dataset biases based on K-nearest-neighbors to help guide future research on dataset developments and bias reduction.\u00a0", "pdf": "/pdf/dae9382653439c53c5698a5c93ae5e30e11215d2.pdf", "paperhash": "bras|adversarial_filters_of_dataset_biases", "original_pdf": "/attachment/3faa39f81520f9300ebe0555d3d26b41572ba65c.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nbras2020adversarial,\ntitle={Adversarial Filters of Dataset Biases},\nauthor={Ronan Le Bras and Swabha Swayamdipta and Chandra Bhagavatula and Rowan Zellers and Matthew Peters and Ashish Sabharwal and Yejin Choi},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1g8p1BYvS}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"required": true, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).
