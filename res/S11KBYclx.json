None of the reviewers championed the paper, however. They all stated that the paper just did not go far enough in showing that the method is really useful in practice.

We fixed the axis label, and added a more detailed description of LastSeenValue and why it is not used in all experiments.\n\nDomhan et al. did not study SGLD or SGHMC, but used a general purpose, gradient-free MCMC sampler. To efficiently sample the weights of the network, a sampler that can leverage a noisy gradient is crucial. We\u2019ve now emphasized that difference in the paper.\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that the overheads of fitting the BNN from scratch at every epoch would be quite high and could quickly become non-negligible. One option for avoiding this high overhead is to use approximate updates of the BNN as new data becomes available and only refit the model from scratch periodically. The option we chose in our exemplary hyperparameter optimization experiment is even simpler: we only refit the model after every internal iteration of Hyperband, yielding a method that has almost no overhead and already leads to large speedups over both Hyperband and Bayesian optimization. Of course, this solution still leaves performance potential untapped, and in future work we aim to explore methods that refit & exploit the model in more fine-grained steps; we expect further improvements from doing so.\n\nWe bound the prediction of the asymptotic value by using a sigmoid function as output. Intuitively this should help since we mostly model validation accuracy which is limited to be in [0, 1]. However, even if other metrics are optimized (such as the lower bound of the likelihood in the Variational Auto-Encoder case) it is typically straightforward to scale them to lie in [0, 1].  \n\nFor Figure 7 and Table 1, all models predicted unseen learning curves completely. The resulting MSE and ALL capture the model\u2019s ability to describe whole learning curves from beginning to end. This part is complementary to the extrapolation of partially observed curves. At this point, we do not draw sample learning curves from our model which would require to condition the prediction on the performance in previous epochs. This would be an integral part when using our model in look-ahead methods, which could be an interesting direction for future research.\n\nWe tried different numbers of basis function and found that often just a small set of diverse basis functions is sufficient to achieve good quality. Just increasing the number of basis function would rather hurt as it also increases the number of parameters and thus makes the regression problem harder for the neural network.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Curve Prediction with Bayesian Neural Networks", "abstract": "Different neural network architectures, hyperparameters and training protocols lead to different performances as a function of time.\nHuman experts routinely inspect the resulting learning curves to quickly terminate runs with poor hyperparameter settings and thereby considerably speed up manual hyperparameter optimization.

In the new Section 3.4 of the revised version of the paper, we report results on integrating it into the Hyperband method (in a nutshell, this runs very many hyperparameter settings for a short time, then drops half, continue running, drops half, etc; here, we use our model to decide which ones to drop). Even though the function evaluations in our experiments are relatively cheap for deep learning experiments (a few hours at most), and even though the time for training our model is not negligible, these experiments show substantial speedups over Bayesian optimization for finding solutions very close to optimal.

What I'd like to know, which I wish I'd asked during pre-review questions, is whether the authors plan to release their code. Do you? I sincerely hope so, because I think the code would be a significant part of the paper's contribution, since the nature of the paper is more practical than conceptual.\n\nThe experiments in the paper seem thorough but the results are a bit underwhelming. I'm less interested in the part about whether the learning curves are actually modeled well, and more interested in the impact on hyperparameter optimization. I was hoping to see BIG speedups as a result of using this method, but I am left feeling unsure how big the speedup really is. Instead of \"objective function vs. iterations\" I would be more interested in the inverse plot: number of iterations needed to get to a fixed objective function value. Since what I'm really interested in is how much time I can save. Ideally there would also be some mention of real time as sometimes these hyperparameter optimization methods are themselves so slow that they end up being unusable. \n\nFinally, one figure that I feel is missing is a histogram of termination times over different runs. This would provide me with more intuition than all the other figures. Because it would tell me, what fraction of runs are being terminated early. And, how early? Right now I have no sense of this, except that at least *some* runs are clearly being terminated early, since this is neccessary for the proposed method to outperform other methods.\n\nOverall, I think this paper merits acceptance because it is a solid effort on an interesting problem.

This is an exploratory paper, in that the ultimate goal is to use this method in a Bayesian optimization system, but for now the experiments are limited to assessing the quality of the predictions. This builds on previous work in Domhan, 2015, however in this work the model incorporates information from all tested hyperparameter settings rather than just extrapolating from a single learning curve. This paper also explores two MCMC methods for inference: SGLD and SGHMC, but I couldn\u2019t tell if either of these were tested in Domhan, 2015 as well.\n\nThe performance seems overall positive, particularly in the initial phase of each curve where there is very little information. In this case, as expected, sharing knowledge across curves helps. One regime which did not seem to be tested, but might be very informative, is when some curves in the training set have been mostly, or fully observed. This might be a case where sharing information really helps.\n\nSomething that concerns me about this approach is the timing. The authors stated that to train the network takes about 20-60 seconds. In the worst case, with 100 epochs, this results in a little over 1.5 hours spent training the Bayesian network. This is a non-trivial fraction of the several hours it takes to train the model being tuned.\n\nThe Bayesian network makes many separate predictions, as shown in Figure 2. It would be interesting to see how accurate some of these individual pieces are. For example, did you bound the asymptotic value of the learning curve, since you mostly predicted accuracy? If not, did the value tend to lie in [0,1]?\n\nBelow are some minor questions/comments.\n\nFigure 1 axes should read \u201cvalidation accuracy\u201d\nFigure 6 can you describe LastSeenValue (although it seems self-explanatory, it\u2019s good to be explicit) in the bottom left figure, and why isn\u2019t it used anywhere else as a baseline?\nFigure 7 and Table 1 are you predicting just the final value of the curves? Or every value along each curve, conditioned on the previous values?\nWhy do you only use 5 basis functions? Does this sufficiently capture all of the flexibility of these learning curves? Would more basis functions help or hurt?\n", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Curve Prediction with Bayesian Neural Networks", "abstract": "Different neural network architectures, hyperparameters and training protocols lead to different performances as a function of time.\nHuman experts routinely inspect the resulting learning curves to quickly terminate runs with poor hyperparameter settings and thereby considerably speed up manual hyperparameter optimization.

For example, what is \"vapor pressure\" -- is it one of your basis functions? Are these basis functions described somewhere? And, unlike the other ones in Fig 3, vapor pressure can become negative -- does this have any implications (good or bad)?\n\nAlso, aside from vapor pressure, it seems that the other basis functions are monotonically decreasing. Is this true? And, if so, will they have trouble modeling real learning curves that are not monotonic?\n\nOn another note, I just want to make sure I understand things correctly. I asked myself, \"why do we still need the basis functions at all instead of just using the BNN for everything?\" I assume the answer is that we want to enforce these characteristic decaying shapes and the BNN might not do this (as in Figure 5, left-hand side, green curve). Am I understanding correctly?\n\nFinally, I couldn't find any mention/discussion of the right-hand panels of Figure 6. Could you please clarify their significance?"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Curve Prediction with Bayesian Neural Networks", "abstract": "Different neural network architectures, hyperparameters and training protocols lead to different performances as a function of time.\nHuman experts routinely inspect the resulting learning curves to quickly terminate runs with poor hyperparameter settings and thereby considerably speed up manual hyperparameter optimization.
