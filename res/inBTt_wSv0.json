As a way to mitigate the cost of generating individual perturbation for each state in each episode, the authors proposed several variants to use same perturbation across different states across different episodes. While reviewers recognize the potential of the direction, they are not comfortable accepting the paper at its current state. The experiment results in its current form does not provide enough support to the claim. In particular, it is unclear how much the shared perturbation changes the original perception in comparison to the individual comparison, and how should the impact number differences be interpreted. Reviewers brought up concerns regarding all the experiments being evaluated on a DDQN agent, and not enough clarities has been provided on the different design choices. If perceptual similarity is not the indicator of environment transferability, do the authors have intuition on what does?

They defined different types of perturbations, like different perturbations for each state, or apply the perturbations on the initial state on every state. The authors tested these perturbations in some existing environments.\n- The conclusions of this submission are unclear and questionable. The authors showed many results in their submission, but all the conclusions are plausible. The results look pretty random, and I do not believe we can draw conclusions from them. For example, in table 2, the impacts of A_M^random are large, even comparable with A^individual. The A_M^random is more like a fixed random noise, so we cannot draw conclusions about transferability from it. It would be helpful to add two new baselines, one is fixed random noise, another is iid random noise, to demonstrate these adversaries are different from random noise.\n- Equations 1 and 2 do not make sense. For the equations wrote by the authors, J(s) is a constant, and we should always let s_adv equal to s.\n\n--Post Rebuttal--\nThank the authors for the response. I agree with other reviewers that the task is interesting and the submission has great potential, but might need another round of editing. The results show \"a single perturbation from a random state of a completely different MDP\" is not normally distributed. However, I agree with R4 that applying a single perturbation from a random state of another MDP does not make sense unless the two MDP and the two states have some similarities.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1786/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1786/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Exploring Transferability of Perturbations in Deep Reinforcement Learning", "authorids": ["~Ezgi_Korkmaz1"], "authors": ["Ezgi Korkmaz"], "keywords": ["transferability", "deep reinforcement learning", "generalization", "adversarial"], "abstract": "The use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as function approximators has led to striking progress for reinforcement learning algorithms and applications.

(2020). \n\nEven if the inputs were quite similar, Deep RL models trained for different games perform semantically quite different tasks, and so it is not a priori obvious that a perturbation effective in one game will transfer to another. Indeed there are some pairs of games where perturbations do not transfer well, and some where they do. Further, this does not seem correlated with the perceptual similarity of the inputs for the pairs of games as shown in Appendix A.2.\n\n5. \"Besides, all experiments are done only on DDQN, hence the claims are hardly validated\":\n\nWe also added a new section dedicated to policy gradient evaluation in the Appendix Section A.1. Please let us know if you have any further questions. We would gladly address them.\n\n6.  Would it be possible to elaborate on \u201c why none of the referred methods for adversarial attacks in RL are tested\u201d? We were a little bit confused by what was meant by this comment.\n\n 7.  \"It is also not explained how the environments are chosen.\":\n\nEnvironments are chosen based on the diversity in their action set sizes,  the perceptual dissimilarity of the states, and the semantic differences between the tasks learned in different games from the Atari Baselines. In particular, for perceptual similarity differences see Appendix Section A.2. For action size  and semantic differences please see Bellemare et. al. (2013). For a small example BankHeist ([BankHeist-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/BankHeist-v0/)) and Amidar ([Amidar-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Amidar-v0/)) can be categorized as relatively more similar based on the semantics of the learned tasks and the perceptual similarity of the states. Also note that DRL algorithms still cannot perform well across all the games uniformly (Wang et. al. (2016)). Therefore, we also did not focus on the games where the algorithm does not perform well yet. Also please see related work on adversarial deep reinforcement learning on the set of games used in Lin et. al (2017), Sun et. al. (2020), Huang et. al.

I am hardly convinced by this statement and led by this statement, the proposed approach in this work.\u201d:\n\nThe importance of black-box attacks is also a quite well studied field.

(2018).\n\nIn particular the Carlini-Wagner adversarial formulation takes 10000 iteration to lower the $\\ell_2$-norm of the adversarial perturbation to 0.1 and one might agree that this is even more computationally expensive when the perturbation is computed custom to each state and added to agent\u2019s observation in real time before the agent perceives the state. In comparison our adversarial framework from Definition 2 through Definition 6 only requires one fixed pre-computed adversarial offset vector, resulting in a computation which is significantly more efficient, and which also does not have to be performed in real time as the agent moves to new states. \n\nWe also did not expect it to be controversial to claim that having the ability to apply a new perturbation to each of the agent\u2019s observations in real-time is a very strong assumption. It seems reasonable that one might not expect this assumption to hold in many real-world applications e.g. the perception system of a self driving car. In particular, assuming that one has  the ability to both access and modify a self driving car\u2019s perception system in real time, before the state is observed by the car, is a stronger assumption than simply having the ability to apply a sticker to the car\u2019s camera lens. Since the approach in our paper relies on only a single fixed adversarial offset vector, it could also plausibly be implemented by camera stickers as in (Li et. al. 2019).\n\n[Athalye et al.

Prior work on adversarial examples in DRL has focused on computing new perturbations customized to either each state of the game (Huang et al. (2017)) or customized to the set of states chosen to be attacked (Sun et al. (2020); Lin et al. (2017)). This requires the ability to access and modify the state observations of the agent in real-time before the agent perceives the states, whereas the $A_M^{random}$ adversary in our paper does not. In particular, our paper shows that by computing a single perturbation from a random state of a completely different MDP it is possible to substantially degrade the performance of trained DRL agents. This was not known before and we find it quite surprising.\n \n2. \"I speculate that a better generalized policy (like A3C) instead of DDQN could still perform well since it has all the actions required to get the maximum return.\"\n \nAt your suggestion we tested an A3C agent in Pong using our framework. We computed a single perturbation from a completely different MDP TimePilot trained with DDQN, and added that single perturbation to the states visited by the A3C agent in Pong. This still results in large impact, showing that perturbations computed in one MDP with a different algorithm do indeed transfer to A3C agents. Please see Appendix Section A.1.\n \n3. \" In figure 1, there are two CrazyClimber plots. One of them needs to be changed.\":\n\nThanks for catching this. We have fixed this in the paper.\n\n4. \u201cIn addition, in Pong, agent needs to press the \u201cfire\u201d button (action 1) to start each round of the game. Without loss of generality, this could be overwritten in an engineering matter (like what has been done in DeepMind Atari wrapper) so the agent still be able to perform without being concerned about the \u201cfire\u201d button.\u201d\n\nAs we cite in the paper we use OpenAI Gym Brockman et. al (2016) not DeepMind Atari wrapper. OpenAI Gym Pong action set size is 6 with the following meanings [\u2018NOOP\u2019, \u2018FIRE\u2019, \u2018RIGHT\u2019, \u2018LEFT\u2019, \u2018RIGHTFIRE\u2019, \u2018LEFTFIRE\u2019].The action size 6 is redundant where \u2018FIRE\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018NOOP\u2019, \u2018LEFT\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018LEFTFIRE\u2019, and \u2018RIGHT\u2019 is equal to \u2018RIGHTFIRE\u2019. In particular, for the numbers used in Figure 1 and Figure 2 action \u20180\u2019 is equivalent to action \u20181\u2019, action \u20182\u2019 is equivalent to action \u20184\u2019 and action \u20183\u2019 is equivalent to action \u20185\u2019. We could have changed this order and reported the action set consisting of 3 actions. However, we did not want to change the official definition of the OpenAI baseline where it might lead to confusion and might hurt reproducibility. That is why we cited the OpenAI Gym Brockman et. al (2016) and used their definition of the action set.\n\nIf we did understand your concern about the action \u2018FIRE\u2019 correctly the agent is indeed taking the action \u20181\u2019 for $P_{adv}, P_{base}, $, and $P_{control}$, because action \u20181\u2019 is equivalent to action \u20180\u2019. This also can be seen in Figure 1. Please let us know if you have more questions on this matter. We would be glad to address them. \n\nMoreover, please see Figure 2 for the heatmap of action changes in Pong. The Figure 2 heatmap shows the maximum action shift for action \u20180\u2019 is towards action \u20182\u2019, and the maximum action shift for action \u20182\u2019 is towards action \u20180\u2019. Note that action \u20180\u2019 is equivalent to action \u20181\u2019. Thereby, shifting from action \u20182\u2019 to action \u20180\u2019 will indeed have an effect on agent\u2019s performance. Again similarly the maximum shift for action \u20184\u2019 is towards action \u20183\u2019 and note that action \u20184\u2019 is equivalent to action \u20182\u2019. Thereby, shifting from action \u20184\u2019 to action \u20183\u2019 will indeed have an effect on the agent\u2019s performance.\n\nAgain please let us know if you would have any further questions on this. We would be glad to address them.\n\nGreg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba.

When we consider transferability in machine learning, we assume that there are something common to learn between the two domains. My first thought when I read the title is that it would be a transfer learning method for adversarial attacks. But the authors seem to prefer a universal offset on the raw pixel input. In this case, the only insights we might possibly learn is the input similarity between different Atari games, which is hardly a contribution to any field. Moreover, since adversarial attack is already used in this work, I don't see the reason why none of the referred methods for adversarial attacks in RL are tested.\n\nBesides, all experiments are done only on DDQN, hence the claims are hardly validated.

However, I have major concerns about the novelty of the material discussed in the paper. The only novelty is about using which states as adversarially perturbed input. It mostly looks like an incremental study. \n\t\nIn the experiments section, authors have used a pre-trained DDQN agent which originally does not show significant generalizability compared to methods like A3C. It would be interesting to see the impact of the proposed framework on algorithms with better generalization capabilities. Thus, I believe the experiment section lacks this very important part.\n\nIn section 4.2, it is discussed which actions are switched to which ones due to adversary. For example, in the case of Pong, all of the actions are changed to 0, 2, or 3, which are \u201cno op\u201d, \u201cright\u201d, and \u201cleft\u201d, respectively. I speculate that a better generalized policy (like A3C) instead of DDQN could still perform well since it has all the actions required to get the maximum return. Thus, the impact would not be this high (according to tables 1 and 2). In addition, in Pong, agent needs to press the \u201cfire\u201d button (action 1) to start each round of the game. Without loss of generality, this could be overwritten in an engineering matter (like what has been done in DeepMind Atari wrapper) so the agent still be able to perform without being concerned about the \u201cfire\u201d button. There is a lot to investigate and talk about in this paper.\n\n\u2014 minor issues:\nIn figure 1, there are two CrazyClimber plots. One of them needs to be changed.\n\nI believe the paper in its current form requires substantial changes.

The paper explores the impact of various types of perturbations between states in the same environment (state transferability), and between states in different environments (environment transferability).\n\n### Review\n\nI think the paper does a good job at capturing the extent/prevalence of the issue of adversarial perturbations. I liked the breadth in the types of perturbations considered, and how they map to scnarios that could happen in practice (e.g., restricted adversaries, etc.).\n\nOne thing that I think could improve the paper is teasing apart properties of environments or learning algorithms that are telling of the transferrability of the perturbations. For example, beyond suggesting that the offset pushes things beyond the decision boundary, checking things like how action gaps change may be insightful. Some of the action manipulation may further be exacerbated by things like using \u03b5-greedy behavior policies which immediately snaps to highest-valued actions, in contrast with things like Boltzmann policies over action-values or policy gradient methods, which are smooth with respect to changes in them. Do the authors have any insight as to how the trends might change should a smooth policy be used?\n\nWhile the focus is on deep RL, perhaps a simple, motivating example (e.g., a little gridworld or Markov chain) could make a stronger/clearer case as to what exactly is happening, and suggest what situations one might expect it to be a more prevalent issue.\n\nBeyond this, I have the following questions/concerns:\n\n1) Is there a reason for the choice of DDQN, over say, regular DQN? While one algorithm may perform a bit better, if the emphasis of the paper is to measure the extent of adversarial perturbations, it seems like it may paint a clearer/more convincing picture if a simpler algorithm is used, with fewer moving parts to attribute performance differences to. Along these lines, I think it would be more convincing to carry out the same experiments with another deep RL algorithm (perhaps a policy gradient one, to be representative of both value-based and policy-based methods) to see if comparable levels of and trends in transferrability are observed there. Can the authors comment on whether \n\n2) How were hyper-parameters chosen for the DDQN agent, and can the authors comment on whether such choices can have reasonably strong interplay with the transferability of perturbations? For example, would larger/smaller learning rates, or deeper vs wider networks be more or less resilient to such perturbations? I think in any case such details need to be included in the paper, to be clearer that the transferability quantified is in the scope of a particular instantiation of a specific algorithm.\n\nOverall, I'm erring toward acceptance in that it outlines an interesting framework to study adversarial attacks in deep RL, and provides some early empirical results and intuitions around them. I do think the paper falls a little short in that there wasn't a representative sample of deep RL methods, as well as not commenting on design choices made and how/whether they might interplay with the transferability measured. I'm willing to adjust my score should my concerns be addressed.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1786/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1786/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Exploring Transferability of Perturbations in Deep Reinforcement Learning", "authorids": ["~Ezgi_Korkmaz1"], "authors": ["Ezgi Korkmaz"], "keywords": ["transferability", "deep reinforcement learning", "generalization", "adversarial"], "abstract": "The use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as function approximators has led to striking progress for reinforcement learning algorithms and applications. At the same time, deep reinforcement learning agents have inherited the vulnerability of DNNs to imperceptible adversarial perturbations to their inputs. Prior work on adversarial perturbations for deep reinforcement learning has generally relied on calculating an adversarial perturbation customized to each state visited by the agent. In this paper we propose a more realistic threat model in which the adversary computes the perturbation only once based on a single state. Furthermore, we show that to cause a deep reinforcement learning agent to fail it is enough to have only one adversarial offset vector in a black-box setting. We conduct experiments in various games from the Atari environment, and use our single-state adversaries to demonstrate the transferability of perturbations both between states of one MDP, and between entirely different MDPs. We believe our adversary framework reveals fundamental properties of the environments used in deep reinforcement learning training, and is a tangible step towards building robust and reliable deep reinforcement learning agents.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "korkmaz|exploring_transferability_of_perturbations_in_deep_reinforcement_learning", "pdf": "/pdf/9e15758accbcb3821823a82b980eda956805f444.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=ZeGNKXNv3n", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkorkmaz2021exploring,\ntitle={Exploring Transferability of Perturbations in Deep Reinforcement Learning},\nauthor={Ezgi Korkmaz},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=inBTt_wSv0}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
