This recent work then pulls the (Euclidean) metric of the output space into the latent space, and performs interpolation along geodesics under such a metric. The present paper argues that pulling the Euclidean metric into the latent space is not suitable for perceptual tasks as this metric is unrelated to perception. It is then proposed to instead pull back a feature-based metric, where the features are extracted from a VGG-19 network. A few examples indicate that this gives nicer interpolations.\n\nI'm generally positive towards this work, but have a few comments:\n\n*) The present paper rely on a deterministic generator, so it does not describe basic models such as the VAE even if this is hinted at in the introduction. Arvanitidis et al. has shown that using stochastic generators gives significantly more meaningful metrics, than when using deterministic generators. It would be good to rely on stochastic generators as the metric of deterministic generators appear to be arbitrarily bad, which renders the comparative study unfair. That being said, I think the author's conclusion is perfectly sensible.\n\n*) In the introduction it is stated that it is shown theoretically that choosing another metric to pull back is better.

The straightforward approach is linear interpolation in the latent space; some recent work has suggested minimizing path energy in image space. This paper instead considers finding paths which minimize path energy in VGG feature space using gradient descent on the path itself. The paper shows qualitative examples where this gives nicer results than other sorts of latent-space interpolation.\n\nPros\n(+) The idea of using VGG features (or other arbitrary differentiable image similarity metric) for latent-space exploration is a nice idea, and novel to the best of my knowledge\n(+) The interpolations using the proposed method do seem qualitatively different from the results using other interpolation methods\n\nCons\n(+) The only results are a handful of qualitative results on CelebA-HQ; I would have also liked to see results on other datasets, such as MNIST or CIFAR which are frequently used for GANs.\n(+) No quantitative evaluation. Latent-space interpolation is a hard thing to quantify, but one idea would be to run a user study to quantify which method produces interpolations that are preferred by users over a large set of images.\n\nQuestions\n- For the generator used in this paper, were latent vectors constrained to unit norm? If so I also would have liked to see a comparison with interpolation along the surface of a hypersphere in latent space.\n\nOverall the paper presents an interesting and novel idea, but backs it up with only a few qualitative examples on a single dataset; this makes it hard to assess the general applicability of the method. Nevertheless the method is likely to be of interest to the community, and seems like a good fit for the workshop track.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Feature-Based Metrics for Exploring the Latent Space of Generative Models", "abstract": "Several recent papers have treated the latent space of deep generative models, e.g., GANs or VAEs, as Riemannian manifolds.
