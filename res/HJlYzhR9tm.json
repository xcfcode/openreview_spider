In this comment I majorly explain the relations between our model and the transformer model (Vaswani et al. 2017).\n\nWe are aware of the transformer model and related works in machine translation, but I did not find any previous work that directly applied transformers on language modeling on the PTB dataset. In terms of the model itself, our model applied a gated self-attention to \"simulate\" LSTMs. The architecture was purely motivated by LSTMs. On the other hand, we believe the most significant difference between our model and transformer is that transformers apply multi-head attentions, and the GTCN only uses one attention. The multi-head attention mechanism brings a huge number of parameters, compared with the GTCN model.\n\nAbout Eq. 13-14 - we used tied output embeddings (Ofir and Wolf, 2016). The output hidden state of the Eq 14 is used to be compared with the word embeddings of the decoders. That's why we said the model predicted the embedding of the next word.\n\nEqs. 6 and 7 included typos. Thank you for reminding!\n\nIn Eq. 9, \\mathbf{W}^p is part of the parameters, and i-j means a line of it. I will make more explanations in the revised version.\n\nEq. 5 stands for a normalization method proposed in a related work. We did not use this in GTCN, but it could be. In practice we use softmax attention to normalize the context information.\n\nIn Eq. 2, f_{t+1}  does rely on f_t. We put the equation here to indicate in LSTM language models, how a context word influences a target word by calculating a weight between them. This motivates the proposal of the GTCN model.\n\nIn terms of time complexity, we believe that processing sentences in parallel is more efficient than recurrent models. We did not compare the exact time of the GTCN and LSTM because the LSTM in pytorch is not implemented in Python. We will try to implement python LSTM and compare the time complexities of both models.\n\nGTCN is not really the state-of-the-art LM, but in our comparisons, it performs best among the non-recurrent models.\n\nAbout the minor questions,\n\nWe had a problem in templates because we used the geometry package and messed everything. We will correct this in the revised version.\n\nIn Eq. 5, X stands for a matrix that includes all nodes, while x means the embedding of one node.\nAnd we are using a 10K vocabulary corpus, instead of 10K words.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1286/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1286/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1286/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Language Modeling with Graph Temporal Convolutional Networks", "abstract": "Recently, there have been some attempts to use non-recurrent neural models for language modeling. \nHowever, a noticeable performance gap still remains. \nWe propose a non-recurrent neural language model, dubbed graph temporal convolutional network (GTCN), that relies on graph neural network blocks and convolution operations.

The key intuition is to treat sentences as (potentially densely-connected) graphs over tokens, instead of sequences as in many RNN-based language models. The model then, when predicting a token, summarizes previous tokens using attention mechanism as context. Empirical evaluation on word-level language modeling on Penn Treebank shows competitive performance.\n\nThe idea of this work appears reasonable and well-motivated to me. But the connections to previous works, especially those based on self-attention, should be clearly addressed. Further, writing can be improved, and I would encourage a thorough revision since there are typos making the paper a bit hard to follow.\nLast but not least, I find several of the claims not very-well supported. Please see details below.\n\nPros:\n- Well-motivated intuition treating language as structured.\n\nCons:\n- Writing can be improved.\n- Missing discussion of existing works. \n\nDetails:\n\n- Based on my understanding of Eqs. 6--11, the proposed GTCN seems to be a gated version (also equipped with window-2 convolutions) of the self-attention mechanism. Could the authors comment on how GTCN relates to Vaswani et al. (2017), Salton et al. (2017), among others? Also, empirical comparisons to self-attention based language models might be necessary.\n\n- I was confused by Eqs. 13--14 and the text around it. Doesn't one need some kind of classifier (e.g., an MLP) to predict x_{t+1}? Why are these two equations predicting word embedding?\n\n- The start of Section 4.1. There seems to be a typo here. I'm assuming the two vectors are `$\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{q}$` here, as in Eqs. 6 and 7.\n\n- More clarification on Eq. 9 might be necessary. Is \\mathbf{W}^p part of the parameters? I'm guessing \\mathbf{W}_{i-j}^p selects a row from the matrix, since there is a dot product outside.\n\n- Can the authors clarify Eq. 5? I'm not sure how to interpret it, and it seems not used anywhere else.\n\n- Eq. 2 is a bit misleading: it might give the impression that f_{t+1} does not depend on f_t (and so forth), which is not the case for LSTM.\n\n- It would be interesting to be how GTCN compare to other models in efficiency, since the paper mentions parallel computation many times.\n\n- Contribution.2: GTCN is not really the state-of-the-art model on LM.\n\n- Comparison to RNNG: RNNG treats each sentence as a separate sequence, in contrast to most cited works in Table 1, where the whole training (eval) set is treated as a single sequence, and truncate the length when applying BPTT. And according to the second paragraph of Section 5.1, this work follows the latter. To the best of my knowledge, such a difference does have an effect on the perplexity metric. In this sense, RNNG is not comparable to the rest in Table 1. It is perhaps fine to still put it in the table, but please clarify it in the text.\n\nMinors:\n\n- Why is the margins above equations seem larger. Can the authors make sure the template is right?\n\n- Around Eq.5: why is \\mathbf{X} is capitalized in the eq, but not in the text? Are they the same thing?\n\n- Section 4.3: the dependence of attention weights $a$ is not reflected in the notation.\n\n- Section 5.1: I think what it means here is a `10K` vocabulary, instead of a 10K word tiny corpora.\n\n\nReferences\n\nVaswani et al.. 2017.
