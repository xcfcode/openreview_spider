While the technique is novel as far as I know (eq. (1) in particular), many details in the paper are poorly explained (I am unable to understand) and experimental results do not demonstrate that the problem targeted is actually alleviated.\n\nMore detailed remarks:\n1: Motivating with ImageNet taking over a week to train seems misplaced when we have papers claiming to train ImageNet in 1 hour, 24 mins, 15 mins...\n4.1: Lemma 4.1 seems like you want B > 1, or clarify definition of V_B.\n4.2: This section is not fully comprehensible to me.\n- It seems you are confusingly overloading the term gradient and words derived (also in other parts or the paper). What is \"maximum value of gradients in a matrix\"? Make sure to use something else, when talking about individual elements of a vector (which is constructed as an average of gradients), etc.\n- Rounding: do you use deterministic or random rounding? Do you then again store the inaccuracy?\n- I don't understand definition of d. It seems you subtract logarithm of a gradient from a scalar.\n- In total, I really don't know what is the object that actually gets communicated, and consequently when you remark that this can be combined with QSGD and the more below it, I don't understand it. This section has to be thoroughly explained, perhaps with some illustrative examples.\n4.3: allgatherv remark: does that mean that this approach would not scale well to higher number of workers?\n4.4: Remarks about quantization and mantissa manipulation are not clear to me again, or what is the point in doing so. Possible because the problems above.\n5: I think this section is not too useful unless you can accompany it with actual efficient implementation and contrast the practical performance. \n6: Given that I don't understand how you compress the information being communicated, it is hard to believe the utility of the method. The objective was to speed up training time because communication is bottleneck. If you provide 12,000x compression, is it any more practically useful than providing 120x compression? What would be the difference in runtime? Such questions are never discussed. Further, if in the implementation you discuss masking mantissa, I have serious concern about whether the compression protocol is feasible to implement efficiently, without writing some extremely low-level code. I think the soundness of work addressing this particular problem is damaged if not implemented properly (compared to other kinds of works in current ML related research). Therefore I highly recommend including proper time comparison with a baseline in the future.\nFurther, I don't understand 2 things about the Tables. a) how do you combine the proposed method with Momentum in SGD? This is not discussed as far as I can see. b) What is \"QSGD, 2bit\" If I remember QSGD protocol correctly, there's no natural mapping of 2bit to its parameters.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variance-based Gradient Compression for Efficient Distributed Deep Learning", "abstract": "Due to the substantial computational cost, training state-of-the-art deep neural networks for large-scale datasets often requires distributed training using multiple computation workers.

To support our arguments, we estimate actual speedup by variance-based compression using micro-benchmarks of communication over slow interconnection.\nFirst, we measured computation and communication time for training ResNet50 on 16 nodes using Infiniband. It took 302.72 ms for computation and 69.95 ms for communication for each iteration in average. We note that ResNet50 contains about 102 MB of parameters.\nNext, we measured communication time of allreduce without compression and that of allgatherv with compression. We used 16 t2.micro instances of AWS Its point-to-point bandwidth was about 100MB/s. We used OSU micro-benchmarks (http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/benchmarks/) for the measurements. Summary of the result is the following:\n--\nallreduce\ncompression | Avg elapsed time (ms)\n1 | 9,572.95\n--\nallgatherv\ncompression | Avg elapsed time (ms)\n10 | 3,440.70\n100 | 314.17\n1,000 | 30.09\n10,000 | 4.26\n--\nWith this result, we can see that communication takes longer time compared to usual computation time even with 100x compression. Thus, we can say that even with only 16 nodes, compression ratio over a hundred is desirable to achieve high scalability. In use cases with more nodes, communication will take longer and thousands of times of compression will help.

(2)", "comment": "> 5: I think this section is not too useful unless you can accompany it with actual efficient implementation and contrast the practical performance. \nYes, we would like to be able to do this comparison. We amended the paper to include this at the beginning of Section 5 -- Performance Analysis:\n\u2018\u2019\u2019Because common deep learning libraries do not currently support access to gradients of each sample, it is difficult to contrast practical performance of an efficient implementation in the commonly used software environment.In light of this, we estimate speedup of each iteration by gradient compression with a performance model of communication and computation.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\n> If you provide 12,000x compression, is it any more practically useful than providing 120x compression?\nYes, we believe it can be practically useful, depending on the underlying computation infrastructure. With existing compression methods, computation with a large number of nodes essentially requires high bandwidth connections like InfiniBand. Much higher levels of compression make it possible to consider large numbers of nodes even with commodity-level bandwidth connections. We amended our paper with the following:\nSec 6.1\u2019\u2019\u2019The hybrid algorithm's compression ratio is several orders higher than existing compression methods with a low reduction in accuracy. This indicates the algorithm can make computation with a large number of nodes feasible on commodity level infrastructure that would have previously required high-end interconnections.\u2019\u2019\u2019\nSec 6.2\u2019\u2019\u2019In this example as well as the previous CIFAR10 example, Variance-based Gradient  Compression shows a significantly higher compression ratio, with comparable accuracy. While in this case, Strom's method's accuracy was comparable with no compression, given the significant accuracy degradation with Strom's method on CIFAR10, it appears Variance-based Gradient Compression provides a more robust solution.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\n> Further, if in the implementation you discuss masking mantissa, I have serious concern about whether the compression protocol is feasible to implement efficiently, without writing some extremely low-level code. \nYes, low-level code would be required to use our method. It is also true for other existing methods.\n\n> Therefore I highly recommend including proper time comparison with a baseline in the future. Once parameter variance is provided within one of the standard calculation libraries of primitives for neural deep neural networks, this time comparison can be done.\n\n> a) how do you combine the proposed method with Momentum in SGD? This is not discussed as far as I can see. \nWe amended our paper with the following:\nSec. 4.1 \u2018\u2019\u2019... In the combination with optimization methods like Momentum SGD, gradient elements not sent are assumed to be equal to zero.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\n> b) What is \"QSGD, 2bit\" If I remember QSGD protocol correctly, there's no natural mapping of 2bit to its parameters.\nThank you for your comment. We misunderstood meaning \u2018bit\u201d used in experiment section of original QSGD paper. We asked the authors at NIPS, and we reran experiments. We amended our paper as follows:\nSec 6.1\u2019\u2019\u2019We used two's complement in implementation of QSGD and \"bit\" represents the number of bits used to represent each element of gradients. \"d\" represents a bucket size.\u2019\u2019\u2019"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variance-based Gradient Compression for Efficient Distributed Deep Learning", "abstract": "Due to the substantial computational cost, training state-of-the-art deep neural networks for large-scale datasets often requires distributed training using multiple computation workers.

We're glad to hear that you found our technique to be novel. We've amended our paper in light of your review. We hope this helps explain the details and demonstrate how our technique alleviates the problem of transmitting gradients between nodes.\n\nSection 1\n> Motivating with ImageNet taking over a week to train seems misplaced when we have papers claiming to train ImageNet in 1 hour, 24 mins, 15 mins...\nThanks for the comment. We have amended our paper with the following:\n\u2018\u2019\u2019For example, it takes over a week to train ResNet-50 on the ImageNet dataset if using a single GPU. \u2026 For example, when using 1000BASE-T Ethernet, communication takes at least ten times longer than forward and backward computation for ResNet-50, making multiple nodes impractical. High performance interconnections such as InfiniBand and Omni-Path are an order of magnitude more expensive than commodity interconnections, which limits research and development of deep learning using large-scale datasets to a small number of researchers.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\n> 4.1: Lemma 4.1 seems like you want B > 1, or clarify definition of V_B.\nCorrect. We have amended our paper with the following:\n\u2018\u2019\u2019Lemma 4.1\n A sufficient condition that a vector -g is a descent direction is\n      \\|g - \\nabla f(x)\\|_2^2 < \\|g\\|_2^2.\nWe are interested in the case of g = \\nabla f_B(x), the gradient vector of the loss function over B.\nBy the weak law of large numbers, when B > 1, the left-hand side with g = \\nabla f_B(x) can be estimated as follows.\u2019\u2019\u2019\nNote, \\nabla_B f(x) in lemma 4.1 of our first paper was replaced with a symbol g.\n\n> 4.2: This section is not fully comprehensible to me.\n> - It seems you are confusingly overloading the term gradient and words derived (also in other parts or the paper). What is \"maximum value of gradients in a matrix\"? Make sure to use something else, when talking about individual elements of a vector (which is constructed as an average of gradients), etc.\nYou\u2019re right. We amended the paper to replace gradient with \u2018gradient element\u2019 when we refer elements of gradient vectors.\n\u2018\u2019\u2019Our quantization except for the sign bit is as follows. For a weight matrix W_k (or a weight tensor in CNN), there is a group of gradient elements corresponding to the matrix. Let M_k be the maximum absolute value in the group.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\n> - Rounding: do you use deterministic or random rounding? Do you then again store the inaccuracy?\nGood questions. We amended our paper as follows:\nSec 4.2\u2019\u2019\u2019... We do not adopt stochastic rounding like QSGD nor accumulate rounding error g_i - g'_i for the next batch because this simple rounding does not harm accuracy empirically.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\n> - I don't understand definition of d. It seems you subtract logarithm of a gradient from a scalar.\nd is a difference of two scalars.\n>  In total, I really don't know what is the object that actually gets communicated, and consequently when you remark that this can be combined with QSGD and the more below it, I don't understand it. This section has to be thoroughly explained, perhaps with some illustrative examples.\nWe hope our clarification between \u2018gradient\u2019 and \u2018gradient element\u2019 made the definition of d clearer. We amended our paper as follows:\nSec 4.2\u2018\u2019\u2019... After deciding which gradient elements to send, each worker sends pairs of a value of a gradient element and its parameter index \u2026\u2019\u2019\u2019\nSec 4.2\u2019\u2019\u2019... Because the variance-based sparsification method described in subsection 4.1 is orthogonal to the quantization shown above, we can reduce communication cost further using sparsity promoting quantization methods such as QSGD instead.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\n> 4.3: allgatherv remark: does that mean that this approach would not scale well to higher number of workers?\nIt does scale well. We amended our paper with the following:\nSec 4.3\u2019\u2019\u2019Thanks to the high compression ratio possible with this algorithm in combination with other compression methods, even large numbers of workers can be supported.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\n> 4.4: Remarks about quantization and mantissa manipulation are not clear to me again, or what is the point in doing so. Possible because the problems above.\nTo make a point of the mantissa operations clear, we amended our paper with the following:\n\u2018\u2019\u2019The quantization of parameters described in subsection 4.2 can also be efficiently implemented with the standard binary floating point representation using only binary operations and integer arithmetic as follows.\u2019\u2019\u2019"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variance-based Gradient Compression for Efficient Distributed Deep Learning", "abstract": "Due to the substantial computational cost, training state-of-the-art deep neural networks for large-scale datasets often requires distributed training using multiple computation workers.
