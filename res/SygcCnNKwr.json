The paper then proposes to evaluate learners on datasets with maximal compound divergence (but minimal atom divergence) between the train and test portions, as a way of testing whether a model exhibits compositional generalization, and suggests a greedy algorithm for forming datasets with this property. In particular, the authors introduce a large automatically generated semantic parsing dataset, which allows for the construction of datasets with these train/test split divergence properties. Finally, the authors evaluate three sequence-to-sequence style semantic parsers on the constructed datasets, and they find that they all generalize very poorly on datasets with maximal compound divergence, and that furthermore the compound divergence appears to be anticorrelated with accuracy.\n\n--\n\nDiscussion:\n\nBlind review #1 is the most knowledgeable in this area and wrote \"This is an interesting and ambitious paper tackling an important problem. It is worth noting that the claim that it is the compound divergence that controls the difficulty of generalization (rather than something else, like length) is a substantive one, and the authors do provide evidence of this.\"\n\n--\n\nRecommendation and justification:\n\nThis paper deserves to be accepted because it tackles an important problem that is overlooked in current work that is evaluated on datasets of questionable meaningfulness. It adds insight by focusing on the qualities of datasets that enable testing how well learning algorithms do on compositional generalization, which is crucial to intelligence.", "title": "Paper Decision"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Measuring Compositional Generalization: A Comprehensive Method on Realistic Data", "authors": ["Daniel Keysers", "Nathanael Sch\u00e4rli", "Nathan Scales", "Hylke Buisman", "Daniel Furrer", "Sergii Kashubin", "Nikola Momchev", "Danila Sinopalnikov", "Lukasz Stafiniak", "Tibor Tihon", "Dmitry Tsarkov", "Xiao Wang", "Marc van Zee", "Olivier Bousquet"], "authorids": ["keysers@google.com", "schaerli@google.com", "nkscales@google.com", "hylke@google.com", "danielfurrer@google.com", "sergik@google.com", "nikola@google.com", "sinopalnikov@google.com", "lukstafi@google.com", "ttihon@google.com", "tsar@google.com", "wangxiao@google.com", "marcvanzee@google.com", "obousquet@google.com"], "keywords": ["compositionality", "generalization", "natural language understanding", "benchmark", "compositional generalization", "compositional modeling", "semantic parsing", "generalization measurement"], "TL;DR": "Benchmark and method to measure compositional generalization by maximizing divergence of compound frequency at small divergence of atom frequency.", "abstract": "State-of-the-art machine learning methods exhibit limited compositional generalization.

As we always target a low atom divergence (specifically <= 0.02, as described in Sections 4 and 5.1), the atom divergence is treated in effect as a constraint, within the bounds of which the splitting algorithm seeks to optimize the compound divergence to match the target divergence as closely as possible. This formulation makes the balancing of the two criteria during the course of splitting relatively straightforward: we penalize deviation from the target atom divergence only in the case that the atom divergence exceeds its target threshold, and we penalize such deviation from the target atom divergence significantly more strictly than deviation from the target compound divergence, so as to minimize the chance that the target atom divergence is exceeded at completion of splitting.\n\nRegarding showing how different compositional divergence can affect the performance of different models, we illustrate this in Figure 2 and in Section 5, where we construct a series of divergence-based splits with different compound divergences and demonstrate that there is a strong negative correlation between the compound divergence and the performance of each of the three baseline models.\n\nIf this is not clear, please let us know, and we would be happy to clarify further.\n\nRegarding comment (2), please note that the paper that you mention was already cited in our original submission. We agree with you that evaluating the Syntactic Attention Model on our dataset is an interesting direction of future work, which we now mention more clearly in the paper (see Section 7). However, it is not the focus of our paper to investigate any particular architecture or model that is optimized for its compositional generalization abilities, but instead we present a framework in which this ability can be measured comprehensively. With the release of our benchmark we hope that it will be used (by us, and by other researchers) to investigate which learning systems and approaches show most promise for compositional generalization. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper274/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper274/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Measuring Compositional Generalization: A Comprehensive Method on Realistic Data", "authors": ["Daniel Keysers", "Nathanael Sch\u00e4rli", "Nathan Scales", "Hylke Buisman", "Daniel Furrer", "Sergii Kashubin", "Nikola Momchev", "Danila Sinopalnikov", "Lukasz Stafiniak", "Tibor Tihon", "Dmitry Tsarkov", "Xiao Wang", "Marc van Zee", "Olivier Bousquet"], "authorids": ["keysers@google.com", "schaerli@google.com", "nkscales@google.com", "hylke@google.com", "danielfurrer@google.com", "sergik@google.com", "nikola@google.com", "sinopalnikov@google.com", "lukstafi@google.com", "ttihon@google.com", "tsar@google.com", "wangxiao@google.com", "marcvanzee@google.com", "obousquet@google.com"], "keywords": ["compositionality", "generalization", "natural language understanding", "benchmark", "compositional generalization", "compositional modeling", "semantic parsing", "generalization measurement"], "TL;DR": "Benchmark and method to measure compositional generalization by maximizing divergence of compound frequency at small divergence of atom frequency.", "abstract": "State-of-the-art machine learning methods exhibit limited compositional generalization.

We added a paragraph discussing this to the paper in Section 5.2 now. Also, we had already observed in Table 3 and the discussion that we did not expect the lengths to stay perfectly constant between train and test splits. Note, however, that the splitting algorithm could be extended in a way that would try to achieve maximum compound divergence while keeping both the atom divergence close to zero and the length distribution constant between the splits. Here, we focus on the compound divergence as a single measure of compositionality challenge. (Compare also the discussion in Section 4: \"Interestingly, the MCD splits still correlate with the aspects of compositional generalization that are targeted by the other experiments in this table. As shown in the four right columns of Table 3, for each MCD split, the train set V contains on average shorter examples than the test set W (measured by the ratio of average lengths), and [...]. However, these correlations are less pronounced than for the experiments that specifically target these aspects, and they vary significantly across the different MCD splits.\")\n\nOn using the idea of varying compound divergence for other tasks (\"not necessarily clear how easily the notion of differing compound distributions generalizes to other types of tasks\"): We agree that this is an interesting direction for future work. For example, we believe that a similar approach may be applicable to visual tasks for which the compounds can be programmatically analyzed, e.g. visual question answering tasks like CLEVR. We mention this now explicitly in Section 7. The same way that splits based on lengths or patterns have been used for natural language compositionality analysis, vision tasks have used specific splits for analysis of compositionality e.g. based on color or pairs of objects in images. (We discuss this in Section 6 to some degree.)

The paper then proposes to evaluate learners on datasets with maximal compound divergence (but minimal atom divergence) between the train and test portions, as a way of testing whether a model exhibits compositional generalization, and suggests a greedy algorithm for forming datasets with this property. In particular, the authors introduce a large automatically generated semantic parsing dataset, which allows for the construction of datasets with these train/test split divergence properties. Finally, the authors evaluate three sequence-to-sequence style semantic parsers on the constructed datasets, and they find that they all generalize very poorly on datasets with maximal compound divergence, and that furthermore the compound divergence appears to be anticorrelated with accuracy.\n\nThis is an interesting and ambitious paper tackling an important problem. It is worth noting that the claim that it is the compound divergence that controls the difficulty of generalization (rather than something else, like length) is a substantive one, and the authors do provide evidence of this. At the same time, I think the authors could possibly do more to show that the trend in the plots in Figure 2 can't be explained by something else: for example, the authors could show that the length ratios remain constant as the compound divergence is varied.  I think it is also not necessarily clear how easily the notion of differing compound distributions generalizes to other types of tasks.\n\nPresentation-wise, much of the paper is clear and well written, though I think the discussion of weighted frequency distributions of compounds (top of page 3) could be clarified further, and in particular an example subgraph of a rule application DAG should be highlighted here.

At the same time, there is a lack of realistic benchmarks that comprehensively measure this ability, which makes it challenging to find and evaluate improvements. We introduce a novel method to systematically construct such benchmarks by maximizing compound divergence while guaranteeing a small atom divergence between train and test sets, and we quantitatively compare this method to other approaches for creating compositional generalization benchmarks. We present a large and realistic natural language question answering dataset that is constructed according to this method, and we use it to analyze the compositional generalization ability of three machine learning architectures. We find that they fail to generalize compositionally and that there is a surprisingly strong negative correlation between compound divergence and accuracy.
