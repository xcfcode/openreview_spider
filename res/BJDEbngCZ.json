The convergence of policy gradient does not rely on the convexity of the loss function, which is known in the community of control and dynamic programming. The convergence of policy gradient is related to the convergence of actor-critic, which is essentially a form of policy iteration.

However, the results seem a bit limited because it does not apply to neural-network function approximator.

We are not aware of any global convergence guarantees in the general non-convex setting. There are some convergence guarantees in convex settings, but even in convex settings there are worst-case examples that require super-polynomial number of iterations for policy iteration (for example, the construction in paper \u201cSub-exponential lower bounds for randomized pivoting rules for solving linear programs\u201d by Friedmann et al.). In the general non-convex setting, even converge to a local minimum (rather than a saddle point) can take exponential time.
