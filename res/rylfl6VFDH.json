The paper provides experiments in several data-sets and compares against several other regularization/pruning approaches, and measures accuracy, speedup, and memory. The reviewers agreed on all these points, but overall they found the results unconvincing. They requested (1) more baselines (which the authors added), (2) larger tasks/datasets, and (3) more variety in network architectures.  The overall impression was it was hard to see a clear benefit of the proposed approach, based on the provided tables of results.\n\nThe paper could sharpen its impact with several adjustments. The results are much more clear looking at the error vs speedup graphs. Presenting \"representative results\" in the tables was confusing, especially considering the proposed approach rarely dominated across all measures. It was unclear how the variants of the algorithms presented in the tables were selected---explaining this would help a lot. In addition, more text is needed to help the reader understand how improvements in speed, accuracy, and memory matter. For example in LeNet 500-300 is a speedup of ~12 @ 1.26 error for BB worth-it/important compared a speedup of ~8 for similar error for L_0? How should the reader think about differences in speedup, memory and accuracy---perhaps explanations linking to the impact of these metrics to their context in real applications. I found myself wondering this about pretty much every result, especially when better speedup and memory could be achieved at the cost of some accuracy---how much does the reduction in accuracy actually matter? Is speed and size the dominant thing? I don't know.\n\nOverall the analysis and descriptions of the results are very terse, leaving much to the reader to figure out. For example (fig 2 bottom right). If a result is worth including in the paper it's worth explaining it to the reader. Summary statements like \"BB and DBB either achieve significantly smaller error than the baseline methods, or significant speedup and memory saving at similar error rates.\" Is not helpful where there are so many dimensions of performance to figure out. The paper spends a lot of time explaining what was done in a matter of fact way, but little time helping the reader interpret the results.\n\nThere are other issues that hurt the paper, including reporting the results of only 3 runs, sometimes reporting median without explanation, undefined metrics like speedup ,%memory (explain how they are calculated), restricting the batchsize for all methods to a particular value without explanation, and overall somewhat informal and imprecise discussion of the empirical methodology.\n\nThe authors did a nice job responding to the reviewers (illustrating good understanding of the area and the strengths of their method), and this could be a strong paper indeed if the changes suggested above were implemented. Including SSL and SVG in the appendix was great, but they really should have been included in the speedup vs error plots throughout the paper. This is a nice direction and was very close.

The authors provide a good motivation for their model, introduce beta-Bernoulli and dependant beta-Bernoulli prior and propose the method in the variational inference framework. \n\nConcerns:\n1) The main concern relates to the significance of benefits from the input dependency property. From the Tables 1, 2 we can see that BB is comparable with DBB and the latter is not uniformly better than the former in terms of error, xFLOPs and memory. This similarity in the performance is more significant for LeNet5-Caffe network, for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Is the overhead of DBB worth the benefits it gives? \n2) The second question is about the memory consumption of DBB. The authors use two stage pruning scheme for DBB: at first, they prune DBB using the beta-Bernoulli dropout, then prune the network for each input individually. It means that DBB should keep all weights after the first stage, in other words the memory consumption of DBB is the same as BB. Some clarifications about this concern are necessary. \n\nOverall, the paper proposes interesting and well-motivated method for training sparse networks. Although, there are concerns about the DBB extension I would recommend considering this paper for acceptance. \n\n---------------------------------------\nUpdate after author rebuttal\n\nThank you for your thoughtful response. You addressed my second concern about memory consumption of DBB. Indeed, the run-time memory mostly consists of activation maps, therefore DBB can benefit from input-dependent sparsity. Considering the first concern I still think that the advantage of DBB is not clear and I agree with AnonReviewer3 who said that except LeNet-500-300 other results are mixed. \n\nHowever, overall I do think that the proposed method is novel, well theoretically grounded and is proved that it works comparably if not better than the state-of-the-art approaches. Therefore, I remain my score as weak accept. \n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper330/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper330/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["juho@aitrics.com", "shkim@aitrics.com", "jaehong.yoon@kaist.ac.kr", "haebeom.lee@kaist.ac.kr", "eunhoy@kaist.ac.kr", "sjhwang82@kaist.ac.kr"], "title": "Adaptive network sparsification with dependent variational beta-Bernoulli dropout", "authors": ["Juho Lee", "Saehoon Kim", "Jaehong Yoon", "Hae Beom Lee", "Eunho Yang", "Sung Ju Hwang"], "pdf": "/pdf/13d165e246f262eabae4ea5e4cf87cd41b5067b3.pdf", "abstract": "While variational dropout approaches have been shown to be effective for network sparsification, they are still suboptimal in the sense that they set the dropout rate for each neuron without consideration of the input data.

In the error-speedup tradeoff graphs in Figure 1 and Figure 2, DBB is much closer to the bottom right corner, which means that the method achieves lower error with larger speedup. This trend is clearly shown in the LeNet-500-300. Thus DBB yields a significantly more compact network than BB. CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 experiments, except on LeNet5-Caffe. We conjecture that input-dependent pruning is less effective on highly underparameterized networks such as LeNet5-Caffe. Yet, even in this case, DBB can always prune more since it starts from the solution of BB.\n\nThis relative advantage of DBB over BB is shown more clearly in Table 2 in the appendix. BB achieves error of 1.40 with 21.79 xFLOPs while DBB achieves the same error with 38.75 xFlOPs. This is a 1.77 times speedup. In Table 3 of the appendix, which shows the results on VGG-CIFAR-100, BB yields the error of 28.86 with 2.60 xFLOPS while DBB records the error of 28.84 with 2.96 xFLOPs. Please note that all FLOPs and memory footprint computations reported in our paper accounts for all the additional overheads due to input-dependent dropout. Thus we believe that the results provided in the paper clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of DBB over BB. We added in these discussions in the revision.\n\n2) Naive approximation\n- We tested MC sampling and averaging inference as you suggested, but found no gain in the accuracy. This is due to the following fact; the variance of the binary mask is given as Var(z) = E_q[pi](1 - E_q[pi]) by the law of total variance. Since the pruning method either tries to make E_q[pi] close to one (retaining the neuron) or zero (pruning the neuron), Var(z) in general tends to zero. Hence, the overall variance of the pruned network is close to zero, which makes the sampling not very different from the naive approximation. The previous works (VIB paper, SBP paper, and so on) also reported this phenomenon, presumably due to a similar mechanism we described above. It would be an interesting research direction to prune the network while maintaining the prediction uncertainty. \n\n3) Justification for design choices\nThe factorization of q is mainly due to the computational reason. We may introduce normalizing flow like variational distributions to increase flexibility, but that would harm the speedup and require more parameters. We agree that the design choice in Eq. (17) may look arbitrary, but we believe that it is nonetheless a reasonable choice for constructing efficient input-dependent dropout gates. An alternative to this may be using layer normalization, which may work as well. \n\n4) Small note.\nThanks for pointing out this.

During the rebuttal period, we have done our best to address your confusions. \n\n1) In sections 4.1 and 4.2 (formula 7, 8 and 18) is there a global z or is there a separate z for each layer? I implicitly prefer it is per layer but it is not clear from the paper.\n\n- Since we mention in Page 4 that W is a parameter of a neural network layer, we are referring to a layerwise z throughout the subsection. We clarified this in the revision as you suggested.\n\n2) How is the inference done? \n\n- First of all, we apologize for the typo. E_q[z_k] smaller than a fixed threshold 10^-3 is a more accurate description. Once the training is done, we can pre-compute the average probability to active the neurons/filters, which is E_q[z_k] (Eq.(15) for beta-Bernoulli and Eq.(20) for dependent beta-Bernoulli). \n\nThen we can explicitly prune neurons/filters having probability lower than a threshold value (1e-3) to ignore them in the inference step. We set this threshold to 1e-3 to eliminate the need for hyperparameter tuning, but setting them to some other values, such as 1e-2 or 1e-4 does not significantly impact the accuracy. While we feel that all the necessary information is already there, in the revision, we described the inference step more in detail to help readers better understand the procedure. \n\n3) Median and standard deviation? \n\n- The reported errors are mean values. We apologize for the confusion and have corrected it in the revision. We have reported memory use and xFLOPS since we did not have space to include them. Previous works have also reported the median values following [Luizos et al. 18].\n\n4) In Table 1, what does the column neurons represent? \n\n- The neurons in Table 1 report reports the number of active neurons after the pruning, which actually participate in the inference. We *do not* report the best performance but report the median over three runs.\n\n5) Missing baselines: SVD (sparse variational dropout) and SSL (structured sparsity learning). \n \nWe did have a comparison to SVD and SSL in an earlier version of the paper but removed them to focus on the comparison against more recent baselines. The two methods largely underperform the recent baselines and ours. For example, for LeNet 500-300 experiments, SVD achieved an error rate of 1.43 with 16.2x FLOPs and SSL recorded error 2.25 with 15.3x FLOPs. On the other hand, according to Table 2 in the appendix, BB recorded error 1.28 with 16.23x FLOPs. We included the results on the two baselines back into the revised paper. Please see Tables 2 and 3 in the appendix.\n \n6) Confusing results in Table 2: \n\n\nWe report two versions with different sparsity level for our BB and DBB since there is a trade-off relationship between sparsity and accuracy. Both Table 1 and 2, in the top rows, reports the performance of BB and DBB when the error is similar to the other methods. They show that given a similar error level, BB and DBB achieve higher sparsity. The bottom rows report the best error with corresponding xFLOPs and memories.

One motivation for the method is to make the dropout rate dependent on the input, by introducing the input to a layer as a factor in the computation of the Bernoulli parameter for the layer which controls whether some parts of it will get turned off. \n\nThe motivation for the goal of making neural networks sparse is clear, since it can potentially lead to significant memory and computation savings (although given that hardware architectures typically used for executing neural networks generally expect dense computations, it may be difficult to realize these savings in practice). Furthermore, it's satisfying to see that the underlying method has a strong probabilistic justification.\n\nHowever, while a significant amount of the paper was devoted to the input-dependent version, it was unclear from the empirical results whether there is much actual advantage to the additional complexity.\nEmpirical validation of the method with experiments on larger datasets such as ImageNet would lend further credence to the viability of the approach.\nI was also somewhat disappointed to see that in order to actually accomplish the pruning, the method involves a naive approximation (equations 14 and 19). I think an interesting experiment would be to see how the method performs when computing the expectation on equation 13 through empirical samples; given the savings in FLOPs and memory, we could run the network with several samples even without exceeding the original computation budget.\nSome other design choices (such as the factorization of q, and equation 17) seem somewhat arbitrary, so I would also prefer to see further justification or a sketch/empirical evidence of why alternative methods may not work as well.\n\nFor the above reasons, I am rating the paper as weak accept.\n\nSmall note: please use \\citep and \\citet (instead of \\cite, when using natbib) properly throughout the paper so that citations are formatted correctly."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper330/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper330/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["juho@aitrics.com", "shkim@aitrics.com", "jaehong.yoon@kaist.ac.kr", "haebeom.lee@kaist.ac.kr", "eunhoy@kaist.ac.kr", "sjhwang82@kaist.ac.kr"], "title": "Adaptive network sparsification with dependent variational beta-Bernoulli dropout", "authors": ["Juho Lee", "Saehoon Kim", "Jaehong Yoon", "Hae Beom Lee", "Eunho Yang", "Sung Ju Hwang"], "pdf": "/pdf/13d165e246f262eabae4ea5e4cf87cd41b5067b3.pdf", "abstract": "While variational dropout approaches have been shown to be effective for network sparsification, they are still suboptimal in the sense that they set the dropout rate for each neuron without consideration of the input data.

The authors also proposed an input-dependent dropout using input-dependent Beta-Bernoulli priors. The paper presents necessary theoretical details as well as the experimental comparison with the other dropout methods on MNIST and CIFAR 10/100 datasets.\n\nThe paper is well-written overall and easy to follow. The paper provides a thorough background on previous work; however the motivation for having an input-dependent dropout method is relatively weak. \n\nI believe the paper presents main idea and necessary details thoroughly, though I have some confusions:\n\n- In sections 4.1 and 4.2 (more specifically formula 7, 8 and 18), is there a global z (i.e. only one z), or there is a separate z for each layer? I implicitly inferred it's per layer but it's not clear from the paper.\n\n- The paper explains well how the two proposed dropouts can be learned during training, but it's not clear about the inference, specially in variational dependent Beta-Bernoulli dropout. In section 5, experimental details, it is said: \"In the testing phase, we prune the neurons/filters whose expected dropout mask probability E_q[pi_k] are smaller than a fixed threshold 10^-3.\" This is not clear to me what it means, and also the related footnote which says different thresholds were tried but the difference is insignificant! More elaboration is helpful.\n\n- In the experimental results, the authors reported median and standard-deviation. Is there any reason the authors didn't report mean and standard-deviation instead? Also, it is not clear if xFLOP and Memory report the best, mean or median of 3 runs.\n\n- In Table 1, what does column Neurons represent? Is it the model parameters at inference time? and if yes, is it the smallest number of parameters in 3 runs? In Table 2, how large the network is in terms of model parameters?\n\n- In the experimental results, some models are missing that are mentioned in the paper as previous work which seem to be good to use for comparison, such as Sparse Variational Dropout (Molchanov 2017) and Structured Sparsity Learning (Wen et al 2016).\n\n- I encourage the authors to expand more on analyzing the experimental results! In Table 1 and Table 2, there are 2 lines for BB and DBB, which is helpful to explain what each line represents. Looking at the results of all tables, and comparing different dropouts w.r.t :1) Error, 2) xFLOPs and 3) Memory, I cannot draw a clear conclusion from the results. For example, in Table 2, CIFAR-10, comparing first line of BB to SBP and second line to VIB, the difference is not significant.
