We are looking into this by using \ncontribution analysis (e.g. Integrated Gradients) to identify visual cues indicating bioactivity. \nHowever, due to the large number of samples and their complex nature this is still an ongoing process.\n\n(4) Discussion of FNN outperforming CNN\n\nSimilar to the previous question we are still in the process of gaining insights here. \nWith respect to this specific assay it seems that the CNN-based method is unable to predict any \nsample correctly as active (although it is capable of correctly predicting inactive samples).\nFrom a first visual inspection we are unsure what causes this.\n\n(5) Sensitivity with respect to the number of labeled examples per assay\n\nWe checked the relation of number of labeled examples per assay with its AUC for all models and overall there is only a slight positive trend. Both end-to-end models as well as the FNN-based approach are able to achieve high AUCs for assays with a high number of labeled samples (200+ and more) as well as for those with a lower number of labeled samples (starting with ~50 samples we see AUCs of >0.9). We added a figure that displays this association (Appendix Figure A1). \n\n(6) Informative compounds and binarized labels\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that modeling this as a regression task could provide valuable insights \nor be of more interest to practitioners. \nHowever, we aim at being comparable to the work of Simm et al. (2018) who also considered \nthis as a classification task. Nonetheless, we plan to include modelling of the regression \ntask in a future version of this work.\n\n\n=== Minor comments \n1) Are individual images from the same sample image always in only the training, validation, or testing set?\n\nYes, we took care that multiple images from the same sample are always in the same fold. \nWe now state this clearer in the manuscript.\n\n2) I did not find the dataset construction description very clear.\n\nWe apologize for not stating the process clearly and have improved the description of the \ndata set which hopefully makes this more clear. \n\n3) Pipeline and data collection\n\nWe have improved the pipeline description in the paper.\nRegarding dataset collection, yes all images have been captured with the same microscope and magnification and are of the same cell line (U2OS). \nDue to the absence of a data set comprising images from multiple devices and labs, it is yet unclear how robust the predictive performance is with respect to variance arising from those sources.\n\n4) Convergence of different architectures\n\nActually, MIL-Net takes the most epochs to converge on the validation set, only reaching good performance after about 90 epochs. In contrast GAP-Net, DenseNet and ResNet converge somewhere around 50-60 epochs. M-CNN converges after roughly 40 epochs and the FNN after 65 epochs.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1070/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1070/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1070/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "End-to-end learning of pharmacological assays from high-resolution microscopy images", "abstract": "Predicting the outcome of pharmacological assays based on high-resolution microscopy\nimages of treated cells is a crucial task in drug discovery which tremendously\nincreases discovery rates.

To arrive at that we perform the following steps:\n  1) Starting with the full ChEMBL database, extract all compounds for which we have microscopy images (11,585)\n  2) Extract all assays for which at least one compound with a pChEMBL value between 4 and 10 is present. \n  3) Then, we apply three thresholds to this matrix (5.5, 6.5 and 7.5) with values above the threshold indicating an \n       active compound and below an inactive compound.\n  4) These three binary matrices are concatenated along the assay dimension.\n  5) Next, we also use the \u201cactivity comment\u201d field of ChEMBL which directly gives us a binary matrix.\n  6) We concatenate the three thresholded matrices and the activity comment matrix.\n  7) Finally, we keep only assays (or assay/threshold combinations) with at least 10 active and 10 inactive compounds. \n  8) This results in some compounds now having no measurement in the remaining assays and by removing these we \n       arrive at 10,574 compounds and 209 assays.\n\nRegarding question 3), the 4 channels stated on page 3 were actually a typo - we now correctly state 5 channels.

They also propose a new convolutional architecture for the same problem. An empirical comparison on a large dataset suggests that end-to-end systems outperform those which first perform a cell segmentation step; the predictive performance (AUC) of almost all the end-to-end systems is statistically indistinguishable.\n\n=== Major comments\n\nThe paper is primarily written as though its main contribution is as an empirical evaluation of different microscopy analysis approaches. Recently, there have been a large number of proposed approaches, and I believe a neutral evaluation of these approaches on datasets other than those used by the respective authors would be a meaningful contribution. However, the current paper has two major shortcomings that prevent it from fulfilling such a place.\n\nFirst, the authors propose a novel approach and include it in the evaluation. This undercuts claims of neutrality. (Minor comments about the proposed approach are given below.) \n\nSecond, the discussion of the results of the empirical evaluation is restricted almost solely to repeating in text the what the tables already show. Further, the discussion focuses only on the \u201ctop line\u201d numbers, with the exception of a deep look at the Gametocytocidal compounds screen. It would be helpful to instead (or additionally) identify meaningful trends, supported by the data acquired during the experiments. For example: (1) Do the end-to-end systems perform well on the same assays? (2) Would a simple ensemble approach improve things? if they perform well on different assays, then that suggests it might. (3) What are the characteristics of the assays on which the CNN-based approaches perform well or poorly (i.e., how representative is Figure 5)? (4) What happens when the FNN-based approach outperforms the CNN-based ones? in particular, what happens in A13? (5) How sensitive are the approaches to the number of labeled examples of each assay type? (6) Are there particular compounds which seem particularly informative for different assays?\n\nA second major concern is whether the binarized version of this problem (i.e., assay result prediction) is of interest to practitioners. In many contexts, quantitative information is also important (\u201chow much of a response do we see?\u201d). While one could imagine the rough qualitative predictions (\u201cdo we see a response?\u201d) shown here as an initial filtering step, it is hard to believe that the approach proposed here would replace other more informative analysis approaches.  \n\n=== Minor comments\n\nAre individual images from the same sample image always in only the training, validation, or testing set? that is, are there cases where some of the individual images from a particular sample image are in the training set, while others from that sample image are in the testing set?\n\nI did not find the dataset construction description very clear. Does each row in the final, 10 574 x 209 matrix correspond to a single image? Does each image correspond to a single row? For example, it seems as though multiple rows may correspond to the same image (up to four? the three pChEMBL thresholds as well as the activity comment). What is the order in which the filtering and augmenting happens? It would be very helpful to provide a coherent, pipeline description of this (say, in an appendix).\n\nDo all the images in the dataset come from the same microscope (and cell line) at the same resolution, zoom, etc.? If so, it is unclear how well this approach may work for images which are more heterogeneous. There are not very many datasets of the size described (I believe, at least) available. This may significantly limit the practical impact of this work.\n\nHow many epochs are required for convergence of the different architectures? For example, MIL-net has significantly fewer parameters than the others; does it converge on the validation set faster?\n\n=== Typos, etc.\n\nThe references are not consistently formatted.\n\n\u201cnot loosing\u201d -> \u201cnot losing\u201d\n\u201cdoesn\u2019t\u201d -> \u201cdoes not\u201d\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1070/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "End-to-end learning of pharmacological assays from high-resolution microscopy images", "abstract": "Predicting the outcome of pharmacological assays based on high-resolution microscopy\nimages of treated cells is a crucial task in drug discovery which tremendously\nincreases discovery rates.

In my view, the primary contributions are the following: an interesting and relatively new application (predicting assay outcomes), enriching the CellPainting dataset with drug activity data, and a comparison of several relevant methods and architectures. The technical novelty is weak, and although the authors demonstrate that end-to-end holistic approaches outperform previous segmentation-and-feature-extraction approaches, this result is not surprising and has been previously reported in closely related contexts.\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe authors evaluate the possibility of using and end-to-end deep learning approach to predict drug activity using only image data as input. The authors repurpose the CellPainting dataset for activity prediction by adding activity data from online ChEMBL databases. If made available as promised, the dataset will be a valuable resource to the community. The authors compare a number of previous approaches and state-of-the-art image classification network architectures to evaluate the use of CNNs instead of more classical image analysis pipelines. The comparison is a strong point of the paper, although some details are lacking. For example, the authors claim that GapNet is the quickest method to train, and while they report the number of hyperparameters and time per epoch, the number of epochs trained is never mentioned. \n\nThe authors propose an architecture (GapNet) for the assay prediction task. While the way Global Average Pooling is used to extract features at different stages in the network might be new, it is a straightforward combination of GAP and skip connections. Little insight into why this approach is more efficient or evidence for its effectiveness is provided. Similarly, more explanation for why dilated convolutions and SELU activations would be appreciated. A comparison between GapNet and the same network without the GAP connections could possibly provide a more interesting comparison and might also provide a more pervasive argument as to why GapNet\u2019s should be used. Ultimately, the benefit of using GapNet over the other architectures is not strongly motivated, as training time is less of a concern in this application than predictive power.\n\n\nRELATED WORK\n\nThe authors present previous work in a clear and comprehensive manner. However, the reported finding that \u201cCNNs operating on full images containing hundreds of cells can perform significantly better at assay prediction than networks operating on a single-cell level\u201d is not surprising, and partial evidence of this can be found in the literature. In [1], it was shown that penultimate feature activations from pre-trained CNNs applied to whole-image fluorescence microscopy data (MOA prediction) outperform the baseline segmentation-then-feature extraction method (FNN). Similarly, in [2] (the paper proposing MIL-Net), it is shown that end-to-end whole-image CNN learning for protein localization outperforms the baseline (FNN). In [3] whole image end-to-end learning outperforms whole image extracted features for a phenotyping task. All of these references use fluorescence microscopy data similar to the dataset in this work.\n\n[1] Pawlowski, Nick, et al. \"Automating morphological profiling with generic deep convolutional networks.\" bioRxiv (2016): 085118.\n[2] Kraus, Oren Z., Jimmy Lei Ba, and Brendan J.

In my view, the creation of this dataset is the strongest and most valuable contribution of the paper. The method used to collect the data is described clearly and the choices made when compiling the dataset, including the thresholds and combinations of activity measures seems like a well founded approach.\n\nThe authors then identify a number of approaches that are relevant for the problem at hand, binary prediction of drug activity based on image data. These include previous approaches used for cell images and modern image classification networks.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTS\n\nThe different approaches/networks mentioned above were evaluated on a testset. The results indicate that end-to-end CNN approaches outperform all non-end-to-end with no significant difference between the individual end-to-end CNNs. The results are stated clearly and the presentation of different metrics is a nice addition to properly compare the results. It would however contribute valuable information if the authors stated how the confidence intervals of the F1 score are calculated (are the experiments based on several runs of each network or how is it done).\n\n\nNOVELTY/IMPACT\n\n+ Creation of a new dataset on a new and interesting problem \n+ Useful comparison of modern networks on the task\n- GapNet - lacking technical novelty, insight, and performance is unconvincing\n- Demonstrates that end-to-end learning outperforms cell centric approach - was this really surprising or even new information?\n\n\nOTHER NOTES:\n* Figure 3 is never mentioned in the main text\n* Figure 3 (*\u2019s) are confusing. Do they represent outliers? Statistical significance tests?\n* Figure 5 which panel is which?\n* Be clear what you mean when you refer to \u201cupper layers\u201d of a network\n* An important point not mentioned: in practice, many assays use stains that are closely tied to the readout, unlike the dataset here which provides only landmark stains. The results found here do not necessarily apply in other cases.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1070/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "End-to-end learning of pharmacological assays from high-resolution microscopy images", "abstract": "Predicting the outcome of pharmacological assays based on high-resolution microscopy\nimages of treated cells is a crucial task in drug discovery which tremendously\nincreases discovery rates.
