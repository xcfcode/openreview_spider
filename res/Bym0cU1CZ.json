In the system,  dialogue acts are used as one of the 1458 features  for learning a response selection model and a special feature in the following abstract discourse MDP model. \n\nBecause the work is building a system for competition, it is about ensemble of response providers from multiple sources. Therefore,  the policy is response select strategy from a bunch of candidates given the existing contexts. For details, please refer to the second paragraph of Section 4 of the paper.    We would say dialogue acts are not used to guide the generation of responses as most responses in the related work are provided by other sources and it only cares how to select one from the candidates, nor the work used dialogue acts as policies to manage the flow of conversation. Dialogue acts in the work are extra features in the learning of response selection, even in the abstract discourse MDP.  As an evidence, both the states and the actions in their models (Equation (5) and Equation (20)) are not related to dialogue acts, but are conversation history and responses respectively. In abstract discourse MDP, dialogue acts are used as one of the 3 features to guide training data sampling (Equation (18)) for the learning of the response selection model.  Although the work aims to achieve engagement in social chat, it provides no insights on how to understand engagement with dialogue acts, not to mention imitating such behaviors with dialogue acts. \n\nIn summary, we would say the same thing as we commented on the ACL work:\nIt is NOT a study of how dialogue acts can be used to interpret and control dynamic human-machine interactions as policies, NOR it is a study of how the generated responses will be affected by the dialogue acts, which are the major contributions of our work. \n\nDetails:\n1.  Dialogue acts. The dialogue acts in the related work mainly come from the existing 42 acts in Switchboard Corpus, which reflect semantics of single utterances.   Our dialogue acts, however, are designed to describe how human perform in order to keep their social interactions. Therefore, they highly connect to human behavior regarding to conversational contexts. The dialogue acts in the related work are used as features for response selection, while our dialogue acts are used to explain human interactions and control the generation of responses in order to keep conversation going. \n\n2. Insights. No insights on what leads to engagement are provided in the related work. The work just reported  evaluation results in the competition.  We show enough insights from the analysis of human interactions and find that  context switch and question are key acts for engagement in social chat with quantitative evidences.\n\n3. Model. The related work learns a response selection model, while we learn response generation. Therefore, we can show how different types of responses can be generated regarding to different dialogue acts. \n\n4.  Learning. The related work optimizes according to human ratings (from both AMT and Alexa users), while we optimize our model by encouraging long and reasonable conversations through self-play, which is more cost-effective.\n\nAgain, we would like to show our respect to the work and have cited it in the new version"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Towards Interpretable Chit-chat: Open Domain Dialogue Generation with Dialogue Acts", "abstract": "Conventional methods model open domain dialogue generation as a black box through end-to-end learning from large scale conversation data.

Why we need reinforcement learning\n\nAs we have mentioned in the paper, open domain dialogue generation needs to be optimized for long-term engagement in practice.  Yes, in supervised learning, we have large scale of human dialogues tagged with dialogue acts, but that does not mean the algorithm can learn how to keep conversation going from the data, as more than 45% training dialogues are not longer than 5 turns (described in the last paragraph of Section 3.1 in the new version).  Supervised learning just learns a model by maximizing the likelihood of the observed data including the short dialogues. Dialogue acts are learned only according to the history, and no information of the future influence can flow in.  Then, without an additional objective (i.e., Equation (8) in Section 3.2) and mechanism (optimizing for future success), how can we (explicitly) guarantee that the model is optimized for long-term engagement? Therefore, supervised learning is to learn human language and reinforcement learning is to further optimize the combination of dialogue acts in order to achieve long-term conversation.\n\nModel optimization with reinforcement learning is also encouraged by the experimental results. In Table 5, response diversity is significantly improved by RL (see the difference between RL-DAGM and SL-DAGM on distinct-1 and distinct-2), and in Table 4(b), with RL, both the dialogues from machine-machine simulation and human-machine test become longer. Moreover, as we have analyzed in the last paragraph of Section 4.3, it is because RL can promote context switch in interactions that the model, after optimized with RL, can lead to better engagement. All the results well support our motivation to learning with RL.  \n\n2.     >>> the formulation in equation 4 seems to be problematic\n\nThanks for pointing out this problem. We have modified Equation (4) in the previous version as Equation (4)+Equation (5) in the new version. Now the procedure of generation becomes more clear. \n\n3.     >>>\"Simplify pr(ri|si,ai) as pr(ri|ai,ui\u22121,ui\u22122) since decoding natural language responses from long conversation history is challenging\" to my understanding, the only difference between the original and simplified model is the encoder part not the decoder part. Did I miss something\n\nYes, from a model perspective, the simplification here just changes the encoder. However, what we mean here is that it is difficult for an RNN to memorize long conversation history, and thus encoding long history means either the response given by the decoder is irrelevant to the early history, or the response will be messed up. \n\n4.     >>>\"We train m(\u00b7, \u00b7) with the 30 million crawled data through negative sampling.\" not sure I understand the connection between training $m(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ and the entire model\n\n $m(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is pre-trained and used to estimate the reward function in Equation (9). This is the only connection between  $m(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ and the entire model. We have clarified this in the paragraph after Equation (9).\n\n5.    >>>the experiments are not convincing. At least, it should show the generation texts were affected about DAs in a systemic way. Only a single example in table 5 is not enough.\n\nThanks for your comments. We do three things to show how the generated texts are affected by dialogue acts:\n\n(1)\tWe move Table 7 in the previous version from Appendix to Section 4.2. Now the table is Table 5. In the table, one can see that with dialogue acts, the diversity of generated responses is significantly improved (corresponding to much larger distinct-1 and distinct-2).  In the following explanation (the third paragraph of Section 4.2), we claim that this is one benefit of dialogue acts, as search space now becomes act \u00d7 language. \n\n(2)\tWe add Section 4.4 where we compare responses from different dialogue acts using some metrics. The conclusion is that responses generated from CS.* are longer, more informative, and contain more new words than responses generated from CM.*, and statements and answers are generally more informative than questions in both CS.* and CM.*.  Please refer to the new version of the paper to get more details.\n\n(3)\tIn the last paragraph of Section 4.3, we show that simulated dialogues without CS.* are much shorter than those with CS.* (SL: 4.78 v.s. 8.66, RL: 2.67 v.s., 8.18). The result indicates that if we remove CS.*, then the conversation engagement of our model may degrade to the baseline model. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Towards Interpretable Chit-chat: Open Domain Dialogue Generation with Dialogue Acts", "abstract": "Conventional methods model open domain dialogue generation as a black box through end-to-end learning from large scale conversation data.

It is NOT a study of how dialogue acts can be used to interpret and control dynamic human-machine interactions as policies, NOR it is a study of how the generated responses will be affected by the dialogue acts, which are the major contributions of our work. \n\nHere, we would like to clarify the  originality (contributions) of our paper and the difference with the ACL paper.\n\nORIGINALITY:\n1. The first study of how to design dialogue acts to understand how human behave and engage in social chat, instead of using dialogue acts to ground semantics of utterances. The contribution lies in filling the gap between end-to-end open domain dialogue modeling and task-oriented dialogue modeling with task specific dialogue acts, which is not covered by the ACL paper. \n\n2. Insights from the analysis of human interactions. The contribution lies in discovery of the role of context switch for engagement in social chat with quantitative evidences, which is not covered by the ACL paper.\n\n3. The first work on modeling the policy in open domain dialogue management with dialogue acts  and learning the policy (i.e., the combination of dialogue acts in a conversation flow) for long-term conversation by reinforcement learning, which is not covered by the ACL paper.\n\n4. Empirical studies of how human-machine conversation is affected by the dialogue acts, from static generated text to dynamic interactions, which is not covered by the ACL paper. \n\n\nDIFFERENCE\n1. Goal.  The goal of the ACL paper is to study how to leverage VAE techniques to address the\"one-to-many\" problem in open domain dialogues. The major contribution of the ACL paper also lies in the VAE framework, as summarized by the authors in the last paragraph of Introduction of the paper. Our goal is to INTERPRET engagement in human-human social interactions with dialogue acts and thus ENHANCE human-machine engagement in open domain conversations by combining the dialogue acts.\n\n2. Dialogue acts.  Dialogue acts  in ACL paper  are extra features, therefore they come from an existing data set and follow a traditional scheme (42 acts).  Our dialogue acts, however, are designed to describe how human perform in order to keep their social interactions. Therefore, they highly connect to human behavior regarding to conversational contexts and are not covered by any of the existing data sets.  Dialogue acts in the ACL paper are used to measure how well the generated responses are and justify  that the learned latent representations are reasonable. Our dialogue acts, however, are used to interpret and control the flow of human-machine interactions in order to achieve long-term conversation. \n\n3. Model. The ACL paper deals with static response generation (i.e., given a fixed context, how to generate a proper response). Therefore, only the  dialogue act of the last turn (in training) and the predicted dialogue act of the response (in both training and test) are treated as extra features in latent representation learning and response decoding. There are no studies on how the dialogue acts are coordinated and thus affect the flow of conversation. While we deal with dynamic human-machine interactions, therefore, dialogue acts are used to model the policy of dialogue management and guide the flow of conversation. Coordination of dialogue acts across multiple turns is implicitly modeled in the policy network. Note that we also show results of static response generation. That is just to show that our model can give reasonable intermediate results in interactions.\n\n4.  Learning method. The ACL paper learns a dialogue model with VAE. While we treat dialogue acts as a kind of strategies and use reinforcement learning to enhance engagement in human-machine interactions. \n\nAlthough there exists significant difference, we would like to show our respect to this ACL work.  We upload a new version and make the following changes:\n1. We cite the paper and clarify the difference in Related Work\n2. We position our contributions on dialogue act design for interpretation and learning dialogue policies with the dialogue acts.  \n3. We withdraw the claim of \u201cfirst work of using dialogue act in open domain dialogue generation\u201d, and change it  to \u201cwe are the first who design dialogue acts to explain social interactions, control open domain response generation, and guide human-machine conversations.\u201d (see the first paragraph of Related Work)\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Towards Interpretable Chit-chat: Open Domain Dialogue Generation with Dialogue Acts", "abstract": "Conventional methods model open domain dialogue generation as a black box through end-to-end learning from large scale conversation data.

In their evaluations, this approach, and one that additionally uses policy gradient RL with discourse-level objectives to fine-tune the dialogue act predictions, outperform past models for human-scored response quality and conversation engagement.\nWhile this is a fairly straightforward idea with a long history, the authors claim to be the first to use dialogue act prediction for open-domain (rather than task-driven) dialogue. If that claim to originality is not contested, and the authors provide additional assurances to confirm the correctness of the implementations used for baseline models, this article fills an important gap in open-domain dialogue research and suggests a fruitful future for structured prediction in deep learning-based dialogue systems.\n\nSome points:\n1. The introduction uses \"scalability\" throughout to mean something closer to \"ability to generalize.\" Consider revising the wording here.\n2. The dialogue act tag set used in the paper is not original to Ivanovic (2005) but derives, with modifications, from the tag set constructed for the DAMSL project (Jurafsky et al., 1997; Stolcke et al., 2000). It's probably worth citing some of this early work that pioneered the use of dialogue acts in NLP, since they discuss motivations for building DA corpora.\n3. In Section 2.1, the authors don't explicitly mention existing DA-annotated corpora or discuss specifically why they are not sufficient (is there e.g. a dataset that would be ideal for the purposes of this paper except that it isn't large enough?)\n3. The authors appear to consider only one option (selecting the top predicted dialogue act, then conditioning the response generator on this DA) among many for inference-time search over the joint DA-response space. A more comprehensive search strategy (e.g. selecting the top K dialogue acts, then evaluating several responses for each DA) might lead to higher response diversity.\n4. The description of the RL approach in Section 3.2 was fairly terse and included a number of ad-hoc choices. If these choices (like the dialogue termination conditions) are motivated by previous work, they should be cited. Examples (perhaps in the appendix) might also be helpful for the reader to understand that the chosen termination conditions or relevance metrics are reasonable.\n5. The comparison against previous work is missing some assurances I'd like to see. While directly citing the codebases you used or built off of is fantastic, it's also important to give the reader confidence that the implementations you're comparing to are the same as those used in the original papers, such as by mentioning that you can replicate or confirm quantitative results from the papers you're comparing to. Without that there could always be the chance that something is missing from the implementation of e.g. RL-S2S that you're using for comparison.\n6. Table 5 is not described in the main text, so it isn't clear what the different potential outputs of e.g. the RL-DAGM system result from (my guess: conditioning the response generation on the top 3 predicted dialogue acts?)\n7. A simple way to improve the paper's clarity for readers would be to break up some of the very long paragraphs, especially in later sections. It's fine if that pushes the paper somewhat over the 8th page.\n8. A consistent focus on human evaluation, as found in this paper, is probably the right approach for contemporary dialogue research.\n9. The examples provided in the appendix are great. It would be helpful to have confirmation that they were selected randomly (rather than cherry-picked).", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Towards Interpretable Chit-chat: Open Domain Dialogue Generation with Dialogue Acts", "abstract": "Conventional methods model open domain dialogue generation as a black box through end-to-end learning from large scale conversation data.

Not sure whether it is necessary to formulate the problem with a RL framework, since the data have everything that the model needs as for a supervised learning.\n2) the formulation in equation 4 seems to be problematic\n3) \"simplify pr(ri|si,ai) as pr(ri|ai,ui\u22121,ui\u22122) since decoding natural language responses from long conversation history is challenging\" to my understanding, the only difference between the original and simplified model is the encoder part not the decoder part. Did I miss something?\n4) about section 3.2, again I didn't get whether the model needs RL for training.\n5) \"We train m(\u00b7, \u00b7) with the 30 million crawled data through negative sampling.\" not sure I understand the connection between training $m(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ and the entire model.\n6) the experiments are not convincing.
