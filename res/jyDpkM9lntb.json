See some points which drew my attention :\n-- \"1. The vectors from the evaluation V (the number of such vectors is N_criteria) is in the space of given crit...\", I think you mean the number of such vectors is N_combinations?\n-- \"2. Pareto gives solutions that are closer to optimal by some criterion, and farther from optimal by\nother criteria\", -- Rephrase \"closer to optimal\" and \"farther from optimal\". A point is either Pareto optimal or not. Maybe formalize the concept of Pareto optimality. Google might come in handy here as this is something that is often defined. \n-- \"nearest Pareto Front\" I think by definition the Pareto Front is the set of Pareto optimal solutions and therefore is there is no \"nearest Pareto Front to the origin\"\n-- equation 8 contains a mistake: $... \\upsilon_{min} \\in R^{N_{criteria}}, \\upsilon_{min} \\in R^{N_{criteria}}$ should be $\\upsilon_{min} \\in R^{N_{criteria}}, \\upsilon_{max} \\in R^{N_{criteria}}$\n-- \"Thus, the optimal solution is the solution closest to the origin of coordinates\", I still disagree on this point. Optimal according to what distance metric? to what weighting of the objectives? you should probably explicitly say that it would be optimal with an equal weighting of objectives, which would at least be unambiguous. \n\n- It is not clear to me how your method handles the multiple tasks... the task i is not mentioned anymore after equation 6 in section 3. Is the performance over the different tasks averaged? what treatment is applied? Are tasks simply concatenated in the space of criteria? Also define the tasks explicitly in Section 4, give examples.\n\n- However, the main flaw remains indeed in the lack of comparisons. I am positive that there are many methods out there to compare with, even if they are only naive approaches (such as the one suggested by reviewer 2). Without baselines, we are left wondering if this is improving over anything. If there no simple baseline to evaluate against, then you must convince the reader why this is a hard problem, a thing the paper does not do in its current form."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper844/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper844/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-Task Multicriteria Hyperparameter Optimization", "authorids": ["~Kirill_Akhmetzyanov1", "uz@at.pstu.ru"], "authors": ["Kirill Akhmetzyanov", "Alexander Yuzhakov"], "keywords": ["hyperparameter optimization", "machine learning", "neural network"], "abstract": "We present a new method for searching optimal hyperparameters among several tasks and several criteria.

We have made changes in the paper to better address your concerns. Although there are few points of disagreement, we are definitely respectful and grateful to the reviewer for the valuable comments.\n\n**Experiments don't say what dataset they used** The dataset used consists of tasks. Each task consists of several images of one of two objects such as a plastic bottle and other object. The tasks differ in how the images are made, namely lighting, background and used cameras. Please see page 4 section 4.1 for the change.\n\n**Real values for objectives never provided** We have added plots for the learning curve of the neural network for each test set and each epoch for the obtained optimal hyperparameters. Please see Appendix C for the change.\n\n**No baseline / comparison. Evaluate against baselines** We agree that it is a significant drawback of our work. In future research, we will eliminate it and do more extensive experiments.\n\n**No justification for method choice** Pareto filters out obviously non-optimal solutions among all combinations of hyperparameters and keeps those that are optimal according to some criteria. Using the criteria, we choose among the Pareto optimal solutions those that are optimal according to the given criterion. That is, we put a correspondence between the Pareto optimal solutions and criteria. In the future, if we want to choose solutions according to other new criteria, then it is enough to calculate the objective function for the new criteria and choose among the previously obtained Pareto solutions that are optimal for these new criteria. Thus, we spend an excessive amount of time training neural networks with all combinations of hyperparameters, but we save time when evaluating. Please see page 2 section 2 for changes.\n\n**Hyperparameter optimization or a selection procedure** In [1] it is said that hyperparameter optimization is the choice of such hyperparameters at which the objective function reaches a minimum. This is the same as the optimization problem described in our article (equation (1)). Therefore, we say that in our article hyperparameter optimization is carried out, and not a selection procedure.\n\n**Equal weight for all objectives is not an optimal solution** We agree that such a solution is not optimal in terms of the objective function. But here it is not about the objective function, it is about the relation between the criteria. That is, in this case, the optimal means not to give preference to any criterion, but to equalize them with each other and choose a solution that corresponds these equal criteria. Thus, we say that equal weight is correct for choosing the optimal solution.\n\n**Add some figures explaining the whole procedure** We have added six figures to explain the steps of our method. Please see page 3 section 3.2 for the change.\n\n**Provide some justification for the steps of the method** Pareto gives solutions that are closer to optimal by some criterion, and farther from optimal by other criteria. These solutions can already be called optimal. But they are optimal according to various criteria. To determine by what criteria these Pareto-selected solutions are optimal, we calculate the objective function for different criteria. For these specified criteria, we obtain the corresponding optimal solutions. See changed section 3.2.\n\n**Have someone not familiar with the work revise the paper before submitting** Thanks for the suggestion. We will take it into account in our future research.\n\n**The whole paper needs to be rewritten with an emphasis on properly defining terms, objectives and research questions** We have added a definition of task and criterion, and research objective. We agree with the reviewer that the article needs to be significantly improved.\n\n[1] James Bergstra and Yoshua Bengio. Random search for hyper-parameter optimization.

We are glad to hear that our solution is interesting from a technical point of view.\n\n**Why this proposed method should work well** In our method, Pareto optimality means that it is impossible to improve the Pareto optimal solution by any criteria without worsening it by at least one other criteria. Thus, for a certain set of values \u200b\u200bof the criteria, the Pareto-selected solutions are optimal. These optimal solutions corresponds to some criteria. We set the criteria. Further, from these Pareto optimal solutions, it is necessary to determine the closest criteria to the given criteria. In our method, this is done by finding the minimum weighted sum of Pareto solutions (where the weight is the inverse criteria). Please see page 2 for change.\n\n**No comparison to state-of-the-art method** We agree that no comparison with baselines is a significant drawback of our work. In future research, we will eliminate it and do more extensive experiments.\n\n**Experiments are not convincing** We have added plots for the learning curve of the neural network for each test set and each epoch for the obtained optimal hyperparameters. Please see Appendix C for the change.\n\n**Include descriptions of this problem** Yes, we should have added a description of the problem. Let's first introduce the term task. *Task* means a set of images with a number of classes $ N_{classes} $ and a number of images $ N_{images} $. There are examples of the same classes between tasks, the difference is how the images are made (different lighting, background and used cameras). The problem is in the choice of such hyperparameters, which achieve the highest classification accuracy among several tasks. Each task consists of several images of one of two objects such as a plastic bottle and other object. The tasks differ in how the images are made, namely lighting, background and used cameras. Please see page 4 section 4.1 for changes.\n\n**Add more realistic real-world problems** We have added cited articles for computer vision, robotics, natural language processing and speech synthesis on page 1 in section 2. \n\n**What N_combination is exactly and why it's different from N_parameter** There is hyperparameter set $ H $. $ N_{parameter} $ is size of the set $ H $, $ N_{parameter} = |H| $. Some hyperparameters are quantitative (for example, learning rate), other ones are categorical (for example, learning method). Quantitative hyperparameters are in a certain interval with a fixed step. Search in the proposed method is performed on all combinations of these hyperparameter values, and the number of such combinations is indicated by $ N_{combination} $.\n\n**Typo: in Eq (4), x_sise -> x_size** Thanks for the typo found.
