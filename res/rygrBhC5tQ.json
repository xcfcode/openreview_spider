Wouldn\u2019t a linear function of \u201cstep\u201d be more natural here?\u201d\n\nThe proximity predictor is used to reward the ending state of a transition trajectory in how close it is to the initiation set of the next primitive as well as actions that increase proximity. As R3 suggested, both linear and exponential functions are valid choices for a proximity function. \n\nWe have experimentally compared the linear and exponential proximity functions. Our model is able to learn well with both functions and they perform similarly. We added the result to our website (Ablation study on Proximity functions: https://sites.google.com/view/transitions-iclr2019#h.p_qGO2W2Dk2q8G ) and will it add to the supplementary.\n\nOriginally, we opted for the exponential proximity function with the intuition that the faster initial decay near the initiation set would help the policy discriminate successful states from failing states near the initiation set. Also, in our experiments, as we use 0.95 as a decaying factor, the proximity is still reasonably large (e.g., 0.35 for 20 time-steps and 0.07 for 50 time-steps).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1537/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1537/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1537/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Composing Complex Skills by Learning Transition Policies", "abstract": "Humans acquire complex skills by exploiting previously learned skills and making transitions between them.

In other words, a termination signal (success/failure of the primitive policy) comes from the primitive policy, i.e. the walker falls down or the arm picks up a box. This call-and-return style [1-3] of execution ensures the same policy is utilized in consecutive steps until its completion. Hierarchical reinforcement methods have employed this call-and-return style when sub-policies are learned for well-defined sub-tasks that do not require a context switch during their execution.\n\n> R1: \u201c... the weaknesses and the limits of the method?\u201d\n\nWe discuss a few assumptions that we made and good follow-up directions below. We will also add the discussion to the revised version.\n\nOur model-free transition policies rely on random exploration. Specifically, we made an assumption that successful transition trajectories between two consecutive policies should be achievable by random exploration (i.e. an initiation set of a primitive policy should be reachable from the ending states of the previous policies). As soon as a transition policy succeeds once, the proximity predictor will learn what good states are and subsequently the transition policy will succeed more frequently. To alleviate the exploration problem with sparse rewards, our transition policy training can incorporate exploration methods that utilize count-based exploration bonuses [4-6], curiosity-driven intrinsic rewards [7-10], etc.\n\nOur current framework is designed to focus on acquiring transition policies that can connect a given set of primitive policies. We believe that additionally enabling an agent to adaptively augment its primitive set [11-12] based on a new environment or task is a promising future direction.\n\nWe assume our primitive policies return a signal that indicates whether the execution should be terminated or not, similar to [1-3, 13]. Without access to this termination signal, the transition policy would learn from very sparse and delayed reward. \n\n\n[1] Oh et al. \u201cZero-shot task generalization with multi-task deep reinforcement learning\u201d, ICML 2017\n[2] Andreas et al. \u201cModular multitask reinforcement learning with policy sketches\u201d, ICML 2017\n[3] Kulkarni et al. \u201cHierarchical deep reinforcement learning: Integrating temporal abstraction and intrinsic motivation\u201d, NIPS 2016\n[4] Strehl Littman \u201cAn analysis of model-based interval estimation for markov decision processes\u201d, Journal of Computer and System Sciences (JCSS) 2008\n[5] Bellemare et al \u201cUnifying Count-Based Exploration and Intrinsic Motivation\u201d, NIPS  2016 \n[6] Martin et al. \u201cCount-Based Exploration in Feature Space for Reinforcement Learning\u201d, IJCAI 2017\n[7] Schmidhuber \u201cA possibility for implementing curiosity and boredom in model-building neural controllers\u201d, From animals to animats: Proceedings of the first international conference on simulation of adaptive behavior, 1991\n[8] Pathak et al. \u201cCuriosity-driven Exploration by Self-supervised Prediction\u201d, ICML 2017\n[9] Achiam and Sastry \u201cSurprise-Based Intrinsic Motivation for Deep Reinforcement Learning\u201d, NIPS Workshop 2016\n[10] Stadie et al. \u201cIncentivizing exploration in reinforcement learning with deep predictive models\u201d, NIPS Workshop 2015\n[11] Hausman et al. \u201cLearning an Embedding Space for Transferable Robot Skills\u201d, ICLR 2018\n[12] Gudimella et al. \u201cDeep reinforcement learning for dexterous manipulation with concept networks\u201d, arXiv 2017\n[13] Le et al. \u201cHierarchical Imitation and Reinforcement Learning\u201d, ICML 2018\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1537/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1537/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1537/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Composing Complex Skills by Learning Transition Policies", "abstract": "Humans acquire complex skills by exploiting previously learned skills and making transitions between them.
