The method is build upon  the GAN framework where the latent variables are divided into different subsets (chunks) which are expected to encode information about high-level factors of variation. To this end, a Siamese Network for each chunk is trained with a contrastive loss minimizing the distance between generated images sharing the same factor (the latent variables in the chunk are equal), and maximizing the distance between pairs where the latent variables differ. Given that the proposed model fails in this fully-unsupervised setting, the authors propose to add weak-supervision into the model by forcing the Siamese networks to  focus only on particular aspects of generated images (e.g, color, edges, etc..). This is achieved by applying  a basic transformation  over the input images in order to remove specific information. The evaluation of the  proposed model is carried out using the MS-Celeb dataset where the authors provide qualitative results.\n\n\nMethodology\n\n*Disentangling generative factors without explicit labels is a challenging and interesting problem. The idea of dividing the latent representation in different subsets and using a proxy task involving triplets of images has been already explored in [3]. However, the use of Siamese networks in this context is novel and sound.\n\n*As shown in the reported results, the proposed method fails to learn meaningful factors in the unsupervised setting. However, the authors do not provide an in-depth discussion of this phenomena. Given that previous works [1,2,3] have successfully addressed this problem using a completely unsupervised approach, it would be necessary to give more insights about: (i) why the proposed method is failing (ii) why this negative result is interesting and (iii) if the method could be useful in other potential scenarios. \n\n*The strategy proposed to introduce weak-supervision is too ad-hoc. I agree that using cues such as the average color of an image can be useful if we want to model basic factors of variation. However, it is unclear how a similar strategy could be applied if we are interested in learning variables with higher-level semantics such as the expression of a face or its pose.\n\n*As far as I understand, the transformations applied to the input images (e.g, edge detection) must be differentiable (given that it is necessary to backpropagate the gradient of the contrastive loss through the generator network). If this is the case, this should be properly discussed in the paper. Moreover, given that the amount of differentiable transformations is reduced, this also limits the application of the proposed method for more interesting scenarios. \n\n*It is not clear why the latent variables modelling the generative factors are defined using a Gaussian prior. How the case where two images have a very similar latent factor is avoided while generating pairs of images for the Siamese network?  Have the authors considered to use categorical or binary variables? The use of the contrastive loss sounds more appropriate in this case.\n\n\nExperimental results\n\n*The experimental section is too limited. First of all, only a small number of qualitative results are reported and, therefore, it is very difficult to assess the proposed method and draw any conclusion. For example, when the edge extractor is used, what kind of information is modeled by the latent variables? Is it consistent across different samples?\n\nMoreover, it is not clear why the authors have limited the evaluation to the case where only two \u201cchunks\u201d are used. In principle, the method could be applied with many more subsets of latent variables and then manually inspect them to check it they are semantically meaningful (see [2]) \n\n*As previously mentioned, there are many recent works addressing the same problem from a fully-unsupervised perspective [1,2,3]. All these works provide quantitative results evaluating the learned representations by using them to predict real labels (e.g, attributes in the CelebA data-set). The authors could provide a similar evaluation for their method by using the feature representations learned by the siamese networks in order to evaluate how much information they convey about real factors of variation. This could clarify the advantages of the weakly-supervised strategy compared to unsupervised approaches.\n\nReview summary\n\n+The addressed problem (learning disentangled representations without explicit labeling) is challenging and interesting.\n\n+The idea of using a proxy task (contrastive loss with triplets of generated images) is somewhat novel and promising.\n\n- The authors report only negative results for the fully-unsupervised version of UD-GAN The paper lacks and in-depth discussion about why this negative result is interesting.\n\n-The strategy proposed to provide weak-supervision to the model is too ad-hoc and it is not clear how to apply it in general applications\n\n-The experimental section do not clarify the benefits of the proposed approach. In particular, the qualitative results are too limited and no quantitative evaluations is provided.\n\n\n[1] Variational Inference of Disentangled Latent Concepts from Unlabelled Observations (Kumar et al, ICLR 2018)\n\n[2] Beta-vae: Learning basic visual concepts with a constrained variational framework.

You can find our response below.\n\n[Embedding Dimensionality or Our Methods]\n\nIn order to compute the disentanglement score, we chose our embedding dimensionality to be consistent with Beta-VAE and DIP-VAE. For the CelebA dataset, our embedding vector has a total of 32 dimensions. For the 2D shapes dataset, it has 10 dimensions. We take these values from Beta-VAE, which are also repeated by DIP-VAE. You can find more details for our unsupervised and guided approaches below. We will explicitly emphasize this in the next iteration of our paper.\n\n(UD-GAN) For the CelebA dataset, we have 32 knobs, each correspond to a one-dimensional latent slice. Our generator maps this 32-dimensional latent vector into images. After that, we could follow two ways to embed a generated image:\n\n1) By using 32 different siamese networks, each produce a 1-dimensional embedding\n2) By using 1 siamese network, which produces a 32-dimensional embedding\n\nWe use the second approach, which shares one siamese network and embeds an image into a 32-dimensional embedding vector. The main reason for this parameter sharing is to save GPU memory. Note that, for each knob, we calculate the contrastive loss by only using the corresponding single embedding dimension, not on the whole 32-dim embedding vector. This means that, each latent dimension corresponds to a single and unique embedding dimension.\n\n(UD-GAN-G) For the CelebA dataset, we use 32 knobs. The first 28 knobs are unguided and processed by the same siamese network, which embeds a generated image into a 28-dimensional embedding vector. As we explained for the unguided case above, this is only to save GPU memory and each embedding dimension is still separately treated. For the remaining 4 knobs, a generated image is guided by four image crops and fed into four different siamese networks, each embeds an image into a 1-dimensional vector. The concatenation of all siamese network outputs has thus 32-dimensions. For the 2D shapes dataset, we use 10 knobs. The first 7 knobs are unguided and the rest three knobs are guided with three separate siamese networks.\n\n[Visual Results for UD-GAN]\n\nWe did not include visual results for UD-GAN case due to space constraints. It indeed learns semantically meaningful factors. We will add these visual results to our Appendix for a better comparison.\n\n[UD-GAN High-Level Generative Factors and Performance]\n\nIn Section \u201c3.4 Probabilistic Interpretation\u201d, we show that minimizing the contrastive loss results in a disentangled embedding representation. This is also illustrated in the correlation matrix of the inferred embedding vectors in Table 9 in Appendix G. Some of the embedding dimensions are strongly related to certain high-level generative factors, because it was possible to use our embedding vectors to classify the existence of an attribute, as shown in Table 2. With our unsupervised method (UD-GAN), there is no guarantee to capture all of the desired high-level generative factors. However, it is still possible to model some of them, as long as the GAN does not have convergence issues, such as mode collapse.\n\n[Siamese Networks - Hair Color Attribute - Disentangling]\n\nIn Figure 2, for the hair color attribute, we only change the knob \\q_{top} that corresponds to the guided siamese network \\phi_{top}. The other latent dimension values are kept the same. The output of \\phi_{top} is a one-dimensional embedding, but is not shown in Figure 2.\n\nIn Table 9, Appendix G, we show the correlation matrix of the concatenated embedding vectors (in total 32 dimensions for the CelebA dataset) both for UD-GAN and UD-GAN-G. We infer embedding vectors by passing real images through our siamese embedding networks and (similar to DIP-VAE) computing the correlation matrix on these vectors. As illustrated, individual embedding dimensions are uncorrelated with each other and correlated with real high-level attributes in the CelebA dataset.\n\n[Ad-Hoc Guidance in UD-GAN-G]\n\nComing up with a guidance function is easier for certain variations than others. Our main goal is not to design guidance functions for each and every attribute. Instead, our guidance approach complements the literature in the sense that it offers a way to disentangle some of the spuriously correlated variations without labeled data. The rest of the variations can be modeled in an unsupervised way, similar to how UD-GAN and other unsupervised techniques operate."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1220/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1220/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1220/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unlabeled Disentangling of GANs with Guided Siamese Networks", "abstract": "Disentangling underlying generative factors of a data distribution is important for interpretability and generalizable representations.

However, I think that the followed experimental setup is not clearly explained in the paper:\n\n\n-How many \u201cknobs\u201d/Siamese networks are used in UD-GAN? If it\u2019s only one (as I have understood), how is the method supposed to model different variation factors? \n\n\n-What is the dimensionality of the latent representation used to compute the disentanglement metric?  Is it the same than the one used in the compared methods? Otherwise, the reported results are not directly comparable.\n\n\n-The authors do not show any qualitative result on the CelebA dataset for the unguided version. Does UD-GAN learn semantically meaningful factors in these dataset? \n\n\nWithout all this information it is difficult to assess that UD-GAN is really learning disentangled representations. Moreover, as the authors state in the paper, there is not any guarantee that their unsupervised method will learn to model high-level generative factors. Therefore, it is counter-intuitive that UD-GAN outperformed all the previous state-of-the-art unsupervised methods. The paper does not provide any convincing explanation or discussion about this issue. \n\n\n\n[Guided Method]\n\nI still think that the approach used to provide weak-supervision is too ad hoc. I am not convinced about how the proposed strategy can be applied to real scenarios where removing information related with the generative factors can be extremely difficult. For example, in the CelebA dataset, how the followed strategy could be used to disentangle the \u201cMake-up\u201d attribute?\n\n\nApart from this, I have also questions about the experimental setup followed to evaluate the guided method. In particular, it is unclear which is the representation used to compute the disentangle metric. As far as I have understood, it is the concatenation of the last layer of the different Siamese networks. This results in a much larger dimensionality compared to the one used in UD-GAN and in the compared baselines. As a consequence, the reported numbers are not directly comparable.  \n\n\nAlso related with this issue, if one Siamese network is supposed to capture information about one high-level factor (e.g, hair color), why the representation of all the Siamese networks is used?. In my opinion, a convincing evaluation would consists on using only the representation of the Siamese network that is supposed to model the specific attribute  (e.g \\psi_{top}).  This is the only way to actually show that the proposed method is disentangling the different high.level attributes.\n\n\n[Revised score]\n\nIn conclusion, I slightly updated my score given the additional material provided in the updated version. However, I still think that the paper is not ready for publication given all the discussed issues.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1220/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1220/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1220/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unlabeled Disentangling of GANs with Guided Siamese Networks", "abstract": "Disentangling underlying generative factors of a data distribution is important for interpretability and generalizable representations.

I did not look at the other reviews].\n\n-------------------------------\nSummary\n-------------------------------\nThis paper proposes to learn disentangled latent states under the GAN framework. The core idea is to partition the latent states into N partitions, and correspondly have N Siamese networks that pull the generated images with the same latent partition towards each other, along with a contrastive loss which ensures generated images with different latent partitions to be different. The authors experiment with two setups: in the \"unguided setup\" training is completely unsupervised, while in the \"guided\" setup, there is some weak supervision to encourage different partitions to learn different factors.\n\n-------------------------------\nEvaluation\n-------------------------------\nWhile the motivation is nice, I find the results (especially in the unguided setup) underwhelming. This does not seem surprising to me, as in the unguided case, the constrative loss seems not strong enough to encourage the latent partitions to be different. Results with weak supervision (their method for injecting weak supervision was very nice) are more impressive. However, there is no comparison against existing work. Learning disentangled representations with deep generative models is very much an active area. Here are some recent papers:\n\nhttps://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=Sy2fzU9gl\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05822\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05983\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04942\n\nImportantly, there are no quantitative metrics. I do not think this work is ready for publication.\n\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1220/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Unlabeled Disentangling of GANs with Guided Siamese Networks", "abstract": "Disentangling underlying generative factors of a data distribution is important for interpretability and generalizable representations.

The key idea is to use siamese networks with contrastive loss. Specifically, it decomposes the latent code to a set of knobs (sub part of the latent code). Each time it renders different images with different configurations of the knobs. For example, 1) as changing one knob while keeping the others, it expects it would only result in change of one attribute in the image, and 2) as keeping one knob while changing all the others, it expects it would result in large change of image appearances. The relative magnitude of change for 1) and 2) justifies the use of a Siamese network in addition to the image discriminator in the standard GAN framework. The paper further talks about how to use inductive bias to design the Siamese network so that it can control the semantic meaning of a particular knob. \n\nWhile I do like the idea, I think the paper is still in the early stage. First of all, the paper does not include any numerical evaluation. It only shows a couple of examples. It is unclear how well the proposed method works in general. In addition, the InfoGAN work is designed  for the same functionality. The paper should compare the proposed work to the InfoGAN work both quantitatively and qualitatively to justify its novelty.
