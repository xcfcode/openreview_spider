They evaluate the architecture on a visual relational task called the \"Relations Game\" which involves comparing Tetris-like shapes according to their appearance, relative positions, etc.. They show that their architecture leads to useful generalizable representations in the sense that they can be used for new tasks without retraining.\n\nI think this paper contains a number of unusual and interesting ideas but is let down by its presentation. The writing is good, but provides very little intuition for why we should expect this approach to work (aside from its connection to equation 1) - I discuss this in more depth below. The experimental task is interesting (I'm okay with synthetic tasks of this form for unusual new architectures like this), but I'm not sure what it tests that isn't tested in the CLEVR and sort-of -CLEVR datasets which rely on similar relational reasoning to solve. The advantage of those datasets is they are well-established with strong baselines so we can be more certain that a fair comparison is been made. I've voted to reject this paper because I feel its premature in its current form.\n\nExpanding on this - The description of PrediNet covers the basics, but missing detail and intuition for why certain choices are made. For example, \n - why is L flattened for the queries (I think it\u2019s because the query is independent of pixel location, but flattening seems of when L also includes co-ordinates) but not the key, K? \n - Why is the key space shared between heads (this seems more intuitive - keys should have consistent meaning\u2026 but if that\u2019s the case, make that intention explicit)? \n - Also, writing the dimensionality of the matrices, would help (e.g. is W_S in R^{m x j} or R^{m x 1} or something else?). \n - What is the meaning of the position features in E_1 and E_2? From the softmax product it seems they should be a weighted sum of the pixels that are addressed - implying that it is the weighted average location?\n - The final representation mostly consists of an h x (j) vector (ignoring positions) containing the output of the comparators. Could you provide some intuition for why we would expect such a representation to be useful for the downstream task? This representation seems to differ substantially from what is used in the baseline methods: i.e. attention-weighted sums of the input features.\n\n ", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper576/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper576/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "An Explicitly Relational Neural Network Architecture", "authors": ["Murray Shanahan", "Kyriacos Nikiforou", "Antonia Creswell", "Christos Kaplanis", "David Barrett", "Marta Garnelo"], "authorids": ["mshanahan@google.com", "knikiforou@google.com", "tonicreswell@google.com", "christos.kaplanis14@imperial.ac.uk", "barrettdavid@google.com", "garnelo@google.com"], "keywords": ["relational representation"], "TL;DR": "We present an end-to-end differentiable architecture that learns to map pixels to predicates, and evaluate it on a suite of simple relational reasoning tasks", "abstract": "With a view to bridging the gap between deep learning and symbolic AI, we present a novel end-to-end neural network architecture that learns to form propositional representations with an explicitly relational structure from raw pixel data.

Please compare the proposed model with it.\u201d\n\nResponse:\n\nThank you for drawing our attention to this work (Dong et al (2019)). We have added it to the bibliography of the revised paper, and cited it in the Related Work section. As we point out there, Dong et al tackle an orthogonal problem to the one we\u2019ve tackled. Dong et al\u2019s NLM carries out inductive inference, assuming input is given in terms of propositions, relations, and objects. Our primary contribution is an architecture (the PrediNet) that _discovers_ objects and relations in the raw data, and learns to generate representations in propositional form built out of the objects and relations it has discovered. So, like the other papers we cite in this context, their work complements ours.\n\n\nReviewer #2: \u201cmy major concern is about its effectiveness on high-dimensional images with more realistic objects as in the CLEVR dataset other than 2d-grid objects. It would be better if the authors could extend their method to natural images.\u201d\n\nResponse:\n\nYou are right, of course, that a novel architecture eventually needs to be proven against rich, real-world data. But, as we argue in Section 3 of the paper, we believe it would be \u201cpremature to apply the PrediNet architecture to rich, complex data before we have a basic understanding of its properties and its behaviour\u201d. The best way to do this is with simple datasets and tasks. (We note that reviewer #1 is sympathetic to this.)

As stated there, W_S is in R^{m x j}. (Sorry the font size is a bit small; there\u2019s a lot packed in to that figure. But the resolution is high, so everything should be legible if viewed on screen.)\n\n\nReviewer #1: \u201cWhat is the meaning of the position features in E_1 and E_2? From the softmax product it seems they should be a weighted sum of the pixels that are addressed - implying that it is the weighted average location?\u201d\n\n\nResponse:\n\nThe last two elements of each input feature vector in L are the xy co-ordinates of the associated patch in the image generated by the CNN. So, you are quite right that, after softmax, this yields the weighted average location. In practice, whether a head attends focally to a specific object, or diffusely to a patch of the background, this yields the centre of mass of whatever is being attended to, which is intuitive and seems to work well. (Unfortunately there isn\u2019t space for this clarification in the revised paper.)\n\n\nReviewer #1: \u201cThe final representation mostly consists of an h x (j) vector (ignoring positions) containing the output of the comparators.

Section 7 of the revised paper has the following new material:\n\n\u201cAlthough, the present experiments don\u2019t use the fully propositional version of the PrediNet output, the concatenated vector form inherits many of its beneficial properties, notably a degree of compositionality. In particular, one important respect in which the PrediNet differs from other network architectures is the extent to which it canalises information flow; at the core of the network, information is organised into small chunks that are processed in parallel channels that limit the ways the chunks can interact. We believe this pressures the network to learn representations where each separate chunk of information (such as a single value in the vector R*) has independent meaning and utility. (We see evidence of this in the relational disentanglement of Fig. 6.)

We have revised the paper accordingly. We hope you feel your concerns have been addressed, and that you will consider recommending acceptance. (Note that this is a two-part response.)\n\n\nReviewer #1: \u201cI'm not sure what [the Relations Game] tests that isn't tested in the CLEVR and sort-of -CLEVR datasets which rely on similar relational reasoning to solve \u2026\u201d\n\nResponse:\n\nAlthough it\u2019s gratifying that the PrediNet out-performs the baselines in various respects, our primary aim in this work is not to demonstrate superior performance, but to present a novel architecture conforming to certain high-level design principles, and to explore some of its basic properties. So we wanted to use simple datasets, and were keen to avoid tasks with confounding features. This ruled out CLEVR on a couple of grounds. First, the 3D nature of the images entails confounding visual complexities such as occlusion and shadows. Second, the CLEVR task involves language input, which is another confounding factor. The sort-of-CLEVR dataset was similarly ruled out, on the second of these grounds (though not the first). A further consideration was that we needed datasets that could be split into multiple tasks in many different ways, so that we could follow the three-step protocol of pre-training , freezing, and re-training (Fig. 3 of the paper). Neither CLEVR nor sort-of-CLEVR lend themselves to this kind of task-level split. Finally, at test time we wanted to use fully held-out objects - that is to say objects with colours not seen during training and shapes not seen during training - which neither CLEVR nor sort-of-CLEVR provide for. We weren\u2019t aware of any existing datasets meeting these criteria, so we devised a new one (the Relations Game). (Indeed, we consider the Relations Game family of tasks as one of the contributions of the paper, albeit only a minor one.)\n\nWe have added the following paraphrased version of the above paragraph to Section 3 the revised paper:\n\n\u201cExisting datasets for relational reasoning tasks, such as CLEVR (Johnson et al (2017)) and sort-of-CLEVR (Santoro et al (2017)), were ruled out because they include confounding complexities, such as occlusion and shadows or language input, and/or because they don\u2019t lend themselves to the fine-grained task-level splits we required. Consequently, we devised a new configurable family of simple classification tasks that we collectively call the Relations Game.\u201d\n\n\nReviewer #1: \u201cWhy is L flattened for the queries (I think it\u2019s because the query is independent of pixel location, but flattening seems of when L also includes co-ordinates) but not the key, K?\u201d\n\nResponse:\n\nThe whole (flattened) image is used to generate queries so that what a head attends to can depend on the full (non-local) context of what\u2019s in the image. For example, perhaps a head needs to pick out the red object in the top-left of the image because there is another red object in the bottom right of the image. By contrast, the shared key space can be determined from local information only.\n\nWe have added the following paraphrased version of the above sentences to Section 2 of the revised paper:\n\n\u201cThe whole (flattened) image is used to generate queries, allowing attention masks to depend on its full (non-local) content.\u201d\n\n\nReviewer #1: \u201cWhy is the key space shared between heads (this seems more intuitive - keys should have consistent meaning\u2026 but if that\u2019s the case, make that intention explicit)?\u201d\n\nResponse:\n\nYes, this ensures that the set of entities that are candidates for attention is consistent across heads.

Please compare the proposed model with it.\n\n- Minor: Figures are understandable, but some of them are too small, especially for the graphical legend. As space is an issue, I would suggest removing some plots and increasing the size of the ones provided. \n\n- In Figure 1, is g equal to n? \n\n[1] Neural Logic Machines.
