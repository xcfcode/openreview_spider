W., Paninski, L., & Cunningham, J. P. (2016). NIPS or Johnson, M., Duvenaud, D. K., Wiltschko, A., Adams, R. P., & Datta, S. R. (2016).

Rudolph, F. Ruiz, S. Athey, and D. Blei (2017). NIPS and L. Liu, F. Ruiz, S. Athey, and D. Blei.  (2017).

The contexts can be learned by, in principle, any model including neural networks, while the final predictions are supposed to be made by some simple models like linear ones. The probabilistic model allows for the simultaneous training of explanation and prediction parts as opposed to some recent post-hoc methods.\n\nThe experimental part of the paper considers variety of experiments, including classification on MNIST, CIFAR-10, IMDB and also some experiments on survival analysis. I should note, that the quality of the algorithm is in general similar to other methods considered (as expected). However, while in some cases the CEN algorithm is slightly better, in other cases it appears to sufficiently loose, see for example left part of Figure 3(b) for MNIST data set. It would be interesting to know the explanation. Also, it would be interesting to have more examples of qualitative analysis to see, that the learned explanations are really useful. I am a bit worried, that while we have interpretability with respect to intermediate features, these features theirselves might be very hard to interpret.\n\nTo sum up, I think that the general idea looks very natural and the results are quite supportive.

Although, there is no silver bullet -- if the data is complex, the model that can accurately represent such data will end up being complex in one way or another. Using neural nets as components of a graphical model (e.g., neural potential functions) results in a powerful model. However, to understand patterns of the relationships between variables of interest learned by such model would require \u201cdigging\u201d into each neural component separately.\n\nCENs, on the other hand, manage this complexity by explicitly localizing it in the conditional p(\\theta | C) -- once we conditioned on the context of interest, we get an explanation which we can understand by simply inspecting its parameters (see footnote 1 on page 2). In this sense, CENs are akin to modular meta-learning approaches (where one constructs models that generate other models) rather than \u201cmonolithic\u201d deep graphical models.\n\nRegarding novelty of our approach, we wish to emphasize that, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose using deep networks for generating parameters for simple graphical models which are then used for prediction and inference. We have elaborated on the differences and similarities in Section 2 in the revised version.\n\nContext representation & amortized inference\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nCENs assume that the representation of the context is given and fixed; learning context embeddings along with predictions is beyond the scope of this work. But thank you for pointing out relevant work -- in the future work, it would interesting to extend CENs to scenarios where context embeddings [1] are learned jointly with the model, or borrow ideas from context selection [2] to improve interpretability of the map from contexts to explanations.\n\nAmortized inference is unnecessary for the types of CENs considered in this work because p(\\theta | C) takes a fairly simple form. If one wishes to have a more hierarchical or structured representation of p(\\theta | C), ideas from [3] would be very useful.\n\nRepresentational power\n---------------------------------\nNeural networks \u201ceating up\u201d the entire representational power is a valid concern. Dictionary and sparsity constraints were chosen to protect us from such scenarios: by constraining the dictionary size and imposing a small sparsity penalty on its atoms, we force CEN to select explanations from a restricted class of models, and hence implicitly control the representational power available the neural part of the model.\n\nWe also wish to emphasize a critical point: the context encoder in CEN does not output \u201ccontext-specific features\u201d as you point out. Instead, it outputs *parameters* for a graphical model which is then used on top of features X (where X is fixed, not learned). The predictive power of CEN necessarily depends on the quality of X and the class of graphical models that are used as explanations (see Appendix A for a detailed discussion).\n\n---\n[1] M.

Larger dictionaries allow for more flexibility so that CENs approach or surpass the performance of the vanilla deep networks.\n\nSparsity regularization\n------------------------------\nWe found that the results were quite stable and not very sensitive to the sparsity regularization hyperparameter. Adding a small sparsity penalty on the dictionary (between 1e-6 and 1e-3) helped to avoid overfitting for very large dictionary sizes -- the model learned to use only a few explanations from the dictionary for prediction while shrinking the rest of the dictionary to zeros. For instance, on the Satellite data, we set the dictionary size to an arbitrary number (16 or 32) and the model learned to always select between only 2 explanations (M1 and M2) and kept using those for prediction.\n\nWe have elaborated on these two points in Section 4.1.1 in the revised version."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Contextual Explanation Networks", "abstract": "We introduce contextual explanation networks (CENs)---a class of models that learn to predict by generating and leveraging intermediate explanations.
