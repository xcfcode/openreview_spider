The novelty in the proposed paper is a multi-scale formulation, which creates multiple scales from the input image and feeds them into different hourglass modules. The different scales are weighted differently, where the weights for a given scale depend on the error obtained on previous scales.\n\nImportant issues:\n\nThe novelty seems to be not sufficient to me, as multi-scale solutions are not new in computer vision and have been applied a lot in pose estimation as well, be it deep neural models or older techniques. In particular in deep models, multi-scale techniques have been proposed extensively for resolution preserving image to image mappings (which is done here), beginning with quite \u201cold\u201d techniques (in deep learning time scales) going back to 2012 (Farabet, C., Couprie, C., Najman, L., LeCun, Y., 2012. Scene parsing with multiscale feature learning, purity trees, and optimal covers. In: ICML.), or formulations which integrate scales and layers, starting with hyper-columns in 2015 (Hypercolumns for object segmentation and fine-grained localization, CVPR 2015) and many more recent variants.\n\nIn 2018, multi-scale formulations are now standard techniques in computer vision with deep networks. I am not sure how the proposed method makes a difference. Also, I am wondering whether there shouldn\u2019t be some parameter sharing between the models of the different scales, as is often done in the literature now to reduce model capacity.\n\nThe way the multi-scale Since different resolutions are created is particular. Why not just simply subsample the input images to different resolutions? Why are these trained layers needed as a preprocessing?\n\nWeighting different scales is not fundamentally new. We also don\u2019t know whether it improves performance, it is not part of the ablation study.\n\nThe method has been compared to several methods, but which are not state of the art anymore. Most papers are from 2016, the field advanced quickly. The performance gains of the multi-scale formulation are pretty low, and overally, the method is not state of the art on the targeted benchmark. Obviously I do not want to say that a paper needs to be state of the art on a benchmark to get published, even at a top-level conference, far from it. However, if the methodological and theoretical contribution of the paper is rather minor, than the performance and evaluation should be flawless.\n\nMinor remarks:\n\nThe writing of this paper is somewhat fuzzy, using non-standard technical language, which I could not decipher and which seems to me somewhat misleading. Examples are:\n\n- \u201cthe stacked hourglass network theoretically increases the stacked depth\u201d: how does theory tell us anything about depth in this context?\n\n- \u201cdifficult to form differentiated and determined collaboration mechanisms for each stacked hourglass\u201d: I don\u2019t understand what this means, simply. This phrase is also repeated several times in the paper in different places\n\n- \u201cinformation loss caused by the functional consistency of hourglass networks\u201d: I don\u2019t understand what functional consistency means here, and why it leads to information loss.\n\nThe description of Algorithm 1 does not seem to be necessary to me. It basically follows from the equations 4-6, which are executed in order and per layer. \n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper301/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-Scale Stacked Hourglass Network for Human Pose Estimation", "abstract": "Stacked hourglass network has become an important model for Human pose estimation.

While the weights are functions of the loss, it is not analyzed and evaluated thoroughly, e.g. evolution of weights for each joint-stack-scale. Even it is not given in the section 5.2.1. So it is hard to judge effectiveness of the proposed loss. \n\nnegative:\n- In general experiments section is the most weakness of the paper. I comment some points in the following:\na) Multi-scale image processing is not a novel idea in computer vision and specifically in human pose estimation. The authors have not compared their methods with most recent papers in the literature and I believe the results are not state-of-the-art (see [1] for instance which is a multi-scale approach).\nb) What is the effect of each scale in the results and for each joint? This must be analyzed and shown visually or numerically.\n\n- The number citations is not enough.\n\n- The writing must be improved.\n\noverall:\nRegarding mentioned comments, I believe the paper needs a huge extra effort (both analytically and numerically) to be adequate for publication.

focus on the multi-scale feature maps dispatched from pre-processing network to aid other deep neural network in training tasks and adaptive weight loss function for optimization convergence, rather than some tricks to increase scores.\nObviously, increasing the complexity of the network, expanding the dataset or increase intermediate supervision in each stack hourglass network can get a better score on the mpii leaderboard. But the purpose of the paper is to propose multi-scale ideas and new loss functions. The network infrastructure is based on hourglass network and our score is 0.3% more than it. Therefore, we have chosen the same period of papers for comparison.\nOn the mpii leaderboard, the rankings which is better than ours also have done some good work. [2] propose a novel bone-based part representation, deep neural networks to learn the compositionality of human bodies. \nMulti-scale supervision[3] is designed to strengthen contextual feature learning in matching body keypoints by combining feature heatmaps across scales. \n[4] design a Pyramid Residual Module to enhance the invariance in scales of DCNNs., theoretic derivation to extend the current weight initialization scheme to multi-branch network structures. \nA structure-aware convolutional network[5] is to implicitly take such priors into account during training of the deep network. \n[6] use the discriminator distinguishes ground-truth heatmaps from generated ones, and back-propagates the adversarial loss to the generator. \nThe Conditional Random Field[7] is utilized to model the correlations among neighboring regions in the attention map.\nSince the focus on the problem is different, our network is simpler in detail than the above method. For example, we use ordinary relay supervision between each stage, rather than using it like [3] in each stage. We use two branches of ResNet as the building block instead of the downsampling structure of several branches of [4]. [5,6] use the structure of the generative adversarial networks, which is more complicated than our structure.\n\nWe are working hard to apply some tricks, and we will definitely get a better score.\n\n[1] http://human-pose.mpi-inf.mpg.de/#results\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper301/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper301/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper301/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-Scale Stacked Hourglass Network for Human Pose Estimation", "abstract": "Stacked hourglass network has become an important model for Human pose estimation.
