The authors consider an auto-encoder model, a colorization model and RND as intrinsic motivation signals. I find the write up very unclear and have trouble understanding what the claims are and how they are backed up. \n\nMajor points:\n* About the claims as stated on page 2: 1) The first claim I don't understand, I think what is meant is on navigation tasks they find \"their measure of representation learning\" (proposed in kolesnikov 2019) seems to correlate well with reward optimization. In 3.1 to back this claim they claim to test disentanglement but seem to test classification. I see no reason to not put that part in 4.1. 2) The authors claim to propose a new method: it can't be a separate representation network to derive rewards because that is what burda et al. and many many others do, it can't be the minimax formulation because that has been known for a while (e.g. predictability minimization schmidhuber) so I am not sure what the claim is about. What exactly is novel about the model. 3) CRL seems at best to outperform baselines on beamrider, qbert and riverraid but the results are impossible to assess. We don't know what the x axis is in figure 7 (is it frames, with or without repeats, is updates etc). Pong -12 is far from learnt for instance and its one of the easiest games. \n* suprisal objective and modeling objectives are very high level concepts that we can talk about in the introduction and conclusion but much more precise terms need to be employed in the model exposition. The readers need to know what sort of properties they should have ideally easily identify examples (without having to read 2 papers and a large survey). I would start with the minimax formula and then explain what is considered, how the different intrinsic rewards are added, if they are normalized, how they are weighted etc. etc.\n* the details about failed experiments, environments and architecture should IMO be relegated to experiments\n* It should be very clear early on that the model is separate from the representation. \n* auto-encoders are a large family of models and it is not clear from the paper which exact model is meant by the authors. Also, citing Bengio 2013 is NOT a valid citation for auto-encoders. The right citation depends on the model you apply please use that! \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1662/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1662/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Good Policies By Learning Good Perceptual Models", "authors": ["Yilun Du", "Phillip Isola"], "authorids": ["yilundu@mit.edu", "phillipi@mit.edu"], "keywords": ["visual representation learning", "reinforcement learning", "curiosity"], "TL;DR": "We present a formulation of curiosity as a visual representation learning problem and show that it allows good visual representations in agents.", "abstract": "    Reinforcement learning (RL) has led to increasingly complex looking behavior in recent years.

I also like the approach taken as it looks into this problem through the lens of better representation learning (LR) and arguing that with focusing on better LR and maximising model loss for novel scenes, we are going to get also better overall performance.\n\nHowever, there are a few key question marks that are still open and I would suggest them to be answered explicitly in the paper:\n\n1) What is the relationship with methods that use auxiliary tasks for unsupervised training in RL (e.g. Jaderberg et al, ICLR 2017)? It's clear that this method doesn't use any extrinsic reward function but the underlying architecture is similar.\n\n2) Similar to above, the comparisons and contrasts to Burda et al, ICLR 2019 could be made more explicit as the objective functions such as autoencoding which seems to be working well in this paper has also been studied in that work.\n\n3) Continuing with comparisons, it's not clear if this method delivers better performance compared to other curiosity based methods. For examples, the top scores in Fig 7 are considerably lower than those achieved in Burda et al, ICLR 2019 (Fig 2). Similarly, we don't know how the method compares to state-of-the-art on other tasks considered in the paper. As a result, the paper lacks good benchmarking against state-of-the-art in this space and discussion on pros and cons.\n\n4) It seems that in Tab 1 the correlation collapses for the last row, any reason why this is happening?\n\n5) It would be good to add both a system diagram as well as a network architecture to clarify how everything is wired.\n\n6) The training details are missing, both in terms of hyperparameters as well as optimisation strategy for solving minmax.\n\n7) Minor: RND is used in the experimental section to refer to both random feature prediction and random network distillation, so would be better to use different references."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1662/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1662/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Good Policies By Learning Good Perceptual Models", "authors": ["Yilun Du", "Phillip Isola"], "authorids": ["yilundu@mit.edu", "phillipi@mit.edu"], "keywords": ["visual representation learning", "reinforcement learning", "curiosity"], "TL;DR": "We present a formulation of curiosity as a visual representation learning problem and show that it allows good visual representations in agents.", "abstract": "    Reinforcement learning (RL) has led to increasingly complex looking behavior in recent years.

We then propose curious representation learning (CRL) which allows us to use better visual representation learning algorithms to correspondingly increase visual representation in policy through an intrinsic objective on both simulated environments and transfer to real images. Finally, we show better visual representations induced by CRL allows us to obtain better performance on Atari without any reward than other curiosity objectives.", "pdf": "/pdf/f7a56aa406d3dbc9410c542ac8d13f917e9c99ca.pdf", "paperhash": "du|learning_good_policies_by_learning_good_perceptual_models", "original_pdf": "/attachment/f7a56aa406d3dbc9410c542ac8d13f917e9c99ca.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\ndu2020learning,\ntitle={Learning Good Policies By Learning Good Perceptual Models},\nauthor={Yilun Du and Phillip Isola},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkgYEyrFDr}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
