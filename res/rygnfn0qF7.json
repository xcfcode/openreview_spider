In particular, the paper uses the word prediction, either for the next work or randomly missing words, as the self-supervised pretraining tasks. The main idea is to not only train text embedding using context from the same sentence but also take the embedding of the surrounding sentences into account, where the sentence embedding is also context-aware. Experiments are done for document segmentation, answer passage retrieval, extractive document summary.\n\n[Pros]\n\n1.\tThe idea of considering across-sentence/paragraph context for text embedding learning is very reasonable. \n2.\tThe random missing-word completion is also a reasonable self-supervised learning task. \n3.\tThe results are consistently encouraging across all three task. And the performance for \u201canswer passage retrieval\u201d is especially good. \n\n[Cons]\n\n1.\tThe ideas of predicting the next word (L+R-LM) or missing words (mask-LM) have been around and widely used for a long time. Apply this idea to an two-layer hierarchical LSTM is a straightforward extension of this existing idea.\n2.\tFor document segmentation, no comparison with other methods is provided. For extractive document summary, the performance difference between the proposed method and the previous methods are very minor.\n3.\tImportantly, the experiments can be stronger if the learned embedding can be successfully applied to more fundamental tasks, such as document classification and retrieval. \n\nOverall, the paper proposed a reasonable method, but the significance of the paper can be better justified by more solid experiments.\n\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1303/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Language Model Pre-training for Hierarchical Document Representations", "abstract": "Hierarchical neural architectures can efficiently capture long-distance dependencies and have been used for many document-level tasks such as summarization, document segmentation, and fine-grained sentiment analysis.

We will address the clarification suggestions in detail in an appendix in the paper and also provide brief explanations below. \n \n        * In the document segmentation task experiments, the dataset is sampled from the same set of articles used for pretraining. However, the labels for the segmentation task (section boundaries) are never used during pretraining.\n\n        * We pre-trained our representations using a sentence-based corpus, containing articles represented as lists of sentences. For passage retrieval, we directly apply the same model on the passages without re-training the models. The whole model is then fine-tuned using the passage retrieval labeled data.\n\n        * Other features for passage retrieval: these features were computed using the software \\url{https://github.com/allenai/document-qa} of Clark & Gardner and are defined as follows: cosine similarity of tf-idf representations of passage and question, logarithm of scaled position of first word in the paragraph, indicator function of whether this is the first paragraph in the document, number of non-stop words in the paragraph that appear in the question, number of paragraph words that appear in the question but with a different case or that are stop-words. \n\n        * Currently we always select 3 sentences in the extractive summarization task. All of our tasks use the same pretrained model trained on Wikipedia.\n\n        * (Compare local setting with ELMo) In fact, the local setting is quite similar to ELMo,  as the existing ELMo models have been trained on documents with shuffled sentences which encourages the model to ignore the external context. In addition, the use of truncated back-propagation (typically at 20 words to enable efficient training) limits the ability of the model to learn long-distance dependencies. We will add discussion in the paper.\n\n        * (More comparisons) We performed an additional experiment using ELMo-pool on document segmentation. For document segmentation, using fixed ELMo-pool representations as block features for a document-level LSTM results in 42.3 F1. This is significantly lower than the 54.9 by L+R-LM and 51.9 by Global-MLM.

The learned contextual representations are evaluated on three downstream tasks, demonstrating the superiority of the bi-directional training setting, and beating strong baselines on extractive summarization.\n\nThe method is clearly presented and easy to follow, and the experiments do seem to support the author's claims, but their exposition misses several important details (or could be presented more clearly).

For passage retrieval, is the representation the same or are the representations re-trained from scratch using paragraph blocks? What exactly are the other features (those can go in the appendix)? And for the extractive summarization task, how many sentences are selected? Is pre-training also done on Wikipedia, or are those representations trained on news text?\n\nA comparison to non-contextualized sentence representations would also be welcome (SkipThought, InferSent, ElMO-pool for settings other than passage retrieval). Note also that the local pre-training is not equivalent to ElMO, as the later sees context form the whole document rather than just the current sentence.\n\nIt is interesting to see that contextualized sentence representations can be used and that the Mask-LM objective yields better results than L+R-LM, but these points would be better made if the above questions were answered.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1303/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Language Model Pre-training for Hierarchical Document Representations", "abstract": "Hierarchical neural architectures can efficiently capture long-distance dependencies and have been used for many document-level tasks such as summarization, document segmentation, and fine-grained sentiment analysis. However, effective usage of such a large context can difficult to learn, especially in the case where there is limited labeled data available.\nBuilding on the recent success of language model pretraining methods for learning flat representations of text, we propose algorithms for pre-training hierarchical document representations from unlabeled data. Unlike prior work, which has focused on pre-training contextual token representations or context-independent sentence/paragraph representations, our hierarchical document representations include fixed-length sentence/paragraph representations which integrate contextual information from the entire documents. Experiments on document segmentation, document-level question answering, and extractive document summarization demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-training algorithms.", "keywords": [], "authorids": ["mingweichang@google.com", "kristout@google.com", "kentonl@google.com", "jacobdevlin@google.com"], "authors": ["Ming-Wei Chang", "Kristina Toutanova", "Kenton Lee", "Jacob Devlin"], "pdf": "/pdf/ec77d07b0e7e1520b1b282fa10d4a0c54198d5ad.pdf", "paperhash": "chang|language_model_pretraining_for_hierarchical_document_representations", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nchang2019language,\ntitle={Language Model Pre-training for Hierarchical Document Representations},\nauthor={Ming-Wei Chang and Kristina Toutanova and Kenton Lee and Jacob Devlin},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rygnfn0qF7},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1303/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234259595, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "rygnfn0qF7", "replyto": "rygnfn0qF7", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1303/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335917316, "tmdate": 1552335917316, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1303/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 11}
