The proposed method uses advantages to as weight in regression, which is an extension of the known method of reward-weighted regression. The paper is in general nicely written, and it comes with a set of theoretical analyses and experiments. While all reviewers admit that the approach is interesting and the work makes an attempt to solve an important yet open problem, there are several aspects of the paper that make it not ready for publication in its current form:\n\n- Novelty: As pointed out by reviewers, the proposed method appears to be a minor modification of existing off-policy solvers. Although the use of advantages as weights makes intuitive sense, it is unclear why and how the new method significantly differs from and outperforms existing methods. Going forward, it would be helpful if the authors could present more convincing arguments/experiments to demonstrate the power of ARW, relative to similar existing methods.\n\n- Experiments provide some insights into the difference between several algorithms, but the results are not strong enough to support the claim of the paper. Please see reviewers' comments for more details. We strongly recommend the authors to take these comments into consideration and develop more rigorous experiments to demonstrate advantages of AWR.\n\n- Theoretical analysis is limited. As R#2, R#3 mentioned, the theory analysis in the paper seems to not match the algorithm, and there remain bugs, this it doesn't add to the paper. Although theory might not be the focus of the paper, if the authors decide into include theoretical analysis, the analysis would hopefully provide insights into why and by how much the approach is better.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Advantage-Weighted Regression: Simple and Scalable Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning", "authorids": ["~Xue_Bin_Peng1", "~Aviral_Kumar2", "grace.zhang@berkeley.edu", "~Sergey_Levine1"], "authors": ["Xue Bin Peng", "Aviral Kumar", "Grace Zhang", "Sergey Levine"], "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "policy search", "offline RL", "control"], "abstract": "In this work, we aim to develop a simple and scalable reinforcement learning algorithm that uses standard supervised learning methods as subroutines, while also being able to leverage off-policy data.

During policy updates for MPO, new actions are sampled from the policy, which may be different from the actions observed during the rollouts. These actions are then scored by the Q function and used to update the policy. However, one problem with this update scheme is that it can cause out-of-distribution errors when querying the Q function with actions that were not observed in the rollouts. This is one of the reasons why other off-policy algorithms such as DDPG and SAC generally do not work well for offline RL. This is also the out-of-distribution action problem that recent offline RL algorithms like BCQ and BEAR attempt to address. Unlike MPO, during the AWR updates (Eq 10), the policy is updated using only actions observed in the replay buffer. We do not need to query a Q function with new actions that may be different from those in the replay buffer. Therefore, AWR is not susceptible to issues due to errors in the value estimation on out-of-distribution actions. This is also the main reason why AWR is able to learn effective policies in the fully offlines setting.\n\nFor regular RL tasks, MPO, like other DDPG style algorithms, requires a number of stabilization techniques such as double Q-learning and target networks, none of which are needed for AWR. AWR does use some standard normalization techniques, but as we show in E.2, AWR still performs well even when these additions are disabled. AWR is therefore quite a bit simpler than algorithms like MPO.\n\nRe: SAC and TD3 on imitation tasks\nWe have not been able to successfully apply SAC or TD3 on the motion imitation tasks with complex simulated agents. We are also not aware of any prior work that has demonstrated successful results with SAC and TD3 on learning these complex motion skills. While we are not certain of the reasons why those algorithms do not work on these tasks, off-policy algorithms such as SAC and TD3 tend to be more unstable than policy gradient algorithms. The AWR updates are more reminiscent of policy gradient methods than Q-learning based techniques, such as SAC and TD3, which might be one of the reasons why AWR is more effective for these tasks.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper250/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper250/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Advantage-Weighted Regression: Simple and Scalable Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning", "authorids": ["~Xue_Bin_Peng1", "~Aviral_Kumar2", "grace.zhang@berkeley.edu", "~Sergey_Levine1"], "authors": ["Xue Bin Peng", "Aviral Kumar", "Grace Zhang", "Sergey Levine"], "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "policy search", "offline RL", "control"], "abstract": "In this work, we aim to develop a simple and scalable reinforcement learning algorithm that uses standard supervised learning methods as subroutines, while also being able to leverage off-policy data.

As we show in Sec 3.2, the update procedure outlined in Alg 1 indeed optimizes the expected improvement over a sampling policy modeled by a trajectory level mixture of behavior policies as represented by the replay buffer. While experience replay has been used in a number of prior RL algorithms, few provide such an analysis of the algorithm when combined with experience. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis is the first of its kind for this style of algorithms.\n\nRe: weights w_i for each policy pi_i\nIn Sec 3.2, the weights w_i corresponds to the likelihood of selecting samples from policy pi_i when sampling from the replay buffer. Therefore w_i is simply determined by the proportion of samples in the replay buffer that are recorded from pi_i. For example, if half of the total samples in the replay buffer is from pi_0, then w_0 = 0.5.\n\nRe: Mathematical errors: The jump from (9) to (10) is not correct\nApproximating the state distribution of a policy using empirical samples from a replay buffer is a very common technique used in nearly every modern off-policy RL algorithm. Examples include DQN, DDPG, SAC, MPO, only to name a few.\n\nRe: there needs to be a gamma^t term in the expectation\nIndeed, in theory the expectation should be computed with respect to the discounted state distribution, in which case the samples should be drawn from the replay buffer using geometric sampling. However, in practice the vast majority of implementations of RL algorithms simply sample uniformly from the replay buffer. We have found this simple strategy to also work well for AWR, and avoids the additional complexity required for sampling from the discounted state distribution.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper250/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper250/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Advantage-Weighted Regression: Simple and Scalable Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning", "authorids": ["~Xue_Bin_Peng1", "~Aviral_Kumar2", "grace.zhang@berkeley.edu", "~Sergey_Levine1"], "authors": ["Xue Bin Peng", "Aviral Kumar", "Grace Zhang", "Sergey Levine"], "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "policy search", "offline RL", "control"], "abstract": "In this work, we aim to develop a simple and scalable reinforcement learning algorithm that uses standard supervised learning methods as subroutines, while also being able to leverage off-policy data.

The paper presents the algorithm AWR, which is an extension of the algorithm reward weighted regression. The primary extensions of RWR are using the advantage function instead of the q function and the ability to use experience replay. Experiments on common environments are conducted to evaluate the performance of AWR and compare it to other algorithms. There are ablation experiments to justify the choice of some of the extensions. \n\nThe development of simple, effective off-policy algorithms for reinforcement learning is still an open problem, and this paper tries to take a step towards addressing it. The paper gives a detailed derivation of the proposed algorithm, and the ablation studies provide some information as to what components in the algorithm make it useful. However, I do not believe this paper is ready for publication because the extensions are minor, and experiments lack scientific rigor, making it unclear what is to be learned from the paper. There are also some errors in the paper. \n\nThere are some essential questions the paper should address but it did not.\n\nWhat is the benefit of using the baseline in RWR? Does it change the weighting of the update, or is it just a variance reduction technique?\n\nThe beta term in RWR is adapted during learning. How does the choice of beta in AWR affect the weighting of rewards during learning?\n\nThe paper says there is a theoretical analysis of the algorithm, but I only see the algorithm's derivation. What analysis is this statement referring to? \n\nThe extension of RWR to using experience replay is formulated as using a mixture policy of past policies using weights w_i for each policy pi_i. How are weights w_i chosen? \n\nThe algorithm, as defined, performs a global maximization at each step. However, neural networks are used, and this maximization cannot be guaranteed. How are the updates performed? There are other changes to make the algorithm used in the experiments, but they are not connected to the algorithm's design, e.g., the normalized advantage function. \n\nExperiments:\nThe primary motivation and claim of this paper is the design of a more effective algorithm. Therefore, one should expect the presented algorithm to be a significant increase in performance. However, this cannot be concluded based on the experimental methodology used. The main issues are with how hyperparameters are selected and the lack of statistical analysis of the results. \n\nSome undefined processes set the hyperparameters for AWR, and the parameters for the other algorithms were left unspecified. Based on this experimental setup, it is impossible to tell if AWR is better or worse than the other algorithms or if it is just due to the specific setting of hyperparameters. \n \nThe performance results are given along with standard deviations over ten trials. However, this does not directly quantify how likely these results are achieved. Furthermore, it has been pointed out in several past works that the performance of RL algorithms are highly stochastic, and more trials and proper statistical analysis is needed to gain confidence in the outcomes (Colas et al., 2018, Henderson et al., 2017).  \n\nThere exist more rigorous evaluation procedures that may be useful in improving this paper (Dodge et al., 2019, Jordan et al. 2020, Sivaprasad et al. 2020).\n\nMathematical errors:\nThe jump from (9) to (10) is not correct. Sampling from a fixed-sized dataset is not equivalent to sampling from the state distribution of a policy. \n\nIn the algorithm, samples of states and actions are drawn according to the data distribution. However, this does not correspond to the empirical samples of discounted state distribution; i.e., there needs to be a gamma^t term in the expectation (Thomas, 2014). \n\n\nReferences\n\nColas, C., Sigaud, O., & Oudeyer, P.

The paper is well written, and has experiments on both on-policy and offline tasks, with ablation studies on various algorithm design choices.\n\nSome questions:\n\n[1] Contributions: it appears the objective is a minor modification off prior work, where, the returns are replaced with advantages. While this makes intuitive sense, and it does indicate improved results, the actual contribution is rather limited. While the paper does present results in off-policy settings, these derivations etc. are standard. Can the authors describe precisely what design decisions they propose in this work (on top of RWR/other prior work) that are novel? \n\n[2] The authors mention they present a theoretical analysis (e.g. in page 1) of AWR. While I see a derivation of the AWR update, this isn\u2019t a theory analysis of any of the proposed algorithm's behavior. In particular, can the authors make a rigorous claim as to why this is a better algorithm than current approaches? This could be through bounding the variance of the updates and indicating this improves over prior work, or, alternatively, showing rates of convergence and how it compares against that of standard NPG. Alternatively, one can view the exponentiation of the advantage as reward transformations which tend to impact the convergence, if one utilizes a policy gradient method for obtaining the new policy (see for e.g. Ghosh et al. 2020 (An operator view of policy gradient methods)). However, these need to be precisely sketched out. Without such results, the paper indicates its merit through its experiments.\n\n[3] Experiments: Looking at table 1: I see that AWR appears to be significantly worse than SAC in several tasks - it is again unclear as to why this is considered \u201ccompetitive in terms of final performance compared to prior works\u201d as written in table 1\u2019s captions. Furthermore, in terms of performance of TRPO, I find that the results appear to be very much lower compared to what I believe they obtain (for e.g. see Rajeswaran, Lowrey, Todorov and Kakade (Neurips 2017)) - could you mention how these experiments were conducted and why there are these discrepancies in terms of final performance? \n\n[4] Ablation: How is the \\beta parameter of AWR chosen?

In each iteration, it samples trajectories from a mixture of previous policies, estimates the value function and then computes the advantage value to estimate the policy. The idea is very similar to the work published in \u201cNeumann, Gerhard and Peters, Jan R, Fitted Q-iteration by advantage weighted regression, Advances in neural information processing systems, 2009\u201d, starting from reward-weighted regression and further developing to advantage weighted regression.  The difference in this paper is to add a constraint on the policy search, requiring the policy to be similar to the sampling policy. However, this constraint has also been studied in the paper \"Christian Wirth and Johannes Furnkranz and Gerhard Neumann, Model-Free Preference-based Reinforcement Learning, AAAI 2017\" (It seems not in reference). Overall, it may enhance this paper if it has more technical novelty when developing a new algorithm.\n \nMy major concern is that this paper has been submitted last year and resubmitted this year without new additions.

Our proposed approach, which we refer to as advantage-weighted regression (AWR), consists of two standard supervised learning steps: one to regress onto target values for a value function, and another to regress onto weighted target actions for the policy. The method is simple and general, can accommodate continuous and discrete actions, and can be implemented in just a few lines of code on top of standard supervised learning methods. We provide a theoretical motivation for AWR and analyze its properties when incorporating off-policy data from experience replay. We evaluate AWR on a suite of standard OpenAI Gym benchmark tasks, and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to a number of well-established state-of-the-art RL algorithms. AWR is also able to acquire more effective policies than most off-policy algorithms when learning from purely static datasets with no additional environmental interactions.
