The span representations are weighted by the spans marginal scores given by the inside-outside algorithm. Experiments on TREC-QA and SNLI show modest improvement over the word-based structured attention baseline (Parikh et al., 2016).\n\nStrengths:\nThe idea of using latent syntactic structure, and computing cross-sentence alignment over spans is very interesting. \n\nWeaknesses:\nThe paper is 8.5 pages long.\n\nThe method did not out-perform other very related structured attention methods (86.8, Kim et al., 2017, 86.9, Liu and Lapata, 2017)\n\nAside from the time complexity from the inside-outside algorithm (as mentioned by the authors in conclusion), the comparison among all pairs of spans is O(n^4), which is more expensive. Am I missing something about the algorithm?\n\nIt would be nice to show, quantitatively, the agreement between the latent trees and gold/supervised syntax. The paper claimed \u201cthe model is able to recover tree structures that very closely mimic syntax\u201d, but it\u2019s hard to draw this conclusion from the two examples in Figure 2.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "STRUCTURED ALIGNMENT NETWORKS", "abstract": " Many tasks in natural language processing involve comparing two sentences to compute some notion of relevance, entailment, or similarity.

Overall, this paper seems a straightforward application of the model first proposed by Kim et al. 2017 with latent tree attention.\n\nIn section 3.1, the formula for p(c|x) looks wrong: c_{ijk} are indicator variables. but where are the scores for each span? I think it should be c_{ijk} * \\delta_{ijk} under the summations instead.\n\nIn the same section, the expression for \\alpha_{ij} seems to assume that \\delta_{ijk} = \\dlta_{ij} regardless of k. I.e. there are no production rule scores (transitions). This seems rather limiting, can you comment on that?\n\nIn the answer selection and NLI experiments, the proposed model does not beat the SOTA, and is only marginally better than unstructured decomposable attention. This is rather disappointing.\n\nThe plots in Fig 2 with the marginals on CKY charts are not very enlightening.

Using a structured attention mechanism, our model matches possible spans in the first sentence to possible spans in the second sentence, simultaneously discovering the tree structure of each sentence and performing a comparison, in a model that is fully differentiable and is trained only on the comparison objective. We evaluate this model on two sentence comparison tasks: the Stanford natural language inference dataset and the TREC-QA dataset. We find that comparing spans results in superior performance to comparing words individually, and that the learned trees are consistent with actual linguistic structures.", "pdf": "/pdf/7cc678302888436c96fed050dfb89b10e20932d2.pdf", "TL;DR": "Matching sentences by learning the latent constituency tree structures with a variant of the inside-outside algorithm embedded as a neural network layer.", "paperhash": "liu|structured_alignment_networks", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nliu2018structured,\ntitle={{STRUCTURED} {ALIGNMENT} {NETWORKS}},\nauthor={Yang Liu and Matt Gardner},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byht0GbRZ},\n}", "keywords": ["structured attention", "sentence matching"], "authors": ["Yang Liu", "Matt Gardner"], "authorids": ["yang.liu2@ed.ac.uk", "mattg@allenai.org"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "duedate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "tmdate": 1516825724403, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper1053/Official_Comment", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"replyto": null, "forum": "Byht0GbRZ", "writers": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1053/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1053/Authors|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1053/Area_Chair|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1053/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1053/Authors|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1053/Area_Chair|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "value-dropdown": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1053/Authors_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1053/Reviewers_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1053/Area_Chairs_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 0, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1053/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1053/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1053/Area_Chair", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "cdate": 1516825724403}}}], "count": 6}
