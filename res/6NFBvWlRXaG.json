They show that the recent works: Tensor Field networks and Fuchs et al., are universal under the proposed framework. A simple theoretical architecture is presented as another universal architecture.\n\nPros:\n- Achieving rotation equivariance is important to point cloud network as it is the key to improve the expressiveness of point cloud features. Hence the study of the universality of network with such property is important to the community.\n- Overall, the proposed proof looks plausible to me. \n- A minimal universal architecture is proposed that satisfies the D-spanning property. This provides the theoretical starting point to design a more advanced and complex equivariant point cloud network.\n\nCons:\n- The paper is quite difficult to follow. I'm not an expert in group theory and had a difficult time understanding some of the theorems and proofs. It would be great if the writing can be broken down into more fundamental modules and provide more illustrations.\n- In addition, the paper doesn't provide any evaluation of the proposed new universal architectures. Though this is a theoretical paper, it would be nice to show the proposed theory have some practical use. For instance, it would be great to provide a simple implementation of the minimal universal architecture and show it indeed achieves the rotation equivariant features on the point cloud data.

Notably, this class contains Tensor Field Networks (TFN). The authors accomplish this by writing the network as a composition of an equivariant function from a class F_feat and followed by a linear pooling layer. When the F_feat class satisfies a \u201cD-spanning\u201d criterion and the pooling layer is universal, the network is universal. For a simple class of networks and for TFNs, the authors prove D-spanning. Linear universality of the pooling layer follows from simple representation theory.\n\nStrengths:\n-\tIt is useful to know whether prevalent classes of neural networks are universal\n-\tThe authors use a general construction for proving universality of equivariant networks for the point cloud group, rather than being specific to certain architectures.\n-\tReading the proofs along with the main text, the argumentation is clear and relatively easy to follow for me as reviewer, unfamiliar with similar universality proofs.\n\nWeaknesses:\n-\tThe paper would benefit from providing more intuition behind the proposed constructions, lemmas and theorems, in particular this holds for: theorem 1 based on the split between the linear universality and D-spanning; the construction of Segol & Lipman (2019) and how this relates to the Q functions and lemma 2\n-\tIn addition to the previous point, the proofs, currently critical for understanding the paper, are given in the appendix, which is not ideal for the self-containedness of the main paper.\n-\tAs the authors of the TFN paper note: in practice not all higher order irreps of the tensor product of the filter and the features are computed. This seems to indicate a big difference between the theoretical analysis - which includes all irreps and thus is computationally intensive even when modelling low order polynomials \u2013 and the practical application of TFNs. It would be interesting to know how expressive such practical low order TFNs are. Another difference between the described networks and practical TFN is that in the described networks, all relevant parameters are in the pooling layer, which sums a large number of terms (looking at the proof of lemma 2, exponential in D), while in practical TFNs, the parameters are in the filters.\n\nRecommendation:\nThe authors proof the useful statement of universality of a prominent class of neural networks, which is why I recommend the acceptance of this paper.\n\nSuggestion for improvement:\n-\tMake the big picture clearer by providing more intuition.\n-\tComment on the differences between the class of networks described and TFNs used in practice.\n\nMinor points/suggestions:\n-\tP3 Add definition of W^n_T as n direct sums of W_T\n-\tP3 \u201cwhere W_feat is a lifted representation of SO(3)\u201d, what does lifted representation here mean? Just any rep?\n-\tI get a bit confused by the wording in Def 1. Unless I am mistaken, it appears like the quantifiers are reversed. Should it mean \u201cfor every polynomial \u2026, there exists f_1, \u2026 in F_feat and linear functionals Lambda_1, \u2026, : W_feat -> R \u201d?\n-\tAround Eq 5, perhaps the authors could clarify the clarify the domain of the Q functions, which I suppose is Q^r : R^3n -> T_T, where T=||r||_1\n-\tAround Eq 7, are X_j and x_j the same?\n-\tIn lemma 4, is A_k any linear map or an equivariant linear map? \n-\tIn Appendix B, perhaps a new subsection B.2 would make sense before theorem 1?\n-\tIn the proof of thm 1, it says \u201cp: R^{d \\times n} \\to W_T\u201d, should that be W_T^n?\n-\tIn the proof of lemma 2, it says \u201cwe see that that exists a linear functional\u201d\n\n## Post rebuttal\nI thank the authors for their response and revised version, which has been improved notably with the inclusion of the proof ideas.

We were happy to see the reviewer found our paper useful.  Below we respond to several points that were raised in the review.\n\nQ: \u201cThe paper would benefit from providing more intuition behind the proposed constructions, lemmas and theorems, in particular, this holds for theorem 1 based on the split between the linear universality and D-spanning; the construction of Segol & Lipman (2019) and how this relates to the Q functions and lemma 2\u201d\n\nA: We used the additional page to add intuition and more discussion on the construction lemmas and theorems. In particular we added more intuition for theorem 1 and the split, and added an explanation of the proof idea for lemma 2. \n\nQ: \u201cIn addition to the previous point, the proofs, currently critical for understanding the paper, are given in the appendix, which is not ideal for the self-containedness of the main paper.\u201d\n\nA: We would be happy to have the proofs in the main text. As this is infeasible due to space constraints we added proof ideas to all the claims in the paper as a compromise.\n\nQ: \u201cAs the authors of the TFN paper note: in practice not all higher-order irreps of the tensor product of the filter and the features are computed. This seems to indicate a big difference between the theoretical analysis - which includes all irreps and thus is computationally intensive even when modeling low order polynomials \u2013 and the practical application of TFNs. It would be interesting to know how expressive such practical low order TFNs are.\u201d \n\nA: This is a good question. We added a discussion of this point in the conclusion section. At the same time we would like to note that practical TFN may change in the future and include higher order representations - in analogy to Alexnet and later Resnet who found ways to successfully implement deeper networks than were used previously.\n\nQ: \u201cAnother difference between the described networks and practical TFN is that in the described networks, all relevant parameters are in the pooling layer, which sums a large number of terms (looking at the proof of lemma 2, exponential in D), while in practical TFNs, the parameters are in the filters.\u201d\n\nA: We note that  our networks hold parameters in the filters as well. The filters in TFN are composed of two parts: (1) an MLP that operates on the norm of a point (2) A spherical harmonic function. In our proof, we show that using the MLP in (1) to approximate certain polynomials can lead to universality, but it certainly does not mean that we restrict these MLPs to have a specific form. This is mentioned in Appendix F where we list the differences between the models we used and the original TFN paper.\n\nRegarding the exponential dependency on D, this is essentially unavoidable since the dimension of the space invariant polynomials of degree D is exponential in D (or more accurately, in min(n,D) ). The linear dependence on n (the number of points) makes computing all invariant polynomials of a modest degree D feasible.  \n\nQ: \u201dI get a bit confused by the wording in Def 1. Unless I am mistaken, it appears like the quantifiers are reversed. Should it mean \u201cfor every polynomial \u2026, there exists f_1, \u2026 in F_feat and linear functionals Lambda_1, \u2026, : W_feat -> R \u201d?\u201d\n\nA: The order of the quantifiers is correct and this condition is stronger than what you suggest: there is a finite number of polynomials f_1,...f_k that can span all D-degree polynomials p (with appropriate p-dependent linear functions). \n\nQ: \u201cComment on the differences between the class of networks described and TFNs used in practice.\u201d\n\nA: We added a discussion of the differences pointed out by the reviewer in the conclusions section.\n\nQ: Minor points/suggestions.\n\nA: Great suggestions! They were incorporated in the revised version.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper481/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper481/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On the Universality of Rotation Equivariant Point Cloud Networks", "authorids": ["nadavdym@gmail.com", "~Haggai_Maron1"], "authors": ["Nadav Dym", "Haggai Maron"], "keywords": ["3D deep learning", "Rotation invariance", "Invariant and equivariant deep networks", "Universal approximation", "Point clouds"], "abstract": "Learning functions on point clouds has applications in many fields, including computer vision, computer graphics, physics, and chemistry.

However, the proof of the rotation equivariance has been discussed in previous works, and the theorems for translation and permutation are much easier than the rotation analysis.\u201d\n\nA: We respectfully disagree. The main challenge in this paper was to prove universality while *simultaneously* dealing with both permutation and rotational symmetries. We had to come up with novel arguments to deal with this combination, and the argument cannot be reduced to just solving separately for rotations, permutations, and translations. \n\nQ: \u201cThis paper \u2026 lacks auxiliary experimental verification. Therefore, it is difficult to verify the correctness and feasibility of the proofs. The authors do not provide experimental results to demonstrate the performance of the proposed new methods\u201d.\n\nA: As commonly done in the machine learning community the focus of this paper is theoretical and many of the claims presented would be difficult to validate experimentally (at the risk of stating the obvious it is worth noting that mathematical proofs do not require empirical validation).  The simple architectures were only introduced to illustrate theoretical concepts and inspire future work.

For the second issue, while this paper focuses on theoretical analysis of methods which have already been implemented independently, we will be happy to add an experimental section focusing on different design choices of the TFN architecture, inspired by our theoretical analysis.  We hope to present at least some of these experiments by the end of the short discussion period, and in any event we will be sure to add these experiments to the final version. \n\nRegarding the implementation of new architectures, we note that our main goal in this paper was understanding the expressive power of existing state of the art architectures. The new architectures were only suggested to (1) illustrate the claims in the paper in a simple setting and (2) offer a starting point for future work aiming to design universal networks (as mentioned by some reviewers). Implementing these new architectures requires a significant engineering effort and we leave it as future work. We have  added a remark to this effect in the conclusions section.\n\nWe have uploaded a revised version. The main changes are additional discussions and proof ideas that make the paper more accessible. Changes in the revised version are marked in blue. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper481/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper481/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On the Universality of Rotation Equivariant Point Cloud Networks", "authorids": ["nadavdym@gmail.com", "~Haggai_Maron1"], "authors": ["Nadav Dym", "Haggai Maron"], "keywords": ["3D deep learning", "Rotation invariance", "Invariant and equivariant deep networks", "Universal approximation", "Point clouds"], "abstract": "Learning functions on point clouds has applications in many fields, including computer vision, computer graphics, physics, and chemistry.

The universal approximation property for equivariant architectures under shape-preserving transformations is discussed. First, the authors derived two sufficient conditions for equivariant architectures with the universal approximation property. Then, they examined two methods based on the Tensor Field Network to prove that such a property holds for both of them. At last, the authors propose alternative methods which also satisfy the universal approximation property. \n\nThis paper is full of theoretical analysis, which is based on investigating the equivariant polynomials in the group theory. The proofs are similar to the previous works, except that more transformations, including rotation, translation and permutation, are considered together. However, the proof of the rotation equivariance has been discussed in previous works, and the theorems for translation and permutation are much easier than the rotation analysis. Moreover, the proposed method based on TFN is simply modified by the authors, resulting in alternative architectures which also satisfies the universal approximation property. However, this paper fails to provide any numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance and the influence of parameters \\theta.\n\npros:\n- provide sufficient conditions for equivariance of shape-preserving architectures to satisfy the universal approximation property\n- prove two methods based of Tensor Field Networks that satisfy the universal approximation property\n- raise two simple models based on the TFN\n \n\ncons:\n- This paper provides complete poofs to the TFN network theoretically, but lacks auxiliary experimental verification.
