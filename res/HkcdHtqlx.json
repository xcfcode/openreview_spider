We agree that a deeper analysis of the performance gain w.r.t. different components in the model is important in order to better understand the architecture. To this end, we have added more analyses to Tables 4 and 6 in the revised draft, and related discussions at the end of section 4.4. Below we address the specific points you raised:\n\n1. While the experiments and architecture presented in the current paper are indeed for the specific task of cloze-style QA, we believe the main idea of GA is applicable in other settings where a sequence needs to be processed conditioned on external context. One possible application is QA over videos. There is already some evidence of the utility of multiplicative interactions in visual QA, see for example [1]. \n\nWe would also like to point out that other researchers have already successfully applied the preprint version GA Reader-- to challenging datasets for other tasks such as language modeling (LAMBADA [2]) and extractive question answering (SQuAD [3]), with SOTA or competitive results, indicating its generality. The current paper adds further improvements to that unpublished version.\n\n2. Table 6 presents an ablation study on the components added on top of GA Reader--. Character embeddings are the least important, and were not applied for CNN/Daily Mail datasets anyway due to anonymization (Section 4.2). The use of token-specific attentions and glove embeddings are both important additions. Since the strongest baseline, NSE, also uses Glove embeddings we believe that the improvement provided by our main contribution, the GA module (with token-specific attentions), is important. Further, the significance of this module is established in section 4.4.\n\n3. Our new empirical results in Table 4 show that increasing the number of hops leads to substantial increase in performance up to K=3, which plateaus beyond that. Intuitively, visualization of the attention at intermediate layers in Figures 3-7 shows that the model tends to focus on distinct salient tokens in the query after each layer. This indicates that multiple hops allow the model to combine multiple pieces of information from the query, mimicking a shallow reasoning process. We agree that a deeper analysis on the effect of K on different types of queries would be most informative, unfortunately this is beyond the scope of this work since such query type annotations are not readily available nor easily constructed for any of the datasets we consider. \n\n[1] Fukui, Akira, et al. \"Multimodal Compact Bilinear Pooling for Visual Question Answering and Visual Grounding.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01847 (2016).\n[2] Chu, Zewei, et al. \"Broad Context Language Modeling as Reading Comprehension.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.08431 (2016).\n[3] Yang, Zhilin, et al. \"Words or Characters?

To this end, we have added more analyses to Tables 4 and 6 in the revised draft, and a discussion of these at the end of section 4.4. Below we address the specific points you raised:\n\n1. (1) We have added results on the effect of varying the number of hops K to table 4. We can see that there is a significant and stable increase in performance as we go from K=1 (which is the AS reader) to K=3 hops, which then plateaus at K=4 hops. This is in line with our expectation from the visualizations presented in section 4.5 (Figures 3-7), where we show that after each layer the model typically attends to distinct tokens in the query to derive the correct answer. \n\n(2) It is certainly possible to share parameters for different components of the system, including the query encoders at each layer. However, the decision to do so is dependent on the particular application; in particular for the datasets we consider we found no benefit in doing so (please see the comment on 4 Dec below). In the paper we present the more general formulation of not sharing the parameters, since that allows the query representations, and hence the filters applied at each layer to be different.\n\n2. Table 6 presents an ablation study on the different components added on top of GA Reader--. We see that even without C(w), the proposed model, despite its relative simplicity, achieves SOTA results on WDW. We would also like to emphasize that C(w) was not used for CNN and Daily Mail datasets where again GA has SOTA performance.

The document representation is attended to sequentially over multiple-hops using similarity with the query representation (using a dot-product) as the scoring/attention function. \nThe proposed method improves upon (CNN, Daily Mail, Who-Did-What datasets) or is comparable to (CBT dataset) the state-of-the-art results.\n\n\nPros:\n\n1. Nice idea on heirarchical attention for modulating the context (document) representation by the task-specific (query) representation.\n2. The presentation is clear with thorough experimental comparison with the latest results.\n\n\nComments:\n\n1. The overall system presents a number of architectural elements: (1) attention at multiple layers (multi-hop), (2) query based attention for the context (or gated attention), (3) encoding the query vector at each layer independently.\nIt is important to breakdown the gain in performance due to the above factors: the ablation study presented in section 4.4 helps establish the importance of Gated Attention (#2 above). However, it is not clear:\n\n  (1) how much multiple-hops of gated-attention contribute to the performance.\n  (2) how important is it to have a specialized query encoder for each layer.\n\nUnderstanding the above better, will help simplify the architecture.\n\n\n2. The tokens are represented using L(w) and C(w). It is not clear if C(w) is crucial for the performance of the proposed method.\nThere is a significant performance drop when C(w) is absent (e.g. in \"GA Reader--\"; although there are other changes in \"GA Reader--\" which could affect the performance). Hence, it is not clear how much does the main idea, i.e., gated attention contributes towards the superior performance of the proposed method.\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Gated-Attention Readers for Text Comprehension", "abstract": "In this paper we study the problem of answering cloze-style questions over documents.

These two representations are combined together using a Gated Attention (GA).\nGA calculates the compatibility of each word in the document and the query as a probability distribution.\nFor each word in the document a gate is calculated weighting the query representation according to the word compatibility.\nUltimately, the gate is applied to the gru-encoded document word.\nThe resulting word vectors are re-encoded with a bidirectional GRU.\nThis process is performed for multiple hops. After k hops, the probability of a word to be part of the answer is calculated by a log-linear model that take as input the last word representations, and the concatenation of the last query representation before and after the cloze token.\nThe probability of a candidate being the answer to the question is given by a linear combination of the single word probabilities.\n\nThe proposed model is tested on 4 different dataset. \nThe authors shown that the proposed model works well (state-of-the-art performance) for 3 out of 4 benchmarks.\n\n\n----------\n\nOVERALL JUDGMENT\nThe main contribution of the paper is the gated attention mechanism, that in my opinion, is a simple and interesting idea.\nThe paper is well thought, and the ablation study on the benefits given by the gated attention are convincing.\nThe GA reader as whole model outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on 3 benchmarks and seems very promising also on the CBT dataset.\nI would have liked to see some discussion on why the model works less well on the CBT dataset, though.\n\n\n----------\n\nDETAILED COMMENTS\n\nminor.

We figure that adding diversity to query representations is more effective than reinforcing the same information at every layer repetitively. In fact, we compared the two schemes (share v.s. not share) experimentally and found them to perform similarly for the datasets we consider. In the paper we present the more general formulation of not sharing parameters.\n\n(B) Thank you for the suggestion. Applying the GA module selectively between the layers is equivalent to replacing the single-layer document GRUs with multilayer versions, and then retuning both the total number of hops (K) and the GRU depth at each hop. We agree this is an interesting direction to explore, though beyond the primary focus of this paper.

Our model, the Gated-Attention (GA) Reader, integrates a multi-hop architecture with a novel attention mechanism, which is based on multiplicative interactions between the query embedding and the intermediate states of a recurrent neural network document reader. This enables the reader to build query-specific representations of tokens in the document for accurate answer selection. The GA Reader obtains state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks for this task--the CNN \\& Daily Mail news stories and the Who Did What dataset. The effectiveness of multiplicative interaction is demonstrated by an ablation study, and by comparing to alternative compositional operators for implementing the gated-attention.
