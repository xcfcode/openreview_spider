LUA scores all the valid segmentation of a sequence and uses Dynamic Programming to find the segmentation with the highest score. In addition, LUA can incorporate labeling of the segment as an additional component for span labeling tasks. \n\nPros:\n1. LUA overcomes the shortages of sequence labeling as a token-based tagging method and span-based models as well, by treating them separately.\n2. The decomposition of scoring label and scoring span allows the pre-computation of the maximum label score for each span, reducing the complexity.\n3. This method achieve the state of the art performance on 13 out of 15 data sets empirically.\n\nCons:\n1. The novelty is incremental, as the idea of calculating span-based score and label-based score with DP has been used widely in constituent parsing, which applies interval DP in a similar way. Also check semi-CRF model (Sunita Sarawagi and William W. Cohen, 2004).\n2. The way of using neural model to calculate the span-based scoring seems to be very arbitrary (Eq3), without any explanation why it is designed in this way.\n3. Label correlations are used to mimic correlation scoring, however the transition between spans are not explicitly modeled.\n\nQuestions:\n1. LUA is only used in inference stage. Do you think by using LUA in training as well, though slower, the performance can be further improved?\n2. Do you have any intuition of why designing the scoring function (Eq3) in that way?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper21/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper21/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Segmenting Natural Language Sentences via Lexical Unit Analysis", "authorids": ["~Yangming_Li1", "~lemao_liu1", "~Shuming_Shi1"], "authors": ["Yangming Li", "lemao liu", "Shuming Shi"], "keywords": ["Neural Sequence Labeling", "Neural Sequence Segmentation", "Dynamic Programming"], "abstract": "In this work, we present Lexical Unit Analysis (LUA), a framework for general sequence segmentation tasks.

This consistency guarantees that LUA is capable of overcoming the label bias problem. \n\nComment-2: It is not clear how DP contributes to the success of the model, as the scores for segments are derived during the training (which seems most of the success is coming from the labeled data (i.e. supervised training) and BERT encoding).\n\nAnswer-2: There are three important facts: 1) the tasks in text segmentation are all supervised learning; 2) most of our baselines adopt BERT as the sequence encoder; 3) DP is consistently used in both training and inference.

Do you think by using LUA in training as well, though slower, the performance can be further improved?\n\nAnswer-1: DP is used for both training and inference in a consistent manner. As shown in Eq. (8), at training time, we use DP to calculate f(\\hat{y}) for inducing the max-margin loss. Besides, in our preliminary experiments, we find that not using DP in training severely degrades the performances. Although DP is involved in training, its running time is still competitive. As shown in Table 6, it is even faster than BERT+CRF by about 1 minute for one training epoch.\n\nQuestion-2: Do you have any intuition of why designing the scoring function (Eq3) in that way? \n\nAnswer-2: The design of Eq. (3) is inspired by the Eq. (14) in ESIM [Chen et al., Enhanced LSTM for Natural Language Inference, ACL 2017]. We will clarify this in the revised version. \n\nComment-3: The novelty is incremental, as the idea of calculating span-based score and label-based score with DP has been used widely in constituent parsing, which applies interval DP in a similar way. Also check semi-CRF model (Sunita Sarawagi and William W. Cohen, 2004).\n\nAnswer-3: Recent methods to text segmentation are dominated by sequence labeling and span-based models. However, they suffer from many problems that are described in Introduction (Section 1). Our proposed LUA solves all of them and have obtained new state-of-the-art results on 13 datasets. Span-based constituent parsers can\u2019t capture the label correlations among constituents and semi-CRF is still an extension of CRF. LUA is highly light-weight and very effective. We strongly believe that LUA will have a great impact on future research.\n\nComment-4: Label correlations are used to mimic correlation scoring, however the transition between spans are not explicitly modeled.\n\nAnswer-4: This is an interesting direction and we will explore it in future work.

Also, a similar method has been applied to the segmentation of character sequences into word sequences for the languages that have no delimiters between words, such as Chinese and Japanese. \n\nAnswer-1: Would you please show us the related works in speech recognition? We will clarify the differences between them and our work. The proposed LUA has made significant contributions to NLP. Currently, the dominant approaches to text segmentation are sequence labeling and span-based models. However, they suffer from many problems, which have been made clear in Introduction (Section 1). LUA addresses all of them and, importantly, it has established new state-of-the-art performances in 13 datasets. LUA is very light-weight and highly effective. We strongly believe that LUA will be a new framework for text segmentation. We sincerely hope the reviewer can see the value of this work to NLP.\n\n\n\nComment-2: On the contrary, the application of the BERT-based representation to the sequence segmentation tasks such as sentence segmentation and sequential labelling may be new, and the finding that this method can attain a state-of-the-art performance in those problems could be worth reporting\n\nAnswer-2: In fact, most of the compared baselines adopt BERT as the sentence encoder, but our proposed LUA has still significantly outperformed them. This demonstrates that the superiority of LUA is not attributed to BERT but thanks to its attractive properties. As described in Introduction (Section 1), LUA avoids predicting invalid segmentation, overcomes the label bias issue, consistently uses DP in both training and evaluation, etc."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper21/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper21/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Segmenting Natural Language Sentences via Lexical Unit Analysis", "authorids": ["~Yangming_Li1", "~lemao_liu1", "~Shuming_Shi1"], "authors": ["Yangming Li", "lemao liu", "Shuming Shi"], "keywords": ["Neural Sequence Labeling", "Neural Sequence Segmentation", "Dynamic Programming"], "abstract": "In this work, we present Lexical Unit Analysis (LUA), a framework for general sequence segmentation tasks.
