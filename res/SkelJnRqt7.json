The algorithm assumes that training samples from only one of the sources and the mixture distributions are available, which is a realistic assumption in a lot of cases. It then iteratively learns a model that can separate the mixture by using the available samples in a clever fashion.\n\nStrengths:\n- The novelty lies in how the authors formulate the problem, and the iterative approach used to learn the unknown distribution and thereby improve source separation.\n- The use of existing GLO masking techniques for initialization to improve performance is also novel and interesting.\n\nWeaknesses\n- There are some concerns around guarantees of convergence. Empirically, the algorithm works well, but it is unclear when the algorithm will fail. Some analysis here would have greatly improved the quality of the paper.\n- The reviewers also raised concerns around clarity of presentation and consistency of notation. While the presentation improved after revision, there are parts which remain unclear (e.g., those raised by R3) that may hinder readability and reproducibility. \n- The mixing model assumed by the authors is additive, which may not always be the case, e.g. when noise is convolutive (room reverberation, for instance).\n- (Minor) Experiments can also be improved. The vision tasks are not very realistic. For the speech separation task, relatively clean speech is easy to obtain. Therefore, it would be worth considering speech as observed, and noise as unobserved. The authors cite separating animal sounds from background, but the task chosen does not quite match that setup. \n\nOverall, the reviewers agree that the paper presents an interesting approach to separation. But given the issues with presentation and evaluations, the recommendation is to reject the paper. We strongly encourage the authors to address these concerns and resubmit in the future.", "confidence": "4: The area chair is confident but not absolutely certain", "recommendation": "Reject", "title": "Good formulation, but needs improvement in presentation and experiments"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper956/Area_Chair1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper956/Area_Chair1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural separation of observed and unobserved distributions", "abstract": "Separating mixed distributions is a long standing challenge for machine learning and signal processing.

The objective of our approach is to create synthetic training samples from the unobserved distribution, which are very similar to unobserved real samples. Once obtained, it suffices to train a separation function T() which minimizes the supervised regression objective - using the synthetic mixtures. This separation function - which is just a single neural network - can be directly applied at test time for any mixture y and yield separated signals x and b (which are given by T(y) and y-T(y)). Following the responses by the reviewers, we significantly simplified the notation and added a description of our method in the form of an algorithm. Our edits are marked in red.\n\n\u201cIn the image separation task, GLOM performs better than GAN, but worse in other tasks. Analysis is needed here.\u201d : We would like to explain that we do not claim the generations by GLO are of better quality than GAN. In our experiments, GLOM as a standalone method always underperformed AM in terms of PSNR or SDR, with the sole exception of vocal-instrumental separation. GLOM however does not suffer from mode-dropping, making it more suitable for initializing NES. It is crucial for an initialization to not be too close to a bad local minimum. As GANs generate high quality samples but suffer from mode dropping, they push NES towards suboptimal solutions. We think that GLOM provides an initialization that is further away from bad local minima with missing modes and is therefore a better initialization for NES.\n\n\u201conly in the music separation task, finetuning is significantly better than vanilla NES. Is it because generative models can synthesize more realistic data samples?\u201d : We think that the good performance of GLOM initialization for music separation comes from the fact that it makes no assumption of the relation between the two sources. Vanilla NES assumes independence between the sources, which is not true for instrumental and vocal (or drums) sources in music. It is therefore empirically found to be important to use a good initialization by a technique that does not make the independence assumption (which can be AM or GLOM). We give possible reasons above for GLOM being a better initializer than AM.\n\n\u201cwould the generator learn to synthesize X+B with temporal synchronization?\u201d :  It should be noted that GLOM does not consist of a single generator but two generators. G_X() for X and G_B() for B. By using clean training samples from B, we train G_B(), while using the mixture samples we can then train G_X(). GLOM never learns about the dependance between X and B. G_X() and G_B() use unrelated latent spaces (and do not rely on dependence or independence assumptions). We therefore do not expect them to generate signals that are synchronized, but do expect them to be effective in all cases of synchronization.\n\nWe will add results addressing the other requests made by the reviewer within the next few days. We would be happy to provide the reviewer with any additional information.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper956/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper956/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper956/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural separation of observed and unobserved distributions", "abstract": "Separating mixed distributions is a long standing challenge for machine learning and signal processing.

We also deal with the much harder case of separating the target being given only pure samples from the nuisance signal (this is the case for the speech and music separation experiments). The only assumption is that one of the sources is given (regardless of which one it is).\n\nThank you for pointing out some notational improvements:\n\n\u201cThe loss in (1) is unclear\u201d : As per the suggestion by the reviewer, we replaced the \\|,\\| notation by \\ell(). We use an L1 loss throughout the paper and made it clear where appropriate.\n\n\u201cDoes T^m(b_j + x_i^m) share the parameter of that from previous iterations like T^{m-1}?\u201d : The separation function T^m() is initialized by the weights of the separation function T^{m-1} from the previous iteration (starting from random initialization would also work, however it would require more epochs per iteration). T^m() is of course trained during the iteration. In response to the reviewer\u2019s question, we removed the superscript $m$ altogether, thereby significantly simplifying the notation (while the algorithm does not change).  We also added a description of our method in the form of an algorithm, further improving clarity.\n\n\u201cconfusion between the inner product and element-wise product\u201d: We resolved the overloading of dot products with both scalar and element-wise product by replacing all element-wise products by the operation \\odot.\n\nWe believe this addresses all issues raised by the reviewer. If there are any remaining issues, we would be most enthusiastic to address them.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper956/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper956/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper956/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural separation of observed and unobserved distributions", "abstract": "Separating mixed distributions is a long standing challenge for machine learning and signal processing. Applications include: single-channel multi-speaker separation (cocktail party problem), singing voice separation and separating reflections from images. Most current methods either rely on making strong assumptions on the source distributions (e.g. sparsity, low rank, repetitiveness) or rely on having training samples of each source in the mixture. In this work, we tackle the scenario of extracting an unobserved distribution additively mixed with a signal from an observed (arbitrary) distribution. We introduce a new method: Neural Egg Separation - an iterative method that learns to separate the known distribution from progressively finer estimates of the unknown distribution. In some settings, Neural Egg Separation is initialization sensitive, we therefore introduce GLO Masking which ensures a good initialization. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms current methods that use the same level of supervision and often achieves similar performance to full supervision.
