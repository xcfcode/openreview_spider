Through experiments on two datasets, this paper shows improved performance over a few baselines.\n\nPaper Strengths:\n1. The direction of spatial-temporal point cloud processing is indeed underexplored so I appreciate the efforts put into this direction in the paper. \n2. The ability to answer arbitrary prediction queries could be useful in different application domains\n\nPaper Weaknesses:\n1. The technical contribution is limited. Essentially, the proposed method is just to apply the existing PointConv operator in both spatial and temporal dimensions. Also, regarding the literature of spatial-temporal point cloud processing, it would be nice if the paper can add some discussion/comparison with PointRNN [A1], which I think is the closest work to this paper though to my knowledge it is not published yet (has been on arXiv for more than a year).\n2. The proposed method seems to be problematic in modeling temporal dynamics. Specifically, the PointConv operator in Eq. 1 is to aggregate features within a neighborhood (weighted summation of the features), which does not consider the order of the points in the neighborhood, i.e., permutation-invariant. In the spatial point processing case, this is fine in some applications where we do not consider the direction but only distances of neighborhood points. However, in the temporal domain (i.e., Eq. 3), I feel using PointConv does not make much sense as the order of time should matter in general. Essentially, Eq.3 tells us that, if the centroid point is at frame t, then its corresponding neighbor point at frame t-H has the same distance measure as its corresponding neighbor point at frame t+H, which means that the direction of time is not considered. I feel that the formulation needs to inform the network of the time flow, i.e., the order of time. Also, in Eq 2, the neighborhood also considers some points within a small time window but discards the order of the time again. As a result, I do not think the spatial-temporal point processing proposed in this paper is properly modeling temporal dynamics. Even simple GNN/PointNet + RNN [Li et al 2018b, A2] network structure considers the order of time in the RNN.\n3. A big problem I feel about the proposed method is that it relies on a strong assumption about the point correspondences in time, which largely limits the practical impact of this paper. In this paper, the proposed method is shown to reason for high-level entities (e.g., represent an object or a Starcraft unit as a single point), which is fine as the correspondences can be obtained by object tracking in practice. However, how about the scenario where each point does not represent a high-level object but represent low-level observations, e.g., 3D point clouds obtained by LiDAR or stereo reconstruction? In such cases, it is extremely difficult to obtain the point correspondences across time as there could be no correspondences at all in the real-world. Then the proposed method might have problems applied to such data which is widely used in many applications such as point cloud-based object detection, SLAM, point cloud-based classification/segmentation/prediction. In contrast, Minkowski Networks [Choy 2019] that this paper is compared to and also the PointRNN [A1] and SPF [A2] can be applied to these more challenging scenarios. \n4. I am a bit concerned about the dataset used in the experiments as the data in the Starcraft II dataset seems to be generated randomly, which is hard to be reproduced and compared by the follow-up work. Would it be possible that evaluating the proposed method on the test set of a few public benchmarks (e.g., traffic prediction) that others can easily compare with even without re-implemented the proposed method? \n5. The re-implementation of the Minkowski Networks is somewhat concerning. The paper claims that it is hard to find a suitable kernel size and vocalization resolution, and will lead to a prohibitively high number of network parameters if increasing the kernel size. This leads me to wonder how large scale the data is, e.g., how many points and how many frames the method needs to process. If the scale of the data is not too big, there should not be a problem for the Minkowski Networks I guess. In the original paper of the Minkowski Networks, they evaluated their method on a sequence of large-scale LiDAR point cloud data (usually with 50k number of points per frame), which seems fine and obtains strong performance. It would be nice if a more detailed explanation of why the Minkowski Networks cannot be properly tuned.\n\nJustification:\n\nMy decision is made mainly because I feel the proposed method seems to have some flaws and limitations. Also, I am not fully convinced by the experimental results due to the concern about data and re-implementation, and the technical contribution is limited too. However, I would be happy to change my mind if there are any misunderstandings. \n\nReferences\n\n[A1] H. Fan and Y. Yang.

Nevertheless, in my eyes there are still some open questions:\n* Why not simply use 4D convolution like for example in the paper Meteornet: Deep learning on dynamic 3d point cloud sequences?

For example, an ablation study, where the importance of the time component is shown, would be advantageous.\n* The data sets consist of sequences with corresponding point data.

It would be interesting to see a test with semantic segmentation (with lidar data) or action estimation (from depth images) to see more general applications of the TPC layer.\n* It is not clear to me why graph convolution networks are not taken into account, in my eyes graph networks would be a good choice for the given data.

It proposes the Temporal PointConv model which is an extension of the PointConv model (Wu et al., 2019). In particular, PointConv computes a convolution by aggregating the features of nearby points of a point p as the new feature of p.  Temporal PointConv extends this by aggregating the features of points near p in both space and time in a two-step process: first weighting the aggregation by the space distance and then weighting the aggregation by the temporal distance. \n\nExperiments on two datasets show that Temporal PointConv outperforms the baseline models in prediction accuracy. \n\nPros:\n1. The paper studies an interesting topic. Spatial-temporal point cloud modelling has many applications including weather forecasting as shown in the paper.  \n\n2. The experimental results are good. The proposed model achieves substantial improvement in terms of the prediction accuracy. The experiments done with a gaming setting (Starcraft II) is interesting. \n\n3. The paper is well written and easy to follow. \n\nCons:\n1. The paper proposed a simple and effective model. However, a concern is on its technical contribution. As discussed above, the proposed Temporal PointConv model is a direct extension of the PointConv model. The technical contribution is too little to justify a publication in a top-tier conference. \n \nAdditional comments:\nThe Abstract claims that the proposed model achieved improved efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines, but there is no experimental result reported on model efficiency. \n\nGrammar: \"do not have recorded properties we can use to determine property loss.\" => \"do not have recorded properties which we can use to determine property loss.\"\n\nTypo: \"tables 1 and 2\" => \"Tables 1 and 2\"", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1843/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1843/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Convolution for Irregularly Sampled Temporal Point Clouds", "authorids": ["~Erich_Merrill_III1", "~Stefan_Lee1", "~Li_Fuxin1", "~Thomas_G_Dietterich1", "~Alan_Fern1"], "authors": ["Erich Merrill III", "Stefan Lee", "Li Fuxin", "Thomas G Dietterich", "Alan Fern"], "keywords": ["point cloud", "convolution", "irregular sampling", "starcraft", "nowcasting"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of modeling the dynamics of continuous spatial-temporal processes represented by irregular samples through both space and time. Such processes occur in sensor networks, citizen science, multi-robot systems, and many others. \nWe propose a new deep model that is able to directly learn and predict over this irregularly sampled data, without voxelization, by leveraging a recent convolutional architecture for static point clouds. The model also easily incorporates the notion of multiple entities in the process. In particular, the model can flexibly answer prediction queries about arbitrary space-time points for different entities regardless of the distribution of the training or test-time data. We present experiments on real-world weather station data and battles between large armies in StarCraft II.
