", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "review": "SUMMARY\nThis work is on protein design, i.e.~generating protein structures. Based of a large repository of proteins, in a first step a convolutional generative GAN is trained on (length-matched) fragments in order to produce 2D pairwise distance maps between alpha carbons on the backbone. In a second step, protein folding maps are computed by the ADMM algorithm. In particular, the problem of recovering 3D coordinates from pairwise distances is addressed by iteratively projecting an updated gram matrix onto the cone of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices of rank 3.  Finally, the proposed method is applied to the problem of \"inpainting\" missing parts of proteins.\n\nEVALUATION:\nThe paper is easy to read, the motivation is clear and convincing, and everything seems to be technically sound. The proposed technique for recovering 3D coordinates from pairwise distances is certainly interesting, but it is a bit unclear to me if there is any specific novel contribution. The \"inpainting\" application example is certainly interesting on a qualitative level. Unfortunately, there is (almost) no quantitative evaluation provided, which makes it a bit difficult for the reader to understand what type of problems can be solved successfully, and where the limits of this approach are.  \n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Modeling for Protein Structures", "abstract": "We apply deep generative models to the task of generating protein structures, toward application in protein design.
