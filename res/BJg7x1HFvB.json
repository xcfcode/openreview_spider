In particular, multiple papers have advocated for highly restrictive yet complex strategies when more general, simpler baselines shown in our paper are just as effective. \n\nWe argue that the ubiquity of distillation is not a strong enough reason to reject a paper that merely uses it as a tool. We do not claim novelty for using distillation in the context of building compact models, but rather investigate its interaction with pre-training. It was not clear a priori that a student with access to a powerful pre-trained teacher can (somewhat redundantly) benefit from its own pre-training. Prior cited studies initialize their model by truncating taller models, without questioning whether pre-training is necessary, or whether truncation is the best strategy for pre-training. Our in-depth ablation studies fill this void in the literature. Indeed, the results are empirical, not unlike the majority of neural network research.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1499/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1499/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Well-Read Students Learn Better: On the Importance of Pre-training Compact Models", "authors": ["Iulia Turc", "Ming-Wei Chang", "Kenton Lee", "Kristina Toutanova"], "authorids": ["iuliaturc@google.com", "mingweichang@google.com", "kentonl@google.com", "kristout@google.com"], "keywords": ["NLP", "self-supervised learning", "language model pre-training", "knowledge distillation", "BERT", "compact models"], "TL;DR": "Studies how self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation interact in the context of building compact models.", "abstract": "Recent developments in natural language representations have been accompanied by large and expensive models that leverage vast amounts of general-domain text through self-supervised pre-training.

We should have made it clearer that comparison against prior work in Table 3 is for completeness only, and it is not our goal to beat SoTA in the traditional setup; rather, we propose a solution for the case where there is unlabeled task data.\n\nComparison to Patient Knowledge Distillation (PKD): PKD requires initialization with a pre-trained Transformer which has the same hidden dimension size and same or larger depth; it also requires that the teacher and student have the same hidden dimension size. It is possible that transferring intermediate map values will bring improvements on top of our method pre-trained distillation; this would be a possibility in the restricted case that the student and teacher have the same hidden dimension size, limiting the accuracy and efficiency of the compact model. Our preliminary experiments (not reported in the paper) showed no gains from intermediate map matching objectives when combined with pre-trained distillation but further experiments will be interesting.\n\nBy eliminating the intermediate layer transfer between students and teachers, our method is more *general*, with no architectural restrictions. For instance, in Table 3, the comparison is limited to 6/768 models because of the extreme restrictions from the baselines. Also, we disagree that our method is more *elaborate* just because it requires a pre-training step; note that PKD also requires a (deeper) pre-trained Transformer. Once our pre-trained models are released, future efforts can simply reuse them, the same way PKD reuses a pre-trained Bert checkpoint. Exploring more flexible intermediate layer knowledge transfer following PKD but generalizing to mismatched dimensionality of student and teacher would be an interesting avenue for future work.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1499/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1499/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Well-Read Students Learn Better: On the Importance of Pre-training Compact Models", "authors": ["Iulia Turc", "Ming-Wei Chang", "Kenton Lee", "Kristina Toutanova"], "authorids": ["iuliaturc@google.com", "mingweichang@google.com", "kentonl@google.com", "kristout@google.com"], "keywords": ["NLP", "self-supervised learning", "language model pre-training", "knowledge distillation", "BERT", "compact models"], "TL;DR": "Studies how self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation interact in the context of building compact models.", "abstract": "Recent developments in natural language representations have been accompanied by large and expensive models that leverage vast amounts of general-domain text through self-supervised pre-training.

From Table 3 the results on test sets are better than previous works, but not by much. The authors spend quite a of space on ablation studies to investigate the contribution of different factors, and on cross-domain transfers.

It also shows that the best is to combine both and distill from that pre-trained student model.\n\nMy rating is Weak Accept. I think the submission highlights a very useful observation about knowledge distillation that I imagine is overlooked by many researchers and practitioners. The decision of Weak as opposed to a Strong accept is because the submission does not introduce anything truly novel, but simply points out observations and offers a recommended training strategy. However, I do argue for its acceptance, because it does a thorough job and presents many interesting findings that can benefit the community.\n\nComparison with prior work:\n\nThe submission focuses on comparison with Sun et al. and Sanh. These comparisons are important, but not the most compelling part of the paper. Comparison with more prior work that show large benefits would make the paper even stronger.\n\nInteresting experiments:\n\nThe paper presents many interesting experiments useful for anyone trying to develop a compressed model. First, it shows that distillation (from scratch) by itself may be overrated, since simply repeating the pre-training+fine-tuning procedure on the small model directly is effective. However, distillation remains relevant since it also shows that pre-training the student, then distilling against a teacher, is a potent combination. In the case when the transfer set is the same size as the pre-training set, it surprisingly still has some benefits. This is not experimentally explained, but I suspect there are optimization benefits that are hard to pin down exactly. The paper hypothesizes that the two methods learn different \u201clinguistic aspects,\u201d but I think it is a bit too speculative to put it in such terms.\n\nThe experiments are thorough, with many student sizes, transfer set sizes, transfer set/task set correlation, etc. It also compares against the truncation technique, where the student is initialized with a truncated version of the teacher. There are no error bars in the plots, but there are so many plots with clear trends, that this is not a big concern. I can\u2019t think of any experiments that are obviously missing.\n\nMisc:\n\n- The introduction says that the pre-training+fine-tuning baseline has been overlooked. It would be great to point out papers that has actually overlooked this baseline. Including this in the results would be even better.\n- During my first read-through, I got confused because I didn\u2019t realize \u201cpre-training\u201d in most of the paper refers to \u201cstudent pre-training\u201d (as opposed to simply training the teacher). Making this a bit more explicit here and there can avoid this confusion."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1499/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1499/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Well-Read Students Learn Better: On the Importance of Pre-training Compact Models", "authors": ["Iulia Turc", "Ming-Wei Chang", "Kenton Lee", "Kristina Toutanova"], "authorids": ["iuliaturc@google.com", "mingweichang@google.com", "kentonl@google.com", "kristout@google.com"], "keywords": ["NLP", "self-supervised learning", "language model pre-training", "knowledge distillation", "BERT", "compact models"], "TL;DR": "Studies how self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation interact in the context of building compact models.", "abstract": "Recent developments in natural language representations have been accompanied by large and expensive models that leverage vast amounts of general-domain text through self-supervised pre-training.
