The writing is clear, concise and easy to follow.\n\nAn important argument in favour of using complex-valued networks is said to be the propagation of phase information. However, I feel that the observation that CReLU works best out of the 3 proposed alternatives contradicts this somewhat. CReLU simply applies ReLU component-wise to the real and imaginary parts, which has an effect on the phase information that is hard to conceptualise. It definitely does not preserve phase, like modReLU would.\n\nThis makes me wonder whether the \"complex numbers\" paradigm is applied meaningfully here, or whether this is just an arbitrary way of doing some parameter sharing in convnets that happens to work reasonably well (note that even completely random parameter tying can work well, as shown in \"Compressing neural networks with the hashing trick\" by Chen et al.). Some more insight into how phase information is used, what it represents and how it is propagated through the network would help to make sense of this.\n\nThe image recognition results are mostly inconclusive, which makes it hard to assess the benefit of this approach. The improved performance on the audio tasks seems significant, but how the complex nature of the networks helps achieve this is not really demonstrated. It is unclear how the phase information in the input waveform is transformed into the phase of the complex activations in the network (because I think it is implied that this is what happens). This connection is a bit vague. Once again, a more in-depth analysis of this phase behavior would be very welcome.\n\nI'm on the fence about this work: I like the ideas and they are explained well, but I'm missing some insight into why and how all of this is actually helping to improve performance (especially w.r.t. how phase information is used).\n\n\nComments:\n\n- The related work section is comprehensive but a bit unstructured, with each new paragraph seemingly describing a completely different type of work. Maybe some subsection titles would help make it feel a bit more cohesive.\n\n- page 3: \"(cite a couple of them)\" should be replaced by some actual references :)\n\n- Although care is taken to ensure that the complex and real-valued networks that are compared in the experiments have roughly the same number of parameters, doesn't the complex version always require more computation on account of there being more filters in each layer? It would be nice to discuss computational cost as well.\n\n\nREVISION: I have decided to raise my rating from 5 to 7 as I feel that the authors have adequately addressed many of my comments. In particular, I really appreciated the additional appendix sections to clarify what actually happens as the phase information is propagated through the network.\n\nRegarding the CIFAR results, I may have read over it, but I think it would be good to state even more clearly that these experiments constitute a sanity check, as both reviewer 1 and myself were seemingly unaware of this. With this in mind, it is of course completely fine that the results are not better than for real-valued networks.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Complex Networks", "abstract": "At present, the vast majority of building blocks, techniques, and architectures for deep learning are based on real-valued operations and representations.

Indeed, the most standard work nowadays with real-valued neural networks depends on a variety of already well-established techniques for weight initialization, regularization, activation function, convolutions, etc. In this work, the complex equivalent of many of these basics tools are developed, such as a number of complex activation functions, complex batch normalization, complex convolution, discussion of complex differentiability, strategies for complex weight initialization, complex equivalent of a residual neural network. \n\nEmpirical results show that the new complex-flavored neural networks achieve generally comparable performance to their real-valued counterparts, on a variety of different tasks. Then again, the major contribution of this work is not advancing the state-of-the-art on many benchmark tasks, but constructing a solid framework that will enable stable and solid application and research of these well-motivated models. \n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Complex Networks", "abstract": "At present, the vast majority of building blocks, techniques, and architectures for deep learning are based on real-valued operations and representations.

We have considered the comments and added a discussion on Phase Encoding in the appendix of the revised manuscript. We have illustrated the difference in encoding between the different activation functions tested for the deep complex network and shown that CReLU has more flexibility discriminating phase information. We also show that for all the tested activations, phase information is not necessarily preserved but, depending on where the complex representation lies in the complex plane, the latter might be either preserved, altered or discarded.\n\n\u201c CReLU simply applies ReLU component-wise to the real and imaginary parts, which has an effect on the phase information that is hard to conceptualise. It definitely does not preserve phase, like modReLU would.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2026 Some more insight into how phase information is used, what it represents and how it is propagated through the network would help to make sense of this.\u201d\n\nIndeed, none of the ReLU based activations that are presented preserve phase completely. However, the nature of a ReLU is that it operates as an identity function in certain regions of the input. Therefore phase is preserved exactly in some regions of the input space and discriminated in others. \n\nFor example, in section 3.4 we discuss the properties of the MoDReLU, CReLU and zReLU activation functions. We have added Section 6.6 which discusses the ways in which phase is preserved and manipulated in each of these cases. \n\nImportantly, in cases when activation functions do not preserve phase information, phase information can still influence subsequent computation. For example phase information may be preserved explicitly through a number of layers when activation functions are operating in their linear regime, prior to a layer further up in a network where the phase of an input lies in a zero region of an activation function.  In audio classification tasks, one can easily imagine how phase information could be important to use to influence classification decisions, but this does not mean that phase must be preserved all the way from input to the final classification output.\n\n\u201cThe image recognition results are mostly inconclusive, which makes it hard to assess the benefit of this approach.\u201d\n\nAs mentioned to reviewer 3. we feel it is important to underscore that our experiments on CIFAR with complex ResNets are included to demonstrate that our implementation is correct and that it yields results that are comparable to state of the art real architectures on a standard, well-known vision benchmark. This type of experiment is important because a naively implemented complex variation of a ResNet is *not* stable. Our complex batch norm formulation is essential to making deep complex networks work and therefore is an important contribution. (See Section 6.5).\n\n\u201cThe improved performance on the audio tasks seems significant, but how the complex nature of the networks helps achieve this is not really demonstrated. It is unclear how the phase information in the input waveform is transformed into the phase of the complex activations in the network (because I think it is implied that this is what happens). This connection is a bit vague. Once again, a more in-depth analysis of this phase behavior would be very welcome.\u201d\n\nConsider also our experiments in Table 4 which use tanh and sigmoid activations. These activation functions are bijective (invertible) functions and therefore they allow phase information to pass through the network with negligible loss of information. Our experiments in Table 4 involve predicting spectrograms and therefore the utility of preserving phase information should be easy for the reader to imagine. Our experiments support this intuition, as we see clear performance improvements with these phase information preserving models compared to similar real computation only networks.\n\n\u201c Although care is taken to ensure that the complex and real-valued networks that are compared in the experiments have roughly the same number of parameters, doesn't the complex version always require more computation on account of there being more filters in each layer? It would be nice to discuss computational cost as well.\u201d\n\nIn terms of computational complexity, the convolutional operation and the complex batchnorm are of the same order than their real counterparts. However, as the complex convolution is 4 times more expensive than its real counterpart and as the complex batchnorm is not implemented in cudnn, this makes a difference in terms of running time.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Complex Networks", "abstract": "At present, the vast majority of building blocks, techniques, and architectures for deep learning are based on real-valued operations and representations.

However their application don't seem to connect to any of those uses\u201d\n\nThere is not a lot of work that has considered the use of complex representations in the context of deep learning. This is why we have cited and commented upon interesting examples of what people have used complex representations for in the past. Some examples of prior work include the work on holographic representations and spectral pooling which use the (complex) Fourier Transform. We therefore discuss them as related work, i.e, holographic representations (and Associative LSTMs) and Fourier Transform methods (with their applications to Spectral Representations for ConvNets).\n\n\u201cSince any complex valued computation can be done with a real-valued arithmetic, switching to complex arithmetic needs a compelling use-case.

In contrast, our audio experiments in Tables 3 and 4 demonstrate the utility of complex VGG style architectures and complex convolutional LSTM architectures through clear performance gains. Comparing similarly structured real and complex networks, one sees increased performance for the complex variant in both of these sets of experiments. This is in line with the interpretation that for audio signals the use of complex neural networks allows information such as phase to be represented and manipulated within layers (implicitly in the case of rectangular complex numbers), and this yields higher performance compared to similarly structured real models.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Complex Networks", "abstract": "At present, the vast majority of building blocks, techniques, and architectures for deep learning are based on real-valued operations and representations.

However, recent work on recurrent neural networks and older fundamental theoretical analysis suggests that complex numbers could have a richer representational capacity and could also facilitate noise-robust memory retrieval mechanisms. Despite their attractive properties and potential for opening up entirely new neural architectures, complex-valued deep neural networks have been marginalized due to the absence of the building blocks required to design such models. In this work, we provide the key atomic components for complex-valued deep neural networks and apply them to convolutional feed-forward networks. More precisely, we rely on complex convolutions and present algorithms for complex batch-normalization, complex weight initialization strategies for complex-valued neural nets and we use them in experiments with end-to-end training schemes. We demonstrate that such complex-valued models are competitive with their real-valued counterparts. We test deep complex models on several computer vision tasks, on music transcription using the MusicNet dataset and on Speech spectrum prediction using TIMIT.
