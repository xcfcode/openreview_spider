The proposed algorithm performs randomized SVD on \\bar{X}=X-\\mu 1^T with a given constant vector \\mu without explicitly constructing \\bar{X} from X.\n\nThe proposed algorithm seems to be a straightforward modification of the randomized SVD algorithm, so that the contribution of this paper would be incremental. Also, the claimed benefits of the proposed method are better accuracy, less memory usage, and less computational time. On memory usage and computational time, however, I could not find any experimental comparison in Section 5. At least in Section 5.3 where the data matrix is indeed sparse, there should be some comparison in these respects. Because of these reasons, I would not be able to recommend acceptance of this paper.\n\nIn Algorithm 1, line 6, I think that one has to subtract not \\mu 1^T but \\mu 1^T \\Omega.\n\nI guess that equation (12) comes from Theorem 1.2 in Halko et al. (2011). An explicit citation should be needed here to put an appropriate credit to that paper. Also, the conditions under which equation (12) holds should be explicitly stated. In fact, Theorem 1.2 in Halko et al. is about the expected reconstruction error with rank-2k factorization obtained by randomized SVD, which is not consistent with the authors claim in page 3, lines 4-5: The first top unused singular value is not \\sigma_{k+1} but \\sigma_{2k+1}.\n\nPage 1, line 25: that provides (for) the SVD estimation\nPage 2, line 38: that span(s) the range\nPage 4, line 6: a s(h)ifted matrix\nPage 4, line 29: to be use(d) by the\nPage 5, line 22: uniformly distribut(ion -> ed)\nPage 5, lines 33, 38: Space is missing after the period.\nPage 5, line 43: There is an extra comma.\nPage 5, line 48: suggest(s) that\nPage 6, line 4: approaches (to) zero\nPage 6, line 14: 16 \\times 1979 should read 64 \\times 1979.\nPage 7, line 2: is validate(d)\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1830/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1830/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Shifted Randomized Singular Value Decomposition", "authors": ["Ali Basirat"], "authorids": ["ali.basirat@lingfil.uu.se"], "keywords": ["SVD", "PCA", "Randomized Algorithms"], "TL;DR": "A randomized algorithm to estimate the SVD of a shifted data matrix without explicitly constructing the matrix in the memory.", "abstract": "We extend the randomized singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm (Halko et al., 2011) to estimate the SVD of a shifted data matrix without explicitly constructing the matrix in the memory.
