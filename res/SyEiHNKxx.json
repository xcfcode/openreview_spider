This avoids the type of finite differentiation that physics engines such as MuJoCo use to compute derivatives. It is quite an interesting idea, and is demonstrated using learned control for several models. \n \n Quality, clarity:\n  The original version was somewhat loosely written; the current version is improved.\n \n Pros:\n - The nice idea of implementing a physics engine in a language such as Theano, and showing that this is quite feasible.\n - May inspire further work in this direction.\n \n Cons:\n - The speed is not systematically evaluated, as compared to finite-difference-based engines. It is thought to be \"in the same ballpark\" as other more full-featured engines.

You are correct, this has been corrected in the paper.\n2. In this paper, we did not want to introduce a new way to control robots. Our focus in this paper was not to introduce new paradigms for policies, therefore we did not compare to those other methods. We did introduce a new policy method, as we felt that this method would be most intuitive to people working with deep neural networks. On top of that, this naive method was powerful enough to solve all problems we threw at it in this paper. It is true that other methods rely already on the finite difference approximation of the gradient, but generally in those methods the robots are kept small with a limited number of states in order to keep the calculations fast. On top of that, they usually assume the entire state of the robot is known by the controller at every time step. Our method even works with very abstract sensors, such as cameras.\n\nThe fact that you let a library do the differentiation for you, empowers you to have the exact gradient. This is not only exact, but also only scales better to a bigger number of states (e.g. soft or compliant robots, or robots handling soft tissues come to mind), and to more abstract sensors (like cameras).\n3. We plan on training with noisy parameters, in order for the neural network controller to generalize over the stochasticity of the model. This has however only been explored little in the work for this paper.\n4. We did not compare to those other methods, as this paper is focused on the differential physics engine, and the new approach to implement and use that. Our approach solves these gradients exactly. It is true that we could have compared to these different methods for estimating the gradient, but our approach requires a specific framework. Implementing those other approaches for estimations of these exact gradients in this framework would be cumbersome and not a fair comparison. We rely on the judgement of the reader to evaluate whether the benefits of our approach outweighs the benefits of the other methods. We would argue that at worst, our approach is novel and illustrates an alternative to tackling these problems of finding the gradient for complex robotic systems.\n\nIn short, Natural Policy Gradient and REINFORCE estimate the gradient of stochastic models. In this paper, we show a practical method to differentiate deterministic models exactly. We would deal with stochastic models the same way REINFORCE does, by sampling from them, and optimizing the controller through stochastic gradient descent. This has however not been evaluated in this paper."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Differentiable Physics Engine for Deep Learning in Robotics", "abstract": "One of the most important fields in robotics is the optimization of controllers.

The approach is novel, and is motivated by being able to learn policies for robotics.\n\nMy two key reservations with the paper are as follows:\n1. The method is motivated by learning policies for robotics. However, the proposed method is *only* useful for robotics if the learned policy can transfer the real world. Transferring policies from simulation to real-world is an open research problem, and is particularly challenging with less realistic simulators.\n2. They key novelty/benefit of this approach over other model-based approaches is that the simulator is differentiable. However, the only empirical comparison in the paper is to a model-free approach (CMA-ES). To appropriately demonstrate the approach, it should be compared to other model-based approaches, which do not require analytic derivatives of the model.\n\nFor the reader to fully understand the pros and cons of the approach, the paper should also include quantitative comparison between the speed of the proposed simulator, and that of standard simulation platforms.\n\nBecause the idea is interesting and novel, I think it lies above the acceptance threshold. However, it would be significantly improved with the aforementioned comparisons.\n\nLastly, the writing of the paper could be improved, as it is rather informal and/or imprecise in a number of places. Here are some examples:\n-- \u201cwe model the use of a neural network as a general controller for a robot\u201d - can be more concisely phrased as something like \u201cwe model the robot controller using a neural network\u201d or \u201cthe robot controller is modeled using a neural network\"\n-- \u201cIn previous research, finding a gradient\u2026\u201d - This is a run-on sentence.\n-- \u201cWe basically jam this entire equation into\u201d - This sentence is informal and imprecise.\n-- \u201cdeep learning neural network\u201d - the word \u201clearning\u201d should be omitted\n-- \u201cone big RNN, where we unfold over time\u201d - should be \u201c\u2026RNN, which we unfold over time\u201d or \u201c\u2026RNN, unfolded over time\u201d\n\nThe writing would also be improved by making it more concise and fitting the paper into 8 pages.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Differentiable Physics Engine for Deep Learning in Robotics", "abstract": "One of the most important fields in robotics is the optimization of controllers.

Section I: \"Evaluating finite difference approximations, however, requires the same number of model evaluations as the number of parameters with respect to which is differentiated.\" -- this is incorrect. If you have a differentiable policy, you only require model evaluations of the order of number of states (which are typically in 100s) and not number of parameters.\n\n2. Have you tried comparing against numerical derivatives of the Jacobian and propagating these to find derivatives with respect to policy parameters (as opposed to jamming everything into the RNN as noted in the paper)? To me, the entire pitch of the paper lies on the former being difficult. However, the robotics literature is full of success stories where essentially one plans through a model by computing gradients using finite differences (e.g. iLQG, CIO, GPS etc).\n\n3.

Since the model is implemented rather than learned, it does not require data acquisition for learning the model. However, I foresee more use of this approach as a (very) strong prior on the model.\n\n2. In this paper, we did the machine learning and optimization process as vanilla as possible. Exploration is very likely a problem for some applications, but this could be resolved in obvious ways if it were a problem for a specific application. Local optima are unlikely in deep neural networks, but again, if it were a problem, it could be dealt with by appropriate deep learning techniques. I want to stress that the goal of the paper was not to provide an in depth, thorough method dealing with all corner cases, but rather to explain that we see a different way in which deep learning could be combined with robotics.\n\n3. Speed and fidelity are all lower than standard simulation platforms, as is stated in the paper. On the other hand, it is differentiable.\n\n4. This is an excellent point. We think that the task is hard, but it is indeed surprising that we saw no convergence at all. We note that in Duan et al. ICML 2016 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06778), CMA-ES did not manage to solve all tasks either. Indeed, it seems that the many parameters are not the only issue at hand. We will look into why this is the case and correct our statement in the paper.\n\nWe do not know how other deep RL methods would compare in general. If we look at the results of Schulman et al. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02438v5.pdf) for the quadruped task, it seems that we require less iterations (500 instead of 1000) with less model-time (8s instead of 2000s). There are however so many differences, that we would draw no conclusions from this observation.\n\n5. This is indeed a question we hope to tackle in our next paper. We found comparing with other simulators not useful, as results would obviously differ. We rather hope to tackle this problem in a different way, as described in the paper. We hope that training our policies with parameter noise (in both hardware and policy) will make them robust against the errors caused by the simulator, and thus more readily transferable to real-world applications.\n\nGiven the questions, I would like to stress that we do not want to claim that we have a new or even a good way to use policies, or to outperform other approaches in robotics. The claim we would like to make, is that the physics engines used in robotics rely on 'nearly'-linear equations, and are therefore differentiable in closed form, and that this closed form can be evaluated quickly. We claim that current day AD libraries are powerful enough to remove the laborious task of differentiation by hand, as was common in the time of adjoint optimization. We claim that this is a new approach to deep learning in robotics, one which deserves more attention. We tried to illustrate this claim by training a vanilla policy network in a vanilla way, and showing how this conceptually simple approach already optimizes fast. Therefore, we ended the paper with a list of the possible use cases we see."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Differentiable Physics Engine for Deep Learning in Robotics", "abstract": "One of the most important fields in robotics is the optimization of controllers.
