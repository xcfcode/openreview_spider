The authors describe their setup for physical experiments with a drone, and compare three neural network architectures for trail navigation on the IDSIA dataset. Experiments in a simulator are also reported.\n\n\nGood aspects of the paper:\n\nThe pairing of simulation with trail navigation is an interesting idea, though it is not explored much in this paper.\n\n\nBad aspects of the paper:\n\nAlthough the presence of physical experiments is suggested by pages 3 and 4, there are no physical experiments actually reported in the paper. In Section 5, this is revealed to be due to a hardware bug. The authors should not include these descriptions if they are not tied to reported experiments.\n\nOne of the main contributions of the paper is stated to be the comparison between neural network architectures. The two architectures compared to the TrailNet model from Smolyanskiy et al. are selected for their performance on the ImageNet classification task, and are shown to outperform TrailNet on salient metrics. However, comparing only three architectures is a very small comparison, and is not much of a contribution to the research problem.\n\nThis paper does not introduce new methods for approaching the problem of trail navigation. In its current form, it is a small comparison of existing classification architectures on the IDSIA dataset.\n\nThe paper also contains a number of minor errors. For instance, in Table 2 there is a footnote that leads nowhere, \u201cintroduced in Sif\u201d is cited incorrectly, \u201cin recent times jet (2014)\u201d is cited incorrectly, and the figures are grainy (this isn\u2019t really an error, but do try to make figures crisp in the future, e.g. with pdf images).", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1566/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A CASE STUDY ON OPTIMAL DEEP LEARNING MODEL FOR UAVS", "abstract": "Over the passage of time Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (UAVs), especially\nAutonomous flying drones grabbed a lot of attention in Artificial Intelligence.\nSince electronic technology is getting smaller, cheaper and more efficient, huge\nadvancement in the study of UAVs has been observed recently.

It is also great that the authors have included an explicit enumeration of all the dimensions relevant for their analysis (which are sometimes neglected), namely, computational cost, power consumption, inference time and robustness, apart from accuracy. \n\nHowever, I think the paper is not very well polished: there are quite a lot of grammatical, typing and aesthetic errors. Furthermore, the analysis performed is an A+B approach from previous works (Giusti et al.2016, and Smolyanskiy et al, 2017) and, thus, it is hard to find the novelty here, since similar comparisons have been already performed. Therefore, the paper needs major improvements in terms of clarity regarding the motivations in the introduction.\n\nAlso, one third of the paper is devoted to the software and hardware architecture used in the study, which I think it would be better fitted in an appendix section as it is of no added scientific value.

The forward facing image is associated with a label \u201cgo straight\u201d, whereas the two side images are associated with labels for \u201cgo left\u201d and \u201cgo right\u201d. Giusti then trained a convolutional neural network to predict these labels and used the network to guide a \"quadrotor micro aerial vehicle\u201d. \n\nSmolyanskiy improves on Giusti\u2019s work by (1) gathering additional trail image data using three cameras mounted to face forward but with lateral offsets and (2) using this additional data to train a 6 output neural network (\u201cTrailnet\u201d) which predicts both view orientation and lateral offset. In addition, they also combined predicted pose relative to the trail with predictions of localized objects and a depth map for potential obstacles. They compared several neural network architectures for predicting the view angle on the IDSIA data as well as the closed-loop performance of each network in avoiding collisions while operating within a UAV on a previously unseen trail. Though Trailnet did not achieve the highest accuracy (84% vs. the max 92% achieved by ResNet-18), it was the only network that achieved 100% collision avoidance on their UAV test course. \n\nThis paper, \"A CASE STUDY ON OPTIMAL DEEP LEARNING MODEL FOR UAVS\u201d, attempts to evaluate two potentially better convolutional neural networks for UAV trail guidance. They fine tune pertained Inception-Resnet and MobileNet models to predict the IDSIA dataset. These then both achieve better accuracy on the IDSIA test set and were analyzed for inference time and power consumption. These two models are then run through a single simulated path, where both seem to perform adequately across 2 turns in the path. \n\nThis paper has a variety of essential flaws.\n\n1. A large portion of the text is devoted to their hardware and UAV control but they were not able to actually run models on a physical UAV \"due to a hardware bug we were facing with the FCU\u201d. \n2. The paper claims to \"introduce to the best of our knowledge, a very first comparative study of three algorithms in order to find a better motion control of a drone for detecting a trail\u201d. This is a confusing claim since a comparison of neural network architectures is a central part of the evaluation in the Smolyanskiy paper. \n3. The higher accuracy on view orientation does not seem relevant since it was also achieved by Smolyanskiy et al. with networks that they then showed performed worse when combined with object detection, obstacle depth inference and combined controller.\n4.

In our study, we have shown that MobileNet has\nproduced better results with very less computational requirement and power consumption.\nWe have also reported the challenges we have faced during our work\nas well as a brief discussion on our future work to improve safety features and\nperformance.", "keywords": ["Energy Efficiency", "Autonomous Flying", "Trail Detection"], "authorids": ["chandan@iastate.edu", "svaddi@iastate.edu", "asarkar1@iastate.edu"], "authors": ["Chandan Kumar", "Subrahmanyam Vaddi", "Aishwarya Sarkar"], "TL;DR": "case study on optimal deep learning model for UAVs", "pdf": "/pdf/4bd81f6bd9cccfb76f9015e4c9c9127300dacacc.pdf", "paperhash": "kumar|a_case_study_on_optimal_deep_learning_model_for_uavs", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkumar2019a,\ntitle={A {CASE} {STUDY} {ON} {OPTIMAL} {DEEP} {LEARNING} {MODEL} {FOR} {UAVS}},\nauthor={Chandan Kumar and Subrahmanyam Vaddi and Aishwarya Sarkar},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syx9rnRcYm},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1566/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234202304, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "Syx9rnRcYm", "replyto": "Syx9rnRcYm", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1566/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335974071, "tmdate": 1552335974071, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1566/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 5}
