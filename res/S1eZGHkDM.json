The reverse KL is estimated by GAN-based density-ratio estimation. Furthermore a generalisation of reverse KL that emphasises the entropy term is proposed. Experiments considered fitting the target distribution with two different set-ups: one with target distribution's samples only, and the other with tractable unnormalised density.\n\nThe paper is clearly written and easy to follow.\n\nAlthough the experimental results look promising, I feel like the proposed approach is a straightforward combination of existing approaches:\n\n1. GAN-based density ratio estimation is not new and the authors admit it. Probably the new part is the suggestion of extra entropy term (and its corresponding lower-bound), although I don't think it is a significant contribution.\n\n2. Amortising dynamics is also not new and the authors also admit it. The new part is to replace the divergence that is used for matching to reverse KL (originally amortised SVGD uses L2, and amortised MCMC uses Jensen-shannon with GAN-based estimation), although again I wouldn't say it's highly novel.\n\nHowever, the observation that amortised SVGD with L2 loss fails is interesting.\n\n In summary, I think the paper lacks significant novelty. Given that I don't understand the bar of acceptance for ICLR workshop, I will recommend for weak rejection, but I won't be offended if the abstract is accepted.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Sample with Adversarially Learned Likelihood-Ratio", "abstract": "We link the reverse KL divergence with adversarial learning.
