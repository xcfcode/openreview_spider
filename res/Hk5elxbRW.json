The proposed approach seems to be of interest and to produce interesting results. As datasets in various domain get more and more precise, the problem of class confusing with very similar classes both present or absent of the training dataset is an important problem, and this paper is a promising contribution to handle those issues better.\n\nThe paper proposes to use a top-k loss such as what has been explored with SVMs in the past, but with deep models. As the loss is not smooth and has sparse gradients, the paper suggests to use a smoothed version where maximums are replaced by log-sum-exps.\n\nI have two main concerns with the presentation.\n\nA/ In addition to the main contribution, the paper devotes a significant amount of space to explaining how to compute the smoothed loss. This can be done by evaluating elementary symmetric polynomials at well-chosen values.\n\nThe paper argues that classical methods for such evaluations (e.g., using the usual recurrence relation or more advanced methods that compensate for numerical errors) are not enough when using single precision floating point arithmetic. The paper also advances that GPU parallelization must be used to be able to efficiently train the network.\n\nThose claims are not substantiated, however, and the method proposed by the paper seems to add substantial complexity without really proving that it is useful.\n\nThe paper proposes a divide-and-conquer approach, where a small amount of parallelization can be achieved within the computation of a single elementary symmetric polynomial value. I am not sure why this is of interest - can't the loss evaluation already be parallelized trivially over examples in a training/testing minibatch? I believe the paper could justify this approach better by providing a bit more insights as to why it is required. For instance:\n\n- What accuracies and train/test times do you get using standard methods for the evaluation of elementary symmetric polynomials?\n- How do those compare with CE and L_{5, 1} with the proposed method?\n- Are numerical instabilities making this completely unfeasible? This would be especially interesting to understand if this explodes in practice, or if evaluations are just a slightly inaccurate without much accuracy loss.\n\n\nB/ No mention is made of the object detection problem, although multiple of the motivating examples in Figure 1 consider cases that would fall naturally into the object detection framework. Although top-k classification considers in principle an easier problem (no localization), a discussion, as well as a comparison of top-k classification vs., e.g., discarding localization information out of object detection methods, could be interesting.\n\nAdditional comments:\n\n- Figure 2b: this visualization is confusing. This is presented in the same figure and paragraph as the CIFAR results, but instead uses a single synthetic data point in dimension 5, and k=1. This is not convincing. An actual experiment using full dataset or minibatch gradients on CIFAR and the same k value would be more interesting.\n\n", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Smooth Loss Functions for Deep Top-k Classification", "abstract": "The top-$k$ error is a common measure of performance in machine learning and computer vision.

We answer each of the reviewer\u2019s concerns:\n\n\nA/ \nThe reviewer rightly points out the two key aspects in the design of an efficient algorithm in our case: (i) numerical stability and (ii) speed. We have implemented the alternative Summation Algorithm (SA), and we have added a new section in the appendix to compare it to our method, on numerical stability and speed. On both aspects, experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the Divide and Conquer (DC) algorithm over SA in our use case.\n\nHere are some highlights of the discussion:\n(i) We emphasize the distinction between numerical accuracy and stability. To a large extent, high levels of accuracy are not needed for the training of neural network, as long as the directions of gradients are unaffected by the errors. Stability is crucial however, especially in our case where the evaluation of the elementary symmetric polynomials is prone to overflow. When the loss function overflows during training, the weights of the neural network diverge and any learning becomes impossible. \nWe discuss the stability of our method in Appendix D.2. In summary, the summation algorithm starts to overflow for tau <= 0.1 in single precision and 0.01 in double precision. It is worth noting that compensation algorithms are unlikely to help avoid such overflows (they would only improve accuracy in the absence of overflow). Our algorithm, which operates in log-space, is stable for any reasonable value of tau (it starts to overflow in single-float precision for tau lower than 1e-36).\n\n(ii) The reviewer is correct that the computation of the loss can be trivially parallelized over the samples of a minibatch, and this is exploited in our implementation. However we can push the parallelization further within the DC algorithm for each sample of a minibatch. Indeed, inside each recursion of the Divide-and-Conquer (DC) algorithm, all polynomial multiplications are performed in parallel, and there are only O(log(C)) levels of recursion. On the other hand, most of the operations of the summation algorithm are essentially sequential (see Appendix D.1) and do not benefit from the available parallelization capabilities of GPUs. We illustrate this with numerical timing of the loss evaluation on GPU, with a batch size of 256, k=5 and a varying number of classes C:\n\n             \t        C=100\tC=1,000    C=10,000     C=100,000\nSummation\t0.006\t0.062\t  0.627\t       6.258\nDC\t                0.011 \t0.018\t  0.024\t       0.146\n\nThis shows that in practice, parallelization of DC offers near logarithmic rather than linear scaling of C, as long as the computations are not saturating the device capabilities. \n\nB/ We believe that the differences between top-k classification and detection make it difficult to perform a fair comparison between the two methods. In particular, detection methods require significantly more annotation (label and set of bounding boxes per instance to detect) than top-k classification (single image-level label). Furthermore, detection models are most often pre-trained on classification and then fine-tuned on detection, which entangles the influence of both learning tasks on the resulting model.\n\nAdditional comments: We thank the reviewer for this useful suggestion. We have changed Figure 2.b) to visualize the sparsity of the derivatives on real data.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Smooth Loss Functions for Deep Top-k Classification", "abstract": "The top-$k$ error is a common measure of performance in machine learning and computer vision.
