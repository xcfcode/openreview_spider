However, they seem to be unaware of several developments in the field, where mixtures of Gaussian processes are postulated, so as to allow for capturing long tails in the data distribution; for instance:\n\nEmmanouil A. Platanios and Sotirios P. Chatzis, \u201cGaussian Process-Mixture Conditional Heteroscedasticity,\u201d IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 36, no. 5, pp. 888-900, May 2014.\n\nHence, the provided experimental comparisons are essentially performed against non-rivals of the method. It is more than easy to understand that a method not designed for modeling observations with the specific characteristics of financial data should definitely perform worse than a method designed to cope with such artifacts. That is why the sole purpose of a (convincing) experimental evaluation regime should be to compare between methods that are designed with the same data properties in mind. The paper does not satisfy this requirement.\n\nTurning to the method itself, the derivations are clear and straightforward; the method could have been motivated a somewhat better, though.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Autoregressive Convolutional Neural Networks for Asynchronous Time Series", "abstract": "We propose Significance-Offset Convolutional Neural Network, a deep convolutional network architecture for regression of multivariate asynchronous time series.

A data augmentation technique for asynchronous time series data.\n2. A convolutional 'Significance' weighting neural network that assigns normalised weights to the outputs of a fully-connected autoregressive 'Offset' neural network, such that the output is a weighted average of the 'Offset' neural net.\n3. An 'auxiliary' loss function.\n\nThe experiments showed that:\n1. The proposed method beat VAR/CNN/ResNet/LSTM 2 synthetic asynchronous data sets, 1 real electricity meter data set and 1 real financial bid/ask data set. It's not immediately clear how hyper-parameters for the benchmark models were chosen.\n2. The author observed from the experiments that the depth of the offset network has negligible effect, and concluded that the 'Significance' network has crucial impact. (I don't see how this conclusion can be made.)\n3. The proposed auxiliary loss is not useful.\n4. The proposed architecture is more robust to noise in the synthetic data set compared to the benchmarks, and together with LSTM, are least prone to overfitting.\n\nPros\n- Proposed a useful way of augmenting asynchronous multivariate time series for fitting autoregressive models\n- The convolutional Significance/weighting networks appears to reduce test errors (not entirely clear)\n\nCons\n- The novelties aren't very well-justified. The 'Significance' network was described as critical to the performance, but there is no experimental result to show the sensitivity of the model's performance with respect to the architecture of the 'Significance' network. At the very least, I'd like to see what happens if the weighting was forced to be uniform while keeping the 'Offset' network and loss unchanged.\n- It's entirely unclear how the train and test data was split. This may be quite important in the case of the financial data set.\n- It's also unclear if model training was done on a rolling basis, which is common for time series forecasting.\n- The auxiliary loss function does not appear to be very helpful, but was described as a key component in the paper.\n\nQuality: The quality of the paper was okay. More details of the experiments should be included in the main text to help interpret the significance of the experimental results. The experiment also did not really probe the significance of the 'Significance' network even though it's claimed to be important.\nClarity: Above average. \nOriginality: Mediocre.
