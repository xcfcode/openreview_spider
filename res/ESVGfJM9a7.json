Our paper\u2019s main goal is to fill the gap of spatial modeling and establish a neural point process framework for spatiotemporal forecasting. The temporal component can be any marked TPP model\u2019s intensity function. Our paper\u2019s another novelty is the accurate simulation of an arbitrary spatiotemporal point process (see Appendix B.2), which is highly non-trivial [Reinhart et al, 2018]. As far as we know, among all spatiotemporal point processes, only the spatiotemporal Hawkes process has well-developed simulation methods [Ogata 1998, Zhuang 2004]. We described a general way of simulating an STPP given its spatiotemporal intensity function, even when its temporal intensity function has no closed-form. In addition, we designed STSCP featuring self-inhibition and demonstrated the method\u2019s validity on simulating an STSCP.  This will serve as a validation tool for the community to evaluate the correctness of various neural models.\n\n\n__The KDE method has a major drawback that the current spatial pdf does not depend on the current time. This is counter-intuitive.__\n \nThank you for pointing this out. In fact, the KDE method is compatible with any conditioned spatial pdf. The weight of the kernels can have the current time as a part of the input.   We have conducted additional experiments to include the current time into the spatial PDF as described in Sections 4.3.  We added the results for this  and 5.3. However, we found the performance to be worse. The error in the next event timing prediction would accumulate to the error in spatial prediction. While adding current time to spatial PDF makes the model more expressive, the prediction accuracy deteriorates. \n\n__The author stated \u201ctime-conditioned spatial density function\u201d. This is not accurate as it is not conditioned on current time as mentioned above.__\n\nOur spatial PDF was designed to be conditioned on the past time. We have also experimented with ``conditioning on current time\u2019\u2019 but did not see performance improvement (see Section 4.3 and 5.3 for details). \n \n__Why fix the covariance to be identity? Why fix $w^t$ and $w^b$ to be 0.1? Why are only 1 or 2 baseline models considered in Table 1 and 2?__\n \nThis is a typo and we have fixed it; those variables are not hyperparameters but trainable parameters. Covariance is initialized to be identity and $w^t$ and $w^b$ are initialized to 0.1.\n \n__The example in the end of sec.3.1 is not appropriate.__\n\nWe have rephrased the example in Sec 3.1.\n\n__The kernel for KDE is chosen to be Gaussian kernel, so how to choose the hyperparameters?__\n\nThe covariance matrix of the Gaussian kernel are also not hyperparameters but trainable parameters. \n\n __Why are only 1 or 2 baseline models considered in Table 1 and 2? What is the performance of other baselines?__\n\nThere are very few models that can learn the spatiotemporal intensity. Most neural TPP models only learn the temporal intensity. To the best of our knowledge, the spatiotemporal Hawkes process MLE learner is the only candidate.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper980/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper980/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Point Process for Forecasting Spatiotemporal Events", "authorids": ["~Zihao_Zhou1", "~Xingyi_Yang1", "~Xinyi_He1", "~Ryan_Rossi1", "~Handong_Zhao3", "~Rose_Yu1"], "authors": ["Zihao Zhou", "Xingyi Yang", "Xinyi He", "Ryan Rossi", "Handong Zhao", "Rose Yu"], "keywords": ["spatiotemporal point process", "deep sequence models", "time series"], "abstract": "Forecasting events occurring in space and time is a fundamental problem.

We revised our paper and included several alternative model designs and results that we have considered in Appendix D. Our design ensures a closed-form marginal intensity by summating outside the exp, such that the integration sum rule works. In contrast, moving $s$ into the power makes the marginal intensity $\\lambda(t)$ intractable. When $s$ is inside exp, either learning or inference requires at least triple numerical integration, which is computationally prohibitive.\n \n__Reasons to favor the proposed design is missing in the current paper.__\n \nThank you for the suggestion. In the revised paper, we have added more alternative designs and presented both theoretical explanations and experiment results in Appendix D to support our choice of the current design.\n \n__The regularization for $w$ is a little hacky.

We did not use an event-type marker to handle location. The event-type marker is discrete.  We predict the continuous location, not discrete location.  Our framework deals with continuous space and time, not categorical features such as event-type marker.\n\n__How could multiple types of events be handled in this framework?__\n \nOur framework can be easily extended to make use of event-type markers by including the embedding of the event-type markers as part of the RNN input. This allows sharing of hidden states for multiple types of events, which can deal with sparsity of events of different types.

However, our main goal is not a new temporal component but to fill the gap of spatial modeling,  hence establishing a neural point process framework for spatiotemporal forecasting. \n \nAnother concern from R1 and R3 was there is still space for improvement of the model\u2019s expressibility. However, our model design was not made \u201chastily\u201d.

It points out the drawback of most existing DNN-based point process models: incapability to incorporate the spatio information. Although in statistics, the spatiotemporal point process is capable of capturing events in continuous space and time, such methods are computation expensive. The theoretical analysis is provided, and experimental comparisons are conducted on synthetic and real data. \n\nStrengths: The model setup is reasonable, and the paper writing is easy to follow. The work successfully includes the space information into the DNN-based point process model with a KDE method. \n\nBut I recommend rejection of the paper for the reasons below.\n\nWeakness: The major concern is the contribution of the work is not significant enough for publishing on ICLR, because most of the work (in fact, almost all the work on the temporal part) is same as the work \u201cRecurrent marked temporal point processes: Embedding event history to vector. KDD, 2016.\u201d as cited by the submission, e.g. the conditional intensity in Eq.(5). The improvement of the model on spatial information is implemented by introducing a KDE method to learn the spatial pdf. The KDE method has a major drawback that the current spatial pdf does not depend on the current time (eq.(3)) which is counter-intuitive, as in most cases it is natural to decide when it happens first and then locate where it happens, just as the definition of \\lambda_(s, t) = f_(s|t)*\\lambda__(t) in the submission. \n\nSome specific concerns: in abstract, the author stated \u201ctime-conditioned spatial density function\u201d. This is not accurate as it is not conditioned on current time as mentioned above.\nThe example in the end of sec.3.1 is not appropriate. Because the earthquake observation in the example only contains time and magnitude (no location information), of course it has no advantage over RNN for location prediction. \nThe kernel for KDE is chosen to be Gaussian kernel, so how to choose the hyperparameters, e.g. \\Sigma, for the kernel function? I only saw it is fixed to identity matrix in the experiments, so why choose identity? Any validation experiments?\nIn sec.4.2, why use the \u2018max\u2019 regularizer to avoid w_j>>w_k? why not use the L2 regularizer? is the max regularizer better than L2? why set the hyperparameter \\gamma to 1e-4 in experiments? Any validation experiments?\nIn experiments, why fix w^t and b to 0.1, respectively? If my understanding is right, these two parameters should be learned in the training process. \nIn experiments, why are only 1 or 2 baseline models considered in Table 1 and 2? What is the performance of other baselines?\nIn experiments, what is the definition of joint RMSE? \n\n\nTypo: in \u201cRelationship to TPP\u201d, f^*(s|t)=f(s|t,H_t)\nIn Eq.(5), h_{i-1}-->h_{i}    H_{t_{i-1}}-->H_{t_{i}}   \nIn eq.(7), E[t_i|H_t_{i-1}]-->E[t_{i+1}|H_t_i]     E[s_i|H_t_{i-1}]-->E[s_{i+1}| H_t_i]\nSec.4.2, S={s_i-j,t_i-j}_{j=1}^L-->S={s_i,t_i}_{i=1}^N  the RNN input is J but the whole observation is N.\nIn \u201cBaselines\u201d, ofspatiotem --> of spatiotemporal ", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper980/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper980/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Point Process for Forecasting Spatiotemporal Events", "authorids": ["~Zihao_Zhou1", "~Xingyi_Yang1", "~Xinyi_He1", "~Ryan_Rossi1", "~Handong_Zhao3", "~Rose_Yu1"], "authors": ["Zihao Zhou", "Xingyi Yang", "Xinyi He", "Ryan Rossi", "Handong Zhao", "Rose Yu"], "keywords": ["spatiotemporal point process", "deep sequence models", "time series"], "abstract": "Forecasting events occurring in space and time is a fundamental problem.

The temporal component uses the parametrization of Du et al 2016 and the spatial component uses a kernel density function. \n\nPros: \n\nThe model design is reasonable and it performs well on multiple synthetic and real datasets, compared against several appropriate baseline models. \n\nThe paper presentation is fairly clear, with thoroughly documented appendices. \n\nCons: \n\nIt is a lack of novelty. Precisely, I don\u2019t mean the model is not novel at all; it is indeed new. But its novelty and significance is not enough. \n\nThe key design is to factor $\\lambda(s, t)$ as $f(s|t) \\lambda(t)$, but this design is really not well-motivated. In general, coupling $s$ and $t$ inside $\\lambda$ would definitely increase the model expressiveness and, for a neural model, it often won\u2019t increase the number of parameters. E.g., one might simply move $s$ into the power of exp in eqn-5 (and possibly allow $t$ and $s$ to interact with each other by feeding $h$ and $s$ through a neural net)---why and in what sense is the proposed factorization better than (say) this simple one? \n\nI am sure there must be reasons to favor the proposed design, but they need to be carefully thought through and clearly presented---that is missing in the current paper. \n\nThe regularization for $w$ (suppressing the largest past $w$) is a little hacky: if one would like to balance between past and background points, considering their weights sum to 1, the most straightforward way would be to smooth the $w$ distribution, namely aggregating past $w$ and background $w$ and then increasing the entropy of the resulting binary distribution.  \n\nThere are things the authors need to clarify: \n(1) citations for spatiotemporal Hawkes and self-correcting processes; \n(2) $\\lambda$ of eqn-5 is inherited from Du et al 2016 and the authors didn\u2019t mention it. \n\nIt is a little too bold to claim as \"the first neural point process model that can jointly predict both the space and time of events\": many past models can, they are just not great (e.g., they may need discretization). So I suggest the authors revise their claim: if they\u2019d like to be a little more specific (e.g., continuous space), then their claim might be more convincing. \n\nQuestions: \n\nThe list of baseline models has Mei & Eisner 2017 but I didn\u2019t find this model in any presented table or figure. Is this a typo or is it missing? (The authors are not obligated to compare to every single published model but they should keep the paper consistent.)\n\nHow could multiple types of events be handled in this framework? The authors use the parametrization of Du et al where they use Du\u2019s event-type-marker to handle the event-location---this is a pity: the authors propose a new model to handle some new features, but lose the capacity of handling old features. How could they do both? E.g., in the Taxi data, in principle, one might want to model (time, location, pickup/dropoff), but the current model only handles (time, location). \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper980/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper980/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Point Process for Forecasting Spatiotemporal Events", "authorids": ["~Zihao_Zhou1", "~Xingyi_Yang1", "~Xinyi_He1", "~Ryan_Rossi1", "~Handong_Zhao3", "~Rose_Yu1"], "authors": ["Zihao Zhou", "Xingyi Yang", "Xinyi He", "Ryan Rossi", "Handong Zhao", "Rose Yu"], "keywords": ["spatiotemporal point process", "deep sequence models", "time series"], "abstract": "Forecasting events occurring in space and time is a fundamental problem.

They perform experiments on synthetic data generated by famous point processes such as Hawkes process. \n\n### Strong/Weak points\n- The paper is well-written (with a few exceptions)\n- It is very easy to read and understand\n- The model is very easy to understand, but very hard to reason about and to give guarantees\n- It is only tested on synthetic data and no real-world example is tested upon\n\nI have a tendency to reject this paper, as the idea is straightforward: if one is asked to mix RNNs with spatial data, the way to combine these two is very clear. There is nothing new about the theory of point processes either, hence, no new understanding of these types of processes is provided.
