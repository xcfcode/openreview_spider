This is essentially a slightly better training scheme than the method proposed by Mikolov et al. 2010.\n* The fair comparison against Mikolov et al. 2010 is only shown in Table 1, where a perplexity of 78.6 turns to a perplexity of 73.5. This is a decent gain, but the great majority of this is achieved by switching the optimizer from SGD to an adaptive method, which as of 2018 is a somewhat limited contribution. The remainder of the tables in the paper do not compare with the method of Mikolov et al.\n* The paper title, abstract, and introduction do not mention previous work, and may give the false impression that this is the first paper to propose dynamic evaluation for neural sequence models, significantly overclaiming the paper's contribution and potentially misleading readers.\n\nAs a result, while I think that dynamic evaluation itself is useful, given the limited novelty of the proposed method and the lack of comparison to the real baseline (the simpler strategy of Mikolov et al.) in the majority of the experiments, I think this papers till falls short of the quality bar of ICLR.\n\nAlso, independent of this decision, a final note about perplexity as an evaluation measure to elaborate on the comments of reviewer 1. In general, perplexity is an evaluation measure that is useful for comparing language models of the same model class, but tends to not correlate well with model performance (e.g. ASR accuracy) across very different types of models. For example, see \"Evaluation Metrics for Language Models\" by Chen et al. 1998. The method of dynamic evaluation is similar to the cache-based language models that existed in 1998 in that it reinforces the model to choose similar vocabulary to that it's seen before. As you can see from this paper that the quality of perplexity of an evaluation measure falls when cache-based models are thrown into the mix, and one reason for this is that cache models, while helping perplexity greatly, tend to reinforce previous errors when errors do occur."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dynamic Evaluation of Neural Sequence Models", "abstract": "We present methodology for using dynamic evaluation to improve neural sequence models.

The method is applied to word level and character level language modeling where it yields some gains in perplexity. The algorithm also appears able to perform domain adaptation, in a setting where a character-level language model trained mostly on English manages to quickly adapt to a Spanish test set. \n\nWhile the general idea is not novel, the implementation choices matter, and the authors provide one which appears to work well with recently proposed models. The character level experiments on the multiplicative LSTM make the most convincing point, providing a significant improvement over already good results on medium size data sets. Figure 2 also makes a strong case for the method's suitability for applications where domain adaptation is important.\n\nThe paper's weakest part is the word level language modeling section. Given the small size of the data sets considered, the results provided are of limited use, especially since the development set is used to fit the RMSprop hyper-parameters. How sensitive are the final results to this choice? Comparing dynamic evaluation to neural cache models is a good idea, given how both depend en medium-term history: (Grave et al. 2017) provide results on the larger text8 and wiki103, it would be useful to see results for dynamic evaluation at least on the former.\n\nAn indication of the actual additional evaluation time for word-level, char-level and sparse char-level dynamic evaluation would also be welcome.\n\nPros:\n- Good new implementation of an existing idea\n- Significant perplexity gains on character level language modeling\n- Good at domain adaptation\n\nCons:\n- Memory requirements of the method\n- Word-level language modeling experiments need to be run on larger data sets\n\n(Edit: the authors did respond satisfactorily to the original concern about the size of the word-level data set)", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Dynamic Evaluation of Neural Sequence Models", "abstract": "We present methodology for using dynamic evaluation to improve neural sequence models.

Dynamic evaluation in general does relate to fast weights (and could even be considered a type of fast weights, although it differs from traditional fast weights in the update mechanism), and the global prior we use is similar to the decay sometimes used in fast weights. We added a paragraph about this in the related work section, and updated the paper to mention the relationship with the decay rule of fast weights when we introduce the global prior. \n\nWe did provide some experiments exploring how much the global prior helps in the submitted version of the paper in table 1; a simple L2 global prior helps slightly, and scaling decay rates by RMS gradient values helps a bit more. \n\n\u201cThe sparse update idea feels very much an afterthought and so do the experiments with Spanish.\u201d\n\nWe included the sparse update idea to address the high memory cost of dynamic evaluation when mini-batching.

As pointed out by AnonReviewer2 in the comments of this review, the results in this paper are quite strong, and language modelling is very sensible for evaluating new techniques. This reviewer also claims that the paper is not well-written, but provides very little evidence to support this.  Overall, this reviewer has no valid scientific criticisms of the paper.\n \n\"the paper also shows (marginal) improvement from a conventional method (neural cache RNNLM)\"\n\nOur results on WikiText-2, where we demonstrate a 7.7 perplexity point improvement over the previous state-of-the-art, would be considered far more than a \"marginal\" improvement by almost any standard. For instance, we report much larger perplexity gains on WikiText-2 as compared with contemporary ICLR submissions such as [1,2,3], which all use similar baselines to our experiments. Our improvements to character-level language modelling were also far more than \"marginal\".\n\n\"Some variables are not explicitly introduced when they are appeared including i, n, g, and l\"\n\n g and l are not variables, they are subscripts used to denote \"global\" and \"local\".  If the reviewer thought g and l were variables, we can understand why the reviewer may have been confused by our explanations of our method. However, we did explicitly introduce all variables that use g and l subscripts, so this really should have been clear to the reviewer.\n\nThe reviewer also mentions a few minor variables that are not \u201cexplicitly introduced\u201d, however every one of these variables is defined implicitly in sequence/set notation. \n\n\" n is already used in Section 2 as a number of sequences.\"\n\nTo avoid confusion, we replaced n in section 2 with M, since we also use M in section 3 as the number of sequences in a slightly different context.\n\n\u201cAbstract: it is difficult to guess the characteristics of the proposed method only with a term \u201cdynamic evaluation\u201d. It\u2019s better to explain it in more detail in the abstract.\u201d\n\n Our use of the term dynamic evaluation was described in the second sentence of the abstract. We elected not to describe the specific engineering details of our dynamic evaluation method because this is beyond the scope of the abstract.\n\n\"It\u2019s better to provide relative performance (comparison) of the numbers (perplexity and bits/char) from conventional methods.\" \n\nWe elected not to provide relative performance comparisons, because the \"deltas\" to perplexity and bits/character are almost meaningless without knowledge of how strong the baseline numbers are. Providing the static evaluation numbers alongside the dynamic evaluation numbers would also be unreasonable as it is too many results for an abstract. Providing the overall results with dynamic evaluation is the most concise way to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially since all of these results improve the state-of-the-art.\n\n\"Why does the paper only provide examples for SGD and RMSprop? Can we apply it to other optimization methods including Adam and Adadelta?\"\n\nThe goal of these experiments is to demonstrate the utility of the proposed modifications of dynamic evaluation as compared to past approaches (which used SGD). There are an infinite number of dynamic evaluation approaches, we don't claim anywhere that ours is the best possible-- just that all of our suggested modifications improve on past approaches.\n\nAs for the two approaches suggested by the reviewer, ADAM or ADAM derived methods could be reasonable to use for dynamic evaluation, but were found not to work as well in preliminary experiments. Adadelta likely would not be sensible for dynamic evaluation, because the learning rates of Adadelta decrease over training.  If dynamic evaluation were applied with Adadelta, the rate of adaptation to recent history would decrease later in the test set, which would likely hurt performance. \n\n\"equation (9): is this new matrix introduced for every layer? Need some explanations.\"\n\nThe mLSTM we applied this to only used 1 recurrent layer, so this distinction was arbitrary in the context of our experiments. In a multilayer-RNN, the new matrix could be introduced for every layer or just 1 layer. We've added a sentence in the paper clarifying this point. \n\n\"It\u2019s better to provide the citation of Chainer. \" \n\nwe added this to the current version.\n\n\u201cAWD-LSTM: The paper should provide the full name of AWD-LSTM when it is first appeared.\u201d\n\nWe now provide the full name of AWD-LSTM at first appearance.\n\n[1] Memory-based Parameter Adaptation.

Dynamic evaluation improves the state-of-the-art word-level perplexities on the Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 datasets to 51.1 and 44.3 respectively, and the state-of-the-art character-level cross-entropies on the text8 and Hutter Prize datasets to 1.19 bits/char and 1.08 bits/char respectively.", "pdf": "/pdf/d7fbc5ec8944466faaf84922c0891472b15af107.pdf", "TL;DR": "Paper presents dynamic evaluation methodology for adaptive sequence modelling", "paperhash": "krause|dynamic_evaluation_of_neural_sequence_models", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkrause2018dynamic,\ntitle={Dynamic Evaluation of Neural Sequence Models},\nauthor={Ben Krause and Emmanuel Kahembwe and Iain Murray and Steve Renals},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkdU7tCaZ},\n}", "keywords": ["sequence modelling", "language", "recurrent neural networks", "adaptation"], "authors": ["Ben Krause", "Emmanuel Kahembwe", "Iain Murray", "Steve Renals"], "authorids": ["ben.krause@ed.ac.uk", "e.kahembwe@ed.ac.uk", "i.murray@ed.ac.uk", "s.renals@ed.ac.uk"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "duedate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "tmdate": 1516825739373, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper96/Official_Comment", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"replyto": null, "forum": "rkdU7tCaZ", "writers": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper96/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper96/Authors|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper96/Area_Chair|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper96/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper96/Authors|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper96/Area_Chair|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "value-dropdown": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper96/Authors_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper96/Reviewers_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper96/Area_Chairs_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 0, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper96/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper96/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper96/Area_Chair", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "cdate": 1516825739373}}}], "count": 9}
