See my comments below.\n\nI don\u2019t like this paper because it is full of buzzwords, and it is really poorly written. The author first started in the abstract on \u201chyper deep learners\u201d, which confuses me a lot. It is unclear to me what type of deep learning models that you are aiming for and what exactly \u201chyper deep learners\u201d are. Also, in the abstract, the authors mention Structured Dark Knowledge, but they have not discussed it in the introduction, which makes it extremely hard for the readers to understanding the relationship between this work and the so called \u201cStructured Dark Knowledge\u201d. \n\nThe 3.2 is also poorly written and insufficiently motivated. The term Structured Dark Knowledge sounds fancy, but I fail to see what the structures are. It sounds like the authors just propose \u201cTraining Subset\u201d as Structured Dark Knowledge, which is extremely misleading. This work gives people an impression that you are trying to leverage external knowledge for curriculum learning, it turns out it is not the case.\n\nIn section 4.1, the hyperparameters\u2019 setting seems to be mysterious. It is unclear to me how the authors come up with magic numbers like 0.04, 0.1, 15%. \n\nIn Figure 2, the improvements from SDK do not look like it is very impressive. And also 4.2 the datasets are too small. The metric in Table 4 is poorly chosen. I don\u2019t understand what the numbers mean un Table 4 and how significant they are. Please use standard metrics. \n\nThe future stock price regression experiments are also poorly presented. In Table 5, the authors do not explain what the price, percentage and error mean. It only says \u201cResults\u201d. Please pick common benchmark datasets and well-known metrics. \n\nOverall, this paper is poorly written, and it has not met the requirement of ICLR.\n\n\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1030/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Teaching to Teach by Structured Dark Knowledge", "abstract": "To educate hyper deep learners, \\emph{Curriculum Learnings} (CLs) require either human heuristic participation or self-deciding the difficulties of training instances.

The authors propose a very general framework called `teach to teach\u2019, in which 1) the knowledge is distilled via subset selection that matches the teacher decision distribution 2) the distilled knowledge is then transferred into the teacher model by reweighting the contributions of teacher objective and coherence constraints. Extensive experiments are conducted on image classification, unsupervised domain adaptation and sequence learning.\n \nQuestions: 1) Can the teacher models, like those in L2T, be successfully transferred? For example, the teacher model trained with task 1 (with prior knowledge 1) successfully applied to task 2?\n2) I\u2019m not that clear about the relationship with knowledge distillation (Hinton et. al 2015). Per my understanding, the authors seem to make the distribution of the knowledge (specified by the set prior function F) coherent with teacher model and let the both influence each other (in section 3.2). In that sense I do not know what is the `dark\u2019 knowledge here.\n \nPros: In general I think this paper is a decent work that the structural prior knowledge is elegantly combined with teaching strategy (a.k.a. the teacher models in curriculum learning). The proposed method is intuitive and natural. The empirical verifications are deep and comprehensive to demonstrate the effectiveness of the `teaching to teach\u2019 framework.\n \nCons: 1) I think the authors should compare with self-paced learning with diversity (SPLD) since you also take diversity as a form of structural knowledge.\n2) The writing needs to be significantly polished. First, please simply the writing both in terms of general logic and language. I spent quite a few efforts in figuring out the meaning of some notations and complicated terms such as `curriculum-routed\u2019 and `g_i\u2019. Furthermore, I see no reason of putting so much fancy decorations on an essentially iterative algorithm (the bottom part of page 5 and all page 6). Second,  I suggest the authors give more intuitive and concrete examples towards what is the structural prior knowledge at the earlier phase of the paper, rather than putting most of them into appendix.
