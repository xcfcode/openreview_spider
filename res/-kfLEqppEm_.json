In detail, the unique maximizing argument property, i.e. the policy maximizing the regularized objective, is still correct since $\\tau \\Omega$ is strongly convex.\n\nAbout the second issue, we clarify that the boundedness property is scaled with $\\tau$ and the contraction property is guaranteed as shown in Proposition 2 in (Geist et al., 2019). Note that $\\tau$ is simply a scaling factor that does not affect the property of contraction: for example, we can replace the original reward $r$ by $\\frac{r}{\\tau}$ and get the same formula of (Geist et al., 2019).\n\nWith respect to the additional remarks:\n\n\u201cFirst of all, it would be nice to have a brief summary of how the analysis works and what the main idea is.\u201d: Our analysis aims at deriving the regularized counterparts of the convergence and regret theorems of UCT. While the exponential convergence rate to the regularized objective is already provided in Xiao et al (2019) for the case of maximum entropy, we demonstrate that all convex regularizers, e.g. relative and Tsallis entropy, enjoy this property. Our regret theorem is an extension of the UCT regret bound, and we provide both the standard form for a generic convex regularizer (Theorem 3), and the specialized ones for the considered entropies (Corollaries 1, 2, 3). This allows us to prove that the regret bound of TENTS is tighter in problems with many actions, while the regret of RENTS is tighter than the one of MENTS if a good prior is provided (for the contribution of the component $\\frac{1}{m}$). Finally, since the regularized optimal value is different from the unregularized one, i.e. the one of UCT, we are interested in bounding the approximation error of these values. Like for the regret, Theorem 4 provides a bound for a generic convex regularizer, while Corollaries 4, 5, 6, specialize to each entropy regularizer. Again, Tsallis is beneficial in problems with many actions, while the prior of RENTS can make the bound tighter. We hope this clarifies the doubts of the reviewer. If not, we would be glad to be more helpful.\n\nEquation (6) corresponds indeed to the simulation phase, as stated in the paper. To be more clear, the selection phase does not involve the backup of value-functions, but only the exploration of the tree until an unvisited node is reached. On the other hand, the simulation results in a trajectory $s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, \\dots$ and in the update of the value of each node according to (6).    \n\nEquation (7) is composed of two parts: the first part $\\nabla \\Omega^* (\\frac{Q_\\Omega(s_t)}{\\tau})(a_t)$ is the regularized policy corresponding to the maximizing argument of the Legendre-Fenchel transform; the second part $\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{A}|}$ corresponds to uniform sampling of actions. The parameter $\\lambda$ trades-off exploitation of the regularized policy with uniform exploration, as done in E2W, and well-known $\\varepsilon$-greedy policy in RL. This is convenient, although not necessary, to provide additional exploration to the one already induced by the regularized policy, still maintaining the same theoretical guarantees.\n\nRegarding (10) and (11): Thanks for pointing out the missing reference. We added the reference (Lee et al., 2018) to these two equations.\n\nEquation (13): Thanks for pointing out this problem of notation. We fixed it in the revised paper.\n\nRegarding the experiments:\n\nWe hope that the empirical analysis of the toy problem added in the revised paper clarifies the doubts of the reviewer about the considered problems. These results show that UCT is still a valid choice for big trees, i.e. high branching factor and depth, being  the algorithm with the lowest regret, for k={12,16} and d={1, 4, 5}, and having faster convergence to the optimal value compared to RENTS and MENTS. Remarkably, our novel method TENTS seems to be the best choice, being almost always better, or at least comparable, to UCT.\n\nReferences:\n\n- Matthieu Geist,  Bruno Scherrer,  and Olivier Pietquin.

However, we provide the first study on the use of convex regularization in MCTS, which has only been studied, only for maximum entropy and mostly empirically, in MENTS (Xiao et al., 2019).\n\nTo answer specifically about the two mentioned papers:\n\n(Buesing et al., AISTATS 2020) use MCTS as a component of an approximate inference approach. The proposed MCTS algorithm uses the same policy value backups of MENTS, but since the paper focuses on approximate inference, MCTS is not analyzed. Nevertheless, the paper shows the usefulness of entropy regularized MCTS methods, therefore we are citing it in the introduction of the revised paper.\n\n(Grill et al., ICML 2020) show that tree search in Alphazero is an approximate solution to reversed KL regularization between the prior and current policy. The proposed tree search policy is a special case of the tree search policy in our work. However, (Grill et al., ICML 2020) use the same value backup operator of UCT, which differs from our convex regularized operators, and, contrary to our work, (Grill et al., ICML 2020) do not provide theoretical study of the convergence, regret, and approximation error. Nevertheless, we think this paper is related to ours, thus we are citing it in the related works of the revised paper.\n\nRegarding the results in Table 2, we confirm that we ran 100 random seeds for each method on each Atari benchmark task. The numbers in the table correspond to the mean cumulative reward over 100 random seeds. In each benchmark task, we performed a t-test over all the seeds with p=0.95 to compare each method to the method with the highest mean.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper633/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper633/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Convex Regularization in Monte-Carlo Tree Search", "authorids": ["~Tuan_Quang_Dam1", "~Carlo_D'Eramo2", "~Jan_Peters3", "~Joni_Pajarinen2"], "authors": ["Tuan Quang Dam", "Carlo D'Eramo", "Jan Peters", "Joni Pajarinen"], "keywords": ["Monte-Carlo Tree Search", "Entropy regularization", "Reinforcement Learning"], "abstract": "Monte-Carlo planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are essential to sequential decision making.

In the following, we seek to solve all the concerns:\n\n- P2: The number of actions is finite as MCTS generally works with a discrete, finite, action space. In the revised paper, we define the action space $\\mathcal{A}$ as a finite discrete action space.\n- P3, (2):  To define the Legendre-Fenchel transform, we adopt the notation in Geist et al. (2019). As defined $Q_s$ and $\\pi_s$ are respectively $Q(s,\\cdot)$ and $\\pi(\\cdot | s)$ , i.e. the $Q$-function and the policy for each action in state $s$. Therefore, the max operator is, for each state $s$, w.r.t. the policy maximizing the regularized objective.\n- P3 (4): we are not sure whether the reviewer refers to the contraction property in proposition 1. In that case, we remark that it is defined with respect to the $\\infty$-norm, as shown in (Geist et al., ICML 2019).\n- P4, (7): as noted by the reviewer, the parameter $\\lambda$ trades-off exploitation of the regularized policy with uniform exploration, as done in E2W, and  $\\varepsilon$-greedy in RL. Although not fundamental, as $\\lambda = 0$ would be still an effective choice, adding uniform exploration is convenient for speeding up performance. Moreover, note that $\\lambda \\to 0$ for infinite visitations to the considered node, therefore only the regularized policy is used in the limit.\n- P4, Theorem 1: The bound w.r.t. the true optimal value $|V_\\Omega -V^*|$ is analyzed in detail in section 4.2, for each entropy regularizer.\n- P4, Theorem 2: $a^*$ is indeed the optimal action for the regularized objective. We clarified this in the revised paper.\n- P4:. Thanks for pointing this out. TRPO indeed uses the reverse KL; however, we decided to use the more classical forward KL, as used previously e.g. in REPS (Peters et al, 2012). Nevertheless, we will consider the use of reverse KL for a future empirical study.\n- P5, Table 1: thank you for pointing this out. We added $\\tau$ in the revised paper.\n- P5: we apologise for the lack of clarity of the regret paragraph. We improved the presentation in the revised paper.\n- P5, Theorem 3: Thank you for spotting this typo. We fixed it in the revised paper.\n- P7, figure 1: It is PUCT, but we decided to keep UCT for simplicity. We agree that the reported sentence was too strong, we modified it in the revised paper.\n- P9: As specified in the beginning of Section B in the appendix, and as also studied in the original UCT paper (Kocsis et al, 2006), the reward distribution at the leaf node is $\u03c3^2$-subgaussian, which is the only assumption we used.\n- P10: we are not sure about the issue identified by the reviewer. In Appendix B, we define that $\\hat{r}$ and $r$ are respectively the average and the expected reward at the leaf node. Sum over $k$ here is with respect to the time step $k$. Regarding the term $\\exp(\\frac{-t}{\\log(2+\\dots)^3})$, it is actually upper bounded by $4|\\mathcal{A}| \\exp(\\frac{-t}{\\log(2+\\dots)^3})$.

In this problem, we can tune the branching factor and the depth of a tree, and this allows us to assess how the performance of each regularizer are affected by the size of the tree. We observe that, as expected from our theoretical findings, TENTS is robust w.r.t. increasing branching factor, i.e. number of actions, having the fastest convergence rate to the regularizer optimal value. The error w.r.t. the unregularized optimal value is the smallest among the regularizer, as shown in Section 4.2, and the regret is generally not high as the one of RENTS and MENTS, as proven in Section 4.1. Overall, although we think that the superiority of each regularizer depends on the problem at hand (in Cartpole and Acrobot RENTS seems to be a, slightly more, valid choice), this toy experiment, together with the Atari one, provides further evidence of the effectiveness of Tsallis entropy as a convex regularizer in MCTS.

The main result(s) looks very interesting, but some of the definitions and results don't seem right.\n\nThe main issue\n=============\n\nThe main problem is Proposition 1 and the definition of the convex conjugate:\n1) The definition of the convex conjugate in (2) differs significantly from the standard one (e.g., the definition in the two cited papers) due to the multiplier \\tau. In fact, this \\tau, unless set to 1, strongly questions the validity of (3) - and basically all the usual properties that are true for the standard definition of convex conjugates.\n2) The contraction property in Proposition 1 also seems strange. It is well known that the Bellman operators are contractions, but the property claimed here is not true for the standard definition of the convex conjugate: if \\Omega^* is a contraction, then \\Omega should also be a contraction which, in turn, would imply \\Omega^*=0 due to \\Omega***=\\Omega*. Finally, in case \\Omega* is indeed a contraction, the contraction parameter should depend on \\tau as well.\n\nAs Proposition 1 is essential to the main result, the above issues make the the correctness of the main result questionable.\n\n\nAdditional remarks\n================\n\nFirst of all, it would be nice to have a brief summary of how the analysis works and what the main idea is.\n\nSection 3.2: the part of the trajectory discussed above (6) presumably corresponds to the selection part, not the simulation.

(Presumably, i_n stands for the action taken in step n.)\n\nRegarding the experiments, they do show the superiority of proposed method on some benchmark tasks, such as CartPole, Acrobot and a couple of Atari games.

Precisely they study the benefit of convex regularization in Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). They generalize the E2W by xiao et al., 2019 by considering any strictly convex function as regularizer instead of the intial negative entropy. They provide a regret analysis of this algorithm named E3W and prove that EW3 converges at an exponential rate to the solution of the regularized objective function. Then they consider three particular instances MENTS with the Shannon entropy as a regularizer, RENTS with relative entropy to the previous policy as regularizer, and TENTS with the Tsallis entropy. They compare empirically these algorithms with PUCT as policy search in Alpha-go style MCTS on CartPol, Acrobot, and Atari games.\n\n\n-Score justification/Main comments:\nThe setting is not clearly written and some key definitions are not introduced properly (see specific comments below).

Because T_{\\pi}Q is a function of (s,a) and I do not understand the notation T_{\\pi_s}Q_s (and Proposition 1 will be wrong since in (4) the bound on the rewards should appear, e.g. take Q_s = 0).\n\nP3, (4): absolute value for |\\Omega^*(Q_1) - ....|\n\nP4, (7): what is the link with (6)? Here, by the choice of \\lambda you force the exploration as with \\epsilon-greedy with is what UCT is trying to avoid.\n\nP4, Theorem 1: Could you define the estimated value V_\\Omage(s). But at the end we would like to be close to the true optimal value V^*, can you deduce a bound for |V_\\Omega -V^*|.\n\nP4, Theorem 2: I assume that a^* is the optimal value for the regularizd objective? \n\nP4: In TRPO, Schulman et al, 2015, it is rather the reverse relative entropy than the relative entropy which is used.\n\nP5, Table 1: there should be the temperature parameter \\tau here.\n\nP5: V_i is not defined, a_i either, it is a sum over i in which set? I do not understand your definition of the regret. \n\nP5, Theorem 3: There is a sign issue in 13 since le left hand is greater than the right-hand. So the regret of E3W is linear?\n\nP7, figure 1: Is it UCT or PUCT used for the experiments because in the main test you say it is PUCT? And I would not say that UCT is \"clearly the worst\" approach in Figure 1.\n\nP9, appendix B: According to your setting the reward is deterministic. I do not understand. And it is an assumption no? Which leaf node?\n\nP10: Could you define properly r(a) and \\hat{r}(a)? Why there is a sum over k in the inequality below \"therefore\", is it a sum over a?

Thus it's satisfying to know that this is where the \"magic\" of softmax and entropy as used in MENTS is coming from.  The reason I really like this paper is that it helps to build more intuition about the regularized policies in MCTS, all the while generalizing the underlying theory.\n\nAdditional feedback:\nOn high level, this paper essentially explores the duality of policies and corresponding (regularized) values. This idea/result/notion of duality between policy and value appears quite often (a quick example that comes to my mind being extensive form games but surely others), and I think few sentences on this would help the reader to feel \"less surprised\" about some of the presented derivations and techniques, and overall better place it in the context of previous relevant work.
