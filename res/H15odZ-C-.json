The authors analyze the relation between the latent space dimension and the normal distribution which is commonly used for the latent distribution. The well-known fact that probability mass concentrates in a shell of hyperspheres as the dimensionality grows is used to argue for the normal distribution being sub-optimal when interpolating between points in the latent space with straight lines. To correct this, the authors propose to use a Gamma-distribution for the norm of the latent space (and uniform angle distribution). This results in more mass closer to the origin, and the authors show both that the midpoint distribution is natural in terms of the KL divergence to the data points, and experimentally that the method gives visually appealing interpolations.\n\nWhile the contribution of using a standard family of distributions in a standard implicit model setup is limited, the paper does make interesting observations, analyses and an attempt to correct the interpolation issue. The paper is clearly written and presents the theory and experimental results nicely.

Nevertheless, we would like to emphasize that, as claimed in our original submission, the distribution of \\| z^\\prime \\| is indeed a gamma distribution. This can be seen as follows. First recall that for any z_0 and z_1 vectors drawn from a Gaussian distribution, their squared lengths follows a gamma distribution (this is just the definition of a Gamma distribution which models a sum of the squares of independent standard normal random variables). Then consider the average (z_0 + z_1) / 2 discussed in the paper, this average is then again a gaussian vector (since the sum of two independent normally distributed random variables is normal), so its squared length must also be gamma. Note that the same applies if we scale z_i with a factor sqrt(gamma)/||z_i||. We\u2019ve adjusted the method section for these corrections.\n\n2. \u201cThorough empirical analysis for different dimensionalities would be welcome\u201d\nWe have now added a new section named \u201cEffects of the Latent Space Dimensionality\u201d in the experiments section (we also provide more results in the appendix) where we show examples of straight traversals for GANs trained using different latent dimensionalities. We observe that for low dimensional latent spaces, both the normal and gamma priors produce results where the interior regions seem to produce meaningful samples. However, as the dimensionality grows, the mid-points in the normal-prior GANs quickly degrade, whereas the GANs trained using the gamma prior do not.\n\n3. \u201cFigures 2 and 3 do not add anything to the story\u201d\nWe agree, they merely served to illustrate points that were already made. We have removed the figures.\n\n4. \u201cTrick needs to be motivated better and the experiments improved to really show the improvement of the d-independence of the KL\u201d\nSee answer above, we think the newly added section in the experiments does show a clear improvement in terms of independence to the latent dimension. These results are also in accordance with the theoretical predictions made in the paper and we, therefore, believe that both the theory and experiments do motivate the use of the Gamma prior we advocate in the paper."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Semantic Interpolation in Implicit Models", "abstract": "In implicit models, one often interpolates between sampled points in latent space.
