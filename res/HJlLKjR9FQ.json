We appreciate the comments on improving the clarity of theorem statements and experimental validations, and the revision of the manuscript is being made accordingly. Besides, we would also like to address several of the above concerns. \n\nThe following answers are corresponding to the number (index) of your comments.\n\n1. As to the assumptions in deriving Theorem 1, it has been stated in the abstract that \u201cwe analyze BN by using a basic block of neural networks, consisting of a kernel layer, a BN layer, and a nonlinear activation function\u201d. We have revised the presentation of our results in section 2.1 of the latest manuscript and made this clear. \n\nWe modeled the loss function through a probabilistic perspective for a single-layer perceptron. This is treated as an illustrative case, in order to make our discussions as intuitive and easy to understand as possible. The analyses of a single-layer network already explain optimization and generalization of BN compared to the other approaches. Despite the loss construction based on a single layer, we have also verified the major conclusions in deep CNNs.\n\nAs for multiple-layer neural networks, the current analysis can be naturally extended. (see Appendix C.4 in the new version of the manuscript). \n\n4. In the experiment section, the `batch size\u2019 subsection investigates how the strength of regularization of BN affects the parameter norm. This is one of our findings of gamma decay. We\u2019ll consider move this part to Appendix.\n\n5. The results of section 2.1 can be extended to deep networks. We achieve this by performing decomposition in a deep network with respect to a certain hidden BN layer. The discussions can be found in Appendix C.4. The decay factor of the regularization depends on Hessian matrix of the hidden layer, whose regularization form is not as intuitive and easy to read as the singe-layer ReLU network. We evaluated BN\u2019s regularization in deep CNNs in experiments.\n\n7. We have revised the experiment section by conducting a strong baseline in CIFAR10 using ResNet18 to study the regularization of BN. We would like to argue that down-sampled ImageNet with image size of 32*32 is more challenging than the full size ImageNet (224*224). That\u2019s why the performance of ResNet18 in the down-sampled version is not comparable to the original ImageNet.\n\nIt should be also noted that the purpose of our experiments is to validate the regularization of BN in deep neural networks, instead of improving the performance of networks already pursued with a lot of finely tuned methods. Therefore, in order to focus on the regularization effect of BN, we removed augmentation in data preparation as well as weight decay or dropout to rule out the regularization from these techniques. In this setting in the current paper, the inverse relationship between the strength of BN regularization and batch size was observed most evidently. \n\n8. We have revised the grammatical errors in the latest manuscript.\n\n9. As to the presentation of the current paper, thanks for the advice and we have revised it in the latest version of the manuscript.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper447/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper447/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper447/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Towards Understanding Regularization in Batch Normalization", "abstract": "Batch Normalization (BN) improves both convergence and generalization in training neural networks.

We are glad that the reviewer agrees on the necessity and impact of the current work. We list detailed responses to some concerns.\n\n(1) Theorem 1. As we have stated in the main text, we derived the loss decomposition from a single building block in neural networks. We have rephrased section 2.1 to make this clearer. In fact, we started from a single-layer perceptron in order to keep our discussions intuitive and easy to understand. \n\nBy analyzing the regularization of BN in a single-layer network, its optimization and generalization are investigated sufficiently and BN is compared to WN+gamma decay and vanilla SGD both theoretically and numerically, as shown in section 3 and 4. These results have never been presented before. We believe they should be presented to the community.\n\nIn the latest version of manuscript, we extend the regularization form of BN to deep networks as shown in Appendix C.4. We also analyze generalization of BN in a nonlinear ReLU student network in section 4. Moreover, the current study has verified the major findings both analytically in a single-layer network and empirically in deep nonlinear CNNs. \n\n(2) Motivation and narration. We are grateful for this suggestion. We have made modifications in the latest manuscript. For example, the \u201cnotation\u201d subsection is removed from the introduction and moved to section 2, the \u201csection 6 Related Work\u201d is moved forward in the introduction to better motivate the problem.\n\n\n(3) Implicit Back Propagation [1]. Thanks for the nice advice to compare with other method that stabilizes training and learning rate. We have cited this reference. However, despite the similarity between BN and implicit BP (ISGD) in the effects of stabilization and robust learning rates, these two methods are quite different. \n\nImplicit BP (ISGD) achieves the above effects by implicitly accounting for higher-order derivatives on the loss surface in backward gradient propagation, while BN reaches this goal by reshaping the loss surface to be more isotropic through normalization in forward computation. From their different perspectives, it seems possible to combine ISGD with BN, but the analysis is beyond the topic of the current study. \n\n(4) Figure 1 (and 3). We agree with the reviewer that vanilla SGD would not be adopted because of its simplest form. \n\nHowever, the purpose of the comparison in section 4 between vanilla SGD, WN+gamma decay, and BN is to quantitatively verify the findings of BN\u2019s regularization form. In a linear single-layer network, the analytical solutions are easy to obtain and easy to understand for readers. \n\nThe extension to non-linear solutions is a bit less straightforward. Thanks for the advice and we have also verified the results in a ReLU nonlinear network as shown in section 4 in the latest manuscript, and made corresponding derivations that are enclosed in Appendix D2. \n\nHope the above feedback persuade you to raise your confidence and score."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper447/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper447/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper447/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Towards Understanding Regularization in Batch Normalization", "abstract": "Batch Normalization (BN) improves both convergence and generalization in training neural networks.

The content may be a little dense, but they are inter-connected to each other. The latter two, namely learning rate selection and generalization analysis are all based on the loss decomposition. And these phenomena have been considered to be windfalls of BN and partially conclusive only from experiments. Therefore, a theoretical and systematic analysis on the effect of BN is necessary in this study. \n\nWe also thank the reviewer for the advice to clean up the manuscript to improve its coherence and we are working on it accordingly. Here is the detailed response for the technical comments. \n\n1) \u201cTheorem 1 is not acceptable for publication. It is not a rigorous statement. This should be fixed\u201d. \nSince we have given proper assumptions of the theorem, we suppose that the reviewer\u2019s concern on Theorem 1 is the same as R1 and R2. The construction of the loss function is firstly based on a single-layer network. Its extension to deep neural networks is also possible, as answered in Appendix C.4 in our latest version of manuscript. Moreover, the regularization effect in deep CNNs is also verified in this paper. We have revised the statement to make it clearer to the reader in the latest version.\n\n2) In this study, effective learning rate is defined as lr * \\gamma_0 / L_0, where \\gamma_0 represents the scale parameter at equilibrium position and L_0 is the square average of weight (w) parameters. \n\nMaximum learning rate is the maximum effective lr that allows training to converge without diverging, which maintains the stability of the neural network at a fix point. These two definitions simplify the analysis of learning dynamics but may cause confusion. It has been clarified more in the newest revision. \n\n3) For the derivation and application of the main theorem, which is the loss decomposition with BN, we did not impose any distribution of the input x. Following this result, the learning dynamics is analyzed in Sec. 3, a general expression of ODEs has been presented without knowing the input distribution. \n\nAs for the effective and maximum learning rate at the fixed point,  Gaussian input gives intuitive and meaningful expressions and is thus presented. This has been stated in the latest main text. \n\n4) The thermodynamic limit (N,P->infinity) allows the asymptotic analysis of learning dynamics from continuous differential equations. In the regime of finite N & P is finite, the differential equation would be replaced by a difference equation. In non-asymptotic regime, higher differential orders of parameters must be accounted for, and the interactions between parameters are more complex [1], and this would normally make the optimization process less stable. In reality, the networks are normally constructed with large number of neurons (~10K in each layer) and data points (~1M), the asymptotic analysis would hold.\n\n[1] E. Moulines and F. R.

It considers the simple model of Equation (1) in a straightforward bias-variance decomposition, and may not be useful in general. Some aspects of the theorem are not technically correct or unclear. E.g., \\gamma is a single parameter, what does it mean to have a Fisher information matrix?\n\n2) The problem is not motivated well. It may be a good idea to bring some discussions from Section 6 early in the introduction of the paper. When does BN work well? And what is the current understanding (prior to the paper) and how does the paper compare/contribute? I think the paper does a good job on that front, but it follows a disordered narration flow which makes it hard to read. I understand there is a lot of material to cover, but it would help a lot to reorganize the paper in a more linear way.\n\n3) What about alternatives, such as implicit back propagation that stabilizes learning?  [1]\n\n4) I don't find Figure 1 (and 3) particularly useful on how it handles vanilla SGD. In practice, it would be straightforward to avoid the mentioned pathologies.

The authors connect BN to population normalization (PN) and a gamma-decay term that penalizes the scale of the weights. They analyze the generalization error of BN for a single-layer perceptron using ideas in statistical physics.\n\nDetailed comments:\n\n1. Theorem 1 uses the loss function of a single-layer perceptron in the proof. This is not mentioned in the main writeup. This theorem is not valid in general.\n\n2. The main contribution of this paper is Theorem 1 which connects BN to population normalization and weight normalization. It shows that the regularization of BN can be split into two components that depend on the mini-batch mean and variances: the former penalizes the magnitude of activations while the latter penalizes their correlation.\n\n3. Although the theoretical analysis is conducted under simplistic models, this paper corroborates a number of widely-known observations about BN in practice. It validates these predictions on standard experiments.\n\n4. The scaling of BN regularization with batch-size can be easily seen from Teye et al., 2018, so I think the experiments that validate this prediction are not strictly necessary.\n\n5. It is difficult to use these techniques for deep non-linear networks.\n\n6. The predictions in Section 3.3 are very interesting: it is often seen that fully-connected layers (where BN helps significantly) need small learning rates to train without BN; with BN one can use larger learning rates.\n\n7. The experimental section is very rough. In particular the experiments on CIFAR-10 and downsampled-ImageNet with CNNs seem to have very high errors and it is difficult to understand whether some of the predictions about generalization error apply here. Why not use a more recent architecture for CIFAR-10?\n\n8. There is a very large number of grammatical and linguistic errors in the narrative.\n\n9.

Experiments demonstrate that BN in convolutional neural networks share the same traits of regularization as the above analyses.", "keywords": ["batch normalization", "regularization", "deep learning"], "authorids": ["pluo@ie.cuhk.edu.hk", "wangxinjiang@sensetime.com", "shaowenqi@sensetime.com", "zhanglinpeng@sensetime.com"], "authors": ["Ping Luo", "Xinjiang Wang", "Wenqi Shao", "Zhanglin Peng"], "pdf": "/pdf/8f671110d6fddecbe9002d668ff5d3fa121e8ba5.pdf", "paperhash": "luo|towards_understanding_regularization_in_batch_normalization", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nluo2018towards,\ntitle={Towards Understanding Regularization in Batch Normalization},\nauthor={Ping Luo and Xinjiang Wang and Wenqi Shao and Zhanglin Peng},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJlLKjR9FQ},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper447/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234459467, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "HJlLKjR9FQ", "replyto": "HJlLKjR9FQ", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper447/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335726215, "tmdate": 1552335726215, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper447/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 9}
