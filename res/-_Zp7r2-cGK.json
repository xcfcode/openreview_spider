Results show that the method is competitive with other output modifications such as the large-margin softmax.  \n\nThe  two primary concerns of the reviewers were the lack of large-scale image classification results and theoretical guarantees.  The authors have added CIFAR-100 results.  Moreover, the authors agree that theoretical results would be nice to have, but such results are non-trivial and likely require a PAC-Bayes treatment.\n\nI find the method to be well-motivated and that the paper demonstrates sufficient experimental rigor.  Given the popularity of the softmax throughout deep learning, this paper will likely be of interest---or at least, be of potential use---to a large part of the ICLR community.  I encourage the authors to add the ImageNet results to the final version.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Discriminative Gaussian Mixture Model with Sparsity", "authorids": ["~Hideaki_Hayashi1", "~Seiichi_Uchida1"], "authors": ["Hideaki Hayashi", "Seiichi Uchida"], "keywords": ["classification", "sparse Bayesian learning", "Gaussian mixture model"], "abstract": "In probabilistic classification, a discriminative model based on the softmax function has a potential limitation in that it assumes unimodality for each class in the feature space.

ImageNet does not distribute test labels, and we should upload the predictions of labels by the model to the ImageNet server to obtain test accuracy.

This model is trained based on sparse Bayesian learning. The sparsity constraint removes redundant Gaussian components which results in  reducing the number of parameters and improving the generalization. This framework can potentially be embedded into the deep models and trained in an end-to-end fashion. The main motivation is that the proposed model (i.e., SDGM,)  can consider multimodal data while conventional softmax classifiers only assume unimodality for each class. Experimental results show the superiority of the SDGM over existing softmax-based discriminative models.\n\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow. And the paper precisely places the proposed method among the related work.  However, there are some concerns:\n\n1- Sparsity constraint is supposed to improve the performance and generalization, but experimental results do not support this. What is the motivation of employing sparsity learning in this framework? \n\n2- Conventional softmax classifiers in deep architecture have already provided promising results on real world datasets such as ImageNet which contains classes with multimodal data. However, in this paper, experiments are performed on the small datasets, so was the proposed method evaluated on ImageNet as well? \n\n\n3- There are many versions of softmax-classifiers such as \u201clarge-margin softmax\u201d, \u201cangular softmax\u201d, and \u201cadditive margin softmax\u201d , and  [1 ,2 ] that address conventional softmax-classifiers\u2019 issues.

At least for now, we do not think we can give frequentist non-asymptotic bounds because our method is based on Bayesian estimation. Instead, there is a possibility that we can give error bounds for the proposed method using the PAC-Bayesian theorem because generalization error bounds for the Gaussian process classifier were given by Seeger [A4].   \nIn future work, we would like to tackle the theoretical analysis of error bounds using the PAC-Bayesian theorem.

The language could use another review. Often, the writing slips into the use of informal language.**  \n**A.** Thank you for pointing it out. We will use another professional language editing service and reflect the modification by the end of the discussion period.\n\n**2. Appendices were missing in my version; the paper makes an explicit reference to at least appendix A.**  \n**A.** We are sorry for making you confused. Appendices were included in supplementary materials. We also added appendices to the main PDF (the official FAQ says either is allowed).\n\n**3. The connection to Bayesian methods is week.**  \n**A.** The proposed SDGM is closely related to Bayesian methods. The SDGM is regarded as one of the Bayesian methods because the posterior distribution of weights is estimated during learning instead of directly estimating the weights as points, as with other Bayesian methods. To clarify this, we have updated Section 2.   \n**[Revision]**\np. 3: Added \u201cThe SDGM with kernelization is also regarded as a kernel Bayesian method because the posterior distribution of weights is estimated during learning instead of directly estimating the weights as points, as with the GP and MGP.\u201d\n\n**4. The table describing Algorithm 1 appears abruptly and references formulae that have not been introduced. It is best positioned at the end of Section 3 to improve readability.**  \n**A.** Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We moved Algorithm 1 to the end of Section 3.\n\n**5. Most of the Bayesian approaches used in the comparison are dated.**  \n**A.** Thank you for your insightful comment. As pointed out, the Bayesian methods used in the comparisons (Gaussian process, mixture of Gaussian processes, and relevance vector machine) are a bit old. However, we could not find a method better suited from the perspective of sparsity, multimodality, and Bayesian learning despite our best efforts.   \n In the revised manuscript, we have added the reason why we chose the comparative methods.  \n**[Revision]**  \np. 7: Added \u201cFor comparison, we used three kernel Bayesian methods: a GP classifier, an MPG classifier (Tresp2001; Luo & Sun 2017), and an RVM (Tipping 2001), which are closely related to the SDGM from the perspective of sparsity, multimodality, and Bayesian learning, as described in Section 2.\u201d\n\n**6. Section 4.2 references high computational costs, but it is unclear which steps of the algorithm make this approach computationally prohibitive.**  \n**A.** The most computationally expensive part is inverse matrix calculation of the Hessian (Eq. (16) in the paper), which takes $O(N^3)$, where $N$ is the number of training data. For this problem, we can employ Molchanov's approximation based on dropout [A3], which is almost as computationally inexpensive as softmax training, and we used the approximation in the image classification in Section 4.2. However, the trained SDGM becomes a memory-efficient classifier because it reduces the number of weights by the Sparse Bayesian learning as shown in Table 1 in the paper.  \n In the revised manuscript, we have added some explanation about computational costs.  \n[A3] Molchanov et al., Variational dropout sparsifies deep neuralnetworks, in Proc. ICML, 2017.  \n**[Revision]**  \np. 7: This is because it is difficult to execute the learning algorithm in Section 3.4 with backpropagation due to large computational costs for inverse matrix calculation of the Hessian in (16), which takes $O(N^3)$.\n\n**7. It is unclear from Table 1 that SDGM is significantly better than RVM. A deep dive is warranted to better understand their relative performances.**  \n**A.** We consider that the key is multimodality. For data with a multimodal structure, the decision boundary between classes may have a complex shape at the border of the clusters. As shown in Figure 1 of the paper, the SDGM could more accurately represent the sharp changes in decision boundaries near the border of components compared to the RVM since the SDGM explicitly models multimodality.  \n In the revised manuscript, we have added some explanation to Section 4.1.  \n**[Revision]**  \np. 7: Added: Since the SDGM explicitly models multimodality, it could more accurately represent the sharp changes in decision boundaries near the border of components compared to the RVM, as shown in Figure 1.\n\n**8. It would be better if Section 4.2.1 also include large datasets or more challenging domains. The relative error reduction described in Table 2 on a couple of datasets are marginal.**  \n**A.** Thank you for your valuable suggestion.

We have started additional experiments on ImageNet but it will take some time; we will add the results to the revised manuscript if we can complete the experiments by the end of the rebuttal period.
