For both CPD and MQA, we note that replacing the GVP layers with MLP layers leads to a tangible decrease in performance and the resulting ablated models do not outperform state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, they do not outperform GraphQA and Structured GNN, the previous best methods on MQA and CPD. It is true that these methods, both of which are GNNs, do perform better than some other methods shown in the tables, and we also find this intriguing. Our main claim is that without the GVP, our method performs no better than previous baseline GNNs.\n\n**MQA comparisons**: We thank the reviewer for bringing up the relation between model quality assessment and structure generation. Both are important problems in the protein structure prediction process, but their formulation and role are different. Structure generation methods (such as Ingraham et al. 2019 ICLR and Senior et al. 2020 Nature) map sequences to a generative model over 3D structures, while MQA methods map 3D structures (produced by structure generation methods) to quality scores. MQA is a crucial step in the structure prediction pipeline, as picking out highly accurate models from a large pool of candidate structures is often a performance bottleneck. CASP, the community experiment which biennially evaluates methods for structure prediction, recognizes this by establishing MQA as its own track, with its own characteristic performance metrics and problem definitions. Therefore, a direct comparison with methods that model 3D structure from sequence, such as Ingraham et al. 2019 ICLR and Senior et al. 2020 Nature, is difficult to formulate. The revised manuscript does contain comprehensive comparisons with MQA methods from the most recent CASP experiment for which results are available (CASP 13).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1954/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1954/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning from Protein Structure with Geometric Vector Perceptrons", "authorids": ["~Bowen_Jing1", "~Stephan_Eismann1", "psuriana@stanford.edu", "~Raphael_John_Lamarre_Townshend1", "~Ron_Dror1"], "authors": ["Bowen Jing", "Stephan Eismann", "Patricia Suriana", "Raphael John Lamarre Townshend", "Ron Dror"], "keywords": ["structural biology", "graph neural networks", "proteins", "geometric deep learning"], "abstract": "Learning on 3D structures of large biomolecules is emerging as a distinct area in machine learning, but there has yet to emerge a unifying network architecture that simultaneously leverages the geometric and relational aspects of the problem domain.

We have included an extensive list of additional comparisons for CASP 13 as part of the revisions (Section 5, Table 2 and Appendix E, Table 8). We report results for a total of 23 methods. The comparison includes all single-structure methods highlighted in the CASP 13 special issue in PROTEINS [1], among them ProQ4.

All of the MQA methods we originally compare against were published in 2017 or later, significantly more recent than CASP 12. In particular, SBROD and GraphQA first appeared in 2019. We use the CASP 11/12 dataset mainly because these methods were originally benchmarked on that dataset. Our new CASP 13 results also include many other recent methods, including some published in 2020.\n\n**Deep learning MQA methods**: We agree it is important to compare against other deep learning methods. We have added comparisons to many deep learning methods in our CASP 13 results (FaeNNz, Multicom-Novel, ProQ4, AngularQA, TopQA, Bhattacharya). Additionally, all of the methods in our original comparison, with the exception of SBROD and VoroMQA, use deep networks (dense, convolutional, or graph neural networks).\n\nWe have added a discussion of the CASP 13 dataset in Section 4 to present all rows from Table 6 (Appendix C) in the main text.\n\n**Protein design**: We thank the reviewer for bringing the mentioned relevant works to our attention. We have added references and a brief discussion of ProteinSolver in Section 2. Additionally, using the provided web server link, we have included a comparison with ProteinSolver on the TS 50 test set in Appendix E, Table 9. We report better results for our method GVP-GNN. We reference and briefly discuss the other mentioned works in Section 2 of the updated manuscript. We note that our discussion of related work remains organized by architecture type to best align with the main focus of our technical contribution.\n\n[1] Cheng, et al.

We have revised the manuscript with the goal of making the representation of our method clearer and more accessible.\n\n**Figure 1a**: We have refined the schematic illustration of our method in Figure 1a. The updated figure now shows operations and features using distinct graphical representations and we also depict vector-valued and scalar-valued features differently. We further highlight what parts of the geometric vector perceptron correspond to its scalar and vector channel, respectively.   \n\n**Equations**: We have added information to section 3.2 and section 3.3 to clarify the meaning of symbols and acronyms. We have also made changes to the way Equations 2-4 are written to improve clarity and added further text explaining the represented quantities and notations used.\n\n**Network structure**: We have added text in section 3.3 to clarify how geometric vector perceptrons are used to update node features as part of the message-passing algorithm in the graph neural network.\n\n**Intuition**: We have refined the beginning of Section 3 and the description of the synthetic tasks (Appendix B) to provide further motivation for our method and examples for why the GVP helps the GNN access geometric information. At a high level, a standard GNN with scalar-invariant representations of geometry must transform between local coordinates to propagate vector-valued geometric information across the graph---for example, the representation of an arbitrary position in space. With the introduction of geometric vector features, this information can be represented directly as a vector and propagated using simple vector addition.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1954/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1954/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning from Protein Structure with Geometric Vector Perceptrons", "authorids": ["~Bowen_Jing1", "~Stephan_Eismann1", "psuriana@stanford.edu", "~Raphael_John_Lamarre_Townshend1", "~Ron_Dror1"], "authors": ["Bowen Jing", "Stephan Eismann", "Patricia Suriana", "Raphael John Lamarre Townshend", "Ron Dror"], "keywords": ["structural biology", "graph neural networks", "proteins", "geometric deep learning"], "abstract": "Learning on 3D structures of large biomolecules is emerging as a distinct area in machine learning, but there has yet to emerge a unifying network architecture that simultaneously leverages the geometric and relational aspects of the problem domain.

This paper divides the types of approaches taken to address this challenge into those that use \"geometric\" information (i.e. positions of molecules in space), and those that utilize \"relational methods\" mainly through graphs (how different parts of molecule relate). This study is an attempt to integrate the two source of information by a novel network architecture. They introduce geometric vector perceptrons as a way of summarizing geometric information for graph layers without loss of information as it happens in dense layers. They evaluate the performance of these architectures on MQA and CPD tasks, both relevant and standard benchmarks in the field. \n\nPositives:\n\n- The paper well-written and sets up the problem and how it supposed to be solved very well. \n\n- The method seems to be high-performing on well-established benchmarks. \n\n- The conceptual contribution of GVP seems promising, intuitively relevant and usable.\n\n- Ablation and hyper-parameter studies are well-scoped. \n\nAreas for improvement: \n\n- The authors advertise GVPs as a \"drop-in replacement\" for MLP layers, however, looking at their ablation studies, while the MLP layer is less performant than GVP, it still is outperforming many SOTA methods. For this reason I suggest including the MLP results in the main text, so that the performance improvement is clear. It is also relevant to discuss what drives the performance of the method such  that even with MLP, it outperforms sophisticated architectures introduced before.\n\n- For MQA tasks, A discussion and ideally quantitative comparison with Ingraham 2019 ICLR (Differentiable Simulator), and AlphaFold (Senior et al 2020 Nature) seems pertinent. At least to me it is not immediately obvious if learning seq -> structure is a sufficiently different task not to be considered/discussed here. Presumably sequence data is more widely available than the geometry.  \n\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1954/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1954/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning from Protein Structure with Geometric Vector Perceptrons", "authorids": ["~Bowen_Jing1", "~Stephan_Eismann1", "psuriana@stanford.edu", "~Raphael_John_Lamarre_Townshend1", "~Ron_Dror1"], "authors": ["Bowen Jing", "Stephan Eismann", "Patricia Suriana", "Raphael John Lamarre Townshend", "Ron Dror"], "keywords": ["structural biology", "graph neural networks", "proteins", "geometric deep learning"], "abstract": "Learning on 3D structures of large biomolecules is emerging as a distinct area in machine learning, but there has yet to emerge a unifying network architecture that simultaneously leverages the geometric and relational aspects of the problem domain.
