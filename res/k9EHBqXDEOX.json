The sample complexity result in this paper matches previous result in two time-scale A2C in terms of the dependence of \\epsilon, and this paper further shows the benefit of \"linear speed up\" brough by the structure of A3C. Given the practical usefulness of A3C, the result established in this paper is meaninful.\n\nAlthough most of the technical proof seem correct to me, the algorithm studied in this paper has the following issues.\n\n(1) In the policy evaluation part (critic), samples are generated according to the the \"hybrid\" transition kernel \\tilde{P}, which is not reasonable. The purpose of the policy evaluation is to evalue the value function, thus the samples used by the critic need to follow the transition kernel P not \\tilde{P}. Otherwise, the value function learned by the critic would be different from the pure TD(0). I understand that the the author adopt this sampling method because the author want to make a \"two time-scale\" algorithm to study here. However, under such a sampling startegy only the actor can obtain appropriate samples. In fact, it is very difficult to design a two time-scale algorithm for a discount MDP, as the transition kernel required by actor and critic are different. I suggest the author to study \"averaged MDP\" instead. In the averaged MDP, both the actor and critic can share the same transition kernel, which make designing a two time-scale algorithm possible.\n\n(2) Another problem is the projection used in the critic. The projection in linear SA is a practical problem, as we do not have prior knowledge of the radius before we run the algorithm. The projection issue has been criticized by many researchers' in the RL community in the last few years thus should not be ignored here. In fact, the projection issue can be avoid if the author adopts a nested-loop structure, and I think the sample complexity result can even be  improved in the nested-loop setting. Thus I suggest the author to used nested-loop structure to avoide this projection issue.\n\nOverall I think the paper is well written. However, considering the two problems that I mentioned above, I think the current version is not ready to be published.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1017/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1017/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic: Non-asymptotic Analysis and Linear Speedup", "authorids": ["shenh5@rpi.edu", "~Kaiqing_Zhang3", "~Mingyi_Hong1", "~Tianyi_Chen1"], "authors": ["Han Shen", "Kaiqing Zhang", "Mingyi Hong", "Tianyi Chen"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Asynchronous and parallel implementation of standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms is a key enabler of the tremendous success of modern RL. \nAmong many asynchronous RL algorithms, arguably the most popular and effective one is the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm.  \nAlthough A3C is becoming the workhorse of RL, its theoretical properties are still not well-understood, including the non-asymptotic analysis and the performance gain of parallelism (a.k.a. speedup). \nThis paper revisits the A3C algorithm with TD(0) for the critic update, termed A3C-TD(0), with provable convergence guarantees. \nWith linear value function approximation for the TD update, the convergence of A3C-TD(0) is established under both i.i.d. and Markovian sampling.

We have clarified the sampling and projection questions. ", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the careful reviews and insightful suggestions. \n\n\n(1) Sampling method\n\nAs pointed out by the reviewer, it is *very difficult* to design a two time-scale AC algorithm for the discounted MDP, as the transition kernel required by the actor and critic updates are different. Aware of this sampling mismatch, we adopted the sampling method introduced in the seminal work [R4, R5] and many follow-up works, e.g., [R7, R8], which inevitably introduces extra bias because of sampling from the artificial transition $\\widetilde{\\cal P}$ instead of the original ${\\cal P}$.  However, this extra bias is small when the discount factor $\\gamma$ is close to 1. This choice of $\\gamma$ is also common in practice. For example, $\\gamma$ is chosen as 0.99 in A3C [R6]. In this case, the difference between the stationary distribution and visitation measure are both small [R4].  \n\nTo resolve the concerns of the reviewer, we have decomposed the approximation error defined in (14) into two errors: i) the *function approximation error*, which is common in TD with function approximation; and, ii) the *sampling error* induced by distribution mismatch. We have added Lemma 7 to analytically quantify this sampling error in supplementary material, which is indeed ${\\cal O}(1-\\gamma)$. We have also highlighted the corresponding changes we have made for the rest of proofs. This analysis also justifies the choice of $\\gamma= 0.99$ in A3C [R6]. The result is also consistent with the intuition that the discrepancy between average reward setting and discounted reward setting will be small with a $\\gamma$ close to 1, as one can see that our result reduces to that of [R3] which studies the average reward setting with a $\\gamma$ approaching 1.\n\nOf course, one can bypass this subtle issue by studying A3C for an average-reward MDP. However, this will make our setting different from the original work [R6], and thus deviate from our original purpose --- provide a theoretical justification of A3C.\n\n(2) Projection of critic parameter\n\nThe projection step is often used to control the norm of the gradient. In the context of AC, it prevents the actor or critic from going a too large step in the \u2018wrong\u2019 direction. Such control of gradient is even more important in a two time-scale algorithm where the tolerance for \u2018bad\u2019 direction is especially small compared to, say, nested-loop algorithms. Projection has also been adopted by many previous TD/AC works like [R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R7, R8, R9]. To the best of our knowledge, no provably convergent two time-scale AC algorithm has been studied without projection. In practice, one can choose the projection radius as ${\\cal O}(r_{\\rm max}/\\lambda)$ [R3, R8, R9], *without loss of optimality*. \n\nThanks for the insightful suggestion! Indeed, one can bypass this subtle issue by studying the nested-loop AC that may even enjoy an improved sample complexity; see e.g., [R7]. However, this will also make the considered A3C algorithm different from the original one in [R6]. To mitigate the reviewer\u2019s concerns, we have added some clarifications after Assumption 2. \n\nTo resolve your technical concerns, we have added some clarifications and new derivations in the revised paper.  \n\nFeel free to let us know if this resolves your concerns, and we are open to further discussions!\n\n\n\n[R1] J.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-asymptotic result for *asynchronous* parallel AC algorithms. \n\n(2)\tWe further show that in the i.i.d. setting, A3C-TD(0) achieves a sample complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2.5}/N)$ per worker, where $N$ is the number of workers. Compared to the best-known complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2.5})$ for i.i.d. two-timescale AC, A3C-TD(0) achieves *linear speedup*, thanks to the *parallelism* and *asynchrony*. In the Markovian setting, the sample complexity of A3C-TD(0) matches the order of the non-parallel AC algorithm.\n\n(3)\tWe test A3C-TD(0) on the synthetically generated environment as well as the OpenAI Gym environment (classic control and Atari Games). We make our code publicly available to enhance reproducibility. \n\nBelow we summarize the **major improvements** we have made during the rebuttal period. \n\n(1)\tAs suggested by Reviewer 1, we have added explicit definitions of some variables and discussed the reduction to the tabular setting without value function approximation.  \n\n(2)\tAs suggested by Reviewer 2, we have added some discussion on how to generalize our results to A3C with n-step TD. Due to space limitation, we will pursue this extension in the future work. \n\n(3)\tAs suggested by Reviewer 2, we have added new simulations on Atari game, and we are running more numerical tests which will be included in the final version. \n\n(4)\tReviewer 4 pointed out the difficulty of sampling in two-time scale AC for discounted MDP and kindly suggested that we should analyze the average-reward setting. However, analyzing the average MDP will make our setting different from the *original A3C work*, and thus deviate from our original purpose --- to provide some theoretical justification of the use of asynchronous update in AC algorithms. Therefore, we still consider the discounted setting (as in the *original A3C paper*) and follow the update rule as in the *classical AC paper* (Konda, MIT PhD thesis, 2002).\n\nHowever, we have managed to provide a *fine-grained* analysis to explicitly decompose the approximation error into: i) the function approximation error, which comes from the TD with function approximation; and, ii) the sampling error which seems inevitable in two-timescale AC for discounted MDP due to the distribution mismatch. We have added Lemma 7 to quantify this sampling error, which is indeed ${\\cal O}(1-\\gamma)$. We have highlighted the corresponding changes we have made for the rest of the proofs due to this new analysis. This analysis also justifies the choice of $\\gamma= 0.99$ in the A3C work.\n\n(5)\tTo further resolve Reviewer 4\u2019s concern on the projection used in the critic update, we have added more discussion in the paper on its *necessity* and the *practical choice* of the projection radius, without loss of optimality. We have also added several key references that range from the original AC paper to some exciting recent results to justify that the projection is common in both implementing and analyzing two timescale AC.  \n\nWe hope that our response and revision can resolve all your concerns. **If you have any further suggestions and comments, we are more than happy to implement them in our final version.** \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1017/Authors"], "readers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1017/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1017/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1017/Authors", "everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1017/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic: Non-asymptotic Analysis and Linear Speedup", "authorids": ["shenh5@rpi.edu", "~Kaiqing_Zhang3", "~Mingyi_Hong1", "~Tianyi_Chen1"], "authors": ["Han Shen", "Kaiqing Zhang", "Mingyi Hong", "Tianyi Chen"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Asynchronous and parallel implementation of standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms is a key enabler of the tremendous success of modern RL. \nAmong many asynchronous RL algorithms, arguably the most popular and effective one is the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm.  \nAlthough A3C is becoming the workhorse of RL, its theoretical properties are still not well-understood, including the non-asymptotic analysis and the performance gain of parallelism (a.k.a. speedup). \nThis paper revisits the A3C algorithm with TD(0) for the critic update, termed A3C-TD(0), with provable convergence guarantees. \nWith linear value function approximation for the TD update, the convergence of A3C-TD(0) is established under both i.i.d. and Markovian sampling.

We have added explanation and new simulation.", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for reviewing our paper and recognizing our theoretical contribution.\n\n(1) Extension to multi-step TD method\n\nThe multi-step TD method is a hybrid combination of TD(0) method and the Monte-Carlo method that uses an almost unbiased stochastic gradient. For the asynchronous AC method based on Monte-Carlo sampling, its convergence follows directly from the delayed SGD. And our work has already proved the convergence of the asynchronous AC method based on TD(0). \nIn order to extend our theory to multi-step TD, we will use the error-reduction property of n-step return which establishes that the expected value of all n -step returns is guaranteed to improve over the current value function approximator to the true value function (see (7.3) in page 144 of [R1]):\n \n$ \\max_s  \\Bigg|E_\\pi\\Big[\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\gamma^i r_{t+i} + \\gamma^n \\hat{V}_\\omega(s_n)\\Big|s_t=s\\Big] - V_\\pi (s)\\Bigg| \\leq \\gamma^n \\max_s \\Big| \\hat{V}_\\omega(s)- V_\\pi (s)\\Big|\n $.\n \nThis also implies that the n-step TD error will improve our 1-step TD error, which is a critical quantity in our convergence analysis. With the new expression and bound of TD error, we will need to slightly modify our analysis in places where we need to quantify the approximate TD error, e.g., (58) and Lemma 5. But it will only improve some constants. Therefore, we believe that our results can be easily extended to the convergence of async AC with multi-step TD. \n\nWe have added new discussion at the end of Section III. Due to the space limitation, we will pursue this extension in our future work. \n\n\n(2) More experiments \n\nWe viewed our work as a theory-oriented one, with main focus on establishing the convergence rate and sample complexity for a well-known algorithm (A3C), following the recent line of works on the finite-sample analysis of AC [12]-[18]. In fact, except some basic tests (not gym tests) reported in [13], none of these works have provided any numerical results. We include some empirical validations as an add-on to our theoretical contribution. \n\nTo mitigate the concerns of the reviewer, we have added a new gym Atari game, and we are also running more numerical tests which will be included in the final version.\n\n[R1] R.

We appreciate your careful review. Our response to your comments follows. \n\n(1) Formal definition of $w_\\theta^\\ast$\n\nThe variables $w_\\theta^\\ast$ and $w_{\\theta_k}^\\ast$ denote the stationary points of TD update under policies $\\pi_\\theta$ and $\\pi (\\theta_k)$, respectively. Now it is defined explicitly in (11). Thanks for the careful reading.\n\n(2) Extension to no value function approximation\n\nIndeed, our convergence result can be easily extended to cover the situation where no function approximation is used, e.g., tabular case, and the corresponding function approximation error will be 0. Specifically, for the tabular case, we can simply treat the state feature $\\phi(s)$ as a |S|-dimensional standard basis vector, where only s-th entry is 1 and other entries are 0. In this case, the |S|-dimensional critic parameter concatenates the true value functions. In general, if the linear combination of the feature mapping can express the true value function, then the value function approximation error will be zero (see Lemma 2 of [R1]).\n\n(3) Relaxation of the definition of $\\epsilon_{app}$\n\nIn the proof, we use $\\epsilon_{app}$ to bound the function approximation error at each iteration. Since at each iteration we have different policy parameter $\\theta_k$, $\\epsilon_{app}$ cannot be defined over a fixed policy parameter such as the stationary point of actor update. We define $\\epsilon_{app}$ in this way just for notational brevity. Similar definition of $\\epsilon_{app}$ was also widely used in prior works such as [R2], [R3]. An alternative way is to define an iteration-dependent $\\epsilon_{app}$, which will complicate the already heavy notations. \n\n[R1] J. Bhandari, D. Russo, and R.

This paper showed A3C-TD(0) has O(\\epsilon^{-2.5}/N)  sample complexity per worker where N is the number of workers., which means the per-worker sample complexity can be reduced linearly with respect to # of worker. \n\nIn general, this paper is well written and easy to follow. The sample complexity results are insightful.  Could the authors address my following comments/questions?\n\n(1)$w_\\theta^\\ast$ or $w_{\\theta_k}^\\ast$ are never formally defined. Please clarify the notations properly. \n(2)Unlike \"linear-speedup\" in setting such as convergence rates for SGD,  the linear speedup is not so \"idea\". The gradient norm has a constant error floor term $O(\\epsilon_{app})$, which eventually dominates the error as K increases.   To my understanding, an error term is unavoidable because the valuation is approximated by a linear function.  I wonder if the results in the current paper can be easily extended to cover the situation where no linear approximation is used, in which case I expect the error terms disappears totally. \n(3)  This is also related to (2). It is reasonable that the critic-convergence (Theorem 1) uses  a drifting $\\theta_k$. But if we look at the actor and critic together, our goal is to converge to a fixed policy, am I right? If so, is it necessary to define $\\epsilon_{app}$ in (13) as the error regarding to the worst \\theta? (In other words, can we remove $max_{\\theta\\in R^d}$ in (13) and define $\\epsilon_{app}$ using a single $\\theta$?
