The authors make use of the so-called cluster assumption, i.e., decision boundaries should not cross high-density data regions. VADA extends the standard Domain-Adversarial training by introducing an additional objective L_t that measures the target-side cluster assumption violation, namely, the conditional entropy w.r.t. the target distribution. Since the empirical estimate of the conditional entropy breaks down for non-locally-Lipschitz classifiers, the authors also propose to incorporate virtual adversarial training in order to make the classifier well-behaved. The paper also argues that the performance on the target domain can be further improved by a post-hoc minimization of L_t using natural gradient descent (DIRT-T) which ensures that the decision boundary changes incrementally and slowly.    \n\nPros:\n+ The paper is written clearly and easy to read\n+ The idea to keep the decision boundary in the low-density region of the target domain makes sense\n+ The both proposed methods seem to be quite easy to implement and incorporate into existing DATNN-based frameworks\n+ The combination of VADA and DIRT-T performs better than existing DA algorithms on a range of visual DA benchmarks\n\nCons:\n- Table 1 can be a bit misleading as the performance improvements may be partially attributed to the fact that different methods employ different base NN architectures and different optimizers\n- The paper deals exclusively with visual domains; applying the proposed methods to other modalities would make this submission stronger\n\nOverall, I think it is a good paper and deserves to be accepted to the conference.

However, this task is not necessarily easy to succeed. The authors proposed a sound approach to learn a proper representation (in an adversarial way) and comply the cluster assumption.\n\nThe experiments show that this Virtual Adversarial Domain Adaptation network (VADA) achieves great results when compared to existing learning algorithms. Moreover, we also see the learned model is consistently improved using the proposed \"Decision-boundary Iterative Refinement Training with a Teacher\" (DIRT-T) approach.\n\nThe proposed methodology relies on multiple choices that could sometimes be better studied and/or explained. Namely, I would like to empirically see which role of the locally-Lipschitz regularization term (Equation 7). Also, I wonder why this term is tuned by an hyperparameter (lamda_s) for the source, while a single hyperparamer (lambda_t) is used for the sum of the two target quantity.\n \nOn the theoretical side, the discussion could be improved. Namely, Section 3 about \"limitation of domain adversarial training\" correctly explained that \"domain adversarial training may not be sufficient for domain adaptation if the feature extraction function has high-capacity\". It would be interesting to explain whether this observation is consistent with Theorem 1 of the paper (due to Ben-David et al., 2010), on which several domain adversarial approaches are based. The need to consider supplementary assumptions (such as ) to achieve good adaptation can also be studied through the lens of more recent Ben-David's work, e.g. Ben-David and Urner (2014). In the latter, the notion of \"Probabilistic Lipschitzness\", which is a relaxation of the \"cluster assumption\" seems very related to the actual work.\n\nReference:\nBen-David and Urner.

To improve the quality of the paper, we have made several adjustments to our paper in accordance with your review.\n\n\u201cNamely, I would like to empirically see which role of the locally-Lipschitz regularization term (Equation 7).\u201d\n\nThank you for the suggestion. We have included an extensive ablation study of the role of the locally-Lipschitz regularization term in Section 6.3.1. Our results show that while conditional entropy minimization alone is sufficient to instantiate the cluster assumption and improve over DANN, the additional incorporation of the locally-Lipschitz regularization term does indeed offer additional performance improvement.\n\n\u201cAlso, I wonder why this term is tuned by an hyperparameter (\u03bb_s) for the source, while a single hyperparamer (\u03bb_t) is used for the sum of the two target quantity\u201d\n\nThe choice to use \u03bb_t for the sum of the two target quantities is purely for simplicity. Since the official implementation of VAT (https://github.com/takerum/vat_tf) used the same weighting for the conditional entropy and virtual adversarial training, we opted to do that as well in the target domain.\n\n\u201cIt would be interesting to explain whether this observation is consistent with Theorem 1 of the paper (due to Ben-David et al., 2010)\u201d\n\nThank you for the suggestion. We have added the connection in Appendix E. In particular, we can show that, if the embedding function has infinite-capacity, the H\\DeltaH-divergence achieves the maximum value of 2 even when the feature distribution matching constraint is satisfied. This results in Theorem 1 becoming a vacuous upper bound.\n\n\u201cThe notion of \u2018Probabilistic Lipschitzness\u2019, which is a relaxation of the \u2018cluster assumption\u2019 seems very related to the actual work.\u201d\n\nThank you for this insight. We have incorporated a brief mention of probabilistic Lipschitzness in Section 2. It seems that a stronger connection can be made and we appreciate any additional suggestions you may have on how to better address probabilistic Lipschitzness in our paper.\n\n\u201cEquation 14: In the first term (target loss), theta should have an index t (I think).\u201d and \u201cBottom of page 6: \u2018... and that as our validation set\u2019 (missing word).\u201d\n\nFixed.

To improve the quality of the paper, we have made several adjustments to our paper in accordance with your review.\n\n\u201cTable 1 can be a bit misleading as the performance improvements may be partially attributed to the fact that different methods employ different base NN architectures and different optimizers\u201d\n\nThe purpose of Table 1 is to offer a holistic evaluation of the entire set-up. As such, it demonstrates that there exists a training objective + architecture + optimization configuration such significant improvements over previous methods/implementations are possible. We provided such a table in part because doing so seems to be standard practice in semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation papers (Miyato et al., 2017; Laine & Aila, 2016; Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017; Saito et al., 2017; French et al., 2017).\n\nTo offer a fairer comparison, we made the following modifications to the paper:\n\n1. We explicitly mention Table 2 in the main body of the paper, in the section Model Evaluation/Overall\n\n2. We added an ablation study to Section 6.3.1 to demonstrate the relative contribution of virtual adversarial training in comparison to our base implementation of domain adversarial training.\n\n\u201cThe paper deals exclusively with visual domains; applying the proposed methods to other modalities would make this submission stronger\u201d\n\nWe agree that the submission would be stronger by performing experiments in other modalities. To that end, we added an example of applying VADA and DIRT-T to a non-visual data in Section 6.2. We chose to apply our model to a Wi-Fi activity recognition dataset. Our results show that VADA significantly improves upon DANN. Unfortunately, due to the small target domain training set size, DIRT-T does not improve upon VADA. We provide additional experiments in Appendix F which suggest that VADA already achieves strong clustering on the Wi-Fi dataset, and therefore DIRT-T is not expected to improve performance in this situation.\n\nWe leave as future work the study of applying VADA/DIRT-T (and the general application of the cluster assumption) to text classification domain adaptation tasks. Given the success of VAT on text classification (Miyato et al., 2016), we are optimistic that this line of work is promising.\n\nReferences\nTakeru Miyato, Shin-ichi Maeda, Masanori Koyama, and Shin Ishii.

However, domain adversarial training faces two critical limitations: 1) if the feature extraction function has high-capacity, then feature distribution matching is a weak constraint, 2) in non-conservative domain adaptation (where no single classifier can perform well in both the source and target domains), training the model to do well on the source domain hurts performance on the target domain.
