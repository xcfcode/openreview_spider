The algorithm will increasingly set more weights to zero during the RNN training phase. This provides a RNN model with less storage requirement and higher inference rate. \n\nPros:\nProposes a pruning method that doesn\u2019t need re-training and doesn\u2019t affect the training phase of RNN. The method achieves 90% sparsity, and hence less number of parameters.\n\nCons & Questions:\nJudiciously choosing hyper parameters for different models and different applications wouldn\u2019t be cumbersome? In equation 1, is q the sparsity of final model? Is there a formula to know what is sparsity, number of parameters and accuracy of final model given a set of hyper parameters, before going through training? (Questions answered)\n\nIn table3, we see a trade-off between number of units and sparsity to achieve better number of parameters or accuracy, or in table5 better speed. Good, but where are the results for GRU sparse big? I mean, accuracy must be similar and still get decent compression rate and speed up. Just like RNN Sparse medium compared with RNN Dense. I can\u2019t see much advantage of pruning and getting high speed-up if you are sacrificing so much accuracy. (Issue fixed with updated data)\n\nWhy sparsity for table3 and table5 are different? In text: \u201caverage sparsity of 88%\u201d but in table5 is 95%? Are the models used in table3 different from table5?

Here are the answers to the questions:\n\n1. q is not the final sparsity of the model. As mentioned in the paper, q corresponds to the 90th percentile of the absolute value of the weights of a layer (from a previously trained model). Using this value and equation (1), we can pick reasonable hyper parameters for the pruning schedule. Using these parameters, the training achieves a sparsity of ~90% for a given layer. The hyper params can then be fine tuned to increase or decrease the sparsity. We also intend to perform some more experiments measuring the impact of varying sparsity on accuracy of the model. \n\n2. We will run the experiments for GRU sparse big and update the paper with the results. \n\n3. The text is misleading. It should say \u201coverall sparsity of 88%\u201d instead of \u201caverage sparsity of 88%\u201d. I have fixed this. The overall sparsity of the network is lower than the sparsity of the individual layers due of two reasons. Firstly, we don\u2019t prune the convolution layers and final CTC cost layer. Secondly, we  don\u2019t prune the batch norm and bias parameters. Therefore, the sparsity of the individual layer is higher than the overall sparsity of the network. In order to evaluate speed-ups, it makes sense to consider the individual layer sparsity.

The approach is applied to an RNN-based system which is trained and evaluated on a speech recognition dataset. The results indicate that large savings in test-time computations can be obtained without affecting the task performance too much. In some cases the method can actually improve the evaluation performance.\n\nThe experiments are done using a state-of-the-art RNN system and the methodology of those experiments seems sound. I like that the effect of the pruning is investigated for networks of very large sizes. The computational gains are clearly substantial. It is a bit unfortunate that all experiments are done using a private dataset. Even with private training data, it would have been nice to see an evaluation on a known test set like the HUB5 for conversational speech. It would also have been nice to see a comparison with some other pruning approaches given the similarity of the proposed method to the work by Han et al. [2] to verify the relative merit of the proposed pruning scheme. While single-stage training looks more elegant at first sight, it may not save much time if more experiments are needed to find good hyperparameter settings for the threshold adaptation scheme. Finally, the dense baseline would have been more convincing if it involved some model compression tricks like training on the soft targets provided by a bigger network.\n\nOverall, the paper is easy to read. The table and figure captions could be a bit more detailed but they are still clear enough. The discussion of potential future speed-ups of sparse recurrent neural networks and memory savings is interesting but not specific to the proposed pruning algorithm. The paper doesn\u2019t motivate the details of the method very well. It\u2019s not clear to me why the threshold has to ramp up after a certain period time for example. If this is based on preliminary findings, the paper should mention that.\n\nSparse neural networks have been the subject of research for a long time and this includes recurrent neural networks (e.g., sparse recurrent weight matrices were standard for echo-state networks [1]). The proposed method is also very similar to the work by Han et al. [2], where a threshold is used to prune weights after training, followed by a retraining phase of the remaining weights. While I think that it is certainly more elegant to replace this three stage procedure with a single training phase, the proposed scheme still contains multiple regimes that resemble such a process by first training without pruning followed by pruning at two different rates and finally training without further pruning again. The main novelty of the work would be the application of such a scheme to RNNs, which are typically more tricky to train than feedforward nets.\n\nImproving scalability is an important driving force of the progress in neural network research. While I don\u2019t think the paper presents much novelty in ideas or scientific insight, it does show that weight pruning can be successfully applied to large practical RNN systems without sacrificing much in performance. The fact that this is possible with such a simple heuristic is a result worth sharing.\n\n\nPros:\nThe proposed method is successful at reducing the number of parameters in RNNs substantially without sacrificing too much in performance.\nThe experiments are done using a state-of-the-art system for a practical application.\n\nCons:\nThe proposed method is very similar to earlier work and barely novel.\nThere is no comparison with other pruning methods.\nThe data is private and this prevents others from replicating the results.\n\n\n[1] Jaeger, H.
