When processing high-dimensional datasets, a common preprocessing\nstep is feature selection. Filter-based feature selection algorithms are not tailored to\na specific classification method, but rather rank the relevance of each feature with respect to the\ntarget and the task. The Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance is a measure for separability between two\ndistributions that has been used for filter based feature selection. It calculates for each feature the\nseparability strength between pairs of classes. In this work, a low-dimensional representation of\nthe JM measures for the feature space is formed by diffusion map. Diffusion maps organizes the\nfeatures by their class separation abilities. Moreover, feature elimination is performed based on\nthe distribution of the points in the low-dimensional space. Experimental results are provided for 3\npublic datasets and compared with known filter-based feature selection techniques.", "pdf": "/pdf/fa39ab49ef30657ee7bb71ba7890bc87dbc26b3c.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|graphbased_feature_representation_for_multiclass_classifications_using_the_jeffriesmatusita_distance", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021graphbased,\ntitle={{\\{}GRAPH{\\}}-{\\{}BASED{\\}} {\\{}FEATURE{\\}} {\\{}REPRESENTATION{\\}} {\\{}FOR{\\}} {\\{}MULTI{\\}}-{\\{}CLASS{\\}} {\\{}CLASSIFICATIONS{\\}} {\\{}USING{\\}} {\\{}THE{\\}} {\\{}JEFFRIES{\\}}-{\\{}MATUSITA{\\}} {\\{}DISTANCE{\\}}},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to ICLR 2021 Workshop on Geometrical and Topological Representation Learning},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=NzfacsJyzwL},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615225929161, "tmdate": 1615967298665, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
