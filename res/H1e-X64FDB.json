Also, the Tensorflow implementation should be briefly explained to make clear where these gains come from.\u201d\nWe will include more experimental results against Google\u2019s TensorFlow implementation for linear interpolation models (TensorFlow Lattice). In general, TF is slow due to dispatch time, and generally doesn\u2019t handle operations of sparse sets of data efficiently, and TF is especially ill-suited for simplex interpolation because of its sort operation.    \n\nRe: \u201cThe experiments put much focus on speed performance over different batch sizes, but this is (1) not the focus of the paper (unbatched CPU operation is the focus), and (2) is little informative because the introduced methods (which do not benefit much from batching) are not compared against Tensorflow (which does benefit from batching).\u201d\nWe note that even at large batch sizes, the Tensorflow implementation is substantially slower than the interpreter on models using kernels well-suited for a Tensorflow implementation.\n\nRe: \u201cNo ablation study is presented. The method description mentions informally how much speed-up is to be expected from different parts of the proposed method, but do not clarify how much this contributes to overall speed-gains.\u201d\nWe will add ablation studies (Fig. 2 does show the effect of just the optimized index-mapping). \n\nRe: \u201cThe description in 4.1 is rather hard to follow, even though the ideas behind it are relatively simple. An illustrative figure might be of help for readers.\u201d\nYes, we will include a illustrative figure in a final version.\n\nRe: \u201cThe method description in 4.1 lacks formal preciseness. For example, in 4.1. alpha, P, supp, are not defined (or in some cases introduced much after they are used first), and the \u201c+4\u201d in the beginning of page 5 appears out of nowhere.\u201d\n\nThanks for the note, we will make these definitions clearer. The \u201c+4\u201d figure comes from a calculation based on L1 cache access latency and arithmetic operations as given by Fog 2018, and was noted in section 2.1, but we\u2019ll make it clearer why it\u2019s showing up in Sec 4.1 \n\nRe: \u201cThe proposed bit-packing is not well motivated. It promises to save half of the memory at a minor loss in precision (at least for the double-precision case), but it is unclear how much of a bottleneck this memory consumption is in the first place. In addition, it remains unclear to me why this is relevant particularly in the shared index case.\u201d\n\nThe bit-packing is only used in the shared-index case, and not the single-calibration case. We note that memory latency is important, and due to the large numbers of inputs in our models, this optimization increases the size of models which can be executed using stack-allocated memory instead of heap-allocated memory, reducing the number of much costlier cache misses. Note that this also affects the batch size that can be executed on stack before spilling into heap memory.\n\nRe: \u201creaders are likely not familiar with some of the concepts used in the paper, and a bit more explanation is needed.\u201d\nWe will add brief explanations of these terms.\n\nRe: The introduction could be a bit more concrete on describing tasks where PWLs are relevant.\nWithout the restriction of blind review, we will be able to give additional concrete examples.  GAMs (which either directly use a sum of PWLs or can be approximately implemented with PWLs) are a standard modeling approach by statisticians, and many papers can be found applying GAMs to real-world problems.  Here\u2019s a nice recent public post by Microsoft on the importance of GAMs: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/how-to-guides/use-gams-for-model-explainability\nSee also this Facebook paper on using GAMs for forecasting: \nhttps://peerj.com/preprints/3190/\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper439/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper439/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Fast Linear Interpolation for Piecewise-Linear Functions, GAMs, and Deep Lattice Networks", "authors": ["Nathan Zhang", "Kevin Canini", "Sean Silva", "and Maya R.

", "comment": "We hope these responses give you more perspective on the novelty and significance.\n\nRe: \u201cBut my impression is that achieving speed up using existing MLIR framework has no surprising novelty. \u201c\nThe key novelty here is that we show that ML models with many small ops (here, linear interpolation ops) are not bottlenecked by their computation, but by the interpreter itself, and we additionally present low-level optimizations and data-handling that enable incredibly fast runtimes on widely available CPUs.  This is in contrast to ML models with large matrix operations (like ResNet or DNN\u2019s) where the interpreter is a small fraction of total runtime, and have well-studied primitives.\n\n\nRe: \u201cThis is only consider optimization on CPUs. What about the case of using GPUs?\u201d\nEvaluation runtimes in our experiments are at or below the typical GPU latency of around 10 microseconds, so our CPU implementation would already have finished by the time you moved the data to a GPU.  \n\nRe: \u201cIs branch free assumption for functions \u2018Adjust\u2019 & \u2018T\u2019 is valid?

This paper is focused on models with runtimes in the microseconds or nanoseconds.  In production systems such models can run early in a latency-critical pipeline, or many such models may need to be run serially, making speed-ups important.  \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper439/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper439/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Fast Linear Interpolation for Piecewise-Linear Functions, GAMs, and Deep Lattice Networks", "authors": ["Nathan Zhang", "Kevin Canini", "Sean Silva", "and Maya R.

Note that in Equation 2 and Equation 3, we propose an objective to optimize to find T, which as the reviewer notes can be expressed as an optimal transport problem. However, because in these applications T must be fast to evaluate, as measured by $C_T$ in equation 3, we can restrict our attention to a small set of possible T that take few instructions. As noted in Section 4.1, we only allow the compiler to select between 3 choices of T in all our experiments (Identity, Log2, Exp -  note that Log2 and Exp are implemented with fast bitwise approximations). While this may not minimize Equation 3, we find empirically that this produces a function T requiring an adjustment cost of at most 3 steps forward. As a result, we do not believe there is significant headroom to improve the choice of T, as more complex choices of T will incur a larger runtime cost $C_T$. As per Equation 3, T is selected based on worst-case behavior over the support of P, and therefore the performance of the algorithm is invariant with respect to distribution shifts within the same support. Additionally, inputs outside of the support of P are clipped to the support and thus do not produce decreases in performance.\n\nResponse to (3):\nThe shared indices apply to the standard case where the N input keypoints are assigned to be the N quantiles over the input distribution of a particular feature $x$. Note that input distribution is the same for all calibrators acting on the same feature $x$, thus the quantiles are the same, and thus the keys for each of the calibrators are the same and can be shared. Of course, as the reviewer notes, the output values in the key-value pairs are different for each of the calibrators.  (Assigning the N keypoints to the quantiles is done to make sure an equal amount of training data is available to train each output value, to reduce overfitting or degeneracy). \n\nResponse to (4):\nFor all our experiments, we use the standard quantile initialization of the keys, so they are not trained, and are denser where the feature $x$ is denser. A more accurate piecewise linear function is obtained by using more keypoints K. As we have shown in this paper, our runtime is largely independent of K as long as you compile for that K, though there can be nonlinear caching impact of increasing K. \n\nResponse to (5): \nAs noted in Section 7, the output values differed by no more than $10^{-13}$ for a double implementation, but did differ by up to $10^{-4}$ for a float implementation. In a final version, we will add the effect on classifier accuracy of these small changes.  \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper439/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper439/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Fast Linear Interpolation for Piecewise-Linear Functions, GAMs, and Deep Lattice Networks", "authors": ["Nathan Zhang", "Kevin Canini", "Sean Silva", "and Maya R.

In the case where training is required or finetuning is needed to adapt the system to another distribution, the the proposed auxiliary LUT could have a hard time mapping input data properly.\n\n(2) In my understanding, the transformation, T: supp(P) -> R, is assumed to be known whilst IMO it is crucial to the proposed method. A non-trivial effort is expected in finding T, and a whole area of research is dedicated to this which is Optimal Transport. Currently, plausible and computationally efficient method is through Sinkhorn algorithm. I don't think the paper should downplay the part of finding T as it is crucial.\n\n(3) In the shared Index PWLs, the paper seems to have ignored the fact that different functions still have different output values, and different key-value pairs are indeed needed. For example, log(x) and x^2 (as used in the paper) have different input domains and output domains, so sharing indices between two functions is impossible. Could the authors elaborate on why it is okay to share indices?\n\n(4) A necessary process of LUT from piece-wise linear functions of approximating the ones that we care about is to conduct 1-D density estimation on the input domain, since more fine-grained splits are required in the dense area and less splits elsewhere. The proposed methods in this paper seem to have largely ignored this effect. For example, log(x) needs splits with smaller intervals when the x is around 1. \n\n(5) The presented results only include the speed of the forward computation of several models. It is okay if there is a performance (accuracy or likelihood) and speed trade-off, but the paper didn't present any results on this. Could the authors present some results for this?\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper439/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper439/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Fast Linear Interpolation for Piecewise-Linear Functions, GAMs, and Deep Lattice Networks", "authors": ["Nathan Zhang", "Kevin Canini", "Sean Silva", "and Maya R.

The paper is very practically oriented in the sense that it does not aim for improving asymptotic speed-ups, but rather real speed-ups expressible in terms of CPU cycles that are achievable by exploiting compiler optimizations such as branch prediction and loop unrolling. The focus is on unbatched computations which can arise in many real-time situations. The proposed implementation techniques are as follows:\n- A method for fast index mapping, which first transforms inputs using a monotonic function such as log_2 or 2^x, and the applying a branch-free linear search implementation on a uniformly-spaced auxiliary LUT.\n- A memory-efficient bit-packing technique to store both integer and floating point representations together.\n- Speed-up for multilinear interpolation using latency hiding\n- Branch-free implementation of sorting permutation, needed for simplex interpolation\nThe proposed implementation is then evaluated on 4 different benchmarks, with considerable speed gains over interpreter-based baselines, while batching and single-vs-double precision do not have major impact on speed.\n\nWhile the paper is relevant and interesting, and the proposed techniques are reasonable and probably result of a considerable amount of work, more effort is needed to improve clarity and preciseness of the explanations, and (most importantly) the experimental evaluation. Detailed strengths and weaknesses are outlined below.\n\nStrengths\n- The paper is well-motivated and relevant to the ML community\n- Low-level speed optimizations are needed but overlooked in the community\n- Reasonable choice of experimental conditions (focus on unbatched CPU evaluation, testing on a selection of 4 different tasks)\n- Proposed techniques are sensible\n\nWeaknesses (roughly in order of decreasing significance)\n- Gains over Tensorflow performance is advertised in the intro, but only mentioned anecdotally in the experiments. Also, the Tensorflow implementation should be briefly explained to make clear where these gains come from.\n- The experiments put much focus on speed performance over different batch sizes, but this is (1) not the focus of the paper (unbatched CPU operation is the focus), and (2) is little informative because the introduced methods (which do not benefit much from batching) are not compared against Tensorflow (which does benefit from batching).\n- No ablation study is presented. The method description mentions informally how much speed-up is to be expected from different parts of the proposed method, but do not clarify how much this contributes to overall speed-gains.\n- The description in 4.1 is rather hard to follow, even though the ideas behind it are relatively simple. An illustrative figure might be of help for readers.\n- The method description in 4.1 lacks formal preciseness. For example, in 4.1. alpha, P, supp, are not defined (or in some cases introduced much after they are used first), and the \u201c+4\u201d in the beginning of page 5 appears out of nowhere.\n- The proposed bit-packing is not well motivated. It promises to save half of the memory at a minor loss in precision (at least for the double-precision case), but it is unclear how much of a bottleneck this memory consumption is in the first place. In addition, it remains unclear to me why this is relevant particularly in the shared index case.\n- While the topic is relevant for this conference, readers are likely not familiar with some of the concepts used in the paper, and a bit more explanation is needed. An example for this is \u201cbranch prediction\u201d, which is a key concept; readers unfamiliar with this compiler concept will likely not understand the paper, and a brief explanation is needed. Another example is \u201cloop-carry dependency\u201d, a term that could be explained in a short footnote. A third example is FPGA, which is mentioned in the very last sentence without further explanation/justification.\n- The introduction could be a bit more concrete on describing tasks where PWLs are relevant"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper439/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper439/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Fast Linear Interpolation for Piecewise-Linear Functions, GAMs, and Deep Lattice Networks", "authors": ["Nathan Zhang", "Kevin Canini", "Sean Silva", "and Maya R.

They achieved speedups by reducing 1) fixed overhead cost and 2) per example computation (linear interpolation operation level optimization).\nAuthors consider this problem for small operation models like linear interpolation rather than the models requiring large operations such as ResNet. In this case, dispatch overhead cannot be ignored and so they use the MLIR frameworks to optimize trained model into the C++ code (reducing fixed overhead cost). This results in 2-3x speed up. Secondly, they propose the way to construct auxiliary index-mapping function by considering spacing of the key points rather just using for example evenly spaced index-mapping.\nThey compare proposed method to C++ interpreter implementation on two-layer and deep lattice networks and achieve 5-10x speed improvements.\n\nIt seems the topic of this paper does not fit ICLR and most machine learning researchers are unlikely to be interested in and even understand this paper. This reviewer also does not have enough knowledge and background to judge this paper.
