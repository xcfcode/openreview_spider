However, provided only a few training examples, many tasks are ambiguous. Such ambiguity can be mitigated with side information in terms of weak labels which is often readily available. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian gradient-based meta-learning algorithm that can incorporate weak labels to reduce task ambiguity and improve performance. Our approach is cast in the framework of amortized variational inference and trained by optimizing a variational lower bound. The proposed method is competitive to state-of-the-art methods and achieves significant performance gains in settings where weak labels are available.", "pdf": "/pdf/fff437b55b20556ee453845fbb2a4f04b0804ba1.pdf", "proposed_reviewers": "", "paperhash": "anonymous|fewshotlearning_with_weak_supervision", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021fewshotlearning,\ntitle={{\\{}FEW{\\}}-{\\{}SHOTLEARNING{\\}}  {\\{}WITH{\\}} {\\{}WEAK{\\}} {\\{}SUPERVISION{\\}}},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to Learning to Learn - Workshop at ICLR 2021},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=VmNVLQ2Pd3K},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "proposed_reviewers": {"value-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615595596483, "tmdate": 1615844205826, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
