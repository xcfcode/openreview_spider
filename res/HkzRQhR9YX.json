This appears to be the key difference between the proposed framework and the previous work of (Linderman et al., 2017) on recurrent switching dynamical systems that partition the dynamic space sequentially at the same level of resolution.\n\nThis seems like a non-trivial extension to the previous work of (Linderman et al., 2017) & I tend to consider this a novel contribution. That said, the paper was also not positioned against existing literature on hierarchical switching linear dynamic systems (see below) & I find it hard to evaluate the significance of the proposed framework (which explains the borderline rating)\n\n\"A Hierarchical Switching Linear Dynamical System applied to the detection of sepsis in neonatal condition monitoring\", Ioan Stanculescu, Christopher K. I. Williams and Yvonne Freer. In Proceeding of the 30th Conference on Uncertainty in AI (UAI-14), pages 752-761\n\nCould the authors please discuss the differences between the proposed work & (at least) the above? \n\nTECHNICAL SOUNDNESS:\n\nThe technical exposition makes sense to me. Please also discuss the processing complexity of the resulting TrSLDS framework. In exchange for the improved performance, how much slower TrSLDS is as compared\nto rSLDS? I am interested to see this demonstrated in the empirical studies.\n\nCLARITY:\n\nThe paper is clearly written.\n\nEMPIRICAL RESULTS:\n\nThe experiments look interesting and are very extensive on both test domains. However, I do not understand why the authors decided not to compare with rSLDS using its benchmark? \n\nI find this somewhat sloppy and hope the authors would clarify this too. \n\n****\n\nPost-rebuttal update: The authors have made significant revision to their work, which sufficiently addressed all my concerns.

In Stanculescu et al. 2014., they propose adding a layer to factorized SLDS where the top-level discrete latent variables determine the conditional distribution of z_t, with no dependence on x_{t-1}. While the tree-structured stick-breaking used in TrSLDS is also a hierarchy of discrete latent variables, the model proposed in Stanculescu et al. 2014., has no hierarchy of dynamics, preventing it from obtaining a multi-scale view of the dynamics. Stanculescu et al. (2014) also reference preceding work on hierarchical SLDS by Zoeter & Heskes (2003), the only example they found in the literature. In Zoeter & Heskes (2003), the authors construct a tree of SLDSs where an SLDS with K possible discrete states is first fit. An SLDS with M discrete states is then fit to each of the K clusters of points. This process continues iteratively, building a hierarchical collection of SLDSs that allow for a multi-scale, low-dimensional representation of the observed data. While similar in spirit to TrSLDS, there are key differences between the two models.\nFirst, it is through the tree-structured prior that TrSLDS obtains a multi-scale view of the dynamics, thus we only need to fit one instantiation of TrSLDS; in contrast, they fit a separate SLDS for each node in the tree, which is computationally expensive. There is also no explicit probabilistic connection between the dynamics of a parent and child in Zoeter & Heskes (2003). We also note that TrSLDS aims to learn a multi-scale view of the dynamics while Zoeter & Heskes (2003) focuses on smoothing, that is, they aim to learn a multi-scale view of the latent states corresponding to data but not suitable for forecasting. We have amended the manuscript to include a section discussing prior and related work.\n\n>>Technical Soundness\nThe rSLDS and the TrSLDS share the same linear time complexity for sampling the discrete and continuous states, and both models learn K-1 hyperplanes to weakly partition the space. Specifically, both models incur: an O(TK) cost for sampling the discrete states, which increases to O(TK^2) if we allow Markovian dependencies between discrete states; an O(TD^3) cost (D is the continuous state dimension) for sampling the continuous states, just like in a linear dynamical system; and an O(KD^3) cost for sampling the hyperplanes. The only additional cost of the TrSLDS stems from the hierarchical prior on state dynamics.  Unlike the rSLDS, we impose a tree-structured prior on the dynamics to encourage similar dynamics between nearby nodes in the tree.  Rather than sampling K dynamics parameters, we need to sample 2K-1.  Since they are all related via a tree-structured Gaussian graphical model, the cost of an exact sample is O(KD^3) just as in the rSLDS, with the only difference being a constant factor of about 2. Thus, we obtain a multi-scale view of the underlying system with a negligible effect on the computational complexity. We have amended the manuscript to make this clear.\n\nWe also note that tree-structured stick-breaking utilized by TrSLDS is a strict generalization of the sequential stick-breaking used by rSLDS. We can recover sequential stick-breaking from tree-structured stick-breaking by enforcing the left node at each level in the tree to be a leaf node. Our experiments only considered balanced binary trees for simplicity, but an interesting avenue of future work is to learn the tree structure, perhaps through additional MCMC. Learning such discrete representations is highly non-trivial and demands further investigation outside this submission.  We have amended the manuscript to make this connection explicit.\n\n>>Empirical Results\nThe Lorenz attractor in experiment 2 was also used in as a benchmark for the rSLDS (Linderman et al, 2017; Fig. 4). The only difference is that Linderman et al generated binary observations with a Bernoulli GLM emission model. For completeness, we ran TrSLDS on the synthetic nascar example used to test rSLDS in Linderman et al. (2017) to see if we could recover the dynamics and the discrete latent state assignments and included the results in the appendix. We also note that we included another example in the appendix where the data generated from an alternative version of the synthetic nascar example from Linderman et al. (2017) where the underlying model is a TrSLDS and compared both TrSLDS and rSLDS.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1408/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1408/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1408/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Tree-Structured Recurrent Switching Linear Dynamical Systems for Multi-Scale Modeling", "abstract": "Many real-world systems studied are governed by complex, nonlinear dynamics.

Like switching linear dynamical systems (sLDS) the proposed models capture non-linear dynamics by switching between a collection of linear regimes. However, unlike SLDS, the transition between the regimes is a function of a latent tree as well as the preceding continuous latent state. Experiments on synthetic data as well as neural spike train data are presented to demonstrate the utility of the model.\n\nThe paper is clearly written and easy to read. The tree structured model (TrSLDS) is a sensible extension to rSLDS. While one wouldn\u2019t expect TrSLDS to necessarily fit the data any better than rSLDS, the potential for recovering multi-scale, possibly more interpretable decompositions of the dynamic process is compelling. \n\nWhile the authors do provide some evidence of being able to recover such multi-scale structures, overall the experiments are underwhelming and somewhat sloppy. First, to understand whether the sampler is mixing well, it would be nice to include an experiment where the true dynamics and the entire latent structure (including the discrete states) are known, and then to examine how well this ground-truth structure is recovered. Second, for the results presented in section 5, how many iterations was the sampler run for? In the figures, what is being visualized?, the last sample?, the MAP sample? or something else? I am not sure what to make of the real data experiment in section 5.3. Wouldn\u2019t rSLDS produce nearly identical results? What is TrSLDS buying us in this scenario? Do the higher levels of the tree capture interesting low resolution dynamics that are not shown for some reason? \n\nMy other big concern is scalability. To use larger number of discrete states one would need deeper (or wider if the binary requirement is relaxed) trees. How well does the sampler scale with the number of discrete states? How long did the sampler take for the various 4-state results presented in the paper? \n\nMinor:\na) There is a missing citation in the first para fo Section 5. \nb) Details of message passing claimed to be in the supplement are missing.\n\n============\nThere are interesting ideas in this paper. However, experimental section could better highlight the benefits afforded by the model and scalability concerns need to be addressed.\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1408/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Tree-Structured Recurrent Switching Linear Dynamical Systems for Multi-Scale Modeling", "abstract": "Many real-world systems studied are governed by complex, nonlinear dynamics.

We note that we added a section to the Appendix comparing the computational complexity of TrSLDS and rSLDS in which it states that the computational complexity of TrSLDS is of the same order as rSLDS; for specifics please refer to our response to AnonReviewer 1. Thus, we obtain a multi-scale view of the underlying system with a negligible effect on the computational complexity.

In both synthetic experiments, the predictive power of TrSLDS is at least as much rSLDS. \n\nTo better highlight the differences between TrSLDS and rSLDS, we added two more examples in the appendix.

The space is partitioned into 4 sections using sequential stick-breaking, where the trajectories trace out oval tracks similar to a NASCAR track. TrSLDS was fit to see if it could recover the dynamics even though it relies on tree-structured stick-breaking. From Fig. 6, it is evident that TrSLDS can recover the dynamics and obtain a multi-scale view. The second example is a twist on the TrSLDS, where the underlying model is a TrSLDS i.e. the space is partitioned using tree-structured stick-breaking (Fig. 7). We ran TrSLDS and rSLDS and compared their predictive performance using k-step R^2. From Fig. 7, we can see that rSLDS could not adequately learn the vector field due to its reliance on sequential stick-breaking.

We note that tree-structured stick-breaking utilized by TrSLDS is a strict generalization of the sequential stick-breaking used in rSLDS. As stated in the response to AnonReviewer1 above, we can recover sequential stick-breaking from tree-structured stick-breaking by enforcing the left node at each level in the tree to be a leaf node. We have amended the manuscript to make this connection explicit.\n\nSince tree-structured stick-breaking is a strict generalization of sequential stick-breaking, the  expressive power of TrSLDS theoretically subsumes that of rSLDS. The question reduces to a comparison of tree structures; in our experiments, a comparison of right-branching trees to balanced binary trees. We emphasize this by including two new examples in the appendix in which the true dynamics and the entire latent structure are known; the first being the \u201csynthetic Nascar\u201d example used in Linderman et al. (2017), where the true model follows a right-branching tree, as in the standard rSLDS, to emphasize that we can effectively learn these dynamics with a tree-structured model. The second example is a twist on the synthetic Nascar where the underlying model is a TrSLDS and where we test both rSLDS and TrSLDS. In this example (Fig. 7), rSLDS fails due to the sequential nature of stick-breaking that cannot adequately capture the locally-linear dynamics.\n\n>>Experiment Section\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out the missing information in the experiments section and have amended the manuscript with corrections. As stated above, we have included two more examples in the appendix to highlight not only the expressive power of TrSLDS, but also to show that the sampler is indeed mixing well. Concerning the real data experiment, we have amended the manuscript with more results from the analysis. The orientations were chosen to resemble a tree where orientations 140 and 150 have the same parent; the same is true for orientations 230 and 240. Thanks to the multi-scale nature of TrSLDS, the method is able to learn this relation and assigns the two groups to different subtrees. It then refines the dynamics by focusing on each of these two groups separately. \n\n>>Scalability\nThe computational complexity of TrSLDS is of the same order as rSLDS; for specifics please refer to our response to AnonReviewer 1.\n\nTo address the concerns regarding the samplers mixing speed as a function of number of discrete states, we fit a TrSLDS with K = 2, 4, 8 discrete states, keeping the amount of data used to train the model fixed, and plotted the log joint density as function of samples and included it in the appendix. From the plots, the sampler seems to converge to a  mode of the posterior after about 150-250 samples for each of the various numbers of discrete states. Due to the nature of Gibbs sampling, we are limited to batch updates to each of the conditional posteriors. While scalability has not been an issue in our experiments,  we will explore stochastic variational approaches in future work.\n\n>>Minor\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out these minor mistakes and have corrected them in the amended manuscript.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1408/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1408/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1408/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Tree-Structured Recurrent Switching Linear Dynamical Systems for Multi-Scale Modeling", "abstract": "Many real-world systems studied are governed by complex, nonlinear dynamics.
