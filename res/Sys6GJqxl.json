In fact, we have added a contribution section to highlight the most important take-aways. We will rework the story part of the paper as suggested to make the messages come across. \n\nWe choose to report the results for three ResNet models, because these results show the transferability between models using the same architecture but with different hyper-parameters. As an in-depth study, we believe both same-architecture transferability and cross-architecture transferability are meaningful to investigate. In fact, we indeed make some interesting unexpected and expected observations: \n1) using single-model approaches, transferability between ResNet models is not significantly better than other models. For example, VGG-16\u2019s transferability to ResNet-50 is better than both ResNet-101\u2019s and ResNet-152\u2019s (Table 2);\n2) at the same time, we found that ResNet models are more frequently making the same mistakes than others (Table 3).\nThere are more findings, and we will highlight them in the next revision.\n\nFor AlexNet and NIN, we had technical issues, i.e., we cannot choose 100 images from the testset that all models make correct predictions for them. We can mitigate this issue by omitting the model with the lowest test accuracy, i.e., AlexNet, choosing a smaller test set, or choosing test images not only from the ILSVRC validation dataset but also from its training dataset. However, any of these choices will require a re-run of all experiments. We will work on this, but given the expected time to be consumed, we are afraid that we may not have time to update the paper to reflect these results before Jan 19, 2017.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Delving into Transferable Adversarial Examples and Black-box Attacks", "abstract": "An intriguing property of deep neural networks is the existence of adversarial examples, which can transfer among different architectures.

We are happy to incorporate the suggestions on trimming the paper, but we also notice that other reviewers indeed consider the length of this paper as a strength. We will work hard to maximize the information-noise ratio.\n\n2. We asked for the full citation since we are unclear how to cite this work properly. A url alone is not enough to resolve this issue. So we still hope the reviewer can provide the full citation, so that we can cite it properly. To our understanding, this paper is from the Perturbations, Optimization, and Statistics workshop accompanying NIPS 2016. Thus we do not think that the appearance of this (likely workshop) article hinders the novelty of our paper. \n\nDespite this issue, we have carefully studied the article mentioned in the review. Fig 1.2-1.4 are all drawn using models trained on CIFAR-10 dataset, which has only 10 labels. Models showed throughout our paper (including Section 6) are trained over ImageNet, which contains 1,000 classes. We want to emphasize that we do not claim the methodology to conduct the geometric analysis as our contributions, but the new findings in Section 6 are. Examining ImageNet models is the main point of our work, and it allows us to make unique findings that are not presented in any other work (including the one mentioned in the review):\n(1) Gradient directions of different models in our examination are orthogonal to each other (see page 11 Table 9)\n(2) Although there are 1000 classes, on a 2-D plot, there are at most 21 regions (see page 13 Table 10 for results, page 12 for text)\n(3) The width of ground truth region is thinner than its height. (see page 13 Figure 5, page 13 for text)\n(4) Other novel findings are presented in Section 6, and we do not want to flood this response by repeating all of them one by one.\n\nTo sum up, we believe that most of Section 6 are novel findings. We can also add a statement somewhere in Section 6 to emphasize that all these results are not presented in prior works.\n\n3. We are not quite following reviewer\u2019s comments here. We agree that Szegedy et al (2013) and Goodfellow et al (2014) made the observation that ImageNet models also have adversarial examples, but our paper is studying the transferability among ImageNet models, which we do not see before, except a concurrent work by Moosavi-Dezfooli et al (2016) (cited in our submission). We presume that the reviewer refers to Kurakin et al (2016) as the following paper:\nAlexey Kurakin, Ian Goodfellow, Samy Bengio, Adversarial examples in the physical world, arxiv: 1607.02533\nHowever, this paper is also not studying the transferability.\n\nTo sum up, we believe that we have made it very clear (from title, to abstract, to introduction, and throughout the paper) that the focus of this paper is on transferability of large models. We would appreciate the reviewer to explain better about this point and how we can improve.\n\n4. Papernot et al (2016) uses Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s services as black-box model providers to perform the attack, but both the training data set and the label set is provided by the authors. Therefore, in their paper, only the model and the training process is a black-box to the adversary. In contrast, we attack clarifai.com that we know nothing about: we do not know the training data, the model, and the training process; even the label set is unknown to us, and our observation shows that it is different from that of ImageNet. Furthermore, we not only perform non-targeted attacks, but also targeted attacks. All of these show that we are actually solving a much harder problem than that in Papernot et al (2016). We can make this point clearer in our paper.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Delving into Transferable Adversarial Examples and Black-box Attacks", "abstract": "An intriguing property of deep neural networks is the existence of adversarial examples, which can transfer among different architectures.

Specifically, an attack aims to fool the classification system with a specially corrupted image, i.e. making it misclassify the image as (1) any wrong class (non-targeted attack) or (2) a target class, chosen in advance by the attacker (targeted attack). For instance, the attacker could corrupt an image of an ostrich in such a way that it would be classified as a megalith. Even though the attacker's agenda is not so clear in this example, it is still interesting to study the weaknesses of current systems in view of (1) improving them in general and (2) actual risks with e.g. autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe paper is mostly experimental. In short, it compares different strategies (already published in previous papers) for all popular networks  (VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet-50/101/152) and the two aforementionned types of attacks. The experiments are well conducted and clearly exposed. A convincing point is that attacks are also conducted on \"clarifai.com\" which is a black-box classification system. Some analysis and insightful explanations are also provided to help understanding why CNNs are prone to such attacks (Section 6).\n\nTo sum up, the main findings are that non-targeted attacks are easy to perform, even on a black-box system. Non-targeted attacks are more difficult to realize with existing schemes, but the authors propose a new approach for that that vastly improves over existing attacks (even though it's still far from perfect: ~20% success rate on clarifai.com versus 2% with previous schemes).\n\nArguably, The paper still has some weaknesses:\n\n - The authors are treating the 3 ResNet-based networks as different, yet they are obviously clearly correlated. See Table 7 for instance. This is naturally expected because their architecture is similar (only their depth varies). Hence, it does not sound very fair to state that \"One interesting finding is that [...] the first misclassified label (non-targeted) is the same for all models except VGG-16 and GoogLeNet.\", i.e., the three ResNet-based networks.\n\n - A subjective measure is employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the attacks on the black box system. While this is for a good reason (clarifai.com returns image labels that are different from ImageNet), it is not certain that the reported numbers are fair (even though the qualitative results look convincing).\n\n - The novelty of the proposed approach (optimizing an ensemble of network instead of a single network) is limited. However, this was not really the point of the paper, and it is effective, so it seems ok overall.\n\n - The paper is quite long. This is expected because it is an extensive evaluation study, but still. I suggest the authors prune some near-duplicate content (e.g. Section 2.3 has a high overlap with Section 1, etc.).\n\n - The paper would benefit from additional discussions with the recent and related work of Fawzi et al (NIPS'16) in Section 6. Indeed the work of Fawzi et al. is mostly theoretical and well aligned with the experimental findings and observations (in particular in Section 6).\n\n\nTo conclude, I think that this paper is somewhat useful for the community and could help to further improve existing architectures, as well as better assess their flaws and weaknesses.", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Delving into Transferable Adversarial Examples and Black-box Attacks", "abstract": "An intriguing property of deep neural networks is the existence of adversarial examples, which can transfer among different architectures.

The authors confirm that transferability exists even in large models but demonstrate that it is difficult to manipulate the network to adversarially perturb an image into a specifically desired label. The authors additionally demonstrate real world attacks on a vision web service and explore the geometric properties of adversarial examples.\n\nMajor Comments:\n1. The paper contains a list of many results and it is not clear what single message this paper provides. As mentioned in the comments, this paper is effectively 15 pages and 9 page of results in the Appendix heavily discussed throughout the main body of the paper. Although there is no strict page limit for this conference, I do feel this pushes the spirit of a conference publication. I do not rule out this paper for acceptance based on the length but I do hold it as a negative because clarity of presentation is an important quality. If this paper is ultimately accepted, I would suggest that the authors make some effort to cut down the length even further beyond the 13 pages posted elsewhere. I have marked some sections to highlight areas that may be trimmed.\n\n2. The section of geometric understanding is similar to results of 'Adversarial Perturbations of Deep Neural Networks' in Warde-Farley and Goodfellow (2015). See Figure 1.2. I am not clear what the authors show above-and-beyond these results. If there are additional findings, the authors should emphasize them.\n\n3. The authors expand on observations by Goodfellow et al (2014) and Szegedy et al (2013) demonstrating that large-scale models are susceptible to adversarial perturbations (see also Kurakin et al (2016)). The authors additionally demonstrate that attempting to perform adversarial manipulation to convert an image to a particular, desired label is more difficult.\n\n4. The authors demonstrate that they can target a real-world vision API. These results are compelling but it is not clear what these results demonstrate above-and-beyond Papernot et al (2016). \n\nAs far I can understand, I think that the most interesting result from this paper not previously described in the literature is to note about the unique difficulty about performing adversarial manipulation to convert an image to a particular, desired label. The rest of the results appear to expand on other results that have already appeared in the literature and the authors need to better explain what these makes these results unique above-and-beyond previous work.\n\nAreas to Trim the Paper:\n- Table 1 is not necessary. Just cite other results or write the Top-1 numbers in the text.\n- Condense Section 2.2.1 and cite heavily.\n- Figure 2 panels may be overlaid to highlight a comparison.\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Delving into Transferable Adversarial Examples and Black-box Attacks", "abstract": "An intriguing property of deep neural networks is the existence of adversarial examples, which can transfer among different architectures.

Excluding the references and the appendix, the paper is 14.5 pages long right now.\n\nWe believe this paper is addressing one important problem, and thus cannot be divided into two papers. In fact, we try to provide an extensive analysis of the transferability phenomenon.  To this end, we include evaluations for not only existing popular methods to generate adversarial examples, but also our new proposal. The latter indeed demonstrates an intriguing property that is not shown by prior methods --- targeted transferability. We believe that such an extensive evaluation is necessary to have a full understanding of the phenomenon. This is why this paper becomes both long and dense.\n\nHaving said this, however, we can indeed move some interesting but secondary findings into the appendix to shrink the main body down to around 12-13 pages. However, as we have discussed above, we believe most of the current materials are necessary to be presented to the readers.\n\nAlso, although the appropriateness of using additional pages is judged by reviewers, we do not think a judgment solely based on the number of pages without reviewing the content is fair to us or is consistent with the spirit of ICLR.\n\nTo sum up, we are happy to move secondary results to the appendix if the number of pages is indeed an issue. But we have received pre-review questions from other reviewers. To avoid confusion, we would like to wait for the full reviews from all reviewers first before updating the paper, in case some reviewers may think some results to be important though we may think they are secondary.

Take the original image of the one in http://postimg.org/image/sdsguxrnn/ as an example, our goal is to mislead Clarifai.com to output a tag related to \"bee eater\" (see Table 11 in the paper), which is a kind of birds. For the adversarial example generated using our method (i.e., an ensemble-based approach), Clairifai.com returns tags such as \"ornithology,avian,beak,wing,feather\", which are all related to birds.

Finally, we show that the adversarial examples generated using ensemble-based approaches can successfully attack Clarifai.com, which is a black-box image classification system.", "pdf": "/pdf/978205dd6095246709f97a4ec11279e65df57035.pdf", "paperhash": "liu|delving_into_transferable_adversarial_examples_and_blackbox_attacks", "keywords": ["Computer vision", "Deep learning", "Applications"], "conflicts": ["sjtu.edu.cn", "berkeley.edu"], "authors": ["Yanpei Liu", "Xinyun Chen", "Chang Liu", "Dawn Song"], "authorids": ["resodo.liu@gmail.com", "jungyhuk@gmail.com", "liuchang@eecs.berkeley.edu", "dawnsong@cs.berkeley.edu"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "duedate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "tmdate": 1485287706724, "id": "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper160/public/comment", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["~"], "reply": {"forum": "Sys6GJqxl", "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*|\\(anonymous\\)"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*|\\(anonymous\\)", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "value-dropdown": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/organizers", "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/ACs_and_organizers", "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/reviewers_and_ACS_and_organizers"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"order": 2, "description": "Your comment or reply.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,20000}"}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper160/reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper160/areachairs"], "cdate": 1485287706724}}}], "count": 23}
