The people who create the data have no stake in the final result and thus little incentive to do a good job.\"  \n\nBut crowd workers are incentived to do good work because they don't want their work to be rejected.  It is common wisdom within the HCI / human computation community that workers will produce good work if you design the task clearly. The fault in getting bad data is almost always on the side of the researcher for not designing a good task. (You can get a sense for this if you watch your requester ratings/reviews on Turkopticon or similar platforms)\n\nThe authors motivate their system for computational resources as a way to prevent copying data.\n\nIn my opinion, computational resources is actually a much bigger factor than access to data in the type of work that a researcher can do in machine learning. We are surrounded by data, and storage is cheap. But computation remains prohibitively expensive.\n\nFor this reason, thinking about how to create a commons for computational resources could be a great idea. The authors don't deal with the economics of their platform, though. Is there a way for it to be a shared resource that can allow under-resourced labs to increase their computational capacity?\n\nThat said, there are huge problems with platforms like MTurk in terms of workers rights, and the authors' proposal could help that situation.  Providing ownership of data to crowd workers is a nice idea not just for incentivizing them, but also for empowering them. \n\nIt's not clear from the paper how the data infrastructure outside etherium would be supported or maintained. It seems there must be some additional scaffolding software. Who owns and maintains that? \n\nThe researchers should also be aware that governing commons is notoriously difficult. Ostrom is a good reference for thinking through the issues at play.\n\nIn brief, I like that the authors are thinking creatively about important problems, and it would be great to try to implement something like what the authors describe, but I think there will be many challenges to deploying the particular system the authors have outlined.\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DataBright: Towards a Global Exchange for Decentralized Data Ownership and Trusted Computation", "abstract": "It is safe to assume that, for the foreseeable future, machine learning,\nespecially deep learning will remain both data- and computation-hungry.

The contributor becomes a shareholder in the dataset they created. To enable the measurement of usage, a computation platform that contributors can trust is also necessary. DataBrigh thus merges both a data market\nand a trusted computation market.\n\nWe illustrate that trusted computation can enable the creation of an AI market, where each data point has an exact value that should be paid to its creator.DataBright allows data creators to retain ownership of their contribution and attaches to it a measurable value. The value of the data is given by its utility in subsequent distributed computation done on the DataBright computation market.\nThe computation market allocates tasks and subsequent payments to pooled hardware. This leads to the creation of a decentralized AI cloud. Our experiments show that trusted hardware such as Intel SGX can be added to the usual ML pipeline with no additional costs. We use this setting to orchestrate distributed computation that enables the creation of a computation market.
