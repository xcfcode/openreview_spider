The data considered are of the form {(y_i, c_i)}_{i=1}^N where, for example, each y_i \\in R^D represents a feature vector to be generatively modeled and each c_i \\in {1, 2, ..., C} represents a categorical label. The data are imbalanced when, for example, C=2 and the number of observations in the first class is much greater than the number in the second, e.g. writing N_i \\triangleq #{k : c_k = i} we have N_1 >> N_2. Modeling imbalanced data can be challenging because the latent features often end up modeling only the dominating class. This paper adapts the GP-LVM machinery to include both shared and private latent factors, thus allowing the private latent factors of each class to model class-specific details.\n\nThe construction is very natural. Indeed, it would not be surprising if there are some related ideas even in classical statistics, particularly in terms of factor analysis, and so for a full conference paper a related works section would be nice. However, the use of more general GP-LVM machinery is almost certainly new and has much greater reach, especially in the context of machine learning.\n\nI was slightly confused by the `unsupervised learning' terminology, especially since the class labels are used in the definition of the kernel (Eqs. (2) and (3)). While it's probably accurate enough to include `unsupervised' in the title, it would be nice to clarify the use of the labels in other parts of the text and notation; in particular, you could write that you aim to build a conditional probabilistic generative model p(Y | c), and that while the labels are used to structure that model, the emphasis is latent variable representation learning with a generative objective on the data Y.\n\nOverall, the paper is a great workshop paper and people will be interested in reading and discussing it.", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"CMT_id": "", "title": "Unsupervised Learning with Imbalanced Data via Structure Consolidation Latent Variable Model", "abstract": "Unsupervised learning on imbalanced data is challenging because, when given imbalanced data, current model is often dominated by the major category and ignores the categories with small amount of data.

Without parallelization, it is difficult to handle the size of orginal dataset (~146k). We are aiming at the original problem in future work.

The aims is to avoid the dominance of the main category when modeling the data. The idea of the article is to decompose the learned latent representation in two pieces: one latent space is shared across all the data while another latent space is used to model each category. Such assumption is obtained by defining a new kernel function which is a sum of a kernel on the first latent space plus a category dependent kernel on the second space. Experiments are made on patches extracted from biological images. The article proposes a visualization of the latent spaces, examples of generated patches but also classification performances by using a (weighted) SVM on the latent space. The model is compared to other techniques, showing the effectiveness of the approach\n\nThe underlying idea is simple, intuitive and interesting. It is a significant contribution for a workshop paper and I like this approach. The two first pages of the paper are very clear, but after that the writing can be improved. Particularly, equations 4 to 8 are difficult to understand without reading the original GP-LVM paper since some notations are not defined : K_{u,u} for example. Moreover, I don't really understand how kernel k' is used in equations 6 to 8 since the category information (equations 2 and 3) is missing. Some additional informations could be provided by the authors on this part. Concerning the experimental part, the results are interesting and made on different setups (generation + classification). My only concern is the way the training set is obtained: the paper focuses on unbalanced categories which is clearly the case for the original dataset composed of 146,562 patches where only 550 are positive. So it seems to be a nice use-case... But the authors decided to only keep 5000 negative images creating a more balanced dataset. What are the results of the different methods on the original (really unbalanced) dataset ? The new one is not so \"difficult\".", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"CMT_id": "", "title": "Unsupervised Learning with Imbalanced Data via Structure Consolidation Latent Variable Model", "abstract": "Unsupervised learning on imbalanced data is challenging because, when given imbalanced data, current model is often dominated by the major category and ignores the categories with small amount of data.
