Two variants of model are considered, which generate on time domain and frequency domain. The author show that frequency domain generation leads to better semantics (better inception score) but lower sound quality.\n\nStrength:\n- WaveGAN and SpecGAN are two sensible formulation of audio synthesis models.\n\n- Phase shuffle is a neat trick for avoiding too powerful discriminator.\n\nWeakness:\n- The story of the paper is not clear. The abstract is all about WaveGAN; however, It seems that the SpecGAN leads to better performance on inception score, which is also not given enough discussion: e.g. why is SpecGAN has better inception score but lower MOS?\n\n- Only quantitative results for SC09 is provided, which is a pretty small dataset. \n\n- No comparison to other audio synthesizer approaches.\n\nConclusion:\n- The authors have shown promising experimental results for two GAN based models for audio synthesis. More experimental results can make this paper more solid.
