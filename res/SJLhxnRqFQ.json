The technique appears to be a mix of various pre-existing techniques, combined with a novel choice of model. The experimental results are somewhat promising, and it is encouraging to see that good generative model results are consistent with improved semi-supervised classification results.

Experiments on the MNIST and SVHN datasets show that the AMM allows for semantic separation of complex data when little or no labeled data is available. The AMM achieves unsupervised clustering error rates of 3.32% and 20.4% on the MNIST and SVHN datasets, respectively.  A semi-supervised extension of the AMM achieves a classification error rate of 5.60% on the SVHN dataset.", "keywords": ["Unsupervised", "Semi-supervised", "Generative", "Adversarial", "Clustering"], "authorids": ["andrew.jesson@imagia.com", "cecile.low-kam@imagia.com", "tanya.nair@imagia.com", "fsoudan21@gmail.com", "florent.chandelier@imagia.com", "nicolas.chapados@imagia.com"], "authors": ["Andrew Jesson", "C\u00e9cile Low-Kam", "Tanya Nair", "Florian Soudan", "Florent Chandelier", "Nicolas Chapados"], "TL;DR": "The AMM is the first fully adversarially optimized method to model the conditional dependence between categorical and continuous latent variables.", "pdf": "/pdf/a9c763e04547d54f26eb22dd6be464853364e81e.pdf", "paperhash": "jesson|adversarially_learned_mixture_model", "_bibtex": "@misc{\njesson2019adversarially,\ntitle={Adversarially Learned Mixture Model},\nauthor={Andrew Jesson and C\u00e9cile Low-Kam and Tanya Nair and Florian Soudan and Florent Chandelier and Nicolas Chapados},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJLhxnRqFQ},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1117/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234302240, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "SJLhxnRqFQ", "replyto": "SJLhxnRqFQ", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1117/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335876371, "tmdate": 1552335876371, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1117/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 6}
