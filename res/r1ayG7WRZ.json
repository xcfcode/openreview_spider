This is largely due to the lack of clarity, in general, and the lack of distinction between what is known and what is proposed. I failed to find any clear description of the proposed approach and any evaluation of the main idea.\n\nMost of the discussions in the paper are difficult to follow due to that many of the statements are vague or unclear. There are some examples of this vagueness illustrated under \u201cminor issues\u201d. Together, the many minor issues contribute to a major communication issue, which significantly reduces readability of the paper. A majority of the references included in the reference section lack some or all of the required meta data.\n\nIn my view, the paper is out of scope for ICLR. Neither the CFP overview nor the (non-exhaustive) list of relevant topics suggest otherwise. In very general terms, the paper could of course be characterised as dealing with machine learning implementation/platform/application but the issues discussed are more connected to privacy, security, fair transactions, and pricing.\n\nIn summary; although there is no universal rule on how to structure research papers, a more traditional structure (introduction, aim & scope, background, related work, method, results, analysis, conclusions & future work) would most certainly have benefitted the paper through improved clarity and readability. Although some interesting works on adversarial learning, federated learning, and privace-preserving training are cited in the paper, the review and use of these references did not contribute to a better understanding of the topic or the significance of the contribution in this paper. I was unable to find any support in the paper for the strong general result stated in the abstract (\u201cWe successfully show that without running the data through the model, one can approximate the value of the data\u201d).\n\nMinor issues (examples)\n\n- \u201cModels trained only a small scale of data\u201d (missing word)\n- \u201cto prevent useful data from not being paid\u201d (unclear meaning)\n- \u201cwhile the company may decline reciprocating gifts such as academic collaboration, while using the data for some other service in the future\u201d (unclear meaning)\n- \u201csince any data given up is given up \u201d (unclear meaning)\n- \u201ca user of a centralized service who has given up their data will have trouble telling if their data exchange was fair at all (even if their evaluation was purely psychological)\u201d (unclear meaning)\n- \u201cFor a generally deployed model, it can take any form.

Issues of how to price the new data are discussed in a high level, abstract way, and arguments against retrieving the new data for free or encrypting it are presented.\n\nOverall, the paper is of an expository nature, discussing high-level ideas rather than actually implementing them, and does not  experimentally or theoretically substantiate any of its claims. This makes the technical contribution rather shallow. Interesting questions do arise, such as how to assess the value of new data and how to price datapoints, but these questions are never addressed (neither theoretically nor empirically). Though main points are valid, the paper is also rife with informal statements  and logical jumps, perhaps due to the expository/high-level approach taken in discussing these issues.\n\nDetailed comments:\n\nThe (informal) information theoretic argument has a few holes. The claim is roughly that every datapoint (~1Mbyte image) contributes ~1M bits of changes in a model, which can be quite revealing. As a result, there is no benefit from encrypting the datapoint, as the mapping from inputs to changes is insecure (in an information-theoretic sense) in itself. This assumes that every step of stochastic gradient descent (one step per image) is done in the clear; this is not what one would consider secure in cryptography literature.  A secure function evaluation (SFE) would encrypt the data and the computation in an end-to-end fashion; in particular, it would only reveal the final outcome of SGD over all images in the dataset without revealing any intermediate steps. Presuming that the new dataset is large (i.e., having N images), the \"information theoretic\" limit becomes ~N x 1Mbyte inputs for ~1M function outputs (the finally-trained model). In this sense, this argument that \"encryption is hopeless\" is somewhat brittle.\n\nEncryption-issues aside, the paper would have been much stronger if it spent more effort in formalizing or evaluating different methods for assessing the value of data. The authors approach this by treating the ML algorithm as a blackbox, and using influence functions (a la Bastani 2017) to assess the impact of different inputs on the finally trained model (again, this is proposed but not implemented/explored/evaluated in any way). This is a design choice, but it is not obvious. There is extensive literature in statistics and machine learning on the areas of experimental design and active learning. Both are active, successful research areas, and both can be provide tools to formally reason about the value of data/labels not yet seen; the paper summarily ignores this literature.\n\n\nExamples of imprecise/informal statements:\n\n\"The fairness in the pricing is highly questionable\"\n\"implicit contracts get difficult to verify\"\n\"The fairness in the pricing is dubious\"\n\"As machine learning models become more and more complicated, its (sic) capability can outweigh the privacy guarantees encryption gives us\"\n\"as an image classifier's model architecture changes, all the data would need to be collected and purchased again\"\n\"Interpretability solutions aim to alleviate the notoriety of reasonability of neural networks\"", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Don't encrypt the data; just approximate the model \\ Towards Secure Transaction and Fair Pricing of Training Data", "abstract": "As machine learning becomes ubiquitous, deployed systems need to be as accu- rate as they can.

As a result, machine learning service providers have a surging need for useful, additional training data that benefits training, without giving up all the details about the trained program. At the same time, data owners would like to trade their data for its value, without having to first give away the data itself be- fore receiving compensation. It is difficult for data providers and model providers to agree on a fair price without first revealing the data or the trained model to the other side. Escrow systems only complicate this further, adding an additional layer of trust required of both parties. Currently, data owners and model owners don\u2019t have a fair pricing system that eliminates the need to trust a third party and training the model on the data, which 1) takes a long time to complete, 2) does not guarantee that useful data is paid valuably and that useless data isn\u2019t, without trusting in the third party with both the model and the data. Existing improve- ments to secure the transaction focus heavily on encrypting or approximating the data, such as training on encrypted data, and variants of federated learning. As powerful as the methods appear to be, we show them to be impractical in our use case with real world assumptions for preserving privacy for the data owners when facing black-box models. Thus, a fair pricing scheme that does not rely on secure data encryption and obfuscation is needed before the exchange of data. This pa- per proposes a novel method for fair pricing using data-model efficacy techniques such as influence functions, model extraction, and model compression methods, thus enabling secure data transactions. We successfully show that without running the data through the model, one can approximate the value of the data; that is, if the data turns out redundant, the pricing is minimal, and if the data leads to proper improvement, its value is properly assessed, without placing strong assumptions on the nature of the model.
