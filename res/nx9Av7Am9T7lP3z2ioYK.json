These context-sensitive\nword representations are suitable for, e.g., distinguishing different word senses\nand other context-modulated variations in meaning. To learn the parameters of\nour model, we use cross-lingual supervision, hypothesizing that a good representation\nof a word in context will be one that is sufficient for selecting the correct\ntranslation into a second language. We evaluate the quality of our representations\nas features in three downstream tasks: prediction of semantic supersenses (which\nassign nouns and verbs into a few dozen semantic classes), low resource machine\ntranslation, and a lexical substitution task, and obtain state-of-the-art results on all\nof these.", "pdf": "/pdf/nx9Av7Am9T7lP3z2ioYK.pdf", "paperhash": "kawakami|learning_to_represent_words_in_context_with_multilingual_supervision", "conflicts": ["cs.cmu.edu"], "authors": ["Kazuya Kawakami", "Chris Dyer"], "authorids": ["kkawakam@andrew.cmu.edu", "cdyer@cs.cmu.edu"]}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "tmdate": null, "cdate": 1454464564200, "ddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "duedate": 1455833700000, "tcdate": 1454464564200, "id": "ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/-/submission", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"pdf": null, "forum": null, "replyto": null, "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*", "description": "Your displayed identity associated with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"pdf": {"order": 4, "description": "Either upload a PDF file or provide a direct link to your PDF on ArXiv.", "value-regex": "upload|http://arxiv.org/pdf/.+"}, "title": {"order": 3, "description": "Title of paper.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "abstract": {"order": 4, "description": "Abstract of paper.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}, "authors": {"order": 1, "description": "Comma separated list of author names, as they appear in the paper.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "author_emails": {"order": 2, "description": "Comma separated list of author email addresses, in the same order as above.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "conflicts": {"order": 100, "description": "Semi-colon separated list of email domains of people who would have a conflict of interest in reviewing this paper, (e.g., cs.umass.edu;google.com, etc.).", "value-regex": "^([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))+(;[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))*$"}, "CMT_id": {"order": 5, "value-regex": ".*", "description": "If the paper is a resubmission from the ICLR 2016 Conference Track, enter its CMT ID; otherwise, leave blank."}}}, "invitees": [], "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "expdate": 1463609700000}}}], "count": 1}
