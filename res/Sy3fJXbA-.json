They substitute the simple add operation with a selection operation for each input in the residual module. The selection of the inputs happens through gate weights, which are sampled at train time. At test time, the gates with the highest values are kept on, while the other ones are shut. The authors fix the number of the allowed gates to K out of C possible inputs (C is the multi-branch factor in the ResNeXt modules). They show results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet (as well as mini ImageNet). They ablate the choice of K, the binary nature of the gate weights.\n\nPros:\n(+) The paper is well written and the method is well explained\n(+) The authors ablate and experiment on large scale datasets\n\nCons:\n(-) The proposed method is a simple extension of ResNeXt \n(-) The gains are reasonable, yet not SOTA, and come at a price of more complex training protocols (see below)\n(-) Generalization to other tasks not shown\n\nThe authors do a great job walking us through the formulation and intutition of their proposed approach. They describe their training procedure and their sampling approach for the gate weights. However, the training protocol gets complicated with the introduction of gate weights. In order to train the gate weights along with the network parameters, the authors need to train the parameters jointly followed by the training of only the network parameters while keeping the gates frozen. This makes training of such networks cumbersome.\n\nIn addition, the authors report a loss in performance when the gates are not discretized to {0,1}. This means that a liner combination with the real-valued learned gate parameters is suboptimal. Could this be a result of suboptimal, possibly compromised training? \n\nWhile the CIFAR-100 results look promising, the ImageNet-1k results are less impressive. The gains from introducing gate weights in the input of the residual modules vanish when increasing the network size. \n\nLast, the impact of ResNeXt/ResNet lies in their ability to generalize to other tasks. Have the authors experimented with other tasks, e.g. object detection, to verify that their approach leads to better performance in a more diverse set of problems?\n", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Connectivity Learning in Multi-Branch Networks", "abstract": "While much of the work in the design of convolutional networks over the last five years has revolved around the empirical investigation of the importance of depth, filter sizes, and number of feature channels, recent studies have shown that  branching, i.e., splitting the computation along parallel but distinct threads and then aggregating their outputs, represents a new promising dimension for significant improvements in performance.

Furthermore, this learning extends to large-scale image datasets.\n- There is indeed a boost in classification performance, and the approach shows promise for automatically reducing the number of parameters in the network.\n\nCons:\n- Overall, the approach seems to be an incremental improvement over the previous work ResNeXt.\n- The datasets used are not very interesting: Cifar is too small, and ImageNet is essentially solved.

We address the individual questions/comments below.\n\n* \u201cThe proposed method is a simple extension of ResNeXt.\u201d\n\nWe point out that our algorithm is a general procedure for connectivity learning in multi-branch networks. We chose to demonstrate it on ResNext, since it is one of the state-of-the-art architectures for image categorization. However, the method can be applied without modifications to any other multi-branch architecture. Furthermore, it is not even tied to the problem of image categorization, as it can use any arbitrary loss function. Thus, we disagree with the characterization that it is merely an extension of ResNeXt.\n\n* \u201cLoss in performance when the gates are not discretized.\u201d\n\nThe training algorithm for the binary gates (GateConnect as shown in Algorithm 1) is substantially different from the training algorithm used to train the model with real-valued gates (mentioned in page 6). First, GateConnect performs sampling of gate weights to activate K branches while the training with real-valued gates does not use sampling since all branches are activated at all times. Second, in GateConnect the gradient of the loss function is calculated w.r.t. to the binary gate values (as shown in Algorithm 1, parameter update step); whereas in the case of training with real-valued gates, the gradient of the loss function is calculated w.r.t. the real-valued gates. Therefore, the loss in performance is not due to suboptimality. It is due to the different training procedure. We found that the forward and backward propagation using stochastically-sampled binary gates yields a larger exploration of connectivities and results in bigger changes of the auxiliary real-valued gates, which in turn leads to better connectivity learning. \n\n \n* \u201cThe training protocol gets complicated with the introduction of gate weights... The authors need to train the parameters jointly followed by the training of only the network parameters while keeping the gates frozen. This makes training of such networks cumbersome.\u201d\n\nOverall, the proposed procedure remains straightforward. Evidence of this is the fact the entire algorithm used in the first stage can be summarized in a few lines of pseudo-code, as illustrated in Algorithm 1. The second stage simply involves freezing the binary gate weights and performing standard backpropagation. Considering that this two-stage procedure results consistently in a gain in accuracy, we believe that it will be of interest to the community despite the slightly increase in complexity. We note that we will be releasing the software of our approach for reproducibility and to allow other researchers to use it without having to reimplement it.\n\n* \u201cThe impact of ResNeXt/ResNet lies in their ability to generalize to other tasks. Have the authors experimented with other tasks, e.g. object detection?\u201c\n\nIn order to show the generalization ability of our approach, in this work we conducted experiments using many different model specifications and a wide variety of datasets, albeit all focused on image categorization. We plan to apply our approach to other tasks in future work.  \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Connectivity Learning in Multi-Branch Networks", "abstract": "While much of the work in the design of convolutional networks over the last five years has revolved around the empirical investigation of the importance of depth, filter sizes, and number of feature channels, recent studies have shown that  branching, i.e., splitting the computation along parallel but distinct threads and then aggregating their outputs, represents a new promising dimension for significant improvements in performance.
