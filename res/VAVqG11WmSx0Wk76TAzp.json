The idea is not particularly novel but the results show how an unrelated area can fairly easily benefit from advancements in DL NLP. The intuition that localised features determine molecular binding seems like a great fit for sentiment analysis techniques.\n\nIt would be nice to show the molecule lengths and sizes of dataset in Table 1, I don't think these are mentioned anywhere.
