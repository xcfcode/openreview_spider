In Introduction, the authors raised 4 kinds of issues, including framework/optimization/memory/multi-scale. However, optimization and memory issues are mitigated by the CNN architectures; multi-scale issue is addressed with the help of work from Kim et al.. It seems the proposed questions are mostly addressed by the previous methods.\n\n- It seems CISTA may be the main novelty of this work. However, no comparasions with previous ISTA methods (e.g., [R1-3]) are conducted and discussed. \n\n- From Tabs. 2&3, the improvement is very limited. Besides, time complexity needs to be compared with the competitors, including flops or inference times.\n\n[R1] A Fast Proximal Method for Convolutional Sparse Coding, IJCNN 2013.\n[R2] Convolutional Neural Networks Analyzed via Convolutional Sparse Coding, JMLR 2017.\n[R3] On Multi-Layer Basis Pursuit, Efficient Algorithms and Convolutional Neural Networks, TPAMI 2018."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1330/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1330/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CRNet: Image Super-Resolution Using A Convolutional Sparse Coding  Inspired Network", "authors": ["Menglei Zhang", "Zhou Liu", "Jingwei He", "Lei Yu"], "authorids": ["zmlhome@whu.edu.cn", "liuzhou@whu.edu.cn", "jingwei_he@whu.edu.cn", "ly.wd@whu.edu.cn"], "keywords": ["Convolutional sparse coding", "LISTA", "image super-resolution"], "abstract": "Convolutional Sparse Coding (CSC) has been attracting more and more attention in recent years, for making full use of image global correlation to improve performance on various computer vision applications.

The discussion refers to sparse coding as motivation and how such coding can be achieved within a neural network using activation functions, and then it slides into iterative soft thresholding and ends up with the observation that ReLU and the soft nonnegative thresholding operator are equal (paper should have pointed that they are equal with slight difference around the bias term). This argument is not new, this conclusion has already been known and analyzed extensively in (Papyan et al., 2017a).\n\nThe proposed network is not much different from what several other SR methods used before (see NTIRE 2019). It is basically composed of a collection of single layer residual units that share the same parameters. As expected, there is also a skip connection from the input to the last layer. The only slight variation is that the activation function ReLU for the residual layers are arranged before the convolutional layers. \n\nTraining details are missing. \n\nThe paper does not provide any comparisons with the top-ranking methods in the NTIRE 2019 single image super-resolution challenge leaderboard.

Then we develop a novel CSC based SR framework analogy to the traditional SC based SR methods. Two models inspired by this framework are proposed for pre-/post-upsampling SR, respectively. Compared with recent state-of-the-art SR methods, both of our proposed models show superior performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative measurements.", "pdf": "/pdf/db40f2cc1022aebe4c17b98bfc1a02f5e50ccdef.pdf", "paperhash": "zhang|crnet_image_superresolution_using_a_convolutional_sparse_coding_inspired_network", "original_pdf": "/attachment/db40f2cc1022aebe4c17b98bfc1a02f5e50ccdef.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nzhang2020crnet,\ntitle={{\\{}CRN{\\}}et: Image Super-Resolution Using A Convolutional Sparse Coding  Inspired Network},\nauthor={Menglei Zhang and Zhou Liu and Jingwei He and Lei Yu},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJgqjREtvS}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
