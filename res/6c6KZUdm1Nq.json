Authors provided appealing application for this problem setting. They rewrote the risk and provided an unbiased gradient estimator. However, there is a gap between the estimator and the actual implementation, thus making the overall paper less convincible.\n\nMain Concern:\n- A gap exists between Eq. (8) and Eq. (13). In Eq. (8), the expectation is taken over the distribution of \"up\". This distribution, as well as \\pi_{up}, is fixed throughout training. Unlike PU classification, this essential information is not given in this problem setting. However, according to Eq. (13) and Algorithm 1, this distribution and \\pi_{up} change ever minibatch with the current model. I admit this is a pratical algorithm, but it differs substaintialy from the first half of the paper. To fill the gap, investigation on how Eq. (13) approximate Eq. (8) should be conducted at least.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3505/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3505/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Regression from Upper One-side Labeled Data", "authorids": ["~Takayuki_Katsuki2"], "authors": ["Takayuki Katsuki"], "keywords": ["regression", "weakly-supervised learning", "healthcare"], "abstract": "We address a regression problem from weakly labeled data that are correctly labeled only above a regression line, i.e., upper one-side labeled data.\nThe label values of the data are the results of sensing the magnitude of some phenomenon.\nIn this case, the labels often contain missing or incomplete observations whose values are lower than those of correct observations and are also usually lower than the regression line.

From the definition of Eq.(3), E_{up} and E_{lo} depend on a current f for both ordinary regression and our one-side regression. As you know, f is changing in SGD and we can see that E_{up} and E_{lo} are also changing in each step of SGD from the view point of Eq.(3), but E and p(x, y) are not changing. Thus, since Theorem 1 holds for each step of SGD, we can say that Eq.(13) is a mini-batch approximation for the unbiased gradient in Eq.(9).\nAlso, we justified the effectiveness of Eq.(13) and Algorithm 1 with experimental results, as the other reviewers mentioned. In the main text, we also have explicitly described that Eq.(13) is an approximation for the gradient in Eq.(9).\nThe point of our manuscript is to show that we can derive a gradient for the one-side regression in an unbiased and consistent manner to that for ordinary regression, that is Theorem 1, and to show we can develop a practical algorithm to implement that in a straightforward approximation, a mini-batch approximation."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3505/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3505/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Regression from Upper One-side Labeled Data", "authorids": ["~Takayuki_Katsuki2"], "authors": ["Takayuki Katsuki"], "keywords": ["regression", "weakly-supervised learning", "healthcare"], "abstract": "We address a regression problem from weakly labeled data that are correctly labeled only above a regression line, i.e., upper one-side labeled data.\nThe label values of the data are the results of sensing the magnitude of some phenomenon.\nIn this case, the labels often contain missing or incomplete observations whose values are lower than those of correct observations and are also usually lower than the regression line.

In this problem setting, upper-side data (labeled above the regression line) and unlabeled data are provided. To solve this problem, the authors derive a learning algorithm in an unbiased and\nconsistent manner to ordinary regression that is learned from data labeled correctly in both upper- and lower-side cases. Experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm.\n\nPros:\n1.\tTo the best of my knowledge, this paper is the first to solve the weakly supervised regression problem presented in the paper. I consider that it is the biggest advantage of this paper.\n2.\tThis paper proposes a consistent learning algorithm to solve the above problem.\n3.\tExperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\n\nCons:\n1.\tThe presentation of this paper needs to be improved. For example, I understand that in the introduction section, the authors try to justify that the weakly supervised regression problem (where upper-side and unlabeled data are available) is reasonable and could be encountered in real-world settings. However, I personally feel that the presentation is not very clear and I am not fully convinced. In addition, for the order of Eq. (4) and Eq. (5), I think it would be better to present Eq. (5) before Eq. (4), as Eq. (4) relies on Eq. (5).\n2.\tFor the proposed consistent algorithm, I would admit that it is novel to some degree, while the technical contribution of this algorithm is limited. It is worth noting that the proposed algorithm is adapted from the risk estimator of PU learning (Du Plessis et al., 2014; 2015). I think the only key contribution lies in Eq. (6), e.g., the authors show that instead of setting the value of ${\\tilde{y}}\\_{\\text{lo}}$, we can find the gradient only depends on the sign of $f(\\boldsymbol{x})-{\\tilde{y}}\\_{\\text{lo}}$.\n3.\tFor the experiments, it seems that the authors do not use a ground-truth regression line to separate the given data, and obtain upper-side and unlabeled data. Instead, they corrupt some selected data by setting their value to the minimum regression value. I feel that this practical operation does not accord with the proposed problem setting. Maybe we could use originally labeled data to obtain a well-trained regression line and then obtain the required upper-side and unlabeled data.\n\nIn summary, this paper proposed a novel problem setting and a novel learning algorithm, while the problem setting is not well justified and the technical contribution of the algorithm is limited. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3505/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3505/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Regression from Upper One-side Labeled Data", "authorids": ["~Takayuki_Katsuki2"], "authors": ["Takayuki Katsuki"], "keywords": ["regression", "weakly-supervised learning", "healthcare"], "abstract": "We address a regression problem from weakly labeled data that are correctly labeled only above a regression line, i.e., upper one-side labeled data.\nThe label values of the data are the results of sensing the magnitude of some phenomenon.\nIn this case, the labels often contain missing or incomplete observations whose values are lower than those of correct observations and are also usually lower than the regression line.

A few comments,\n\n1) It is unclear if the labels y can be noisy. I assume they can't be, because all the derivations seem to be under the assumption they are not. \n2) The application of this setup is not clear to me. I think the authors would benefit from motivating it via other papers that study the same regression problem (if any), as opposed to citing other topics in motion sensor research. They would also benefit from writing down the existing work on classification more explicitly, and connecting it to the regression setup in the paper. It is unclear if the classification literature treats a similar (or exactly the same) problem in the classification setting and what is the hard part of translating these results into regression.\n\nThe solution to the problem proposed by the authors is quite simple. This would not be a downside if the motivation of the problem and the related work was established with more authority at the beginning of the problem. I am concerned that in the case of losses of the form g(sgn(f(x)-y), f(x)) the problem is not meaningful because in this case the learner only requires to know if f(x) < y or not. The initial problem the authors set to solve vanishes in this case. This means that Theorem 1 is not very informative. \n\nIn section 3.2, there is little explanation as to why using a \\rho multiplier in (13). This does not seem to be in accordance with Theorem 1. It is also unclear to me why do the last two terms on the RHS of (4) need to be written as a difference, when at the end gradients of an expectation of a loss of the form g(sgn(f(x)-y)), f(x)) over the unlabeled dataset can be computed directly. There doesn't seem to be any need of writing it as a difference. \n\nThe experimental evaluation is thorough. \n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3505/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3505/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Regression from Upper One-side Labeled Data", "authorids": ["~Takayuki_Katsuki2"], "authors": ["Takayuki Katsuki"], "keywords": ["regression", "weakly-supervised learning", "healthcare"], "abstract": "We address a regression problem from weakly labeled data that are correctly labeled only above a regression line, i.e., upper one-side labeled data.\nThe label values of the data are the results of sensing the magnitude of some phenomenon.\nIn this case, the labels often contain missing or incomplete observations whose values are lower than those of correct observations and are also usually lower than the regression line.
