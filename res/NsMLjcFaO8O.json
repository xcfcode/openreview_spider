(2020) for image generation to address the conditional waveform synthesis problem.  There are really limited innovations on the model side since the proposed method just combines some techniques from recent score matching and diffusion probabilistic models.  \n\n(2) Why the proposed WaveGrad Vocoder can synthesize high-quality speech comparing to LSTMs in WaveRNN and WaveNet in the original Tacotron 2? The authors should give more insights and explanations to better illustrate the proposed method. \n\n(3) The original Tacotron 2 with WaveNet can achieve 4.526 \u00b1 0.066, which is better than the WaveGrad. The authors should also include the results of the WaveNet Vocoder. \n\n(4) The authors should also provide results from the compared methods in https://wavegrad-iclr2021.github.io/ to validate the superiority of the proposed method. \n\n*** Post-Rebuttal ***\n\nThank the authors for responding to my concerns in the rebuttal. \n\nFor the contribution part,  the major technical contribution is the continuous noise schedule. However, it is very obscure in the original paper. As also suggested by R1, the authors should carefully revise the paper to make it more clear. In addition, I found the paper largely borrowed content from Ho et al. (2020). From the framework figure and Algorithms to texts and equations, only limited modifications are made. After reading the paper, my first impression is that the paper just uses a new model on image synthesis to address speech synthesis. The work is not well motivated and largely copying another paper in the method section is not a professional way.  \n\nHope the authors can modify the paper by adding the new clarifications and explanations in the rebuttal to improve the paper.\n\n\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1311/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1311/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "WaveGrad: Estimating Gradients for Waveform Generation", "authorids": ["~Nanxin_Chen1", "~Yu_Zhang2", "~Heiga_Zen1", "~Ron_J_Weiss1", "~Mohammad_Norouzi1", "~William_Chan1"], "authors": ["Nanxin Chen", "Yu Zhang", "Heiga Zen", "Ron J Weiss", "Mohammad Norouzi", "William Chan"], "keywords": ["vocoder", "diffusion", "score matching", "text-to-speech", "gradient estimation", "waveform generation"], "abstract": "This paper introduces WaveGrad, a conditional model for waveform generation which estimates gradients of the data density.

Because of the time limitation, we couldn\u2019t finish subjective evaluations but we never see those models give us high quality results even with longer training time compared to GAN-based models and WaveGrad. \n \nWe believe another advantage of WaveGrad is that it can serve different applications with one network by tuning the inference schedule.

The proposed method is a direct application of Ho et al. (2020) for waveform synthesis. The combination/connection between score matching and diffusion probabilistic model is a contribution in Ho et al. (2020).\n\n2, In general, flow-based models (e.g., WaveGlow, WaveFlow) can also match autoregressive model in terms of audio fidelity, while being much faster at synthesis (e.g., >20 times faster than real-time). What is the advantage of using WaveGrad as a neural vocoder? It provides comparable audio quality as flow-based models, but it is slower at synthesis (e.g., up to 5x faster than real-time). BTW, the authors may discuss WaveFlow (a SOTA flow-based model), which also introduces a trade-off between autoregressive and non-autoregressive models. It also needs constant number of sequential steps at synthesis. \n\n3, Section 2 is not well written and self-contained. For example, the authors simply list Equation (2-4) and references without further explanation. Indeed, they are not closely related to the technical contribution of this paper.

Below we address each of the individual questions.\n\nQ1. \"There are really limited innovations on the model side since the proposed method just combines some techniques from recent score matching and diffusion probabilistic models.\"\n\nOur key contribution can be summarized as follows:\n(1) WaveGrad applies the diffusion-probabilistic model while conditioning on the continuous noise, this allows our model to use any noise inference schedule. Ho et a., 2020 [1] relies on a fixed discrete noise schedule. Our continuous noise schedule also licenses our model to use fewer inference iterations while maintaining the same quality (e.g., 6 vs. 1000). This also licenses the same model to run a dynamic number of inference iterations depending on the choice of sample quality desired.\n(2) We adapt the score matching framework previously only applied to unconditional image generation to conditional speech synthesis. We discuss our modelling contributions in depth in Section 4.\n\nQ2. \"Why the proposed WaveGrad Vocoder can synthesize high-quality speech comparing to LSTMs in WaveRNN and WaveNet in the original Tacotron 2?\"\n\nWaveRNN and WaveNet are autoregressive models that capture the output distribution directly. WaveGrad models the score function, which implicitly models the output distribution. Ho et al. showed the score matching objective can be seen as a lower-bound to the log-likelihood, suggesting that score matching models may in theory be capable of matching autoregressive models. Empirical experiments in our work and prior work (Ho et al [1], Song et al [2]) demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework. Additionally, due to the neural network architectures, autoregressive models may be limited to capturing left-only context, while non-autoregressive score matching iterative framework may be more likely to capture larger bidirectional context.\n\nDuring inference, autoregressive models are iterative models that require `n` steps. At each step, the output is generated without allowing for any correction in future iterations. Errors generated (e.g., generated from random sampling) at any point during the inference process can easily cascade and corrupt the signal. This is especially true since `n` is large in waveform generation, and autoregressive models were trained with teacher forcing. In contrast, iterative refinement methods like WaveGrad do not suffer from this cascading phenomena. WaveGrad iteratively refines the whole speech signal with each iteration, permitting it to correct for errors generated by the previous iteration.\n\nQ3. \"The original Tacotron 2 with WaveNet can achieve 4.526 \u00b1 0.066, which is better than the WaveGrad. The authors should also include the results of the WaveNet Vocoder.\"\n\nFrom our internal experiments, also observed in [3], WaveRNN achieves similar performance as WaveNet  on the vocoding task while the inference speed of WaveRNN is much faster in comparison. That is the reason why we only include the performance of WaveRNN, which is already comparable with ground truth utterances from Table 1. \n\nQ4. \"The authors should also provide results from the compared methods in https://wavegrad-iclr2021.github.io/ to validate the superiority of the proposed method.\"\n\nThank you for your suggestion. We are in the process of generating audio samples from our baseline models and once we get it, we will update our demo page as soon as possible.\n\n[1] Ho, J., Jain, A. and Abbeel, P., 2020.

It would be great to substantiate it with evidence/comparison?\"\n\nOur conclusion comes from observations during experiments. There are mainly three different types of baselines covered in this paper:\n* WaveRNN and WaveNet: we found those autoregressive models take longer time to train\n* GAN-based: GAN-based approaches usually require additional losses, for example, losses on different resolutions or STFT-based losses. Also GAN training in general is not stable without proper hyperparameters.\n* Flow-based: Flow-based models require specialized architectures, since the network must be invertible and differentiable.  Furthermore, for efficient training and inference, flows are generally constrained to have efficient to compute Jacobian and inverses, as in coupling-based flows such as WaveGlow. \n\nIn comparison, our work imposes minimal restrictions on the model architecture and we used a simple L1 loss to learn the score function instead of data likelihood used in autoregressive models. As discussed in the experiment section, our model converged very quickly. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1311/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1311/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "WaveGrad: Estimating Gradients for Waveform Generation", "authorids": ["~Nanxin_Chen1", "~Yu_Zhang2", "~Heiga_Zen1", "~Ron_J_Weiss1", "~Mohammad_Norouzi1", "~William_Chan1"], "authors": ["Nanxin Chen", "Yu Zhang", "Heiga Zen", "Ron J Weiss", "Mohammad Norouzi", "William Chan"], "keywords": ["vocoder", "diffusion", "score matching", "text-to-speech", "gradient estimation", "waveform generation"], "abstract": "This paper introduces WaveGrad, a conditional model for waveform generation which estimates gradients of the data density.

In what follows we have provided a detailed response to your concerns:\n\nQ1. \"The proposed method is a direct application of Ho et al. (2020) for waveform synthesis. The combination/connection between score matching and diffusion probabilistic model is a contribution in Ho et al. (2020).\"\n\nWaveGrad applies the diffusion-probabilistic model while conditioning on the continuous noise, this allows our model to use any noise inference schedule. Ho et a., 2020 relies on a fixed discrete noise schedule. Our continuous noise schedule also enables thelicenses our model to use fewer inference iterations while maintaining the same quality (e.g., 6 vs. 1000). This also licenses the same model to run a dynamic number of inference iterations depending on the choice of sample quality desired.\n\nQ2. \"What is the advantage of using WaveGrad as a neural vocoder? It provides comparable audio quality as flow-based models, but it is slower at synthesis (e.g., up to 5x faster than real-time). BTW, the authors may discuss WaveFlow (a SOTA flow-based model), which also introduces a trade-off between autoregressive and non-autoregressive models. It also needs a constant number of sequential steps at synthesis.\"\n\nThe advantage of WaveGrad is to build a single model which can dynamically balance the tradeoff between generation speed and performance by tuning the noise inference schedule. WaveGrad is capable of generating high-fidelity audio samples matching the state-of-the-art autoregressive models in terms of subjective naturalness. Meanwhile with the same model parameters, WaveGrad is able to use only a few iterations (e.g., 6) to support fast sampling, which still outperform other non-autoregressive baselines.\n\nWe are in the process of reproducing WaveFlow. We are anticipating WaveGrad to outperform WaveFlow. However, there is concurrent work in the literature, DiffWave [1], that demonstrates their diffusion probabilistic model ( similar to ours), outperforms WaveFlow.\n\nQ3. \"Section 2 is not well written and self-contained. For example, the authors simply list Equation (2-4) and references without further explanation. Indeed, they are not closely related to the technical contribution of this paper. One may either introduce in more detail, or skip some content  as this work focuses on a particular parameterization of diffusion probabilistic model introduced by Ho et al. (2020).\"\n\nWe have taken this to heart and improved the writing of Section 2. Indeed Equation 2-3 are not closely related to the technical contribution of this paper however we think that including them is beneficial to help understanding. So we update Section 2 to include further explanations. More specifically:\n* Equation 2 is related to algorithm 2 so we added another sentence: \"A variant [2] is used as our inference procedure.\"\n* Equation 3 and equation 4: \"WaveGrad adopts a similar objective which combines the idea of [2,3,4].\"\n\n[1] Kong, Z., Ping, W., Huang, J., Zhao, K. and Catanzaro, B., 2020.

Results from the proposed approach match the state-of-the-art WaveRNN model. The paper is very well-written and it is quite easy to follow. The study of the total number of diffusion steps and two different ways (continuous and discrete) ways to feed it in the network is very interesting. It is quite relevant and important for speech synthesis tasks. Using this, authors are able to find a 6-step inference procedure that yields very competitive performance to WaveRNN while still being computationally feasible.\n\nPros:\n1. Great results for the neural vocoding task\n2. Exhaustive study of the diffusion steps and how to feed them to the network is valuable and original.\n\nCons:\n1. Study of the width/depth of the network can be more exhaustive.\n\n*Further comments*: Authors mention in the conclusion ````Wavegrad is simple to train`. What makes the authors say so? It would be great to substantiate it with evidence/comparison?", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1311/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1311/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "WaveGrad: Estimating Gradients for Waveform Generation", "authorids": ["~Nanxin_Chen1", "~Yu_Zhang2", "~Heiga_Zen1", "~Ron_J_Weiss1", "~Mohammad_Norouzi1", "~William_Chan1"], "authors": ["Nanxin Chen", "Yu Zhang", "Heiga Zen", "Ron J Weiss", "Mohammad Norouzi", "William Chan"], "keywords": ["vocoder", "diffusion", "score matching", "text-to-speech", "gradient estimation", "waveform generation"], "abstract": "This paper introduces WaveGrad, a conditional model for waveform generation which estimates gradients of the data density.
