Specifically, symmetries in the computation graph are identified and then the neural network is compressed into an equivalent model.\n\nThe idea of using symmetries for improving scalability has been successfully used in statistical relational models. Therefore, it seems to be a nice direction for improving scalability in neural networks such as GCNs. Thus, large computation graphs can be reduced to smaller graphs for effective computation.\n\nThe main weakness with the paper is that the compression algorithm was not very clear to me. Particularly, the problem of identifying isomorphisms is a hard problem and several lifted inference techniques have typically used approximate methods to identify symmetries in graphical models [e.g. Niepert UAI 2012, Bui et. al. UAI 2013, Holtzen et al. UAI 2019, etc.]. I was not sure why or how the identification of exact symmetries is not hard in this case. Is the type of computation graph restricted to some form?

One aspect that was not very clear was how large were the computation graphs? Also, when the compression is exact would the accuracies still vary between the compressed and uncompressed model?\n\nIn general, I like the idea of using symmetries to compress graph-based neural networks. I am not too clear on the details of the proposed approach, particularly their applicability for general graph structures.\n\nFrom the discussions, the authors make it clear that \"compressing\" the computation graph is possible without the need for expensive operations (as is the case in typical \"lifted\" inference literature).

Although I think this work is good for small datasets like molecular networks, i am skeptic about its transferability in large scale graphs. The reason behind that is I don't assume there would be a lot of structurally similar nodes in case of a large scale real life graph. Authors did not provide any information on the size of the graphs used for the experiments.*\n\nIt is true that the effectiveness of the compression depends on the amount of symmetries in the computation graphs, which stem from the input graph symmetries together with the model symmetries (weight-sharing). It is however not dependent on the size of the graphs.\n\nThe individual input graphs vary from the smallest with app. 25 nodes and 50 bonds per a single molecule, to medium-size knowledge bases with app. 20,000 triples over hundreds of objects and relations. We note that the molecular data are not \"small datasets\", as there are thousands of molecules in each (and so the overall dataset size can be actually bigger than some \"large\" graphs). \n\nWe also note that these are real-life datasets, and the molecular data represent one of the primary GNN applications (Zhou, Jie, et al, 2018).\n\nThe computation graphs themselves are then in the orders of 10^2-10^5 of nodes.\n\nWe added the information on graph sizes into the paper.\n\n>*2. Authors proposed two different algorithm, exact and non-exact. There are no comparisons between these two methods are shown in the result. Proper analysis on time and performance of the algorithms are also absent. The motivation behind using exact or non-exact is not clear.*\n\nThese two algorithms are not to be considered as competing alternatives in terms of performance. The practical difference is that the exact algorithm provides guarantees on lossless compression, while the non-exact does not. However in the experiments, we demonstrate that even the non-exact algorithm achieves lossless compression in practice, given simply a high enough numeric precision to be used in the value comparisons (Fig. 4). The results of the two algorithms are then equivalent in practice.\n\nThe non-exact algorithm is slightly faster, since it skips the structural equivalence check, nevertheless the asymptotic complexity of both is the same and is linear in the size of the computation graph (i.e. the same as traversing the graph for simple evaluation - see end of Section 4).\n\nThe main motivation behind the exact vs. non-exact algorithms were the structural vs. functional symmetries (see beginning of Section 4). Without having the exact algorithm, we could not show that the non-exact algorithm behaves as an exact one in practice (given sufficiently many bits of precision). \n\n>*3. On Table 1, the time of the different experiments are given. There are no analysis on time vs performance metric in this table. Does all the baseline show similar performance as the baseline model? The analysis is not present.*\n\nYes, each of the models achieves the same accuracy (performs equivalent computations) across all the frameworks (see Sec. 5.1., p. 8). The computation time is thus all that matters. A more detailed analysis and comparison of the frameworks can be found in the work of (Sourek et. al., 2020).\n\n>*4. It would also be interesting to see an analysis on the effect of the algorithms on different graph types based on their characteristics (degree distribution, density, veracity etc).*\n\nWe generally agree, but the compression performance of the algorithm(s) depends on the input graph and model properties (symmetries) in a more complicated manner. Consequently, one could surely select or simulate input graphs of very different properties leading all to extreme compression rates using the right combination of particular node types and patterns of their interconnections extracted by the respective models. \nInstead, in this paper we provide experiments over varying real-world datasets and models from actual practice to reflect the expected real-life performance.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\nZhou, Jie, et al. \"Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.08434 (2018).\n\nSourek, Gustav, Filip Zelezny, and Ondrej Kuzelka. \"Beyond Graph Neural Networks with Lifted Relational Neural Networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.06286 (2020)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3256/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3256/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Lossless Compression of Structured Convolutional Models via Lifting", "authorids": ["~Gustav_Sourek1", "zelezny@fel.cvut.cz", "~Ondrej_Kuzelka1"], "authors": ["Gustav Sourek", "Filip Zelezny", "Ondrej Kuzelka"], "keywords": ["weight sharing", "graph neural networks", "lifted inference", "relational learning", "dynamic computation graphs", "convolutional models"], "abstract": "Lifting is an efficient technique to scale up graphical models generalized to relational domains by exploiting the underlying symmetries.

Particularly, the problem of identifying isomorphisms is a hard problem and several lifted inference techniques have typically used approximate methods to identify symmetries in graphical models [e.g. Niepert UAI 2012, Bui et. al. UAI 2013, Holtzen et al. UAI 2019, etc.]. I was not sure why or how the identification of exact symmetries is not hard in this case. Is the type of computation graph restricted to some form? If so, a more detailed description of the properties of this graph is useful. Since the main focus of the paper is on \u201cexact\u201d symmetries, I think in general, a more detailed analysis of the proposed approach will help in general.*\n\nThe type of the computation graphs is not restricted, but the algorithm does not promise to detect isomorphisms or automorphisms in arbitrary graphs.\n\nThe \u201ctrick\u201d is that our method does not actually need to be able to detect isomorphism or find automorphisms, which is why it can sidestep the computational complexity obstacles. Automorphisms are important in some other problems (such as probabilistic inference in some of the references you mention) but they are not necessary for compressing computational graphs, as we argue below. The description below applies to the exact algorithm (which is the focus of the reviewer\u2019s comment).\n \nConsider the following computation graph (using the notation used in the paper where we have (node1, node2, edge label)): (1, 3, 1), (2,3,1), (4,5,1), (3,6,1), (5,6,1)\n \nThis can be visualized as (v1 -> v3), (v2 -> v3), (v4 -> v5), (v3 -> v6), (v5 -> v6) and all edges are labelled with the same weight w_1.\n \nSuppose that we have the constant activation functions for the leaves of the graph: f_1 = 1, f_2= 2, f_4 = 1. And the other activation functions are, say, a sigmoid.\n \nThe output of the exact algorithm will be a graph corresponding to:\n \n(v1 -> v3), (v2 -> v3), (v1 -> v5), (v3 -> v6), (v5 -> v6)\n \nIn this case, we only removed the node v4 and replaced it by v1 (so the compression gain is not high but that is not the point of this example). The point of this example is to illustrate that we merged v1 and v4 despite the fact that there is no automorphism mapping v1 to v4 (in the graph theoretical sense). \n \nHopefully, this example helps to illustrate why we do not have to worry about complexity of detecting symmetries such as graph automorphisms - our algorithm simply does not use them. \n \nWe have added a new paragraph explaining in more detail how structural-equivalence differs from detecting automorphism (page 4).\n\n\n\n> *Regarding the experiments, they show that the proposed techniques can help speed up different types of deep models based on GNNs. One aspect that was not very clear was how large were the computation graphs?* \n\nThe computation graph sizes are in the orders of 10^2-10^5 of nodes, reflecting the input graphs ranging from small molecules to knowledge bases.

In particular, it proposes an idea using a technique named lifting which is used in scaling up of graphical models to detect the symmetries and compress the neural model such as Graph Neural Network. Authors show that this compression can lead to speedups of the models in many tasks.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nPros:\n \n1. The paper takes one of the most important issue of structured convolutional models: scale/speed up. I think this is an area with real world implication where we need more works.\n\n \n2. I think this method can be very useful for networks using lots of identical nodes like molecular network. It can leverage from the repetition in nodes and compress the network into some smaller network and save time and memory.\n \n3. Overall the paper is well written. I liked the illustrations for explaining the methods. Result section is also well structured. It clearly shows the effectiveness of the algorithm over other methods.\n \n##########################################################################\n\nCons: \n\n \n1. Although I think this work is good for small datasets like molecular networks, i am skeptic about its transferability in large scale graphs. The reason behind that is I don't assume there would be a lot of structurally similar nodes in case of a large scale real life graph. Authors did not provide any information on the size of the graphs used for the experiments. \n \n2. Authors proposed two different algorithm, exact and non-exact. There are no comparisons between these two methods are shown in the result. Proper analysis on time and performance of the algorithms are also absent. The motivation behind using exact or non-exact is not clear.\n\n3. On Table 1, the time of the different experiments are given. There are no analysis on time vs performance metric in this table. Does all the baseline show similar performance as the baseline model? The analysis is not present.\n\n4. It would also be interesting to see an analysis on the effect of the algorithms on different graph types based on their characteristics (degree distribution, density, veracity etc). \n \n##########################################################################\n\nQuestions during rebuttal period: \n\n \nPlease address and clarify the cons above \n\n \n#########################################################################\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3256/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3256/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Lossless Compression of Structured Convolutional Models via Lifting", "authorids": ["~Gustav_Sourek1", "zelezny@fel.cvut.cz", "~Ondrej_Kuzelka1"], "authors": ["Gustav Sourek", "Filip Zelezny", "Ondrej Kuzelka"], "keywords": ["weight sharing", "graph neural networks", "lifted inference", "relational learning", "dynamic computation graphs", "convolutional models"], "abstract": "Lifting is an efficient technique to scale up graphical models generalized to relational domains by exploiting the underlying symmetries.

The compression consists of removing asymmetries by merging nodes. They define two algorithms for compression: a non-exact algorithm that merges two nodes that are \"functional\" equivalent and an exact algorithm that merges two nodes that are structurally equivalent.\n\nThe approach seem quite novel, pretty interesting and it could interest a wide audience that works on graph models. However, I think the presentation could be improved. In particular, it is not clear the evalutation settings that they are using. For knowledge completion how do they compute accuracy? Do they use golden triples?\n\nIn conclusion I think section 5 should be improved and writte more clearly but overall I think it is a good paper and should be considered for acceptance.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3256/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3256/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Lossless Compression of Structured Convolutional Models via Lifting", "authorids": ["~Gustav_Sourek1", "zelezny@fel.cvut.cz", "~Ondrej_Kuzelka1"], "authors": ["Gustav Sourek", "Filip Zelezny", "Ondrej Kuzelka"], "keywords": ["weight sharing", "graph neural networks", "lifted inference", "relational learning", "dynamic computation graphs", "convolutional models"], "abstract": "Lifting is an efficient technique to scale up graphical models generalized to relational domains by exploiting the underlying symmetries. Concurrently, neural models are continuously expanding from grid-like tensor data into structured representations, such as various attributed graphs and relational databases. To address the irregular structure of the data, the models typically extrapolate on the idea of convolution, effectively introducing parameter sharing in their, dynamically unfolded, computation graphs. The computation graphs themselves then reflect the symmetries of the underlying data, similarly to the lifted graphical models. Inspired by lifting, we introduce a simple and efficient technique to detect the symmetries and compress the neural models without loss of any information.
