Similarly, top players of competitive videogames are required to contend with frequent updates or patches to their game of choice, and are expected to adapt to the changes quickly and without a significant decrease in skill. By considering each patch of a competitive game to be a separate task, drawn from a distribution describing versions thereof, the adaptation of players to new patches becomes analogous to the adaptation of models to new tasks. This paper seeks to describe the process of players adapting to updates of their games in the language of meta-learning, and then to analyze that process to inspire future modifications to the meta-learning paradigm.", "pdf": "/pdf/6a1199bf11949670fa18fab7a44eaf318d0b0f99.pdf", "proposed_reviewers": "", "paperhash": "anonymous|metalearning_as_learning_the_meta_a_videogametheoretic_perspective_on\\\\_learning_to_learn", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021metalearning,\ntitle={Meta-learning as Learning the Meta: A Videogame-Theoretic Perspective on{\\textbackslash}{\\textbackslash} Learning to Learn},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to Learning to Learn - Workshop at ICLR 2021},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=mSUKAWrkkkc},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "proposed_reviewers": {"value-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615595596483, "tmdate": 1615844205826, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
