tackle the problem of learning good, task-relevant representations for Reinforcement Learning (RL) with policy gradient (PG) methods. Specifically they propose combining the loss of a variational auto-encoder (VAE) with the PG loss during training to learn better features. They compare this approach against a pre trained VAE model with and without fine-tuning on the Atari Breakout task. ", "review": "My recommendation would be to reject this paper for reasons which I will outline below.\n\nPros:\nThe problem of learning good features for RL is an important one to tackle and has application in many important tasks with complex input spaces like vision. The authors explain why this is important and I encourage them to continue to explore this line of research albeit more thoroughly as detailed below. \n\nCons:\nOne big issue with the paper is in its lack of experimental rigour. This can be improved by considering more than just the single Breakout task (the Atari suite itself contains many example tasks ripe for research) and also by comparing against more competitive baselines.\nFor instance the authors mention the AC-VAE (Yang et al. [1]) but do not compare against their method since \u2018they do not report rewards achieved on Breakout\u2019. To me this is not a good enough reason to not have a comparison. Instead I encourage the authors to reimplement the alternative approach and compare it on the tasks they consider.\nWhile the paper lists some early work on representation learning and learning features for RL they do not mention or compare against many other works (e.g. Jaderberg et. al. [2] and Achiam et al [3] to name a few). A thorough literature survey helps place the work in the broader context of the field and allows the work to be evaluated more comprehensively. \n\nFinally there are a number of minor points in the presentation which did not affect my final decision but would be good to fix.  There is a typo where 'Introduction' is spelled 'Introdction'. Reference capitalisation is inconsistent - in some places the paper refers to 'Figure 1' but elsewhere there is 'figure 3' and 'figure 4' (on page 7). If references are to be capitalised, 'table 1' would also have to be replaced with 'Table 1'.\n\nReferences: \n[1] John Yang, Gyuejeong Lee, Simyung Chang, and Nojun Kwak.

More specifically, the authors consider the case where a variational autoencoder (VAE) is to be trained to embed the state, and three training regimes are compared:\n1. The VAE is pretrained on a dataset of episodes - collected separately with a pretrained agent. It weights are then frozen, and a policy is trained online.\n2.  The VAE is pretrained on a dataset of episodes - collected separately with a pretrained agent. Its weights are then refined durign the training a policy online (gradients of the policy are backpropped into the VAE encoder).\n3. The VAE and the policy are traiend end-to-end online jointly.\n\nThe authors' main claim is not only possible, but that pretraining without refinemenet / joint optimization can potentially result in the VAE discarding essential details needed for policy/value optimization; the claim is supported by: \n1. Comparing the three training regimes on Breakout using a PPO;\n2. Providing a visualization of the PPO value function highlighting how in the regimes in 2 and 3 details of the game that intuitively are relevant for good performance are indeed picked up during training.\n\n\nAssessment\n-----------------\n\n-- The positives --\n\nThe paper is well structured and mostly well written - it was in fact a pleasure to read apart from a few confusing bits that I will point to later in the review. \nThe results are a bit thin in quantity, but to the point! The goal and the description of the experiments are clear and detailed, the figures clear and easy to understand.\n\n-- The concerns --\n\n1. The broad topic addressed in the paper (model training in RL) is interesting, but the contributions are not novel enough for this venue.\n\n* First contrbution in Section 1: \"we show that combined learning is possible and that it yields good performing policies\"\nTraining models (variational or not) alongside a policy (in this or similar settings) is commonplace, and we now they can be trained. Example of much richer (action-conditional) and larger scale models than those presented in this submission are for example MuZero (https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08265), or belief state models (one example https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.09237.pdf).\n\n* Second contribtion of Section 2: \"we show that jointly trained representations incorporate additional, task-specific information which allows a RL agent to achieve higher rewards then if it was trained on a static representation\" \nThis statement is quite unsurprising, as we are literally training the encoder to retain that information and provide it to the policy/value functions. Furthermore, the authors do not actually strictly verify that the fully pretrained model doesn't encode the ball location - that is, is the VAE decoder failing to reconstruct or the encoder failing to capture the ball localtion? What happens if you apply the method in Wang et al to PPO^{fixed}?  \n \n2. Whilst running on 1 environment with 1 training setup helps making the point, I can't help wondering if the comparisons between PPO^{VAE} and PPO^{adapt} could have yielded different results if multiple training tricks had been compared, e.g. something like using target networks for the VAE, using replay - which would have also made the comparison of the two method more fair to PPO^{VAE} since PPO^{adapt} has access to more compute.  \nThe problem of how to use a pretrained model is indeed very exciting and I wish they authors had expanded more this section of the paper.\n\nSuggestions \n-- \n\nTo make the paper more interesting, the authors could consider framing the paper in the broader context of unsupervised pretraining in DL (e.g. https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume11/erhan10a/erhan10a.pdf) .\n\nPlease consider clarifying: \n\n- Section 4.2 \"This weight sharing method has proven to be more time efficient than to query the encoder n times\nand concatenate the results afterwards.\" --> I find this a bit confusing - isn't the graph compiler going to optimized this out? Can you elaborate?\n\n- Section 4.3. \"While for PPOadapt, the latent space can be changed without restrictions, the decoder of PPOVAE constantly produces gradients do not contain information about the ball. \" --> Sentence is badly formed, please fix. \n\n- Section 4.3 \"Therefore, PPOVAE has less incentive to achieve higher rewards, which is reflected by its performance.\" --> I do not see this, and would need to see an experiement to show/support this claim. Please point me to the relevant sections of the paper if I missed them.\n\n- Conclusion \"Our work verifies that the fundamental issue with pre-trained representations still exists and shows possible solutions in RL scenarios.\"  --> Why should the fundamental issue should have gone away? Also, the paper doesn't seem to suggest any solutions to improving the bridge between unsupervised pretraining and online training. Please do correct me if I am mistaken.\n\n\nI look forward to the rebuttal, hoping the author will help me reassess the paper in a more positive light. \n\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1238/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1238/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Guiding Representation Learning in Deep Generative Models with Policy Gradients", "authorids": ["~Luca_Lach1", "~Timo_Korthals1", "~Malte_Schilling1", "~Helge_Ritter1"], "authors": ["Luca Lach", "Timo Korthals", "Malte Schilling", "Helge Ritter"], "keywords": ["VAE", "RL", "PPO"], "abstract": "Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) provide an efficient latent space representation of complex data distributions which is learned in an unsupervised fashion.\nUsing such a representation as input to Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches may reduce learning time, enable domain transfer or improve interpretability of the model.\nHowever, current state-of-the-art approaches that combine VAE with RL fail at learning good performing policies on certain RL domains.\nTypically, the VAE is pre-trained in isolation and may omit the embedding of task-relevant features due to insufficiencies of its loss.\nAs a result, the RL approach can not successfully maximize the reward on these domains.\nTherefore, this paper investigates the issues of joint training approaches and explores incorporation of policy gradients from RL into the VAE's latent space to find a task-specific latent space representation.\nWe show that using pre-trained representations can lead to policies being unable to learn any rewarding behaviour in these environments.\nSubsequently, we introduce two types of models which overcome this deficiency by using policy gradients to learn the representation.\nThereby the models are able to embed features into its representation that are crucial for performance on the RL task but would not have been learned with previous methods.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "lach|guiding_representation_learning_in_deep_generative_models_with_policy_gradients", "pdf": "/pdf/c62dca1a0b9a6391c18dddfbbfde9d2d71c96448.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=RfurEF4GDf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nlach2021guiding,\ntitle={Guiding Representation Learning in Deep Generative Models with Policy Gradients},\nauthor={Luca Lach and Timo Korthals and Malte Schilling and Helge Ritter},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=sgNhTKrZjaT}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).

The authors visualize that using a learned latent space of a pre-trained VAE is not good enough for learning policies and propose a solution for this problem: back-propagate gradient policies through the VAE encoder. The authors proposed two versions on this method, one with pre-training and one fully online.\n\nThis paper suffers from fundamental issues. The biggest one in my opinion is its poor literature review. There is a bold statement in the introduction which shapes up the problem that the paper is trying to address and I quote: \"Recently, many such approaches employed the VAE framework which aims to learn a smooth representation of its domain. Most of these approaches follow the same pattern: First, they build a dataset of states from the RL environment. Second, they train the VAE on this static dataset and lastly train the RL mode using the VAE\u2019s representation.\" But the authors do not provide any reference for this. The related work section is also more focused on VAEs rather than its combination with RL. And as one would expect, there is no comparison with previous work either. Joint training of a VAE with a reward predictor or a policy network is not new. There is a massive body of research doing this. PlaNet, Dreamer by Danijar Hafner et al and their variations being the latest ones. \n\nThe experiments are also done on a single Atari game (Breakout) which is not sufficient to demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in a variety of tasks. And again, with no comparison to ANY of the previous work.\n\nOverall, the paper is suffering from multiple fundamental issues which makes it hard to be accepted as a scientific contribution in a top conference.
