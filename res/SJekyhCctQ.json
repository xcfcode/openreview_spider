The writing is clear and the experiments are extensive.\n\n* Weaknesses\n\nThe experiments are thorough. However, they contain a subtle but important flaw. During discussion it was revealed that the attacks used to evaluate the method fail to reduce accuracy even at large values of epsilon where there are simple adversarial attacks that should reduce the accuracy to zero. This casts doubt on whether the attacks at small values of epsilon really are providing a good measure of the method\u2019s robustness.\n\n* Discussion\n\nThere was substantial disagreement about the paper, with R1 feeling that the evaluation issues were serious enough to merit rejection and R3 feeling that they were not a large issue. In discussion with me, both R1 and R3 agreed that if an attack were demonstrated to break the method, that would be grounds for rejection. They also both agreed that there probably is an attack that breaks the method. A potential key difference is that R3 thinks this might be quite difficult to find and so merits publishing the paper to motivate stronger attacks.\n\nI ultimately agree with R1 that the evaluation issues are indeed serious. One reason for this is that there is by now a long record of adversarial defense papers posting impressive numbers that are often invalidated within a short period (often less than a month or so) of the paper being published. The \u201cObfuscated Gradients\u201d paper of Athalye, Carlini, and Wagner suggests several basic sanity checks to help avoid this. One of the sanity checks (which the present paper fails) is to test that attacks work when epsilon is large. This is not an arbitrary test but gets at a key issue---any given attack provides only an *upper bound* on the worst-case accuracy of a method. For instance, if an attack only brings the accuracy of a method down to 80% at epsilon=1 (when we know the true accuracy should be 0%), then at epsilon=0.01 we know that the measured accuracy of the attack comes 80% from the over-optimistic accuracy at epsilon=1 and at most 20% from the true accuracy at epsilon=0.01. If the measured accuracy at epsilon=1 is close to 100%, then accuracy at lower values of epsilon provides basically no information. This means that the experiments as currently performed give no information about the true accuracy of the method, which is a serious issue that the authors should address before the paper can be accepted.", "confidence": "2: The area chair is not sure", "recommendation": "Reject", "title": "interesting direction with extensive experiments but critical flaw"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Area_Chair1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Area_Chair1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Detecting Adversarial Examples Via Neural Fingerprinting", "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples: input data that has been manipulated to cause dramatic model output errors.

We can run the specific comparison you request. \n\nAlso, I believe the paper uses m=1000 (number of \"fingerprints\") -- it does not use the change in normalized-logits, rather it considers the label predictions at a specific set of randomly sampled points around the data-point and uses that as an ensemble classifier. Here are some initial thoughts on the need for embedding:\n\n1. We investigate the effect of adding different numbers of fingerprints in our paper. For instance, see Figure 9b: If we choose low fingerprint numbers  (say N=3) during embedding, the AUC-ROC is quite bad. In fact, we find that with an adaptive attack, we can make the adversarial examples seem more real than the real examples for such low fingerprint numbers.\n\n2. The premise for https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05583 is that adversarial examples are not robust, however there is some evidence that robust adversarial examples can be synthesized (See https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07397).  We believe high-confidence adversarial examples are more robust (in relation to random samples in the neighborhood) => increased success rates for high confidence attacks in https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05583. We believe this would not be the case if the fingerprints are embedded, we will run tests to confirm this. \n\n3. Assuming a non-adaptive attacker, the success rates reported in the paper you cite (e.g. 78% adversarial success rate for JSMA on CIFAR-10) are significantly higher than those reported in our paper.  \n\n4.  https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05583 uses randomized ensembles, so I suspect an adaptive attack with EOT (see Athayle et al.

Bigger robustness numbers can come from both improved robustness, or looser upper bounds, and discerning between these two cases is crucial to determining the true robustness of a defense. For this paper, my reasoning here is that there exists a perturbation bound (namely, infinity), for which the true value of the robustness is known (0%)---so if I want to know how tight my bounds on robustness are, this might be a natural place to look at it. In the case of this paper, in the regime where we know that the true robustness is 0%, the upper bound given by the evaluation in 95%. This indicates that in general, the evaluation might not be giving us tight enough upper bounds to conclude anything about the robustness of the network.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Detecting Adversarial Examples Via Neural Fingerprinting", "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples: input data that has been manipulated to cause dramatic model output errors.

We would like to further add two more points of discussion to your comment:\n\n1. Using more fingerprints leads to more robustness to adaptive attacks, and poses a much harder optimization problem as you mentioned. We did find some evidence that directly points to this during our tests.\n\nFor MNIST with hyper-parameters N=6, \\vareps=0.1, against non-adaptive attacks NeuralFP achieves >95% AUC-ROC detection. When evaluated with adaptive-CW-l2, this number drops to 70% or less (with some variance due to the random dx chosen).\n\nWith N=20, eps=0.05, for the non-adaptive attacks AUC-ROC is near 100% and when evaluated with the adaptive-CW-l2 attack AUC-ROC is still >95%. We see a similar effect with CIFAR-10 as well (in the appendix).\n \n2. To provide extra intuition we discuss some observations from our experiments.\n\nHypothesis: NFP has a flat loss-surface away from the data. \n\nIf we look at Figure 3, most regions away from the training data have a very high fingerprint loss and these regions are mostly flat. The loss surface is essentially flat everywhere, except for a few valleys of low-loss around the data-distribution. We believe the loss surface for the fp-loss looks similar to this plot for MNIST and CIFAR-10 as well.  At large distances, for randomly sampled points, the gradient is essentially not providing much useful information. This interpretation is to some extent justified by what we observe for the random adversary (end of the appendix).\n\nIf we interpret \u201cgradient masking\u201d as a phenomena of supplying the adversary with misleading gradients, we do not think NeuralFP does gradient masking.

I am not surprised to see that they still achieve high accuracy even for unbounded attacks.\n\nIn my previous reply I stated that the authors are (at least implicitly) forcing an inherently non-convex landscape on the adversary. What I mean by this is that they are making the optimization complexity arbitrarily high by introducing these N fingerprint directions. In order to consistently break the defense, an attacker would need to consistently succeed in learning perturbations from x to x' that produce misclassifications. Although x' is close to x, it is expected to have its \"secondary\" perturbation direction deltas (one for each of the N fingerprint directions) conform to those of the new class (of x') rather than the old class (of x). This is an extremely non-convex problem whose difficulty of this is parameterized by N.  If N is high enough, even an unbounded attack would eventually succumb to this effect, due to the increase in accumulation of contributions in the N terms of the fingerprint loss. \n\n(The authors don't state their argument as forcefully as they could, but they do explain the computational burden faced by any attacker that might seek to reverse engineer the fingerprint directions, in the first few paragraphs of Section 2.1.)\n\nThis paper constitutes a new \"arms race\": on the one hand, the adversary has the weapon of \"exposing\" gradient masking through loss approximation and other search or smoothing tricks; on the other hand, the defender can now (by raising the number of hidden \"fingerprint\" directions) increase the burden on the adversary. The authors' experimental results do show that increasing N improve the effectiveness of their defense. What is surprising is that N does not need to be very high to defeat the attacks they consider. Exploration of this tradeoff will be a great area for future investigation."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/AnonReviewer3", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Detecting Adversarial Examples Via Neural Fingerprinting", "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples: input data that has been manipulated to cause dramatic model output errors.

CW-l2 attack has been shown to fail, even when there exist adversarial examples for certain. For example, in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00420 (see Appendix) show that against Defense-GAN the attack is only able to reduce the accuracy to 55% even though adversarial examples exist on the projection manifold. As such, there is no formal guarantee that the CW-l2 attack will succeed.\n\nThis is also discussed in their ICML talk ( https://nicholas.carlini.com/talks/2018_icml_obfuscatedgradients.mp4 ) at minute 15:00."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Detecting Adversarial Examples Via Neural Fingerprinting", "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples: input data that has been manipulated to cause dramatic model output errors.

To conclude, we see that state-of-the-art attacks with more iterations and varying hyperparameters search do *not* generate significantly more successful adversarial perturbations. Together with the results in our paper, this strongly suggests that current attacks are not able to effectively find adversarial perturbations that can fool NFP. \n\n2. Moreover, generating adversarial perturbations by randomly sampling around the data is not successful. This is another sanity check that indicates that NFP does *not* merely implement gradient masking.\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Detecting Adversarial Examples Via Neural Fingerprinting", "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples: input data that has been manipulated to cause dramatic model output errors.

In these settings, NeuralFP achieves AUC-ROCs of 99-100% (near-perfect detection) consistently across attacks and in practical applications where security is a concern in the black-box setting, we believe NeuralFP is a significant step towards solving the problem of adversarial robustness. \n\n** Adaptive white-box setting\nIn the adaptive white-box setting, we show that the approach is robust over the full range of currently known attacks, even when run for a very large number of iterations, and with randomized restarts. We believe that running the attacks for much longer is not likely going to change the numbers significantly. (See Appendix H, Appendix I, Appendix J)\n\n** Weakness of current attacks\nWe do not claim that NeuralFP is entirely robust to all possible attacks, but against attacks that defenses are currently evaluated against, NeuralFP is able to detect such attacks quite successfully. These attacks fail even in scenarios when adversarial examples definitely exist, pointing to weaknesses in the current optimization methods.\n\n** Gradient masking unlikely\nIn addition to evaluation against black-box adversaries and adaptive white-box adversaries, we further evaluate against an adversary that functions by random sampling. This is suggested as a test for obfuscated gradients in (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00420.pdf ). For a set of MNIST and CIFAR-10 unseen data-points, we sample large numbers of points (5e5 to 1e6 points for each input) uniformly randomly in epsilon-balls around the unseen data-points. For these points we analyse the fingerprint-losses and we find that for the entire set of points sampled, we cannot find a single adversarial point with a low fingerprint loss (See Appendix K).\n\nFurther,  we  would  like to note that our defense does not  introduce any non-differentiable functions/optimization procedures that have frequently been associated with obfuscated gradients.\n\n** Current attacks are not effective, even with more computation and hyperparameter search.\nFurther, that current attacks fail even when allowed a large perturbation budget indicates the need for stronger attacks/improved optimization methods. \n\nIn short, we believe that NeuralFP is a strong detection method for current attacks and serves as a useful baseline for developing a new range of adversarial attacks and thereby, robust defenses.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Detecting Adversarial Examples Via Neural Fingerprinting", "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples: input data that has been manipulated to cause dramatic model output errors.

In all their responses, their dismissal of BPDA is the one that ultimately concerns me the most.\n\nHowever, this paper greatly advances the debate.

The commands I am running on the Ubuntu machine are as follows:\n1. cd into the directory with run.sh after extracting the files from the tar-ball\n2. Run the command 'export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd):$PYTHONPATH'\n3.  Run the command './run.sh mnist train attack eval nogrid 50 0.1 10'\n\nAlso, this runs with python 2.7 and we have not tested with python 3 or above.\n\nWe have tested our code on multiple linux platforms with the following specific software versions:\n\n>>> torch.__version__\n'0.3.0.post4'\n\n>>> torchvision.__version__\n'0.2.0'\n\n>>> tensorflow \n'1.4.0'\n\n>>> keras\n'2.1.0'\n\nWe are actively currently working on running PGD (with random restarts) and SPSA with many more iterations.

We respectfully note that the adversarial  examples illustrated in the paper can clearly be deciphered to be altered and unnatural images even with the human eye (e.g. Figure 3 in the paper). This by itself is not convincing evidence that PGD/SPSA can generate \u201crealistic\u201d images from the \u201ctrue\u201d distribution.\n\n\u201c- R.e. high eta leading to failures: this should actually be true both for detection and prediction. For example, at eta = 1.0, an attack that selects the nearest neighbor from another class in the training set should suffice to get 0% detection. In the same vein, an attack that simply uses a generative model of some kind to find images of a class while minimizing distance to an original image should suffice to find high-eta examples of other images that are not adversarially perturbed in the first place.\u201d\n\nWe agree that \u201crealistic\u201d unbounded attacks undoubtedly exist, e.g., images from the training dataset. We would like to clarify that most of our earlier comments with regards to finding realistic images in the rebuttal were in regard to the attacks that we use to  evaluate NeuralFP, such as SPSA/PGD/FGSM/CW. \n\nWe would like to emphasize that our contribution focuses on detecting *bounded* attacks from the literature. Note that we do *not* evaluate or claim robust detection of (yet unpublished) unbounded attacks, e.g., based on generative models such as GANs (e.g., Song et al, NIPS 2018  https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07894). Although we plan to evaluate on detection of unbounded (generative) attacks shortly, the scope of the current paper is limited to bounded adversarial attacks.\n\nFurthermore, for bounded adversarial attacks (e.g., eta<0.25), robust prediction is certainly a more difficult task than detection. For instance, Schmidt et al, NIPS 2018 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11285) argue that robust prediction requires significantly larger amounts of data.\n\n\u201cIn any case, if extending Figure 5 to eta = 1.0 still yields a high success rate at detection with the current attacks, this indicates that it is a failure of current optimization methods, rather than a true detection mechanism, that might be generating this success, so this would be useful.\"\n\n\nWe agree that failure at eta=1.0 would indicate flaws in the evaluated attacks, e.g., their inability might be due to the computationally hardness or might need improved optimization algorithms. We will try to address your suggestion to evaluate up to eta=1.0. However, we note that is computationally demanding.\n\nNote that for each eta, the PGD attack evaluation (with the bisection search  and 1000 iterations) for 112 samples is expected to take 4-5 days on a single GPU. We will try to run as many cases as possible before the revision dates, but we have a limited compute budget and time constraints.\n\nFurthermore, although evaluating at large eta is interesting, note that we do *not* claim NeuralFP can detect all (unbounded) adversarial attacks. However, given its excellent detection performance on both bounded gradient and non-gradient based attacks, we do believe it is a very strong baseline. As such, NeuralFP highlights the need for better attacks. \n     \nAlso, as we discussed in our previous replies, we do not believe our experimental results show that NeuralFP provides robustness merely through gradient masking. We feel that failure of the attacks at eta=1.0 also would not provide conclusive evidence of gradient masking, but rather a failure of the current attacks. However we are running experiments with larger eta-s and will update the manuscript/the page shortly.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Detecting Adversarial Examples Via Neural Fingerprinting", "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples: input data that has been manipulated to cause dramatic model output errors.

Note that our previous experiments were already extensive -- as noted by the reviewer, we have put in significant effort into our evaluation.\n\nFor 112 unseen CIFAR-10 test points we are running: \n1. CW-fp with 20,000 iterations and bisection search with 25 steps for gamma-1 and 12 steps for gamma-2 (roughly 6,000,000 gradient steps per point!).\n\n2. Adaptive-PGD attack (similar to the other adaptive attacks) with \na) 1,000 steps and 1 randomized restart with 6 bisection steps, eps = 16.0/255.0, eps_iter=0.005 (same parameters as https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.10272.pdf)\nb) 50 steps and 50 randomized restarts with 6 bisection steps, eps = 16.0/255.0, eps_iter=0.005 \nWe believe 6 bisection steps suffice here because we are searching for gamma in the range (0.01,10) -- at gamma>10, misclassification starts to fail for a significant fraction of the samples. The fact that increasing gamma causes misclassification to fail indicates that the gradients from L_{fp} are likely not exploding or vanishing. \n\n3. We ran SPSA with 1,000 iterations and 20 bisection steps (with default parameters for eps=0.05, lr=0.01 and delta=0.01). The AUC-ROC is 99.97%. We are running experiments with \n1. lr=0.005 and delta=0.005 to see if that leads to better performance. \n2. eps=0.25, 1000 iterations, lr=0.01 and delta=0.01 to see if SPSA degrades accuracy at larger eta.\n\nOnce we have all the numbers, we will compile the results and update our paper and the page.

It would be very useful if you could point us to related work that has been successful in doing so. We believe traversing the manifold of natural images in a high-dimensional spaces is an inherently challenging optimization problem (assuming a reasonable compute budget). There is no guarantee that any of the current attack techniques we are aware of will find other realistic images in a computationally tractable way (e.g., within a reasonable number of iterations/random restarts), starting from the vicinity of one image. \n\n-- \u201c-Showing that at a sufficiently high eta attacks start to succeed is also useful\u201d\n\nThis makes sense in the context of robust prediction, where for large perturbations you can turn realistic images into noise where classification makes no sense. The functioning of our method is entirely different to robust prediction methods, since noise is unlikely to pass through NeuralFP. One way to definitely fool NeuralFP is to generate images from the true data-distribution, but as discussed, generating \u201crealistic\u201d images from the true data-distribution is not necessarily an easy task."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Detecting Adversarial Examples Via Neural Fingerprinting", "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples: input data that has been manipulated to cause dramatic model output errors.

Although it will take me some time to fully read and respond to the rebuttal, there are some crucial points that I think may inform the authors' revisions:\n\n- R.e. papers that turn 2s into 6s etc, see this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12152, which I believe may be useful.\n\n- R.e. high eta leading to failures: this should actually be true both for detection and prediction. For example, at eta = 1.0, an attack that selects the nearest neighbor from another class in the training set should suffice to get 0% detection. In the same vein, an attack that simply uses a generative model of some kind to find images of a class while minimizing distance to an original image should suffice to find high-eta examples of other images that are not adversarially perturbed in the first place. \n\nIn any case, if extending Figure 5 to eta = 1.0 still yields a high success rate at detection with the current attacks, this indicates that it is a failure of current optimization methods, rather than a true detection mechanism, that might be generating this success, so this would be useful. It is then unclear if this inability is due to computational hardness, or simply an extremely non-convex landscape that requires \"tricks\" to be able to navigate.\n\n- PGD using L2-normalized gradients is an L2 attack which does not minimize l2 distance (i.e. taking gradient steps (step size) * grad / ||grad||. (In the same vein, the authors should also verify that the L-inf PGD attacks they are using normalize the gradient via sign, i.e. (step size) * sign(grad).)\n\nConcretely, it would be very helpful for the authors to show:\n- Figure 5 for Linf and L2 (using PGD [this means sign(grad) and grad/||grad|| respectively] in both cases), extending from eta=0 to eta=1.\n\nI will read and address the rest of the points directly, but just wanted to respond to these in order to give reasonable time for experimentation. Thanks again for the detailed response, and the overall thoroughness.

The reference [1] mentions a number of features of gradient masking. We note that NeuralFP behaves *contrary* to defenses that rely on gradient masking in many ways: it is \n\n1) robust to black-box attacks, SPSA attack and adaptive attacks, and \n2) single step attacks do worse than multi-step attacks.\n\nThis indicates that NeuralFP may not rely on gradient-masking. With the current set of available attacks it seems hard to conclude (beyond reasonable doubt) about NeuralFP\u2019s reliance on gradient masking, one way or another. \n\n\u201c The two reasons I strongly believe this is the case are (a) Figure 5 and (b) the authors themselves state that their loss is highly non-convex and that no gradient-based method may be able to find a solution. This, however, does not guarantee robustness (see [1] for why such \u201cunfriendly\u201d landscapes can usually be circumvented)\u201d\n\nFirst we note that the function L_{fp} is continuous and differentiable with respect to the logits. Also, please note all of the attacks used in [1] are indeed gradient based. \n\nSecond, [1] (See section 4) introduces three strategies to traverse \u201cunfriendly\u201d landscapes: \n  1. BPDA\n  2. Expectation over transformation\n  3. Reparameterization\n\nHowever, we note that none of these techniques seem directly applicable to our defense: \na) BPDA is applicable in settings where gradient information is masked with either non-differentiable operations or optimization procedures that are likely to cause the gradients to not be readily available. Our loss is continuous and differentiable. This leads us to believe BPDA is not relevant to this setting.\nb) Expectation over transformation -- This mechanism is not relevant as NeuralFP involves no randomization during detection.\nc) Reparameterization -- There is no reparameterization involved in the defense. The network *directly* acts on the image space. \n\nPhenomena such as label leaking (https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJm4T4Kgx) are not likely because we do not train using any information about adversarial examples. \n\nHowever, we understand that it might be possible that there exist attacks that break our defense since we do not provide formal guarantees. We have conducted experiments to extensively evaluate our defense, and are continuing to work on evaluating the defense in more detail. \n\nIn this light, NeuralFP sheds light on possible weak spots in several of the attacks we evaluated against. This implies that either NeuralFP is indeed strong and/or we need stronger attacks for performing accurate evaluations -- both situations being beneficial to the adversarial ML community.  We are happy to summarize these discussion points in the final paper.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Detecting Adversarial Examples Via Neural Fingerprinting", "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples: input data that has been manipulated to cause dramatic model output errors.

Please note that this same bisection search is used in the original CW-L2 attack. Further, larger the gamma, more preference is given to minimizing L_{fp}. \n\n\n*** Regarding SPSA: \n\nWe directly inquired with the authors of (https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05666) about choosing the optimal Lagrange parameter to use for the SPSA attack. We were informed that the Lagrange coefficients for their experiments were hand-picked loosely based on the values of the losses. They further recommended that the simplest thing to do, in the context of their paper, is to just optimize J = C * min(1, J_adv) + L_CNN (for large C). This will cause the optimizer to ensure the image is misclassified, but stop optimizing the misclassification loss once it is already misclassified, and then focus on the likelihood loss. In summary, we believe the Lagrange parameter itself does not affect the results to that great an extent, and a coarse search should suffice. However, we are doing a finer search now as detailed at the end of our comment. \n\n*** Regarding CarliniL2-FP: \n\nNote that the loss in CW-fp has a similar form as that used in the SPSA paper (the loss in the SPSA paper was modelled after the loss from the CW attack), hence we believe that the optimization of L_{CW} and L_fp is not too sensitive to the exact Lagrange coefficients; a coarse search should suffice in this case as well. In the paper where the CW-loss function was introduced, the authors argue that the coefficient matters the most in producing the smaller adversarial perturbation. However, as suggested by the reviewer, we are running experiments with an increased number of bisection steps and iterations to be sure of the result. \n\n*** Regarding PGD:\nWe are currently running PGD with a large number of iterations and restarts as discussed above. We will post the results shortly. \n\n-- \u201cThe AUC should monotonically degrade with eta (this is another indication the attacks might not be running for long enough)\u201d\n\nWe agree that with large eta this statement holds true for robust prediction, but it is not obvious that this should indeed be the case for *detection* with NeuralFP, as explained earlier. Large eta can be used to generate noisy images, but it is not entirely obvious that one would be able to generate realistic images from the true distribution by simply allowing for a large eta using the current attack schemes in a computationally tractable manner. \n\n--  \u201cThe method does not seem to be specific to L-infinity constraint. To this end, a version of Figure 5 in the L2 case would be extremely useful in understanding the detection method.\u201d\n\nIndeed, our method is not specific to any adversarial attack. We test against the JSMA attack, which is L-0 based and we have near perfect detection. The CW attack attempts to minimize the L-2 perturbation and we cannot vary the L-2 perturbation as a hyperparameter. Do you recommend any specific L2 based attacks to test-against?\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00420.pdf\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Detecting Adversarial Examples Via Neural Fingerprinting", "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples: input data that has been manipulated to cause dramatic model output errors.

We believe this is because finding \u201crealistic\u201d images in a high-dimensional space starting from the vicinity of the current image may not be an easy task . \n\nBesides the experiments with randomized restarts, which we are currently running, if you have further specific suggestions to improve the paper and the evaluation, we would be glad to hear them.\n\nWe would like to also point out that the Carlini-Wagner attack (https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04644) was compared with that of exhaustive search using a solver-based approach (https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10207). It was shown that the Carlini-Wagner attack does not necessarily succeed in finding the optimal attack. Note that exhaustive search comes with tremendous computation costs (the problem is NP-hard!). This implies that there is no guarantee that the CW attack does indeed find the global minima, and finding the global optima through exhaustive search might be intractable.\n\nAlso, we would like to note again that the SPSA attack and black-box attacks have been shown to overcome defenses that mask gradients. However, NeuralFP performs quite well against these attacks.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Detecting Adversarial Examples Via Neural Fingerprinting", "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples: input data that has been manipulated to cause dramatic model output errors.

We are actively investigating this, and we believe that NeuralFP will result in better attacks being formulated and eventually, better defenses.\n\n-- \u201cAnother issue is whether the NeuralFP would work on more challenging data sets where the classes are highly fragmented - at what rate would the benefits of NeuralFP fade as the classification performance degrades?\u201d\n\nFrom the few experiments we report on MiniImagenet-20, we see good detection rates on FGSM and BIM. Also, when moving from MNIST to CIFAR-10, the classification performance degrades quite a bit, while NeuralFP\u2019s performance nearly stays the same. We think these are promising signs that NeuralFP would be beneficial even on fragmented data-sets where classification is harder. However, conclusively answering this question concretely would need a thorough investigation.\n\n-- \u201cWhat happens to performance if the perturbation directions are chosen so as to better conform with the local sub-manifolds... would fewer perturbations be required? (It would seem that reducing the number of perturbations needed could have a significant effect on training time.)\u201d\n\nThe increased training time (and memory) is indeed one of the biggest drawbacks of our approach, and the suggested idea of using a more principled approach for choosing the perturbation directions could indeed result in faster training, and possibly, better detection of outliers. We believe this is the immediate next step towards making NeuralFP more accessible on more complex tasks like ImageNet.\n\nThanks for pointing out the connection to K-means clustering, that is an insightful interpretation. We will consider this and see if it sheds more light on our approach, and helps us improve NeuralFP.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Detecting Adversarial Examples Via Neural Fingerprinting", "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples: input data that has been manipulated to cause dramatic model output errors.

We would like to briefly summarize and highlight our contributions here, and address specifics in individual comments to the reviewers.\n\nSome merits of our contribution we would like to highlight:\n\n1. NFP is a blackbox defense, i.e. it is attack agnostic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such defense that does not use adversarial examples to learn to distinguish between real and adversarial images, but rather relies on the training data alone and still manages to achieve near perfect detection in the experiments described. \n\n2. NFP does not require extensive fine-tuning to be effective. Indeed, our experiments show that NFP is effective against the strongest state-of-the-art attacks over a wide range of hyperparameters.\n\nDespite the lack of formal guarantees, we present an abundant amount of empirical evidence that our method is robust against a full-range of the strongest available attacks in the literature. In sum, NFP serves as a strong baseline for developing stronger attacks. In turn, this can eventually lead to better defenses.\n\n3. NFP is a promising step towards the problem of detecting and defending against  adversarial attacks with unbounded perturbations (we test SPSA, FGSM with eps=0.25 for CIFAR-10) -- particularly, when the fingerprint is not known to the adversary (for e.g., consider the challenge https://github.com/google/unrestricted-adversarial-examples)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Detecting Adversarial Examples Via Neural Fingerprinting", "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples: input data that has been manipulated to cause dramatic model output errors.

The idea is novel and the paper is well-written, but concerns about gradient masking prevent me from recommending acceptance just yet.\n\nPositives: \nThe paper is extremely well-written, and the approach is clear and presented well. The authors also clearly put significant effort into the evaluation, and accurately/consistently describe threat models that they consider. The approach is also clearly novel, and is interesting. \n\nConcerns:\nMy biggest concern is that this detection mechanism masks gradients in its loss function. The two reasons I strongly believe this is the case are (a) Figure 5 and (b) the authors themselves state that their loss is highly non-convex and that no gradient-based method may be able to find a solution. This, however, does not guarantee robustness (see [1] for why such \u201cunfriendly\u201d landscapes can usually be circumvented)\n\nSome concrete evaluation concerns and experiments that the authors can run to alleviate them:\n- Figure 5 shows adversarial robustness even against eta = 0.25---at this value of epsilon, the attacker should be able to create realistic images of other classes (even without PGD), so this suggests that the loss is somehow making examples hard to find rather than removing them. The authors should address this issue.\n- Showing that at a sufficiently high eta attacks start to succeed is also useful\n- Running SPSA, CarliniL2-FP, and PGD for *many* more iterations and using *many* more steps for binary search (right now it looks like the binary search is looking in a space of size 10^6 with 10 steps, which only has a granularity of about 5k, which means you never see any value < 5k in a bisection search, which casts into doubt all of these results)\n- The AUC should monotonically degrade with eta (this is another indication the attacks might not be running for long enough)\n- The method does not seem to be specific to L-infinity constraint. To this end, a version of Figure 5 in the L2 case would be extremely useful in understanding the detection method.\n\nI also apologize if some of these concerns about gradient masking seem unsubstantiated; that said, I tried to run the code given in the paper, but got several OOM and other errors (utils modules not found, and PyTorch deprecations), even on a machine with 8 12GB-memory GPUs. If the authors can provide instructions for running the code I will be happy to test it and alleviate some of my own concerns. I also tried to reimplement the approach, but did not manage to finish before the review deadline. If I am able to reimplement the approach I will update my review accordingly.\n\nSome smaller comments on the paper:\nA consolidated set of tables for attack parameters in an appendix is needed\n- Page 4 last paragraph line 4 find the subset that \u201csatisfies\u201d instead of \u201csatisfy\u201d\n- Page 5 paragraph 1 line 1 defender,for needs a space before for\n- Page 5 paragraph right before theorem 1 last line Here, for detection needs a , after detection \n- Page 7 paragraph 1 line 2 (2 hidden layers the 2 should be written two\n- Page 7 second last paragraph line 2 \u201cis chosen\u201d instead of \u201care chosen\u201d\n- Page 7 last paragraph line 2 \u201cacross attacks\u201d needs a , after \n- Page 9 table 6 label line 2 \u201cdoes not shown\u201d should be \u201cshow\u201d instead of \u201cshown\u201d \n- Page 9 last line \u201cmeasure of robustness\u201d remove \"of\"\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00420.pdf", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Detecting Adversarial Examples Via Neural Fingerprinting", "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples: input data that has been manipulated to cause dramatic model output errors.

Essentially, a reference collection of perturbations are applied to the training data so as to learn the effects on the classification decision. The premise here is that on average, normal examples from a common class would have similar changes in the classification decision when reference perturbations are applied, whereas adversarial examples (particularly those off the local submanifold) may have a markedly different set of changes from what was expected for the targeted class. These reference perturbations as well as the anticipated output perturbations together form the \"fingerprints\".\n\nTo measure the difference between observed outputs and fingerprints, the average (squared?) Euclidean distance is used. Given a fixed set of input fingerprints (presumably chosen so as to provide coverage of the range of possible perturbation directions), the authors use the distance formula as a regression loss (\"fingerprint loss\") to train the choice of output fingerprints. Although the authors do not explicitly state it this way, this secondary training objective encourages a K-Means style clustering of output perturbations where the output fingerprints serve as cluster representatives. \n\nThis learning formulation is to my mind is both very innovative and extremely effective, as demonstrated by the authors' experimental results. Their experiments show superlative performance (near perfect detection!) against essentially the full range of state-of-the-art attacks. They give careful attention to the mode of attack, and show excellent performance even for adaptive white-box attacks, in which existing attack methods are given the opportunity to minimize the fingerprint loss.\n\nThe presentation of the paper is excellent - clear, well-motivated, and detailed, with careful attention given to experimental concerns such as the choice of perturbation directions (the recommendation is to choose them at random), and the number of fingerprints to pick.\n\nOverall, the reported results are so good, and the approach so convincing, that one wonders what the weaknesses of the approach might be (if any). Questions that do come to mind are:\n* Can an adversarial strategy can be developed that could execute a successful attack while minimizing the fingerprint loss. \n* Another issue is whether the NeuralFP would work on more challenging data sets where the classes are highly fragmented - at what rate would the benefits of NeuralFP fade as the classification performance degrades? \n* What happens to performance if the perturbation directions are chosen so as to better conform with the local sub-manifolds... would fewer perturbations be required? (It would seem that reducing the number of perturbations needed could have a significant effect on training time.)\n\nOverall, this is a very strong and important result, fully deserving of acceptance.\n\nP.S. Two sets of typos that need attention:\n* In Equation 3, the Euclidean norm is taken. In Equation 5, the squared Euclidean norm is taken. Presumably, one of these is a typo.

It might be useful to verify that the attack does >eventually succeed if epsilon is allowed to be 128/255.  \n>(Not because this is an actual valid attack -- but just \n>to make sure the attack is functioning correctly.)\n\n The optimization problem of finding adversarial examples that both misclassify and have a low-fingerprint loss is non-convex, and no gradient method is guaranteed to find a suitable solution (i.e. good local minimum). Though we do not provide *formal* guarantees, it is not obvious if a \u201ccomputationally tractable functional\u201d attack exists that with increasing epsilon will fool neural fingerprinting. We have evaluated with a variety of currently known attacks, and find that neural-fingerprinting is robust across these attacks. \n\nTo evaluate if the defense is simply based on gradient masking, we evaluate both with the adaptive-SPSA attack and black-box adversarial examples, and observe that the detection AUCs do not degrade. Please note that SPSA is gradient-free. \n\nFurther, we do notice a small degradation in AUCs for the adaptive BIM-b and CW-L2, which suggests that the adaptive attacks are not entirely dysfunctional -- which would have likely been the case if the defense was working solely based on masked gradients. \n\nAnother sign against gradient masking is that one step attacks do strictly worse than iterative attacks, unlike [1] cited above. \n\n>> It is not obvious if \n>>1) there are points that successfully produce a misclassification and have a small fingerprint loss (corresponding to the true label), and \n\n>These points definitely exist: we know that there exists at least one image correctly classified as each class, \n>so given an unlimited perturbation budget, there will always exist an \"adversarial example\" with \n>unbounded distortion.\n\n\nThank you for pointing this out, we agree that with unbounded perturbations, such examples exist. For instance, an unbounded \u201csuccessful attack\u201d could transform a natural image of a dog to a natural image of a cat. But, coming up with an attack that finds such \"successful\" unbounded transformations  is likely hard. \n\nAn intuition for why finding such \u201csuccessful\u201d unbounded transformation is likely hard might be that real images are thought to occupy a very low-dimensional subspace in the high-dimensional input space, and so the space of \u201cgood\u201d perturbations might be a very small fraction of the space of all allowed perturbations that a CW attacker searches over.\n\n>> 2) if the CW attack will find it. \n\n>It may not. But clearly an optimal attack should find it, and so if detection rate is not 0% then we know the \n>attack is performing sub-optimally.\n\nAs stated earlier, an optimal attack may be intractable. For reference, in our experiments for the CW-attack, we used the following settings:\n\nL2_BINARY_SEARCH_STEPS_1 = 9 (corresponding to gamma-1)  \nL2_BINARY_SEARCH_STEPS_2 = 5 (corresponding to gamma-2) \nL2_MAX_ITERATIONS = 1000    \nL2_ABORT_EARLY = True      \nL2_LEARNING_RATE = 1e-2     \nL2_TARGETED = True          \nL2_CONFIDENCE = 0           \nL2_INITIAL_CONST = 1e-3    (gamma-1 initial value)\nL2_INITIAL_CONST_2 = 0.1   (gamma-2 initial value)\n\nMeanwhile, we will run experiments with larger L2_MAX_ITERATIONS to see if there is a significant degradation in AUC-ROC.

If you increase the perturbation budget to something much larger does the AUC begin to decrease? (Also: what is the dataset for this figure? MNIST?)\u201d\n\nThe dataset for Figure 5 is CIFAR-10 \u2014 we will include this detail in the paper. 0.25 is already a significantly large perturbation, since our pixel values in the input images are scaled from [-0.5,0.5]. We will run experiments with larger perturbations and report the numbers for this shortly.\n\n\u201cThe adaptive CW attack is unbounded, and should always eventually succeed. That is, for any fixed decision threshold that could be used for detection, the attack should always eventually produce an adversarial example that can fool the detector by introducing a very large perturbation. However, it looks like you claim robustness even at very small thresholds (e.g., a 80+% TPR @ 0%FPR). Do you know what is going on here?\u201d\n\nThe adaptive CW attack is not always guaranteed to work for an arbitrary detection rule for an arbitrary point. For example, the adaptive CW attacks formulated in [1,2] do not succeed. However, we do note that the adaptive CW attack fails in [1] due to gradient obfuscation and [2] has not been tested extensively for gradient obfuscation. \n\nFor the adaptive CW attacks we consider, we do not set up a fixed threshold, instead we attempt to misclassify the point and minimize the fingerprint loss corresponding to the *true class*. From all the successful attacks that produce a misclassification during the iterations, we choose the one with the smallest fingerprint loss. \n\nAlso, we would like to clarify the intuition: At smaller thresholds it is actually harder for the attacker to fool the detector. This is because the fingerprint loss under smaller thresholds admits smaller regions while larger thresholds admit larger regions.\n\nThe fingerprints provide a characterization of the data-distribution and reject regions away from the data-distribution corresponding to the training data . It is not obvious if \n1) there are points that successfully produce a misclassification and have a small fingerprint loss (corresponding to the true label), and \n2) if the CW attack will find it. \n\nFor instance, consider Figure 3 \u2014 there exist no \u201cadversarial regions\u201d that produce a misclassification and have a small fingerprint loss corresponding to the true label. We conjecture that the networks from our experiments on the image dataset (MNIST, CIFAR-10\u2026) show similar behavior \u2014 the \u201cadversarial regions\u201d producing both a misclassification and a small fingerprint loss do not exist/are either quite small and difficult to find. \n\nWe have also considered a variant where the adaptive CW attacker can determine both the target-class for the label-misclassification and the fingerprint loss to be minimized \u2014 constrained to both being the same. This attack performed worse than the variant we report in the paper. \n  \nOur source code (link provided in the paper) includes the implementation for the adaptive CW attack discussed in the paper. If you would like to suggest other variants that are interesting, we would be happy to try them out. \n\n[1] https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1gJ1L2aW (ICLR\u201918)\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03888 (NIPS\u201918)\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper947/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Detecting Adversarial Examples Via Neural Fingerprinting", "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples: input data that has been manipulated to cause dramatic model output errors.
