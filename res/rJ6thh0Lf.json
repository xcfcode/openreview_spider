It proposes to use an ensemble of discriminators, each of which only uses a subset of the coordinates the encoder outputs. Experiments show that the new discriminator better protects the sensitive features of the data, compared to previous works.\n\nquality: the experimental results seems impressive. I have a few questions:\n1. in the experiments , we fix the accuracy degradation rate (2%) and minimize the accuracy of evaluator. Can we give a full tradeoff on these two quantities? This will correspond to applications where different anonymity level is required.\n2. Comparing MA with MARS, we see that MARS is better - are there any explanations? Is it because that the models trained using MA are not diverse enough?\n\nclairity: I don't quite follow Section 2.3, especially the notion of adversarial gradients. What is a formal definition of function V_D(.)? How does Equation (2) relate to the equation in the first page? Also, in the proof of Theorem 1, the analysis of the second term, could you elaborate on why the two variances being equal imply that the second term is zero?\n\noriginality: I am not familiar with relevant literature, and thus unable to judge.\n\nsignificance: I think this is a nice step towards understanding the role of discriminator in the study of adversarial feature learning.\n\nminor commments: please correct the author list in the pdf file, and correct the typographical errors.\n\n\n", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Censoring Representations with Multiple-Adversaries over Random Subspaces", "abstract": "Adversarial feature learning has been successfully applied to censor the representations of neural networks; for example, AFL could help to learn anonymized representations to avoid privacy issues by constraining the representations with adversarial gradients that confuse the external discriminators that try to discern and extract sensitive information from the activations.
