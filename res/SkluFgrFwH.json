Below are our responses to the specific points raised:\n\nRegarding the state-of-the-art: ITML and LMNN are the most widely used and cited methods for learning Mahalanobis metrics, and they represent the state-of-the-art for this problem.\n\nRegarding the novelty of our contribution. Our paper gives the first polynomial-time algorithm with a provable near-optimal guarantee on the number of violated constraints, and for arbitrary (that is, adversarial) inputs. We remark that minimizing the number of violated constraints is a highly non-convex constraint. Therefore, methods that are based on convex optimization are not directly applicable in our setting.\n\nThe paper of Verma and Branson obtains bounds on the sample complexity of learning a Mahalanobis metric, when the input consists of a set of randomly (i.i.d.) chosen labeled pairs of points from an unknown distribution of bounded support. This is different from our setting where the input is adversarial, and the goal is to obtain an algorithm with provably near-optimal error, and provably fast running time. It is also important to note that the notion of error considered by Verma and Branson is different.\n\nThe paper of Ye et al. considers the problem of learning a Mahalanobis metric under perturbations of the input. This setting is completely different than the one considered in our paper.\n\nRegarding the proof of Lemma 2.1. The phrasing in the proof is confusing. What we mean is that adding a constraint to a feasible instance can make it either feasible or infeasible; adding a constraint to an infeasible instance cannot change its feasibility. We will rephrase this in the final version of our paper.\n\nRegarding Figure 4: The running time is not a monotonically increasing function of the dimension because PCA can change the combinatorial structure of an instance in ways that are hard to predict. For example, the minimum number of violations does not need to be a monotonic function of the dimension.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2440/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2440/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["dihara@gmail.com", "nmoham24@uic.edu", "sidiropo@uic.edu"], "title": "Learning Mahalanobis Metric Spaces via Geometric Approximation Algorithms", "authors": ["Diego Ihara", "Neshat Mohammadi", "Anastasios Sidiropoulos"], "pdf": "/pdf/342399b3129eb3fbf5d5c78e96d8d0a4bbe9c1b0.pdf", "TL;DR": "Fully parallelizable and adversarial-noise resistant metric learning algorithm with theoretical guarantees.", "abstract": "Learning Mahalanobis metric spaces is an important problem that has found numerous applications.

Especially because the provided experiments seem to show that there is no improvement  in the accuracy, the authors should have spent some more words  to motivate their strategy.\n\nQuestions:\n\n- Are there any theoretical guarantees for the proposed approximation?

Given a set X \\subset R^d of points, sets S, D of pairs (S and D denoting similar and dissimilar pairs), numbers u, l, find a matrix G such that\n- for all pairs (p, q) \\in S: ||Gp - Gq|| \\leq u, and\n- for all pairs (p, q) \\in D: ||Gp - Gq|| \\geq l.\n\nNote that such a matrix G may not exist for a given input instance (X, S, D, u, l). So, the relevant problem is maximising the number of constraints. The paper gives an (1+\\eps)-approximation algorithm for the maximisation problem. The main idea is defining an LP-type problem and then using a previous result of Har-peled. Some experimental results for a heuristic version are given and compared against other Mahalanobis distance learning algorithms (that may or may not be defined as a maximisation problem). I think the paper ports an interesting result from LP-type problems into the context of distance learning that people may find interesting and may encourage further work.\n\nOther comments: \n1. I did not find any comment about the computational hardness of the problem. It is always good to the hardness of a problem before evaluating an approximation algorithm for the problem.\n2. It will be good to define \u201caccuracy\u201d before using it in Theorem 1.1.\n3. Did you define combinatorial dimension before using this in Lemma 2.1?\n4. What is Exact-LPTML(.) in line 6 of Algorithm 1. The function call should take two inputs.\n5. When you say that your algorithm is an FPTAS I think you are assuming that the dimension d is a constant. It will be good to make this clear.\n6. It will good to know what results for minimising the number of constraints are known from past work. The paper mentions some references.
