The authors conjecture that the intrinsic dimensionality of the local neighbourhood of adversarial examples significantly differs from the one of normal (or noisy) examples. More precisely, the adversarial examples are expected to have intrinsic dimensionality much higher than the normal points (see Section 4).  Based on this observation they propose to use the intrinsic dimensionality as a way to separate adversarial examples from the normal (and noisy) ones during the test time. In other words, the paper proposes a particular approach for the adversarial defence.\n\nIt turns out that there is a well-studied concept in the literature capturing the desired intrinsic dimensionality: it is called the local intrinsic dimensionality (LID, Definition 1) . Moreover, there is a known empirical estimator of LID, based on the k-nearest neighbours. The authors propose to use this estimator in computing the intrinsic dimensionalities for the test time examples. For every test-time example X the resulting Algorithm 1 computes LID estimates of X activations computed for all intermediate layer of DNN. These values are finally used as features in classifying adversarial examples from normal and noisy ones. \n\nThe authors empirically evaluate the proposed technique across multiple state-of-the art adversarial attacks, 3 datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, and SVHN) and compare their novel adversarial detection technique to 2 other ones recently reported in the literature. The experiments support the conjecture mentioned above and show that the proposed technique *significantly* improves the detection accuracy compared to 2 other methods across all attacks and datasets (see Table 1).\n\nInterestingly, the authors also test whether adversarial attacks can bypass LID-based detection methods by incorporating LID in their design. Preliminary results show that even in this case the proposed method manages to detect adversarial examples most of the time. In other words, the proposed technique is rather stable and can not be easily exploited.\n\nI really enjoyed reading this paper. All the statements are very clear, the structure is transparent and easy to follow. The writing is excellent. I found only one typo (page 8, \"We also NOTE that...\"), otherwise I don't actually have any comments on the text.\n\nUnfortunately, I am not an expert in the particular field of adversarial examples, and can not properly assess the conceptual novelty of the proposed method. However, it seems that it is indeed novel and given rather convincing empirical justifications, I would recommend to accept the paper. \n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Characterizing Adversarial Subspaces Using Local Intrinsic Dimensionality", "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently been shown to be vulnerable against adversarial examples, which are carefully crafted instances that can mislead DNNs to make errors during prediction.

The proposed solution seems very intuitive and the empirical evaluations demonstrates its utility. My main concern is the underlying assumption (if I understand correctly) that the adversarial attack technique that the detector has to handle needs to be available at the training time of the detector. Especially since the empirical evaluations are designed in such a way where the training and test data for the detector are perturbed with the same attack technique. However, this does not invalidate the contributions of this manuscript.\n\nSpecific comments/questions:\n- (Minor) Page 3, Eq 1: I think the expansion dimension cares more about the probability mass in the volume rather than the volume itself even in the Euclidean setting.\n- Section 4: The different pieces of the problem (estimation, intuition for adversarial subspaces, efficiency) are very well described.\n- Alg 1, L3: Is this where the normal exmaples are converted to adversarial examples using some attack technique? \n- Alg 1, L12: Is LID_norm computed using a leave-one-out estimate? Otherwise, r_1(.) for each point is 0, leading to a somewhat \"under-estimate\" of the true LID of the normal points in the training set. I understand that it is not an issue in the test set.\n- Section 4 and Alg 1: S we do not really care about the \"labels/targets\" of the examples. All examples in the dataset are considered \"normal\" to start with. Is this assuming that the \"initial training set\" which is used to obtain the \"pre-trained DNN\" free of adversarial examples?\n- Section 5, Experimental Setup: Seems like normal points in the test set would get lesser values if we are not doing the \"leave-one-out\" version of the estimation.\n- Section 5: The authors have done a great job at evaluating every aspect of the proposed method.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Characterizing Adversarial Subspaces Using Local Intrinsic Dimensionality", "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently been shown to be vulnerable against adversarial examples, which are carefully crafted instances that can mislead DNNs to make errors during prediction.

In Section \"Robustness to Adaptive Attack\", we have shown that simply attacking the LID score (towards decreasing the LID scores of adversarial examples) is not effective. Attacking the logistic regression model itself can be expected to have similar results if directly integrate the detection model into the adversarial objective as we did for the LID score. In this paper, we show that adversarial examples tend to transit from a low dimensional submanifold to a more \"complex\" submanifold. A more interesting question is to what extent an attack strategy relies on such transition to find a valid solution. Our proposed LID is not a perfect solution for adversarial detection, after all, it is not 100% accurate in the detection of adversarial examples. In the future, we will investigate more forms of adapted Opt attacks against our LID detector and develop a more in-depth understanding of the detected/escaped adversarial examples.

We have uploaded a new version to address them.\n\n-- Understanding of Table 2:\nWe would like to clarify that the detectors used in Table 2 to detect other attacks, in the previous version, were trained with 20% more data than those used in Table 1 --- that is, the detectors in Table 2 were trained on the training set (80%) plus the test set (20%), whereas those in Table 1 were trained only on the training set (80%). In the latest version of the paper, we have fixed this inconsistency and provided updated results for Table 2, using exactly the same amount of training data (80%) as was used for Table 1. Moreover, we have also provided additional explanations about the exceptionally poor performance of BU measure transferring from FGM to BIM-b.\n \nMeanwhile, we would like to point out that the Opt (or CW) attack we used in this paper is its general L2 version, different to many of its variants designed to attack specific defenses. Code on GitHub by the authors of Opt: https://github.com/carlini/nn_robust_attacks/blob/master/l2_attack.py\nThe reason is that we are more interested in the understanding of the shared properties across different types of attack strategies including Opt and also many others, so that to motivate defense against adversarial attacks in general (not limited to Opt attack). You are very welcome to check the consistency of the code --- we appreciate your interest in this.\n \nThe following responses are related to two papers: 1) the original defense paper of KD and BU (Feinman et al. (2017)), and 2) the latest attack paper (Carlini&Wagner (2017a)).\n \n-- KD works on CIFAR-10?\nYes, our result in Table 1 indicates this. This contradicts the statement in Paper 2 Sect. 5.2, where it says that KD cannot work on CIFAR, as 80% of the time the adversarial example has a higher likelihood score than the original image. However, our result is consistent with the result in the original Feinman paper (Table 2, Paper 1). We found not only that Opt plus KD can detect Opt, but also that the simpler attack FGM plus KD can detect Opt (Table 2). The deeper reasons behind this require further exploration.\n \n--\u2018Opt\u2019 seems to fail against the KD detector?\nYes. But it is the general Opt L2 attack that failed the KD detector, not the KD-adapted version of Opt.

At a high level, although deep neural networks have demonstrated superior performance for many tasks, certain properties which can affect their behavior (such as subspaces, manifold properties) are still not well understood.   A better understanding of these properties can motivate more robust/efficient/effective deep learning models, which can in turn lead to further improving their performance. Adversarial vulnerability is one such property that jeopardizes the reliability of deep neural network learning models, as very small changes on inputs can sometimes lead to completely incorrect predictions (such changed inputs are called adversarial inputs). In this paper, we investigate the expansion dimensional property of the subspaces surrounding such adversarial inputs and show that it can be used as an effective characteristic for detecting such inputs.
