Concretely, a sublinear convergence rate under a general setting and improved convergence rates under KL-condition are provided.\n\nAn interesting point of the paper is that (i) the boundedness assumption on the domain or gradient is not required and that (ii) shows faster convergence rates under KL-condition for non-descent methods. However, a major concern is a uniform boundedness assumption on learning rates. A lower bound is a matter because this condition is verified a posteriori after running methods. This kind of condition is not preferred in general. Indeed, most studies provide convergence analyses without such assumptions. In addition, there are several missing references (listed below) that attempt to analyze the convergence of adaptive methods. To make the position of the paper clear, it would be better to provide a theoretical comparison with these studies. Especially, [LO2019] and [XWW2019] are related to this study. [LO2019] has provided convergence analyses without boundedness assumptions on the domain or gradient and [XWW2019] has provided a linear or better convergence rate of an adaptive method by utilizing the KL-condition. Note that a method treated in [XWW2019] is also a non-descent method because there is no theoretical limitation on the initial step size.\n\n[WWB2018] X.Wu, R.Ward, and L.Bottou, WNGrad: Learn the Learning Rate in Gradient Descent. arXiv, 2018. \n[WWB2019] R.Ward, X.Wu, and L.Bottou.

Moreover, they also prove convergence in function value for a class of functions that satisfy Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) property. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first work that utilizes KL property and respective analysis for ADAM-like methods. I have to note that I disagree with your statement of being \u201cadaptive\u201d.\n\nI summarize my comments step by step below:\n\nI find the presentation and organization of the paper clear and structured. Related work is sufficient, the authors cite relevant papers with respect to convergence in deterministic and stochastic setting and present detailed comparison between their framework. Similarly, the momentum idea is motivated through Polyak\u2019s Heavy ball. The known rates for KL functions are provided in conjunction with momentum-based methods.\n\nZaheer et al. (2018) assume \\beta_1 = 0, meaning their proof works for RMSProp. However for this paper, given that Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 are provided for Algorithm (2), then the algorithm in question is not exactly the same as ADAM either, in my opinion. The bias correction steps are missing. The authors should clarify this point in the paper.\n\nDefinition of adaptivity is a little vague for me. There exist different notions of adaptivity (adaptation to global/local smoothness without knowing L, adaptation to non-smooth & smooth problems simultaneously etc.) The authors define adaptivity as \u201ccomputing step size using gradient history\u201d. However, their upper bound for the step size requires knowledge of L. Also, they assume a uniform lower bound for step size. These make their framework rather non-adaptive in my opinion.\n\nFollow up comment: How would one apply this method to neural networks, or any class of problems where Lipschitz constant is virtually unknown?\n\nConvergence rate in deterministic oracle setting, provided in Theorem 4.2, is plausible. The proof is nice and easy to read. Compared to De et al., the authors show faster rates with respect to number of iterations. But the rate depends on upper/lower bounds of the step size.\n\nConvergence rates in the stochastic setting suggest the quantity does not go to zero, but converges to some noise dominated region (equivalently to some neighborhood) of stationary points. Zaheer et al. has a similar rate characterization for RMSProp, but this paper considers first order moment accumulation on top Zaheer et al. I am not sure about the impact of this results compared to existing ones for ADAM variants. Similar to deterministic case, the analysis is nice and clean. The rate has no dependence on dimension, but so does the analysis of De et al. (2018) and Zaheer et al. (2018). It is not new, but it is a desirable property of the analysis.\n\nI have doubts about \u201cnot having bounded gradient assumption\u201d. There exists a uniform lower bound for a_n, which implies the sum of square of each coordinate of gradients are bounded, which implies the infinity norm of gradients is bounded. I believe there is an implicit assumption of bounded gradients. It also makes me question if somehow the dimension dependence is hidden under this step size lower bound. I would expect the authors to address the concerns about bounded gradient and dimension dependence.\n\nConvergence characterization for KL functions with (sort of) adaptive step size is new also to the best of my knowledge. The convergence analysis is based on PALM (Bolte et al. (2014)) and Bolte et al. (2018) and these previous results are adapted to ADAM. My concern about this direction is whether neural networks belong to this class of functions. If not, how useful it is to use ADAM for this class of functions?\n\nOverall, authors approach ADAM-like methods from a generalized scheme based on Heavy Ball, and provide analysis for smooth, non-convex functions with deterministic/stochastic gradients. Having dimension-independent rates is a positive trait of the analysis, but I would like to see a clarification regarding my previous point. In the stochastic setting, dimension-free rate for ADAM (which has very similar characterization to RMSProp in Zaheer et al.) seems to be an important results of this paper. I think the KL function analysis is a new result for \u201cadaptive\u201d, evolving step sizes, as well. However, I do not agree with the claim that the authors do not make bounded gradient assumption. In a way, the uniform lower bound on the step size implies it. Knowledge of Lipschitz constant (through step size upper bound) is a restriction for \u201chighly non-convex\u201d neural network optimization problems. Considering that ADAM is a classical optimizer for neural networks, I also doubt KL property holds for complex networks. Also, I am not convinced that the algorithm is truly adaptive (upper bounding step size with a function of Lipschitz constant.) \n\nI am inclined to give a weak reject to this paper because I am not convinced that the results presented in the paper are compatible with the application. I would also like to see the justification/clarification of the authors for my previous concerns before making the final decision."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1923/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1923/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["anas.barakat@telecom-paristech.fr", "pascal.bianchi@telecom-paristech.fr"], "title": "Convergence Analysis of a Momentum Algorithm with Adaptive Step Size for Nonconvex Optimization", "authors": ["Anas Barakat", "Pascal Bianchi"], "pdf": "/pdf/e504955342831b0c69d7923124a96887581210bd.pdf", "abstract": "Although Adam is a very popular algorithm for optimizing the weights of neural networks, it has been recently shown that it can diverge even in simple convex optimization examples.

Furthermore, we establish convergence rates of the function value sequence using the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property.", "keywords": ["nonconvex optimization", "adaptive methods"], "paperhash": "barakat|convergence_analysis_of_a_momentum_algorithm_with_adaptive_step_size_for_nonconvex_optimization", "original_pdf": "/attachment/e504955342831b0c69d7923124a96887581210bd.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nbarakat2020convergence,\ntitle={Convergence Analysis of a Momentum Algorithm with Adaptive Step Size for Nonconvex Optimization},\nauthor={Anas Barakat and Pascal Bianchi},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyeYiyHFDH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
