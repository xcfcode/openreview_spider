Below is our response to the common concerns and questions from all reviewers.\n\n- Code Release\n\nWe have released the whole codebase including search, which could be accessed with the following links:\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/ced78872-1992-43b9-ad69-2d611a14616d/\n\n- Transfer learning on COCO Object Detection and Instance Segmentation\n\nTo address the concern that the experiment in the paper is not enough, we assess the performance of AtomNAS models as feature extractors for object detection and instance segmentation on COCO dataset. For more details, please check the appendix A at the end of our revised paper.\n\nWe first pretrain AtomNAS models (without Swish activation function and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) module) on ImageNet, use them as drop-in replacements for the backbone in the Mask-RCNN model, by building the detection head on the last feature map, and finetune the model on COCO dataset. \n\nWe use the open-source code MMDetection (https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection ). All the models are trained on COCO train2017 with batch size 16 and evaluated on COCO val2017. Following the schedule used in the open-source implementation of TPU-trained Mask-RCNN (https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/mask_rcnn ), the learning rate starts at 0.02 and decreases by a scale of 10 at 15-th and 20th epoch respectively. The models are trained for 23 epochs in total.\n\nThe results are shown below. The detection results of baseline models are from [1]. We can see that all three AtomNAS models outperform the baselines on both object detection task. The results demonstrate that our models have better transferability than the baselines.\n\n| Model                           | FLOPs | Cls (%)   | detect-mAP (%)   | seg-mAP (%)  |\n| ------------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |\n| MobileNetV2              | 301M  | 73.6         | 30.5                          | -                            |\n| Proxyless (mobile)  | 320M  | 74.6         | 32.9                          | -                            |\n| SinglePath+               | -            | 75.6         | 33.0                          | -                            |\n| AtomNAS-A                | 258M  | 74.6         | 32.7                          | 30.1                     |\n| AtomNAS-B                | 326M  | 75.5         | 33.6                          | 30.8                     |\n| AtomNAS-C                | 360M  | 75.9         | 34.1                          | 31.4                     |\n| ------------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |\n\n\n=== References ===\n[1] Stamoulis, et al., Single-Path Mobile AutoML: Efficient ConvNet Design and NAS Hyperparameter Optimization.

We respond to each concern below.\n\nQ: \"The authors do not include the searching cost and inference latency in Table 1...The authors only point out that DenseNAS uses more parameters.  It would be better if the authors can make the comparison more transparent.\" \n\n\"I wonder when given the same searching budgets as ProxylessNAS and DenseNAS, how well AtomNAS can perform.\"\n\nFirst, we would like to clarify that the search cost of ProxylessNAS and DenseNAS are measured on V100, not Titan XP, as confirmed by the authors. Titan XP was used to measure the latency in DenseNAS paper.\n\nOur method simultaneously search and train the final architecture in an end-to-end manner; the result model can be directly used for inference.  On the other hand, previous NAS methods like ProxylessNAS and DenseNAS require retraining the searched architecture from scratch after searching. There is no direct way to measure the search cost of our method, as the search and the training are mixed. For reference, simply training the searched architecture from scratch takes 704 V100 hours, and thus the \u201cextra\u201d cost of our method is around 112(=816-704) V100 hours. The cost is much less than ProxylessNAS and 20 V100 hours more than DenseNAS. However, DenseNAS uses a small portion of the original ImageNet training data (quote from the paper \u201cFor the search process, we randomly choose 100 classes from the original 1000 classes of the ImageNet training set. We sample 20% data in each class of the ImageNet subset to form the validation dataset. The remaining data is used for training.\u201d); in other words, DenseNAS uses a proxy dataset, unlike ours and ProxylessNAS which both use the original data.\n\nAt last, we would like to thank Review 3 for bringing up this discussion, as we are definitely interested in further reducing the computational complexity of our method.\n\nQ: The authors use only one dataset: ImageNet. I would like to see results on some other datasets or tasks. For instance, the authors may apply AtomNAS to other image classification datasets or finetuning the pre-trained models on object detection or semantic segmentation tasks.\n\nSee 'Reply To Common Concerns' above."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2280/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2280/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["meijieru@gmail.com", "yingwei.li@jhu.edu", "xiaochen.lian@bytedance.com", "jinxiaojie@bytedance.com", "linjie.yang@bytedance.com", "alan.l.yuille@gmail.com", "yangjianchao@bytedance.com"], "title": "AtomNAS: Fine-Grained End-to-End Neural Architecture Search", "authors": ["Jieru Mei", "Yingwei Li", "Xiaochen Lian", "Xiaojie Jin", "Linjie Yang", "Alan Yuille", "Jianchao Yang"], "pdf": "/pdf/a9423bf70ee536a3131f4ff3443f5496aeb973c0.pdf", "TL;DR": "A new state-of-the-art on Imagenet for mobile setting", "abstract": "Search space design is very critical to neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms.

Below we provide responses to each concern.\n\n3. How do you justify the generality of the channel-wise search space?  For example, is it possible to also search for input/output channel size (column f in Figure 3) and #layers per stage (column n in Figure 3)? Adding some discussions for this would be very helpful.\n\nOur formulation (Equation (1)-(3)) is not only for MobileNetV2 block, but also compatible with other structures like conv-conv, conv-maxpool-conv and  conv-bn-relu-conv, which are the building blocks of many popular architectures (e.g., VGG Net, Residual block). We use the MobileNetV2 blocks in the experiments as its wide application in state-of-the-art NAS methods thus easing the comparison between our method and them.\n\nWe don\u2019t introduce additional constraints. Most NAS methods (e.g., [1,2,3,4]) specify the skeleton of the supernet where the input/output channel is manually determined. It\u2019s an interesting research topic in the NAS community. As for \u201c#layers per stage\u201d, it is actually allowed to change during the search process: when all atomic blocks within a layer are removed, the layer is essentially a skip connection. Although in practice, this never happens.\n\nAt last, we want to emphasize that our method has an exponentially larger and more flexible search space than previous methods. The biggest contribution of our method is that we could use mixed operations instead of selecting one operation from a few options as did in previous methods. In this way, the search space is much more flexible and bigger than the previous ones. For your reference, the total number of possible structures within the experiment is around $10e162$, compared with $10e21$ for FBnet. It\u2019s straightforward to extend our method into using mixed convolution types, mixed activation functions, and so on.\n\n4. The title seems too broad. I recommend the authors including \u201cchannel-wise\u201d in the title.\n\nThanks for the advice. We will figure out a more proper title. \n\n5. Please provide some justifications on how to set $\\lambda$  and $c_i$ in Equation (5).\n \nAs the \u03bb increases, the FLOPs of the final model decrease. We set $\\lambda$ in a heuristic way, such that the resulting models have similar FLOPs as previous state-of-the-art networks under 400M: MixNet-S [1], MixNet-M [1] and SinglePath [4].\n\nc_i\u2019s are computed by equation 6, where we first calculate the FLOPs of every atomic block in the model and then normalize them globally to get $c_i$.\n\n6. When you say \u201cexpands the input channel number from C to $3\\times 6$C\u201d, what does \u201c$3\\times 6$C\u201d mean? Is it 18C? What\u2019s the reason for choosing this specific value?\n\nIt means 18C. We choose this value as 6 is widely used as the maximum expansion ratio [1, 2, 3].\n\n7. Could you show the accuracy and complexity (either FLOPS or params) of the supernet during the training? This information would be helpful to interpret and justify your algorithm 1.\n\nThe top-1 accuracy of the supernet is 78.39. As mentioned in Section 3.3, the FLOPS of supernet is 1521M with 11M parameters.\n\n8. The network architecture in Figure 5 is vague. Could you provide the network source code or frozen graph for this specific model?\n\nWe have released the code (including search). See 'Reply To Common Concerns' above.\n\n===References===\n[1] M.

For example, each block in our architecture has a mix of three different conv kernels; we haven\u2019t apply any optimization to it (e.g., paralleling the computation of three kernels). Under the same total number of kernels, our block is slower than those with a single kernel size, e.g., a typical MobileNet V2 block. In addition, our method specifically targets at reducing the FLOPs, not latency. Therefore FLOPs is a fairer metric than inference speed like GPU time at this stage.\n\nQ: The biggest problem of this paper is that experiment is not enough.

The NAS search algorithm is similar to previous one-shot NAS, but the search space is channel-wise: each channel has it\u2019s own kernel size, which is quite novel and interesting. Results are strong in terms of FLOPS and parameters.\n\n[High-level comments]:\n\n1. I like the novel idea of channel-wise search space, which provides great flexibility for NAS.  Although some recent works (e.g., MixNet) have tried to partition channels into groups, this paper goes further and searches for different kernel size for each single channel.  With this channel-wise search space, it naturally enables a combination of per-channel kernel size selection and per-channel pruning, leading to strong results in terms of FLOPS and parameters, as shown in Figure 4 and Table 1.\n\n2. In general, channel-wise NAS is difficult as different channels are often coupled in various ways. However, the authors observe that recent NAS (such as MnasNet/MixNet/SCARLET-A/EfficientNet) are mostly based on a common MB pattern. By targeting to this specific pattern and applying some additional constraints (e.g. fixed input/output channel size and fixed number of layers per stage as shown in Figure 3), the authors successfully make the channel-wise NAS work well.  I appreciate the authors efforts, but I am also a little concerned that the proposed approach might be limited to this specific small search space. \n\n[Questions and suggestions to authors]:\n\n3.  How do you justify the generality of the channel-wise search space?  For example, is it possible to also search for input/output channel size (column f in Figure 3) and #layers per stage (column n in Figure 3)? Adding some discussions for this would be very helpful.\n\n4. The title seems too broad. I recommend the authors including \u201cchannel-wise\u201d in the title.\n\n5. Please provide some justifications on how to set \u03bb  and c_i in Equation (5).\n\n6. When you say \u201cexpands the input channel number from C to 3 \u00d7 6C\u201d, what does \u201c3x6C\u201d mean? Is it 18C? What\u2019s the reason for choosing this specific value?\n\n7. Could you show the accuracy and complexity (either FLOPS or params) of the supernet during the training? This information would be helpful to interpret and justify your algorithm 1.\n\n8. The network architecture in Figure 5 is vague. Could you provide the network source code or frozen graph for this specific model?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2280/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2280/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["meijieru@gmail.com", "yingwei.li@jhu.edu", "xiaochen.lian@bytedance.com", "jinxiaojie@bytedance.com", "linjie.yang@bytedance.com", "alan.l.yuille@gmail.com", "yangjianchao@bytedance.com"], "title": "AtomNAS: Fine-Grained End-to-End Neural Architecture Search", "authors": ["Jieru Mei", "Yingwei Li", "Xiaochen Lian", "Xiaojie Jin", "Linjie Yang", "Alan Yuille", "Jianchao Yang"], "pdf": "/pdf/a9423bf70ee536a3131f4ff3443f5496aeb973c0.pdf", "TL;DR": "A new state-of-the-art on Imagenet for mobile setting", "abstract": "Search space design is very critical to neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms.

Instead of a search-and-retrain two-stage paradigm, our method simultaneously searches and trains the target architecture. \nOur method achieves state-of-the-art performance under several FLOPs configurations on ImageNet with a small searching cost.\nWe open our entire codebase at: https://github.com/meijieru/AtomNAS.", "keywords": ["Neural Architecture Search", "Image Classification"], "paperhash": "mei|atomnas_finegrained_endtoend_neural_architecture_search", "code": "https://github.com/meijieru/AtomNAS", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nMei2020AtomNAS:,\ntitle={AtomNAS: Fine-Grained End-to-End Neural Architecture Search},\nauthor={Jieru Mei and Yingwei Li and Xiaochen Lian and Xiaojie Jin and Linjie Yang and Alan Yuille and Jianchao Yang},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BylQSxHFwr}\n}", "full_presentation_video": "", "original_pdf": "/attachment/61bc0fecda1769f168e1db46a5784b74f864ecea.pdf", "appendix": "", "poster": "", "spotlight_video": "", "slides": ""}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).

What's more, the authors propose a resource-aware search to reduce the computation and dynamically shrinkage the model to accelerate the learning. Retraining the final network is no longer needed. They achieve state of art on ImageNet under several complexity constraints.\n\nPros:\nNovel idea: the insight of this paper is that \"larger network building blocks can be represented by an ensemble of atomic blocks\". With this in hand, it can search the exact channel number through channel selection (i.e. atomic block selection, according to my understanding).\n\nEfficiency: Resource-aware selection and dynamical shrinkage of the model also make it more efficient in inference and training. \n\nCons:\nIt would be better if the author could provide some comparison on GPU time. Since FLOPs is only an indirect metric for speed evaluation. \n\nThe biggest problem of this paper is that experiment is not enough. It would be more convincing if experiments on other popular datasets (CIFAR10/100 etc.) or tasks (object detection, semantic segmentation, etc.) are implemented.\n\nConclusion:\nThis is an interesting paper with novel idea and efficient implementation. However, more experiments are needed to validate the utility of the proposed method.
