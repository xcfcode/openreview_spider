Extensive experiments on UAV123, VOT2018 and VOT2019 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the 35 FPS running speed indicates its competitive efficiency.\n\nStrengths:\n1. The idea of multiplying the weights of aggregated template feature to the search feature is interesting and rather intuitive, the experimental results on several datasets confirmed the effectiveness.\n2. This paper is well-organized and easy to follow.\n3. Comprehensive experiments including the appendix are carried out, and convincing.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. Lacking important literature reviews on highly relevant works.\nThe proposed SOT method belongs to 1) anchor-free and 2) attention-based pipelines. There are several latest and popular works the author should mention in Related Works:\nSiamFC++: Towards Robust and Accurate Visual Tracking with Target Estimation Guidelines   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.06188.pdf\nSiamCAR: Siamese Fully Convolutional Classification and Regression for Visual Tracking    https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07241v2\nSATIN: Siamese Attentional Keypoint Network for High Performance Visual Tracking\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10128.pdf\nAll three works above are anchor-free methods, and the third paper SATIN adopts attentional mechanism for SOT.\nThe author compared the proposed method with SiamFC++ and SiamCAR in experimental results, but the review of these methods and explanation of difference in methodology are missing in this paper.\nAs a matter of fact, the most relevant work to this paper is SATIN which also adopted channel and spatial attention in Siamese architecture. The only difference is multiplying the attentive channel weights of exemplar to candidate, which is called cross-attention in this paper. \nThe author should give a more thorough review and explain the difference between these works.\n\n2.  The contribution of this work is rather limit.\nThe paper describes three contributions in section 1, however,  the second point (anchor-free and DIoU) is hardly the contribution of this work  but reimplementation of previous works, and the third point is only a report of experimental results. In fact, the only contribution of this work is introducing cross-channel attention to explicitly learn the correlation of template and search images, which is a small trick in network design. Compared to SATIN, which also adopts channel attention to template feature and spatial attention later,  this paper does not bring a substantial contribution to visual tracking community. \n\n3. The comparison with SOTA methods are not comprehensive.\nThe experimental results on UAV123 do not include SOTA method SiamFC++, similarly, results on VOT2018 do not include SiamCAR, and results on VOT2019 do not include SiamFC++ and SiamCAR. Moreover, the author should also compare the results with SATIN on both OTB and VOT datasets.\n\n4. The presentations of Figure 1 and Figure 4 are terrible.\nThe resolution of Figure 1 is rather low, and the author did not even explain which one corresponds to the challenge situation of three aspects in figure caption. It is hard to tell which one is better in case 1 (first row) and case 2 (second row) due to the low resolution.\nFigure 4 is rather confusing. The author did not explain the visualized confidence map belongs to which layer, and this attentive map is whether from template feature or search feature. I assume the second row on left side is from the subsequent frames, then what\u2019s the meaning of both rows on right side, and why there is a blank gap between left and right?\nThe author should pay more attention to improve the figures in this paper, and the captions should be more thorough without ambiguity.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3316/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3316/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SiamCAN:Simple yet Effective Method to enhance Siamese Short-Term Tracking", "authorids": ["~Yue_Zhao10", "~Zhibin_Yu3"], "authors": ["Yue Zhao", "Zhibin Yu"], "keywords": ["Siamese trackers", "cross-attention", "light structure", "anchor-free"], "abstract": "Most traditional Siamese trackers are used to regard the location of the max response map as the center of target.

Concerning the points raised in the your review:\n\n1.\"There is no significant insight, training, updating novelty or theoretical. \"\n\nRe: We're so sorry that the first submitted version didn't clearly explain our novelty, due to the limited time. We have submitted the new version which involves more experiments , analysis and comparision with other anchor-free trackers. Briefly speaking, the most novelty of our paper is how to use the existed method and limited sources (such as one GPU) appropriately to achieves the nearest to the SOTA performance.  Honestly, it has been a long time that tracking research have to depends on sufficient Laboratory equipment, the more GPUS the better performance. So I think our methods have a potential contribution to tracking community to some extent. More details looking forward your reading :).\n\n 2. \" The performance VOT 2019 is worse than state-of-the-art, which is not reported\"\n\nRe: As we known, the best performance in VOT2019 is Ocean (EAO:0.350 R:0.316 ), while it involves a update branch. However, Ocean without update branch(EAO:0.327 R:0.376 ), ours (EAO:0.330 R:0.376 ) ,  the gap between the result of two trackers is not very big. Moreover, Oceans involves  feature alignment module and feature combination  module,  which is more complex than our module and have larger layer parameters. \n\n3. \"The trackers selected for comparison do not include the best performing ones\"\n\nRe: We acknowledge that some trackers we don\u2018t compared in our paper, such as Ocean, Siamatten. The reason is that it is not easy for us to compare with them, for example, both of them use the deformable convolution but they don't do ablation study about that part so I cannot analysis at the same level. However, our tracker also achieves not bad results, for example,  on UAV123(ours AUC 0.638 Pr0.850;Siamatten AUC 0.650 Pr0.845), VOT2018(ours EAO 0.445 R:0.173;Siamatten EAO 0.470 R:0.16). And our method not always get the best scores, details in new paper section 4.\n\n4.\"It is not clear why VOT 2020 was not included.\"\n\nRe: We're so sorry that due to the limited time and sources, we don't have sufficient time to test and analysis on VOT2020. We will finish this work later :).\n\n5.\"This is \"yet another siamese tracker\"\"\n\nRe: We acknowledge that our baseline is siamese tracker, but our goal is not to reproduce another Siamese tracker. The goal of our paper is to discuss if we use appropriate method  and training strategy  can we get satisfactory result. The answer is yes. The simpler network structure, the better performance. From this prospective, I don't think our work is yet another Siamese  tracker :).\n\nTo sum up, thanks for your patient reading.

We add a more thorough review in section 2 and have submitted the new paper, looking forward for your reading. About the cross-attention module in SATIN, we think it just has the same name with ours. The 'cross' in SATIN means attention cross shallow and deep layers, while ours 'cross' tends to represent the information flow between the search branch and template branch which is totally different. Don't worry, the above analysis is rewritten in the paper :).\n\n2.\"The contribution of this work is rather limit.\"\n   \nRe: Due to the paper first submit time, we haven't  done a good writing to emphasis our contribution. In the new paper, we add more experiments and analysis about our works. Our goal is to use the simple strategy and light structure to achieve nearest to the SOTA performance. We hope our work can be adopted by other reseachers as strong baseline like SiamFC, SiamRPN. From this prospective, we think our work can do a potential contribution to tracking community :).\n\n3.\"The comparison with SOTA methods are not comprehensive.\"\n   \nRe: As for the reason of  experimental results on UAV123 and on VOT2019 do not include SiamFC++ , the official website  https://github.com/MegviiDetection/video_analyst/blob/master/docs/TUTORIALS/SOT_SETUP.md  and paper don't provide their raw results, so I\u2018m regret comparing tracking results without this powerful tracker too :(. The same reason for SiamCAR  https://github.com/ohhhyeahhh/SiamCAR . About SATIN, the code haven't released so the only approach to get the tracking result is the data in paper. All in all, I add the more relative tracking results in the new paper as much as I could find :) .\n\n4. \"The presentations of Figure 1 and Figure 4 are terrible.\"\n\nRe: I'm so sorry that our pics and caption are so confusing, we already upload the high resolution figure with clear annotation  and rewrite the caption. \n\nTo sum up, thanks for your patient reading.

It has been a long time that  tracking reasearch have to depends on sufficient Laboratory equipment such as numerous GPUS to gain better performance. How to use limited sources to have ideal results is of great importance for tracking community. Our tracker adopts simple yet effective method to gain nearest SOTA results.  In this aspect, I think our paper has quiet technical contribution. I'm so sorry that our first paper is not satisified due to the limited time.

The 1D conv layer and the sigmoid function your mentioned is a part of ECA network which is involved in cross attention module :).\n\n3.\"The description of the method is not clear\"\n\nRe: I'm so sorry again, due to our careless, the figure and caption are confusing.

The method achives state-of-the-art performance on four visual tracking benchmarks. \n\n## Strengths\n\n +. The design of the network is reasonable, including using template's channel information to help the search branch to learn more specific feature, using spatial attention to aggregate location information from the depth-wise correlation, and utilizing anchor-free regression head to locate the object. \n\n+. The final results are good, and ablation study shows the effectiveness of these modules.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n-. The technical contribution is weak. The main components, including channel attention, spacial attention and the anchor free network, are not new. This proposed method is quite similar to SiamBAN, especially the multi-head fusion and the anchor free network.  Furthermore,  the cross channel attention is more like a cross-correlation between the search branch feature and the pooling template vector. In this case, are the 1D conv layer and the sigmoid function necessary?  \n\n-. The description of the method is not clear. In Figure 2, there is only one correlation map but in Sec. 3.3 the author sad it has N correlation maps from different layers of the backbone. Furthermore, the index \"i\" of these N layers is conflict with the position index \"point(i, j)\", which would lead to misunderstanding.\u00a0Also in Figure 2, the classification map's size is 25x25x1, but it is 25x25x2 in Sec. 3.3.\u00a0The description of spatial attention is not clear. We can find Max/AvgPool in the figure but find no description. So how is the spatial attention used? The only word I can find is in related works \"CBAM (Woo et al.
