This field has recently seen a lot of publications proposing various methods to reduce the precision of weights and activations. These schemes have generally achieved close-to-SOTA accuracy for small networks on datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10. However, for larger networks (ResNET, Vgg, etc) on large dataset such as ImageNET, a significant accuracy drop are reported. In this work, the authors show that a careful implementation of mixed-precision dynamic fixed point computation can achieve SOTA on 4 large networks on the ImageNET-1K datasets. Using a INT16 (as opposed to FP16) has the advantage of enabling the use of new SIMD mul-acc instructions such as QVNNI16. \n\nThe reported accuracy numbers show convincingly that INT16 weights and activations can be used without loss of accuracy in large CNNs.

In this work, we train state-of-the-art visual understanding neural networks on the ImageNet-1K dataset, with Integer operations on General Purpose (GP) hardware. In particular, we focus on Integer Fused-Multiply-and-Accumulate (FMA) operations which take two pairs of INT16 operands and accumulate results into an INT32 output.We propose a shared exponent representation of tensors and develop a Dynamic Fixed Point (DFP) scheme suitable for common neural network operations. The nuances of developing an efficient integer convolution kernel is examined, including methods to handle overflow of the INT32 accumulator. We implement CNN training for ResNet-50, GoogLeNet-v1, VGG-16 and AlexNet; and these networks achieve or exceed SOTA accuracy within the same number of iterations as their FP32 counterparts without any change in hyper-parameters and with a 1.8X improvement in end-to-end training throughput. To the best of our knowledge these results represent the first INT16 training results on GP hardware for ImageNet-1K dataset using SOTA CNNs and achieve highest reported accuracy using half precision ", "pdf": "/pdf/a043e10804c2a592aef5366cfcaaf5478829f209.pdf", "TL;DR": "Mixed precision training pipeline using 16-bit integers on general purpose HW;  SOTA accuracy for ImageNet-class CNNs; Best reported accuracy for ImageNet-1K classification task with any reduced precision training;", "paperhash": "das|mixed_precision_training_of_convolutional_neural_networks_using_integer_operations", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\ndas2018mixed,\ntitle={Mixed Precision Training of Convolutional Neural Networks using Integer Operations},\nauthor={Dipankar Das and Naveen Mellempudi and Dheevatsa Mudigere and Dhiraj Kalamkar and Sasikanth Avancha and Kunal Banerjee and Srinivas Sridharan and Karthik Vaidyanathan and Bharat Kaul and Evangelos Georganas and Alexander Heinecke and Pradeep Dubey and Jesus Corbal and Nikita Shustrov and Roma Dubtsov and Evarist Fomenko and Vadim Pirogov},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=H135uzZ0-},\n}", "keywords": ["deep learning training", "reduced precision", "imagenet", "dynamic fixed point"], "authors": ["Dipankar Das", "Naveen Mellempudi", "Dheevatsa Mudigere", "Dhiraj Kalamkar", "Sasikanth Avancha", "Kunal Banerjee", "Srinivas Sridharan", "Karthik Vaidyanathan", "Bharat Kaul", "Evangelos Georganas", "Alexander Heinecke", "Pradeep Dubey", "Jesus Corbal", "Nikita Shustrov", "Roma Dubtsov", "Evarist Fomenko", "Vadim Pirogov"], "authorids": ["dipankar.das@intel.com", "naveen.k.mellempudi@intel.com", "dheevatsa.mudigere@intel.com", "dhiraj.d.kalamkar@intel.com", "sasikanth.avancha@intel.com", "kunal.banerjee@intel.com", "srinivas.sridharan@intel.com", "karthikeyan.vaidyanathan@intel.com", "bharat.kaul@intel.com", "evangelos.georganas@intel.com", "alexander.heinecke@intel.com", "pradeep.dubey@intel.com", "jesus.corbal@intel.com", "nikita.a.shustrov@intel.com", "roman.s.dubtsov@intel.com", "evarist.m.fomenko@intel.com", "vadim.o.pirogov@intel.com"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "duedate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "tmdate": 1516825726377, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper873/Official_Comment", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"replyto": null, "forum": "H135uzZ0-", "writers": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper873/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper873/Authors|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper873/Area_Chair|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper873/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper873/Authors|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper873/Area_Chair|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "value-dropdown": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper873/Authors_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper873/Reviewers_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper873/Area_Chairs_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 0, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper873/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper873/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper873/Area_Chair", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "cdate": 1516825726377}}}, {"tddate": null, "ddate": null, "tmdate": 1512819850708, "tcdate": 1512819850708, "number": 1, "cdate": 1512819850708, "id": "S1mqhBFWM", "invitation": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper873/Official_Comment", "forum": "H135uzZ0-", "replyto": "r1vIV-R1z", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper873/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper873/Authors"], "content": {"title": "Performance Discussion", "comment": "Thanks a lot for your comments. \n\nWe do indeed have a Proof of Concept implementation for ResNet-50 on KNM 72c, 1.5GHz part with 16GB MCDRAM. \nOn this part a FP32 implementation using MKLDNN on Intel Caffe achieves 152 img/s while our POC (also using Intel Caffe + MKLDNN interface (but not MKLDNN code)) achieved 275 img/s while achieving SOTA. This is a ~1.8x speedup over FP32. We also believe that there is scope for further improvements. If the PC/Reviewers permit we can add these results to the paper. \n\nAlso the results in the paper are obtained using QVNNI-16 kernels on a 32 node KNM cluster as mentioned in Section 5. \n\nWe do admit that the performance and overflow related discussion has room for improvement. Specifically the statement you point out pertains to the fact that we can always have the following sequence of instructions: QVNNI-16, cvtepi32ps (convert INT32 to FP32), fmaddps (scale and accumulate FP32 results) which will almost never overflow. Unfortunately the above mentioned sequence is ~3x slower than pure QVNNI-16 (as it has 3x more instructions). Therefore we select a compromise point between number of sufficient number of QVNNI-16 instructions followed by the convert and accumulate sequence, which optimizes performance without compromising numerics.\n\nI hope this clarifies things a little more. We will rewrite this Section 4.3 to clarify more. \n\nAgain as per the breakup of performance lost per component of the mixed precision training methodology, if the reviewers/PC permits we can provide more details in the paper. \n\nWe will update the submission shortly for a bunch of typographical and grammar issues we have identified at our end, and other edits discussed here. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Mixed Precision Training of Convolutional Neural Networks using Integer Operations", "abstract": "The state-of-the-art (SOTA) for mixed precision training is dominated by variants of low precision floating point operations, and in particular, FP16 accumulating into FP32 Micikevicius et al.
