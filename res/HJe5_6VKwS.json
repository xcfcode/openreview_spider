With regard to the novelty of our paper, please see our general comment above. Below, we would like to address some of the further points highlighted in your review: \n\n\"From a conceptual perspective, the impact of detecting specific adversarial attacks is not clear. In a realistic setting, an adversary could use a very different attack or even utilize a different set of transformations (e.g. image rotations). Thus, in order to demonstrate the utility of their method in a black-box scenario, the authors would need to evaluate the defense in a variety of different scenarios.\" and \"Secondly, after adversarial training, only the robustness against the same attack is considered. In order to argue about white-box robustness, the authors would need to evaluate against a variety of diverse adversaries.\" \n\nWe appreciate that ideally a defense would be suitable against all scenarios, however, in practice, it is difficult to consider all possible transformations and attacks. Recent research has focused on particular black-box and white-box attacks [e.g. Dhillon 2018; Liao 2018]. We follow the general recommendations of Carlini et al. [2017] in our evaluation protocol. \n\n\"At the very least, they should consider generalization to difference attacks (e.g., train against FGSM and BIM, and test against DF).\" \n\nThank you for this feedback- we have evaluated the performance of our defense across different attacks and found that it generalizes well. We have added these results to section 4.2 (and the values can be found in Appendix G). \n\n\"There is little reason to expect that a composition of two neural networks (the saliency map methods and the classifier) would be non-trivially robust.\"  \n\nIn our salient pixel technique, we compute the dot-product of the image and the saliency map. If we target the defense via a gradient-based approach, it is not directly clear how the perturbation translates to the original image. From this perspective, it can improve robustness. We would be curious to hear your further thoughts on this topic. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper642/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper642/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Model-based Saliency for the Detection of Adversarial Examples", "authors": ["Lisa Schut", "Yarin Gal"], "authorids": ["lisaschut94@gmail.com", "yarin.gal@cs.ox.ac.uk"], "keywords": ["Adversarial Examples", "Defense", "Model-based Saliency"], "TL;DR": "We show that gradients are unable to capture shifts in saliency due to adversarial perturbations and present an alternative adversarial defense using learnt saliency models that is effective against both black-box and white-box attacks.", "abstract": "Adversarial perturbations cause a shift in the salient features of an image, which may result in a misclassification.

With regard to the novelty of our paper, please see our general comment above. Below, we address your specific questions: \n\n\"For SMD (Saliency Map Defense), what is the reason that the input image is not used together? computational issue? performance degradation? \"\n\nWe wanted to test whether the saliency mask itself is sufficient to detect adversarial attacks. As such, its performance can be seen as a ``sanity check\" to verify that our saliency technique (adapted from Dabkowski & Gal [2017]) is able to capture shifts in attention due to adversarial perturbations.\n\n\"Is it possible to train a single detector that can handle all different adversarial attacks?\"\n\nOn the attacks we evaluated, yes. Appendix E shows the results of a single classifier trained on a different type of attacks.  Further (these are new results from experiments run based on your feedback),  in Appendix G (and presented in Section 4.2), we show that SPD is successful at detecting CW and DF, even when trained on weaker attacks. \n\n\"Would the distance between saliency maps from different attacks be small? How does the saliency map change under different attacks?\"\n\n  Thanks for this interesting question -- we've added results to Appendix E, which provide these distances. The saliency maps do vary across different attacks. In general, they seem to be similar to the distance between the saliency map of an adversarial image and natural image.\n\n\"Have you tried any other powerful saliency maps other than Dabkowski & Gal (2017)?\"\n\nOur main goal was to show that (1) using salient pixels as a defense is effective and (2) one should still exhibit caution when using other saliency techniques -- a straightforward approach using gradients is unable to capture perturbations (this was shown qualitatively in parallel work by Gu & Tresp [2019], but we verify it via experiments). Other techniques are also able to capture the shifts. The two main candidates are those highlighted by Fong and Vedaldi [2017] and Gu & Tresp [2019]. We did not choose the former due to the high computational costs required to compute the kernel for every pixel at every step.

As requested by reviewers 1 and 2, we have run additional experiments, where we assess the performance of the model trained on a specific adversarial attack to see how well it detects other adversarial attacks. The additional results can be found in Section 4.2 on page 7 (and in Appendix G). \n\nFurther, we have reworded the abstract to better highlight our contributions, and would like to clarify how our work fits into the literature and the novel aspects of our work:\n\n- We show that the previously suggested realtime saliency-based defense (Zhang 2018) is not effective -- it does not improve on a simple baseline which uses the same model but with the saliency map removed. We show that this can be attributed to the weak gradient-based saliency technique used in (Zhang 2018), and propose an effective fix using a realtime model-based saliency technique.\n\n- We introduce a new realtime defense: the salient pixel defense, which is able to successfully detect a large range of adversarial attacks. This defense performs better than using the saliency maps themselves even when model-based saliency is used. \n\n- Fong and Vedaldi (2017) show that their saliency method is able to detect adversarial perturbations. However, the method is not suited for practice, due to the high computational costs associated with computing the kernel at every iteration for every pixel. Further, we provide a systematic analysis against a variety of adversarial attacks, including more difficult attacks such as Carlini & Wagner attack, as opposed to only BIM (as suggested by Carlini et al. [2017]). As shown by Carlini et al. [2017], most defenses break against the C & W attack whereas our method is effective.\n\n- Parallel work to ours [Gu & Tresp, 2019] showed that their technique can capture a shift in saliency due to adversarial perturbations qualitatively, but do not provide any quantitative experiments.

In both cases, the saliency map is combined with the image for training a CNN by way of an element-wise product.\nOverall, this presents a relatively simplistic way of deriving representations of saliency and combining these with inputs for training that builds robustness against white and black box attacks.

The authors propose using the method of Dabkowski and Gal (2017) to generate saliency maps and then train a classifier on these maps (or their dot product with the input image) to distinguish natural from adversarial examples. They perform experiments evaluating the white-box and black-box robustness of their detection scheme.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the contribution of the paper is rather incremental. The detection of adversarial examples by training a classifier on saliency maps has already been studied in prior work. The only modification proposed in this work is using an (existing) alternative method for producing the saliency maps and utilizing the dot product of maps with images.\n\nFrom a conceptual perspective, the impact of detecting specific adversarial attacks is not clear. In a realistic setting, an adversary could use a very different attack or even utilize a different set of transformations (e.g. image rotations). Thus, in order to demonstrate the utility of their method in a black-box scenario, the authors would need to evaluate the defense in a variety of different scenarios. At the very least, they should consider generalization to difference attacks (e.g., train against FGSM and BIM, and test against DF).\n\nMoreover, the robustness against white-box adversaries is not sufficiently studied. Firstly, the robustness of the non-adversarially trained detector is suspiciously high. There is little reason to expect that a composition of two neural networks (the saliency map methods and the classifier) would be non-trivially robust. The authors should consider alternative attacks perhaps using more iterations with a smaller step size. Secondly, after adversarial training, only the robustness against the same attack is considered. In order to argue about white-box robustness, the authors would need to evaluate against a variety of diverse adversaries.\n\nOverall, the technical and conceptual contribution of this paper is insufficient for publication at ICLR, even ignoring the concerns about its experimental evaluation."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper642/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper642/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Model-based Saliency for the Detection of Adversarial Examples", "authors": ["Lisa Schut", "Yarin Gal"], "authorids": ["lisaschut94@gmail.com", "yarin.gal@cs.ox.ac.uk"], "keywords": ["Adversarial Examples", "Defense", "Model-based Saliency"], "TL;DR": "We show that gradients are unable to capture shifts in saliency due to adversarial perturbations and present an alternative adversarial defense using learnt saliency models that is effective against both black-box and white-box attacks.", "abstract": "Adversarial perturbations cause a shift in the salient features of an image, which may result in a misclassification.

The method is motivated by the well-known fact that saliency maps and adversarial perturbations are having similar mathematical formulations and derivations.

As far as the authors mentioned, the proposed method is simply using different techniques to derive saliency maps compared to the previous methods.\n\nOverall, the intuition and motivation of this paper are from the previous works and the main contribution is to use another (powerful) saliency map extractor for learning an adversarial detector.
