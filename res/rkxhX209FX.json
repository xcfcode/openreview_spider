We have made several changes to the paper as we have described in our official comment. Our response is based on this new version.\n\nModel-Ensemble Trust-Region Policy Optimization (ME-TRPO):\nThis paper presents a Model Based RL method to solve any given RL task, with the highlight being that it uses an ensemble of DNNs to successfully train dynamics models for Model Based RL. The contributions of ME-TRPO do not include learning policies robust to changes in the *environment*, and it is therefore not for the same purpose as EPOpt. There is an element of dealing with model uncertainty that is shared with EPOpt, but this comes not from the environment itself but rather due to learning dynamics from finite samples. Therefore, we don\u2019t believe a comparison with ME-TRPO is warranted. Nevertheless, we have mentioned these connections along with Ensemble CIO, a similar work.\n\nModel-Agnostic Meta-Learning:\nWe wish to learn a robust policy that works \u201dout of the box\u201d on a given test environment. This method on the other hand involves an adaptation phase for meta-learning for each new test task, which is not the paradigm we want. It is therefore not pertinent in the discussion on connections to Multi-Task Learning.\n\n\nActive learning vs. Explore/Exploit, Finding bottom epsilon percentile region:\nActive learning is concerned with improving and speeding up learning by making use of the ability to choose the data to learn from. The learning task in question is to perform regression from the space of env. model parameters to the performance of the policy, and it is possible to query the performance (noisily) at arbitrary parameters. The role of the active learner in our framework then boils down to (judiciously) using this ability to obtain a good fit while reducing uncertainty across its input space. So, while this involves an element of balancing exploration and exploitation, achieving an optimal trade-off is in no way the aim of the active learner.\n\nEven our use of the bandit in conjunction with EPOpt is to learn about the performance across the space of parameters (which amounts to getting a reliable estimate for the weights for its input features), and *not* for identifying the point leading to the worst performance. Although, for simplicity, we have not used active learning oriented formulations like (Soare et al. (2013)), our Thompson Sampling implementation still has good guarantees on learning accurate weights (see (Abeille & Lazaric (2017) on which it is based). With the added expressiveness of polynomial input transformations, we expect it to be able to identify accurately the bottom epsilon percentile region. Also, for the purpose of using the fit to sample from that region, it doesn\u2019t matter if the fit is not very accurate in other regions.\n\nNow, it is entirely possible that the performance profile is too complex to fit accurately. However, as we have shown by successfully learning robust policies on even a 2-D model ensemble, this is not a problem in practice. Furthermore, even EPOpt will require too much data to correctly identify the required region given a sufficiently complex profile, and will still not be completely reliable.\n\n\nEfficiency gains:\nThe statement in Section 4 calculates as an illustrative example the reduction in data requirement from EPOpt under a particular value of trajectory allowances for each method. Nowhere do we say that it is possible to always achieve this much reduction. The experiments then go on to perform these calculations for the situations we have actually tested and establish the level of efficiency gain that we can successfully achieve. Thus, we do not see how our statements are loose in any sense. On the point of theoretical analysis, please see our answer to AnonReviewer3.\n\n\nFramework development:\nThere is an overarching idea behind our framework, and it is that the performance has dependencies on the parameters, and this can be used to inform decisions on which parameters to train on. We have justified that active learning is the tool to use for this purpose, and also the way it is used. Although we have not studied new objectives (which we also think does not contribute towards our objectives), we have still provided a concrete realization of the framework using an existing one (CVaR) which leads to a sensible algorithm. All these make \u201cnot principled\u201d an unjust criticism.\n\n\nExperiments:\nOur experiments successfully establish the robustness and performance of the learned policies and validate the reduction in data usage. Further, we show evidence that the bandit active learner indeed works as it should and plays its part correctly. Quite clearly, this array of experiments is not preliminary."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1398/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1398/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1398/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "An Active Learning Framework for Efficient Robust Policy Search", "abstract": "Robust Policy Search is the problem of learning policies that do not degrade in performance when subject to unseen environment model parameters.

We have made several changes to the paper as we have described in our official comment. Our response is based on this new version.\n\n> The biggest concern is that this paper tackles this problem with a combination with existing techniques, leaving many questions unanswered.\n\nWe request elaboration on what questions are unanswered, and why combining existing techniques is particularly a problem.\n\n> more theoretical-grounded perspective would make the paper much stronger.\n\nProviding theoretical grounding for the effectiveness of our framework in general would be as difficult as doing so for Active Learning itself, that is quantifying how efficiently the Active learner can learn about the output (policy performance) across its input space (the space of model parameters). There hasn\u2019t been a lot of work on providing performance bounds for Active Learning in general (ref. the survey by Settles, 2010). There is however a good amount of analysis that has gone into the specific case we have implemented, namely Linear Bandits with Thompson Sampling. Pl. see (Abeille & Lazaric (2017)) which we have cited for bounds on the deviation of the bandit\u2019s learned weights from their true values.\n\n> As the Thompson sampling algorithm of LSB draw samples from the distribution of MDP parameters that leads to the wost performance, why not directly use it for policy search?\n\nIn EffAcTS-EPOpt, the idea is to use the LSB to come up with an approximate sample from the bottom epsilon percentile of parameters according to the source distribution (for the CVaR objective). However, the trajectories generated while the LSB is learning cannot be used for this for two reasons: first, it would have chosen a number of parameters from outside the required region while exploring, and second, it moves towards the absolute worst performance (and so is biased towards that value, even though it learns well about the entire parameter space). That is why we have to have an additional stage of sampling using the performance function fit by the LSB. We illustrate this in Appendix A2 that we have added.\n\n> However, the uncertainty of prediction is not used by the proposed algorithm.\n\nThe approach we have taken in our implementation of the framework is to assign the task of uncertainty reduction to the active learner itself (here the LSB), and assume that the learned return profile has low enough uncertainty that we can use it directly for the subsequent steps. We concur that this is a very valid point and that it might be necessary to employ methods that use the uncertainty of predictions to improve the quality of model parameter selection in situations such as very high dimensional model ensembles.\n\n> The proposed method will not outperform if the number of trajectories used for updating policy is the same, as the surrogate model can never be as good as the real model. It would be nice to explicitly demonstrate the runtime and performance trade-off.\n\nA point to be noted is that even EPOpt does not have the true performance profile and also performs approximate sampling from the bottom epsilon percentile (i.e it is also not guaranteed to produce samples from that region alone). Therefore there is no reason to say that this method will not outperform EPOpt, and as we have shown, the performance of EffAcTS-EPOpt is very close to or better than EPOpt. It samples far fewer trajectories to attain this, and so quite clearly wins in the run-time performance tradeoff.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1398/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1398/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1398/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "An Active Learning Framework for Efficient Robust Policy Search", "abstract": "Robust Policy Search is the problem of learning policies that do not degrade in performance when subject to unseen environment model parameters.

", "review": "This paper targets at a particular type of robust policy search, where a simulation environment exists with explicit tuning parameters, which is referred to as the model parameters of a Markov decision process. The task of robust policy search is to learn a policy robust to all the parameters of the simulator, so that it can potentially give robust performance in real environment. The previous work handles this problem by sampling many trajectories and only learning from the trajectories, in which the current policy produces the worst performance. This approach effectively focus the policy search on the worst case performance, but is highly inefficient as most of the sampled trajectories are discarded. This paper proposes to improve the sampling efficiency by building a surrogate model predicting the return of the current policy given a MDP parameter. The surrogate model is used to select the MDP parameters leading to the worsts performance, so that the policy search can directly sample and learn from the selected MDP parameters without discarding any trajectories.\n\nThis paper tries to tackle the sampling efficiency of RL with building a probabilistic surrogate model. This is a promising direction. The biggest concern is that this paper tackles this problem with a combination with existing techniques, leaving many questions unanswered. Presenting the paper in a more theoretical-grounded perspective would make the paper much stronger.\n\nThis paper uses a linear stochastic bandits (LSB) method to build a surrogate model of the return of the current policy and fits the surrogate model into the EPOpt framework by sampling from the worst performing parameters according to the surrogate model. As the Thompson sampling algorithm of LSB draw samples from the distribution of MDP parameters that leads to the wost performance, why not directly use it for policy search?\n\nThe surrogate model is expected not to give accurate prediction everywhere due to the limited number of data but produces uncertainty of its prediction as an dictator. However, the uncertainty of prediction is not used by the proposed algorithm.\n\nThe presentation of the experiment section needs to be improved. The performance of the baseline needs to be explicitly presented, otherwise it is hard to compare. The proposed method will not outperform if the number of trajectories used for updating policy is the same, as the surrogate model can never be as good as the real model. It would be nice to explicitly demonstrate the runtime and performance trade-off.\n\nMinor issues:\n1. What does TRPO stand for?\n2.

This integration is built on an existing framework, EPOpt, which each time samples a set of models and a set of trajectories for each model. Only trajectories with the bottom \\epsilon percentile returns will be used to update the multi-task policy. This paper proposes a way to improve the sample-efficiency so that fewer trajectories will be sampled and fewer trajectories will be loss. \n\nIn general, the paper presentation is easy to follow. The idea is well motivated of why an active learning integration is needed. The related work is a bit too narrow, e.g. work [1] on the same approach like EPOpt or meta-learning (for model adaptation) [2] (and others more on this topic)\n\n[1] T. Kurutach, I. Clavera, Y.

Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks. In ICML, 2017.\n\nIn overall, I have major concerns regarding to the proposed framework.\n- Active learning is a method that is in general known to be an optimal trade-off between exploration vs. exploitation in finding a global optimal solution. That means, the proposed use of linear stochastic bandits is trying to find an optimal arm \\theta^* (the worst trajectory) that gives the highest reward (the lowest return). In my opinion, integrating this idea naively into EPOpt to sample a set of trajectories would only aim to find the worst trajectory among all trajectories from all models. This is clearly not enough to say \"finding ALL the WORSE regions among trajectory space\" to improve the policy. Therefore, a new way of integration or a new objective should be used in order to make a principled framework. \n\n- The statement over sample-efficiency gain vs. EPOpt in Section 4 is too loose which is not based on any detailed analysis or further theoretical results.\n\n- The experiment results are not well presented: there is no results for EPOpt in Fig. 1; \n\n\nMinor comments:\n\n- Algorithm 1: argument of GetTrajectory (in LEARN) should be \\theta_i, instead of \\pi_\\theta_i?.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed framework is not yet principled. Experiment results are too preliminary and not well presented.

We also present a Multi-Task Learning perspective to the problem of Robust Policy Search, and draw connections from our proposed framework to existing work on Multi-Task Learning.", "keywords": ["Deep Reinforcement Learning"], "authorids": ["saikirann94@gmail.com", "nandan@iitm.ac.in", "ravi@cse.iitm.ac.in"], "authors": ["Sai Kiran Narayanaswami", "Nandan Sudarsanam", "Balaraman Ravindran"], "TL;DR": "An Active Learning framework that leads to efficient robust RL and opens up possibilities in Multi-Task RL", "pdf": "/pdf/cb006bc4b32d26f907b94d3925ebf95e3d795dd4.pdf", "paperhash": "narayanaswami|an_active_learning_framework_for_efficient_robust_policy_search", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nnarayanaswami2019an,\ntitle={An Active Learning Framework for Efficient Robust Policy Search},\nauthor={Sai Kiran Narayanaswami and Nandan Sudarsanam and Balaraman Ravindran},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkxhX209FX},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1398/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234238256, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "rkxhX209FX", "replyto": "rkxhX209FX", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1398/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335938365, "tmdate": 1552335938365, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1398/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 9}
