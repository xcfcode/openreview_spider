The authors show that this enables training neural networks that are guaranteed to satisfy non-trivial constraints on the neurons in a manner that is significantly more scalable than prior work, and demonstrate this experimentally on a generative modelling task.\n\nThe problem considered in the paper is certainly significant (training neural networks that are guaranteed to satisfy constraints arises in many applications) and the authors make some interesting contributions. However, the reviewers found the following issues that make it difficult to accept the paper in its present form:\n1) The setting of homogeneous linear equality constraints is not well-motivated and the significance of being able to impose such constraints is not clearly articulated in the paper. The authors would do well to prepare a future revision documenting use-cases motivated by practical applications and add these to the paper.\n2) The experimental evaluation is not sufficiently thorough: the authors evaluate their method on an artificial constraint involving a \"checkerboard pattern\" on MNIST. Even in this case, the training method proposed by the authors seems to suffer from some issues, and more thorough experiments need to be conducted to confirm that the training method can perform well across a variety of datasets and constraints.\n\nGiven these issues, I recommend rejection. However, I encourage the authors to revise their work on this important topic and prepare a future version including practical examples of the constraints and experiments on a variety of prediction tasks.\n\n", "title": "Paper Decision"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "We propose a method to impose homogeneous linear inequality constraints of the form $Ax\\leq 0$ on neural network activations.

The only mentions are binarization of the predictions (which softmax already does), and monotonicity/convexity of neurons, with no proposed benefits. The running example of the paper is the chessboard constraint, which is either pointless (fig1) or harmful (fig5).

The neural network is trained so as to satisfy the constraint represented by rays. However, I do not understand how to train the neural network to satisfy the constraint represented by rays, which is actually the core of the algorithm.

The method is implemented at initialization (by converting the H-representation to the V-representation) and during training (by modifying the network architecture). Experiments on two setups (projection and VAE+projection on a checkerboard pattern on MNIST) demonstrate a 2-orders of magnitude speed-up with respect to test-time projection (computed with OSQP).\n\nThe contributions claimed are:\n* Novel technique to impose inequality constraints on neural network activations.\n* Significant speed-up w.r.t. other techniques (at test time).\n\nOverall, the approach is well motivated, and well-placed in the literature. However, the experimental analysis does not support all the claims made by the authors as it focuses on a single dataset (i.e., MNIST) and single constraint (i.e., checkerboard pattern). Additionally, while the authors argue that there is no manual trade-off between constraint satisfaction and data representation, the experiment in Fig. 3 appears to show that there is some manual trade-off (using box delay). As such, I am currently inclined to give a \"weak reject\" score.\n\nThe method is clear and the idea of using softmax to get a convex combination of the vertices of the V-representation to guarantee constraint satisfaction is reasonable.\n\n1) The softmax used to satisfy the constraints is preceded by a batch normalization layer. I would expect batch normalization to interfere with the ability to saturate the softmax activation and thus prevent the network from reaching optimality. Could the authors provide experiments that justify the use of the batch normalization layer?\n\n2) An important factor that is unexplored in this manuscript is the softmax temperature. A good scheduling of that temperature could help the optimization. Have authors tried different temperature values?\n\n3) The use of softmax and the integration of the constraints as a network layer seem to create some difficulty during training (even with the rather simple checkerboard pattern used in the experiment). The loss appears to reach some plateau (9% from optimal) and, thus, there appears to be some trade-off between reconstruction and projection. The authors should provide more experiments to explain that trade-off. That trade-off is also visible on Fig. 5 (the zero has a significantly different shape).\n\n4) The method is solely compared to test time projection. Could the authors implement other techniques (if feasible)? e.g., OptNet. Overall, it would helpful to add more setups and different types of constraints (other than a last-layer projection; e.g., monotonicity)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper370/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper370/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "We propose a method to impose homogeneous linear inequality constraints of the form $Ax\\leq 0$ on neural network activations.
