Via the multi-objective optimization of Python code, we synthesize new sampling-based path planners that allow robots to adapt to new tasks and environments involving sequential decision-making.  In addition to the ability  to  adapt  to  new  environments,  our  approach  also  enables  robots  to  balance their computational needs with improvements in task performance. We show that new computer programs can be generated which represent diverse variants of RRT* optimized to StarCraft maps.", "pdf": "/pdf/37335224565f9d73ecd94d7fd402a4490d0a0114.pdf", "proposed_reviewers": "", "paperhash": "anonymous|metalearning_for_planning_automatic_synthesis_of_sample_based_planners", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021metalearning,\ntitle={Meta-Learning for Planning: Automatic Synthesis of Sample Based Planners},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to Learning to Learn - Workshop at ICLR 2021},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=IRuzOyEMSlQ},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "proposed_reviewers": {"value-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615595596483, "tmdate": 1615844205826, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
