It additionally proposes a mechanism for learning from human-provided \"key states\".\n\nThe ideas in this paper are quite nice, but the paper has significant issues with regard to clarity and applicability to real-world problems:\nFirst, it is unclear is the proposed method requires access only high-dimensional observations (e.g. images) during training or if it additionally requires low-dimensional states (e.g. sufficient information to reset the environment). In most compelling problems settings where a low-dimensional representation that sufficiently explains the current state of the world is available during training, then it is also likely that one can write down a nicely shaped reward function using that state information during training, in which case, it makes sense to use such a reward function. This paper seems to require access to low-dimensional states, and specifically considers the sparse-reward setting, which seems contrived.\nSecond, the paper states that the assumption \"when resetting, the agent can be reset to any state\" can be satisfied in problems such as real-world robotic manipulation. This is not correct. If the robot could autonomously reset to any state, then we would have largely solved robotic manipulation. Further, it is not always realistic to assume access to low-dimensional state information during training on a real robotic system (e.g. knowing the poses of all of the objects in the world).\nThird, the experiments section lacks crucial information needed to understand the experiments. What is the state, observation, and action space for each problem setting? What is the reward function for each problem setting? What reinforcement learning algorithm is used in combination with the curriculum and tendency rewards? Are the states and actions continuous or discrete? Without this information, it is difficult to judge the merit of the experimental setting.\nFourth, the proposed method seems to lack motivation, making the proposed scheme seem a bit ad hoc. Could each of the components be motivated further through more discussion and/or ablative studies?\nFinally, the main text of the paper is substantially longer than the recommended page limit. It should be shortened by making the writing more concise.\n\nBeyond my feedback on clarity and significance, here are further pieces of feedback with regard to the technical content, experiments, and related work:\nI'm wondering -- can the reward shaping in Equation 2 be made to satisfy the property of not affecting the final policy? (see Ng et al. '09) If so, such a reward shaping would make the method even more appealing.\nHow do the experiments in section 5.4 compare to prior methods and ablations? Without such a comparison, it is impossible to judge the performance of the proposed method and the level of difficulty of these tasks. At the very least, the paper should compare the performance of the proposed method to the performance a random policy.\n\nThe paper is missing some highly relevant references. First, how does the proposed method compare to hindsight experience replay? [1] Second, learning from keyframes (rather than demonstrations) has been explored in the past [1]. It would be preferable to use the standard terminology of \"keyframe\".\n\n[1] Andrychowicz et al. Hindsight Experience Replay. 2017\n[2] Akgun et al. Keyframe-based Learning from Demonstration. 2012\n\nIn summary, I think this paper has a number of promising ideas and experimental results, but given the significant issues in clarity and significance to real world problems, I don't think that the current version of this paper is suitable for publication in ICLR.\n\nMore minor feedback on clarity and correctness:\n- Abstract: \"Deep RL algorithms have proven successful in a vast variety of domains\" -- This is an overstatement.\n- The introduction should be more clear with regard to the assumptions. In particular, it would be helpful to see discussion of requiring human-provided keyframes. As is, it is unclear what is meant by \"checkpoint scheme\", which is not commonly used terminology.\n- \"This kind of spare reward, goal-oriented tasks are considered the most difficult challenges\" -- This is also an overstatement. Long-horizon tasks and high-dimensional observations are also very difficult. Also, the sentence is not grammatically correct.\n- \"That is, environment\" -> \"That is, the environment\"\n- In the last paragraph of the intro, it would be helpful to more clearly state what the experiments can accomplish. Can they handle raw pixel inputs?\n- \"diverse domains\" -> \"diverse simulated domains\"\n- \"a robotic grasping task\" -> \"a simulated robotic grasping task\"\n- There are a number of issues and errors in citations, e.g. missing the year, including the first name, incorrect reference\n- Assumption 1: \\mathcal{P} has not yet been defined.\n- The last two paragraphs of section 3.2 are very difficult to understand without reading the method yet\n- \"conventional RL solver tend\" -> \"conventional RL tend\", also should mention sparse reward in this sentence.\n- Algorithm 1 and Figure 1 are not referenced in the text anywhere, and should be\n- The text in Figure 1 and Figure 3 is extremely small\n- The text in Figure 3 is extremely small\n\n\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "TRL: Discriminative Hints for Scalable Reverse Curriculum Learning", "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning algorithms have proven successful in a variety of domains.

This covers a number of important cases of interest, including all simulated domains, and a number of robotics applications. The training proceeds in phases, where in each phase the initial starting set of states is expanded. The initial set of states used is close to the desired state goal. Each phase is initiated when 80% of the states in the current phase can reach the goal. Once the initial set of start states overlaps with the desired initial set of states for the task, training can terminate. During the training in a single phase, the algorithm uses a shaping reward (the tendency) which is based on a binary classifier that predicts if it will be possible to reach the goal from this state. This reward is combined in a hybrid reward signal. The authors suggest the use of a small number of checkpoints to guide the backwards state expansion to improve the search efficiency. Results are presented on several domains: maze, Super Mario, and Mujoco domains. \n\nThe topic of doing more sample efficient training is important and interesting, and the subset of settings the authors consider is still a good set. \n\nThe paper was clearly written though some details were relegated to the appendix which would\u2019ve been useful to see in the main text.\n\nI\u2019m not yet convinced about this method for the desired setting in terms of significance and quality.\n\nAn alternative to using tendency shaping reward would be (during phase expansion) make the new \u201cgoal\u201d states any of the states in the previous phase of initial states P_{i} that did reach the goal. This should greatly reduce the decision making horizon needed in each  phase. Since the domain is deterministic, as soon as one can reach one of those states, we have a path to the goal. If we care about the number of steps to reach the goal (vs finding any path), then each of the states in P_{i} for which a successful path can be achieved to the goal can also be labeled by the cost / number of time steps to reach the goal. This should decompose the problem into a series of smaller problems. Perhaps I\u2019m missing something-- could the authors please address this suggestion and/or explain why this wouldn\u2019t be beneficial?\n\nThe authors currently use checkpoints to help guide the search towards the true task desired set of initial states. If those are lacking, it seems like the generation of the new P_{i+1} could be biased towards that desired set of states. One approach could be to randomly roll out from the start state and then bias P_{i+1} towards any states close to states along such trajectories. In general one could imagine a situation in which one both does forward learning/planning from the task start state and backwards learning from the goal state to obtain a significant benefit, similar to ideas that have been used in robot motion planning.\n\nWhy learn from pixels for the robot domains considered? Here it would be nice to compare to some robotics approaches. With the action space of the robot and motion planning, it seems like this problem could be tackled using existing techniques. It is interesting to have a method that can be used with pixels, but in cases where there are other approaches, it would be useful to compare to them.\n\nSmall point\nD.2 Why not compare to GAIL instead? \n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "TRL: Discriminative Hints for Scalable Reverse Curriculum Learning", "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning algorithms have proven successful in a variety of domains.

But in practice, *full* low-dimensional state information is not easy to acquire (i.e. positions of free moving objects) and if you assume access to it during some parts of training, then you might as well use it for all parts of training.

Actually,\u00a0this alternative has been carefully considered,\u00a0and we decided not to use it mainly because this method largely impairs the agent's ability to find new policies. We tested this idea with an experiment setup similar to the one in Appendix E.3\u00a0(Fig 10),\u00a0and found that if we change the goal state to any of the successful states from the previous phase,\u00a0the agent is highly likely to lose the capability of finding a new shortcut\u00a0(the fifth graph in Fig 10). The reason is that TRL's reward function is hybrid\u00a0(tendency + final goal),\u00a0where\u00a0the final goal reward is meant to guarantee the agent's motivation for finding new policies. That\u2019s why keeping the final goal state constant in training of each phase makes sense.\n\n2-Thanks for your suggestion. Based on some experiments on this idea,\u00a0we find that\u00a0in small state space tasks\u00a0(e.g. the Maze)\u00a0this approach can lead to similar performance compared to keyframe scheme (\"checkpoint\" is renamed \"keyframe\"),\u00a0but it might be impractical in large state space multistage tasks such as\u00a0\u201cPick and Place\u201d. Since the shaping of tendency reward hasn\u2019t\u00a0covered the area close to the start state,\u00a0exploration beginning from the start state might be biased as well,\u00a0and the complexity of generating P_{i+1} can be very high. As a matter of fact,\u00a0several keyframes can already solve this problem well in these domains.\n\n3-We learn from raw pixel perceptions based on the assessment that it is a more general form of environment information and contains more details of the environment than low-dimensional data. Classic approaches,\u00a0due to hand-designed detectors and grasp policies,\u00a0cannot be easily generalized to new objects or\u00a0varying background scenes. Additionally,\u00a0images are less expensive to acquire and are more practical than precise sensor information. Taking robotic grasping and picking as an example,\u00a0the location and shape of the object are hard to acquire and define\u00a0(we cannot mount sensors everywhere),\u00a0we will have to rely on perceptions\u00a0(image or video).\n\n4-TRL does NOT fall in the track of imitation learning. The optional keyframes are only used in large-scale experiments like grasping from perception,\u00a0not in simpler ones like Mario and Maze. By our design,\u00a0TRL works without any expert policies. The keyframe scheme only helps to shrink search space and does not influence the learned policy. Our experiments show that\u00a0the agent does not necessarily follow the keyframes\u00a0(Appendix E.3 Fig 10)."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "TRL: Discriminative Hints for Scalable Reverse Curriculum Learning", "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning algorithms have proven successful in a variety of domains.

For deterministic environments,\u00a0we found it not necessary since we can change the discriminator to the probability of success between 0-1 and TRL can then handle stochastic as well. We have revised the claim. For the sample-anywhere assumption,\u00a0in fact, we don\u2019t need to reach everywhere but only start states in the current phase which it has reached during the generation process. We can record those states through low dimensional data\u00a0(angles of joint etc)\u00a0easily. In games,\u00a0actually we find it\u2019s easier than robotics to reset to any state given access to the corresponding API from developers. Given that many game developers are interested in training AI agent automatically for their games,\u00a0such APIs are usually not hard to acquire.\n\n2-As is explained in the Introduction,\u00a0we have pointed out the reason why the method in Reverse Curriculum paper is lack of efficiency\u00a0(Close to the end of the 2nd paragraph). Then we show that with the help of tendency rewards,\u00a0our model can get rid of the unnecessary time-consuming reviewing process\u00a0where the agent switches start states between old and new ones to avoid forgetting old policies\u00a0(End of the 3rd & middle of the 4th paragraph).\u00a0To prove our idea,\u00a0we make a comparison in Experiment 5.1\u00a0(Fig 3),\u00a0which shows our advantage in efficiency compared to Reverse Curriculum algorithm. TRL\u2019s main advantage over reverse curriculum is that it no longer requires keeping all starting sets.\u00a0\n\n3-Thanks for mentioning the potential based reward shaping. However,\u00a0if we define the shaped reward as r = T(St\u2019)\u00a0- T(St),\u00a0although this approach can avoid repeated rewards,\u00a0it still suffer from the reward sparsity problem,\u00a0since T(St\u2019_positive)\u00a0- T(St_positive)\u00a0and T(St\u2019_negative)- T(St_negative)\u00a0remain 0 at most time and won\u2019t help the agent learn to tackle these tasks.\n\n4-Thanks! We have added this assumption. This assumption is also listed in\u00a0[Carlos et al 2017].\n\n5-This gamma is only used for weight balance for two rewards. We are sorry to use a confusing notation. Another notation\u00a0$\\lambda$\u00a0has been used to address the confusion.\n\n6-We explained in Experiment 5.3 that the reward function used in PBRS is well hand-engineered by us. We tried more than 10 different reward functions shaped from demonstration and keep adjusting them to let PBRS solve this task. In our experiments,\u00a0only 2 of all the reward functions we tried can let PBRS work, the others are not shown on the Fig 6. This approach costs much human elaboration and different maps in the Maze need different reward function. Moreover,\u00a0in most robotic domains where the reward function cannot be easily shaped by hands,\u00a0human elaboration will increase to an unpractical level. TRL is able to solve this problem with negligible human elaboration with merely several labeled keyframes (\"checkpoint\" is renamed \"keyframe\"). We also proved TRL\u2019s robustness to keyframes with different quality and scale in Appendix E.3 & E.4\u00a0(Fig 10,\u00a0Fig 11).

Actually,\u00a0we only assume that it can reset to a certain state in each phase where it has reached before. Thanks for mentioning the access to low-dimensional states. TRL does need these low-dimensional data to restore visited states during the generation of new phases and doesn\u2019t require these data for real training. During each generation process,\u00a0the newly sampled states will be stored in the form of low-dimensional states such as the angle of joints and velocity of motors. Since these low-dimensional data is easy to acquire and only used for resetting the agent,\u00a0we just summarized it as\u00a0\u201ca way of adding new states to the new phase\u201d. It seems that there is no need for special emphasize.\n\n2-As is mentioned in the last paragraph of Introduction:\u00a0\u201cThe major contribution of this work is that we present a reliable tendency reinforcement learning method that is capable of training agents to solve large state space tasks with only final reward.\u00a0\u201d\u00a0This is our reward setting and is just the definition of goal-oriented tasks. And the detail of experiments is also shown in Appendix C,\u00a0where we explain all of the settings. The RL used in all of our experiments is A3C and our action control is discrete.\n\n3-There are three components:\u00a0(a)\u00a0Phase administrator\u00a0(b)\u00a0Tendency reward\u00a0(c)\u00a0Keyframes (\"checkpoint\" is renamed \"keyframe\")\nWe ran rough ablation studies with three different settings of difficulties:\u00a0\n(i)\u00a0small state space with only final reward\u00a0(10*10 Maze with observation 10*10): None of the three components are needed since a traditional RL method can tackle it.\u00a0\n(ii)\u00a0medium state space with only final reward\u00a0(40*40 Maze with observation 9*9,\u00a0Mario Bros): We can solve it by only using\u00a0(b)\u00a0with around 53000 training steps(40*40 Maze). We can also accelerate learning by combine\u00a0(b)\u00a0and\u00a0(a),\u00a0which will take around 35000 training steps.\u00a0\n(iii)\u00a0large state space with only final reward\u00a0(100*100 Maze with observation 9*9,\u00a0robotic manipulation from perception(grasping,\u00a0pick and place)): We use\u00a0(a),\u00a0(b)and\u00a0(c)\u00a0to solve these problems. If we only use\u00a0(a)\u00a0and\u00a0(b),\u00a0the generation of each phase might be biased and will fail in multistage tasks. Then we include\u00a0(c)\u00a0and test the influence of keyframes with different quality and scale\u00a0(Appendix E.3 E.4 Fig 10 11). We do not find clear relationship between the number of keyframes and the efficiency of training,\u00a0but keyframes can indeed help TRL learn well\u00a0(33000 iterations in Grasping,\u00a099000 iterations in Conveyance challenge).\n\n4-We ran some tests based on\u00a0[Ng et al 1999]\u00a0and found that if we structure the tendency reward as potential based,\u00a0the efficiency will largely decrease. We tested it in 40*40 Maze with observation 9*9. Since the tendency reward then be defined as rT(St\u2019)\u00a0- T(St),\u00a0the hybrid reward is still very sparse and the agent takes more than 50000 iterations to complete 60% of the whole task\u00a0(our method takes around 35000 steps to complete the whole one).\n\n5-Goal-oriented tasks are among the most difficult challenges in RL and traditional methods\u00a0(e.g. TRPO,\u00a0AC,\u00a0PPO)\u00a0alone are not capable of tackling them. The most recent approach to tackle it is based on intrinsic motivation. We made an experiment comparing TRL with curiosity-driven RL in Appendix E.1.2\u00a0(Table 2)\u00a0and showed TRL\u2019s advantages. Other methods mainly focus on tackling this problem with demonstrations,\u00a0which we also compare TRL with in Experiment 5.3\u00a0(Fig 6).\u00a0The result shows that we only need a small number of keyframes to achieve better results compared to them without much human elaboration or well hand-engineered reward function.\n\n6-Thanks.

However, tasks with sparse rewards remain challenging when the state space is large. Goal-oriented tasks are among the most typical problems in this domain, where a reward can only be received when the final goal is accomplished. In this work, we propose a potential solution to such problems with the introduction of an experience-based tendency reward mechanism, which provides the agent with additional hints based on a discriminative learning on past experiences during an automated reverse curriculum. This mechanism not only provides dense additional learning signals on what states lead to success, but also allows the agent to retain only this tendency reward instead of the whole histories of experience during multi-phase curriculum learning.
