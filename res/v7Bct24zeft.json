Most of the work with the FC, however, depends on the way the connectivity is computed and further depends on the manual post-hoc analysis of the FC matrices. In this work, we propose a deep learning architecture (BrainGNN) that learns the connectivity structure while learning to classify subjects. It simultaneously trains a graphical neural network on this graph and learns to select a sparse subset of brain regions important to the prediction task. We demonstrate the model's state-of-the-art classification performance on a schizophrenia fMRI dataset and show how introspection leads to disorder-relevant findings. The graphs learned by the model exhibit strong class discrimination, and the identified sparse subset of relevant regions is consistent with the schizophrenia literature.", "pdf": "/pdf/39cde3d8b47c813ff010dd3ead4a07e8455fd83c.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|attend_to_connect_gnn_for_predicting_brain_functional_connectivity", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021attend,\ntitle={Attend to connect: {\\{}GNN{\\}} for predicting brain functional connectivity},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to ICLR 2021 Workshop on Geometrical and Topological Representation Learning},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=v7Bct24zeft},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615225929161, "tmdate": 1615967298665, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
