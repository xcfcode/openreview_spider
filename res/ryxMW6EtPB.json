May be in the algorithm, we will miss the best generator because we do not get the equilibrium.\n\n2) Our method may encounter the same problem as the traditional algorithm. It is a kind of Markov chain to train the Loss. And the essence of the algorithm is in fact to solve $\\sup_f \\inf_{g^*} V(f, g^*)$ and $\\inf_g \\sup_{f^*}V(f^*, g)$.

It should be better motivated why one should use the duality gap as an upper bound for the \"F-distance\". Minimizing the F-distance as is usually done seems like the more direct and simple approach. Since the results are far from state of the art, a clean and neat presentation of the theoretical advantages and contributions is crucial. \n\n2) The presentation is not professional, hard to follow and the submission overall looks very rushed:\n- In equations, please use \\inf, \\sup, and \\text{...} for text such as distance, data, ... \n- I have trouble understanding the overall idea behind Algorithm 1 and Eq. (22). What is the definition of f^* and g^* in Eq. (22)? Some explanatory text would be valuable.\n- The set F in Definition 3.5 looks odd, as it appears to be recursive and might not be unique.  \n- The writing looks very rushed, and should be improved. For example, I have trouble understanding the sentence \"So the existed algorithms should be heuristic or it can get a bad result even we train the neural networks with lots of datasets.\" in the introduction. \n- The aspect ratio in Fig. 5 should be fixed.\n\n3) The experiments are completely preliminary and not reasonable:\n- The WGAN-GP baseline is very weak, i.e. does not show any reasonable generated images (Fig. 9). There are countless open pytorch implementations on GitHub which out-of-the-box produce much better results. \n- The shown inception scores are far from state-of-the-art.

It proves that this metric is an upper bound of F-distance. It also proves a generalization bound for this metric. Simulation resultson MNIST, CIFAR10, etc. are reported.\n\n  The contribution of this paper is incremental due to the following reasons.\n\n 1) The duality gap is only an upper bound of the F-distance. This means that if the duality gap is zero then the learned distribution is the true distribution. However, the converse is not necessarily true: even if the algorithm starts with the true distribution, the duality gap may not be zero. Thus the metric is not a proper metric.\n  The proof of the upper bound is straightforward.\n\n  2) Another issue is the gap between the min-max formulation and the real training algorithm. As for GAN, due to the inexact update, it is not really solving the min-max problem. For the proposed metric, it is also impossible to solve sup_f V(f, g*) and inf_g V(f*, g) to reasonable accuracy. Thus what the algorithm is really doing, perhaps, is to optimizing a new loss which is the sum of the original loss and and an extra term. Viewing it as a \u201cduality gap\u201d seems to be far from the practical training. This discrepancy exists for GANs, but it is a bigger issue for the duality gap interpretation. \n\n  3) The simulation is not convincing. The reported FID for CIFAR10 using WGAN-GP is 54.4, which seems to be a bit high. I\u2019m not sure whether it is due to parameter choice or due to weak D/G networks used in the simulation. If the paper cannot compare various architecture, it is more convincing to at least use some standard architecture, like DCGAN. Or at least report the parameter tuning effort made for getting the results.
