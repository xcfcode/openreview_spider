The paper identifies limitations of past evaluations of deep RL agents on Atari. The human baseline scores commonly used in deep RL are not the highest known human scores.  To enable learning agents to reach these high scores, the paper recommends allowing the learning agents to play without a time limit.  The time limit in Atari is not always consistent across papers, and removing the time limit requires additional software fixes due to some bugs in the game software.  These ideas form the core of the paper's proposed new benchmark (SABER). The paper also proposes a new deep RL algorithm that combines earlier ideas. \n\nThe reviews and the discussion with the authors brought out several strengths and weaknesses of the proposal.  One strength was identifying the best known human performance in these Atari games.  \nHowever, the reviewers were not convinced that this new benchmark is useful.  The reviewers raised concerns about using clipped rewards, using games that received substantially different amounts of human effort, comparing learning algorithms to human baselines instead of other learning algorithms, and also the continued use of the Atari environment. Given all these many concerns about a new benchmark, the newly proposed algorithm was not viewed as a distraction.\n\nThis paper is not ready for publication. The new benchmark proposed for deep reinforcement learning on Atari was not convincing to the reviewers.  The paper requires further refinement of the benchmark or further justification for the new benchmark.", "title": "Paper Decision"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Is Deep Reinforcement Learning Really Superhuman on Atari?

It also brings the following additional contributions: (1) a new measure of comparison to human performance based on actual human world records (which shows that RL algorithms are not as \u00ab super-human \u00bb as is generally believed), and (2) an evaluation (based on the proposed guidelines) of Rainbow as well as a Rainbow-IQN variant (replacing the C51 component of Rainbow with Implicit Quantile Networks), showing that the latter brings a significant improvement upon the original Rainbow algorithm.\n\nOverall I am leaning towards acceptance as I believe that such papers encouraging better benchmarking practice on Atari are definitely needed. Even if the technical contribution is limited, this paper could have a positive impact on the field by providing a clearer picture of the current state of deep RL algorithms on Atari (assuming that other researchers start following these recommendations -- and if that is not the case at least it will highlight issues with the way evaluation is currently done).\n\nI do have a few concerns / questions though:\n\n1.\tI am not convinced by the recommendation to use performance during training for evaluation purpose. In Machado et al. (2018) it is argued that \u00ab this better aligns the performance metric with the goal of continual learning \u00bb, but most deep RL algorithms trained on Atari games have not been intended to be used in a continual learning setting. It definitely has the advantage of being simple, but it seems to me that it can cause some issues, like making it difficult to compare different exploration techniques for off-policy learning (the exploration may cause poor behavior during training even if it helps the agent learn a better greedy policy), and more generally not being representative of the common practical use case where the goal is to obtain the best agent possible to use in production (with no further learning). Finally, it could make results even harder to reproduce due to the potential high variance of an agent\u2019s performance at a fixed # of timesteps (vs. considering the max performance it can reach over the whole period). As a result, I am currently reluctant to see the proposed performance measure become the standard evaluation metric on ALE, and I would appreciate some additional justification from the authors on this point.\n\n2.\tWhy not suggest to remove reward clipping in the recommendations? As mentioned in Section 6, reward clipping can prevent RL algorithms from properly playing some games, and thus in my opinion should be removed if the goal is to reach the highest score possible on all games. It seems to me that the choice of clipping the reward should be part of the algorithm (if it is not able to handle the high variety of \u00ab raw \u00bb rewards) and not of the benchmark environment, thus enabling further advancements towards algorithms that are robust to a wide range of rewards.\n\n3.\tWhy bother to keep the mean performance when, as mentioned, it is highly sensitive to outliers compared to the median?\n\n\nAdditional remarks:\n\u2022\tI might have missed it but I do not see the link to the source code. Am I correct to assume it will be released, to help with reproducibility?\n\u2022\tIt is not clear, when reading the paper, that the distributed version of Rainbow is actually constrained to mimic a single agent sequential algorithm in the experiments. I would suggest to remove mentions of the distributed version in the main text to avoid confusion, and mention it only in the Appendix section where it is used.\n\u2022\tThe \u00ab infinite reward loop \u00bb point at the end of Section 6 does not seem relevant in the list of reasons why Deep RL algorithms are far from the best human performance, since with infinite playtime and an infinite reward loop, the algorithm should be guaranteed to outperform humans.\n\u2022\tI would have appreciated an evaluation of Rainbow-IQN with the current most commonly used evaluation schemes (e.g. the one used in the original Rainbow paper), for comparison purpose (even if such an evaluation has flaws, it is often the only performance measure available for existing deep RL algorithms)\n\nReview update: thank you for the response, I am currently keeping my \"Weak accept\" rating because I agree it is important to highlight and (try to) fix the problems with the way algorithms are currently evaluated on ALE, in spite of the limited technical contributions (and the fact that I remained unconvinced regarding #1)", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper601/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper601/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Is Deep Reinforcement Learning Really Superhuman on Atari?

While it is demonstrably better, it isn't clear to me that it will allow researchers to much better distinguish between RL algorithms. \n\n2) The problem with ALE being \"designed for human players\" is exactly that. Humans have years of prior knowledge about objects, embodiment, physics, and many more. It's easier to learn from a general distribution and apply the solution to cartoon problems than to learn from cartoons and apply the solution to real world general problems. This is fairly well established by the success of sim2real. As such, I remain unconvinced that the ALE is the best currently available benchmark for general purpose RL algorithm.\n\n4) Thank you for the link, I will take this into consideration in the future. I do think, though, that this is further evidence that the ALE isn't a great research platform. Researchers rarely have the resources to test all games simultaneously, and since transfer from game to game is very poor, papers tend to overfit to some environments (as the concurrent submission points out)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper601/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper601/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Is Deep Reinforcement Learning Really Superhuman on Atari?

However, I am wondering if it could be a more suitable conclusion to use this information to instead argue that we shouldn't focus on comparing to humans at all. This is because:\n- A considerable number of the scores maxed out, and it might not be very interesting to normalize scores by 999,999\n- These scores were achieved over drastically different amounts of practice time, or like you acknowledged, attention from individuals willing to invest the time into setting records in these games. It's imaginable that for some of the games which have not maxed out, it is largely due to the communities not giving the game much interest, than being representative of what humans are ultimately capable of in the game.\n\nPerhaps this collection of results can instead be posed as an argument that we should only be comparing between algorithms, and perhaps choose a representative base algorithm (e.g., DQN) to report scores relative to?\n\nI hope that makes more sense, let me know if any of it is still unclear!"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper601/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper601/AnonReviewer3", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Is Deep Reinforcement Learning Really Superhuman on Atari?

Machado et al. used a 5 minutes maximum length, to be compared with most of other works using 30 minutes. Moreover as mentioned in the main paper, we think this parameter is a source of ambiguity and led to mistakes even on important published papers in the field.\n\n\"there are some interesting remarks on why Atari is not necessarily a good environment, e.g. most of Section 6\": The authors are in fact convinced that Atari is a good environment for general RL and AI. Indeed, the Section 6 gives some hypotheses on why the RL algorithms are that bad, not that the ALE environment is. In fact, those remarks are even an explanation of why Atari is indeed a good environment describing its remaining difficulties and variability. The authors actually think that on the 3 most commonly used benchmark for DRL: ALE, DeepMind Lab and MuJoCo, ALE is the one with the most variability. We argue that this variability comes from the fact that those games were designed for human players and human don't like to play games that are too similar. In conclusion, we think that ALE is still a really interesting environment for general AI because current DRL algorithms are far from solving most of Atari games.\n\n\"The link to TwinGalaxies should be a proper reference with the time of visit\": We described all the world records we used in the Supplementary Materials, this allows easy reproducibility and comparison and avoid the cumbersome process of checking world records one by one. As suggested, we have specifically included the time of visit for additional clarity in the revision we just submitted.\n\n\"This paper would be much stronger if it focused on a few representative games (e.g. one reflex game, one hard exploration game, etc.) and tested these games with a bunch of DRL algorithms\": We agree it would have been really interesting to evaluate different DRL algorithms but this was not possible regarding our computational resources. Regarding testing on few representative games, we actually think this can bias the results and not represent the generality of the algorithm tested. A concurrent submission at ICLR, https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJewlyStDr , actually supports our argument. Their abstract claims \"the real pace of progress in exploration research for Atari 2600 games may have been obfuscated by good results on a single domain\". Indeed they showed that most of advance for hard-exploration games were most of the time overfitting to Montezuma Revenge and not really leading to improvement on other hard-exploration games and often even led to lower performances on easy exploration Atari games."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper601/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper601/Reviewers"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper601/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Is Deep Reinforcement Learning Really Superhuman on Atari?

We will try to answer to all your questions and remarks in the following.\n\n1) Concerning the recommendation of reporting performance during training, we will base our argument on Machado et al. paper where they specifically speak about \"Evaluation after learning\" and \"Evaluation of the best policy\" (page 8). First we think that evaluating the best policy after learning hides both the data efficiency and the stability of the algorithm. Indeed most paper actually do not mention when the best results were encountered. Finally as stated in Machado et al. we think that \"the best score achieved across training is a statistically biased estimate of an agent\u2019s best performance\". However, it could be interesting to report training performance along with a re-evaluation of the best model encountered while training.\n\n2) We think that finding algorithms capable of managing high variety of rewards is still an open problem and most of algorithms are yet not suited to this. And as you mentioned clipping reward is an algorithmic choice, so we estimate it is out of scope of the recommendations of SABER. We think games on which reward clipping actually leads to sub-optimal policy are an important margin of improvement for algorithms trying to handle highly variable rewards.\n\n3) We kept mean performance as most of previous works were reporting both median and mean. However, we think this is of limited interest and that is why all our graphics just plot the median normalized score.\n\nAdditional remarks:\n\u2022\tThe source code is currently available here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/728e379d-4d38-49e2-9dd8-bf2fb4bd4844/\n\u2022\tWe mentioned our distributed version of Rainbow as we think this give a good value on our source code even if like you mentioned we constrained it to mimic a single agent version in our experiments.\n\u2022\tWe have reformulate this \"Infinite reward loop\" section in the revision we just submitted. The idea we wanted to highlight there was that agents are often stuck in a loop which in many cases is a sub-optimal behavior (in fact most of Atari games incorporate a timeout when not moving along the game and Elevator Action was the only one we found with an infinite reward loop).\n\u2022\tUnfortunately, we did not have time nor computational resources to run Rainbow-IQN following commonly used evaluation schemes."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper601/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper601/Reviewers"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper601/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Is Deep Reinforcement Learning Really Superhuman on Atari?

We will try to answer to all your questions and remarks in the following.\n\n1) It is true that removing the maximum length time introduced some issues but we think those issues are easily solved with our $\\textit{maximum stuck time}$. On the other hand, the fact that 2 main papers (PPO and C51) did a mistake with this parameter is a good indicator of how much such limitation is a source of error and ambiguity. Moreover Machado et al. used only 5 minutes whereas some other papers used 30 minutes, which is an example of a comparison issue.\nConcerning the possible biases based on game's reward distribution, we actually tested both 5 and 30 minutes as maximum stuck time. It led to the exact same results: being stuck 5 min always meant being stuck over 30 min. Moreover Machado et al. used 5 minutes as their max episode length, implying that 5 min is a significant unit of time for an ALE game. This is comforted when considering those games were designed with the patience of human players in mind.\n\n2) We are not sure on how to interpret this question. We assume it is referring to the actual time human players played to reach the world record, typically to the fact that some famous games as Pacman and Space Invaders received much more interest than the other Atari games by the gamers community. This indeed can lead to world records harder to beat than others, but we still think those records are much more representative of best human capabilities than the human baseline commonly used. If this interpretation is wrong, could the reviewer kindly provide more details so the authors can answer accordingly?\n\n3) We choose to evaluate Rainbow as it is the current state-of-the-art on Atari and thus is one of the most important to re-evaluate. As mentioned we had limited amount of computational resources to conduct a full Atari benchmark with other DRL algorithms. As a side note, even Machado et al just re-evaluated on a single DRL algorithm, DQN. The second algorithm evaluated didn't imply DRL and therefore was much faster to train. Moreover, the focus of the article is first on measuring the impact of the diverging evaluation procedures, which is detailed in section 5.1 (applied to Rainbow), rather than re-ranking existing algorithms."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper601/Authors"], "readers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper601/Reviewers", "everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper601/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Is Deep Reinforcement Learning Really Superhuman on Atari?

(2018) for standardizing training and evaluation procedures in the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). It then introduces a collection of human world records for each Atari game to refute previous claims of superhuman performance, as well as recommend comparisons against these records. They proceed to evaluate Rainbow under their proposed evaluation procedures, as well as introduce a new algorithm, Rainbow-IQN, with similar evaluations made based on their proposal.\n\nI'm proposing a weak rejection as I feel some of the arguments made in the paper aren't very strong. In particular, I'd like the authors to comment on the following:\n\n1) The key difference between their evaluation benchmark and the recommendations in Machado et al. (2018) are that episodes should not have a time limit. The justification for this is that many algorithms might achieve practically optimal performance within this time limit, and so one wouldn't be able to compare algorithms on certain games within significance. They further emphasize that human high scores were achieved without limiting to 30 minutes of play. That said, several algorithms performing similarly within said limit can be instead interpreted as shifting emphasis toward comparing performance on the harder games. As the paper acknowledged, removing the maximum episode length ended up introducing more issues, such as the emulator never ending an episode (due to a supposed bug), as well as increasing the likelihood of the score overflowing. The paper suggested a trick of limiting how long an agent can go without receiving a reward, but it's unclear (1) if needing this fix is worth the proposed change, and (2) if the fix introduces additional game-specific nuances in evaluation; e.g., are there any situations where this can be detrimental to properly evaluating performance, or introduce biases based on a game's reward distribution?\n\n2) The paper gathered a list of human world records for the Atari games in the ALE. In my opinion, this is very valuable for the literature in terms of addressing prior work misrepresenting the competency of an algorithm relative to what humans are capable of; a professional game tester is supposed to be representative of the average game player, who is typically tasked with optimizing fun, whereas speedrunners and scorerunners of games are tasked with optimizing a comparable objective to an RL agent. Beyond this though, I think an alternative conclusion would be to use this information in support of not comparing results to human scores, and to focus on comparisons between algorithms. A considerable number of the human world records have reached the maximum allowable score, over drastically variable gameplay times to achieve these scores, that it might still not be that fair a comparison. Have the authors considered this possibility?\n\n3) Were any other algorithms evaluated on this benchmark, beyond Rainbow? While there are computational considerations, it seems odd for a benchmarking-focused paper to only evaluate one standard algorithm and slight modification of it.\n\nSuggestions\n\n1) The introduction of Rainbow-IQN in this paper feels a little random and out of place given the context created by the rest of the paper's contributions- I feel it might be more appropriate for a benchmarking paper to focus on a representative set of \"standard\" or relatively simple/trivial algorithms (Like Machado et al. (2018) did) to give a frame of reference for comparing novel ones."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper601/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper601/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Is Deep Reinforcement Learning Really Superhuman on Atari?

In the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), small changes in environment parameters such as stochasticity or the maximum allowed play time can lead to very different performance. In this work, we discuss the difficulties of comparing different agents trained on ALE. In order to take a step further towards reproducible and comparable DRL, we introduce SABER, a Standardized Atari BEnchmark for general Reinforcement learning algorithms. Our methodology extends previous recommendations and contains a complete set of environment parameters as well as train and test procedures. We then use SABER to evaluate the current state of the art, Rainbow. Furthermore, we introduce a human world records baseline, and argue that previous claims of expert or superhuman performance of DRL might not be accurate.
