Here are our responses to your suggestions and questions.\n\n\u201cI would like to see an ablation study with the two separate techniques (self- and cross-attention processes) on NPs\u201d\n\nRegarding the ablation study for using just cross-attention, all the ANP results for 1D GP regression use cross-attention but not self-attention (i.e. have MLP encodings of each context pair). Hence the improvements here show the contribution of cross-attention only. Figure 4b also shows quantitative results for the CelebA image regression with only cross-attention, denoted Multihead ANP in the legend. The counterpart results for MNIST can be found in Figure 13b of Appendix E of the revised version of the paper. Qualitative comparisons of the NP, Multihead ANP and Stacked Multihead ANP can be found in Figures 14 and 15. It would indeed be helpful to show results for the case when we just have self-attention in the encoder without any cross-attention. We are currently running these experiments and will include the results in the next version of the paper.\n\n\n\u201cWhile the dot product improves the performance significantly, the gain of Laplace is much lower\u2026 Do you have any intuition about why performs worse than other models?\u201d\n\nLaplace attention is parameter-free (so keys and queries are just x-values) whereas for dot-product attention, the keys and queries are parameterised representations of the x-values (output of learned MLP that takes x-values as inputs). So the dot-product similarities are computed in a learned representation space, whereas for Laplace the similarities are computed based on L1 distance in the x-space. Hence it is expected that dot-product attention will be able to fit the contexts better than Laplace. We have made this clear in the revised version of the paper.\n\n\n\u201cDo you have any specific application in mind?\u201d\n\nBayesian Optimisation (BO) is one notable application of (A)NPs since the predictive mean and uncertainty can be used for finding the minimum of a test function drawn from a stochastic process whose realisations can be used to train the (A)NP (toy experiment results shown in Appendix C, referred to in the last paragraph of the section on 1D experiments in main text). The image data experiments also show promise for applying ANPs to arbitrary pixel inpainting, bottom half prediction and mapping images between arbitrary resolutions."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper308/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper308/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper308/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Attentive Neural Processes", "abstract": "Neural Processes (NPs) (Garnelo et al., 2018) approach regression by learning to map a context set of observed input-output pairs to a distribution over regression functions.

Here are our responses:\n\n\u201cThe authors give the hypoethesize about the potential cause of the under-fitting issue and proposes to resolve it with attention\u2026. Although the proposed method give better performance, it is not clear whether the better performance is due to the added complexity to the model (the attention mechanism) or truely resolving the under-fitting issue\u201d\n\nOur reasoning that the mean-aggregation acts as a bottleneck is as follows. In NPs, the aggregated representations r_C and s_C needs to have information about the particular function (the realisation of the stochastic process) not only at the context x-values but for all x-values in the domain for the predictions to generalise well to unseen targets. When we compute these aggregated representations simply by taking the mean of representations of each context pair, it will be difficult for the resulting representation to model the entire function, and may require a large representation dimensionality. On the other hand, cross-attention allows the aggregated representation r* to be specific to the target x-value x*, so that it suffices for the representation r* to only be informative about the prediction at x* instead of all x-values in the domain. We claim that this inductive bias allows the ANP to resolve the undefitting issue, not just because of the added model capacity (i.e. more parameters) that attention introduces. As evidence for this, on the left of Figure 3 we show quantitative results for differing sizes of the bottleneck in NPs, ranging from d=128 to 1024. The figure shows that raising d (i.e. increasing model capacity) does help achieve better reconstructions, but there seems to be a limit in how much the reconstructions can improve, hence showing that naively adding capacity to the model is insufficient in addressing the underfitting behaviour. We show that multihead (and dot-product) attention with d=128 gives a much faster decrease in the reconstructions than NPs with any value of d, both against iteration and wall-clock time. We would also like to point out that the number of parameters in the NP model for bottleneck size d is approximately 10d^2 (ignoring smaller order terms), whereas for multihead it is 15d^2 (so cross-attention introduces 5d^2 extra parameters). So the number of parameters of NP with d=1024 is much higher than that of multihead with d=128, yet we can get noticeably better performance with multihead attention. Hence the improvement in performance is mostly due to the attention mechanism rather than the increase in model complexity (i.e. number of parameters).\n\n\n\u201cA lot of technical details are missing in the paper, which makes the method not reproducible.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the experimental and model architecture details in Appendix A, we have included Figure 8 detailing the precise architecture for the different models. We believe this is sufficient to reproduce the method, but if you think anything is missing please do let us know and we revise the experimental details accordingly.\n\n\n\u201cIn the GP literature, there are also methods tackling meta-learning or multi-task learning or few shot learning.\u201d\n\nThank you for pointing out these references. We agree that these are relevant work and have added them to the related work section of the paper.\n\n\n\u201cFor the 1D regression experiments (Figure 1left, Figure 3right), it is not clear which fitting is better. It largely depends on the prior of kerel parameters. As the data points are generated from a GP, plotting the Gaussian process fit with the ground truth parameters can show what a ground truth fitting would look like.\u201d\n\nIn the revised version of the paper, we have included Figure 9 showing the predictive mean and variance of the oracle GP from which the contexts were drawn for comparison in Appendix C. Note that the data was generated from a GP with small observation noise (sigma_n = 0.02), so we do want the predictive mean to pass through the contexts with predictive variance small near the context points and large away from them. It is clear that the Multihead ANP is much closer to the ground truth than the NP with very accurate predictive mean, despite there being evidence of underestimating the variance away from the contexts - one possible explanation for this is that variational inference usually leads to underestimates of predictive variance.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper308/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper308/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper308/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Attentive Neural Processes", "abstract": "Neural Processes (NPs) (Garnelo et al., 2018) approach regression by learning to map a context set of observed input-output pairs to a distribution over regression functions.

The authors claim that one substantial weakness of NP is the tendency of under-fitting.

This paper proposes to resolve this issue by adding an attention mechanism to the deterministic path. The experimental results show that the proposed method converge faster and give better results on various tasks.\n\nOne major concern about the paper is the lack of analysis of the true cause of under-fitting in NP. The authors give the hypoethesize about the potential cause of the under-fitting issue and proposes to resolve it with attention, however, without theoretical or empirical analyses, it is hard to understand the true cause of the under-fitting issue.

We address this issue by incorporating attention into NPs, allowing each input location to attend to the relevant context points for the prediction. We show that this greatly improves the accuracy of predictions, results in noticeably faster training, and expands the range of functions that can be modelled.

By replacing MLPs and mean pooling with these attention processes, the authors resolve the underfitting problem of NPs. The experimental results show that ANPs converge better and faster than NPs.\n\nOverall, I had fun to read the paper and have not much to complain. Below are some comments and questions.\n\n1. It is intuitive and reasonable that the cross-attention process makes ANPs fit with smaller predictive uncertainty for those regions with many context points. This is well illustrated in the qualitative results in the experiment section.\n\n2. I would like to see an ablation study with the two separate techniques (self- and cross-attention processes) on NPs since the two techniques aim to improve different aspects of NPs. More specifically, I wonder the results of just adding cross-attention with the vanilla MLPs for feature encoding and just replacing the MLPs with self-attention modules while keeping using mean pooling.\n\n3. While the dot product improves the performance significantly, the gain of Laplace is much lower. Also, qualitatively it fails to overcome the underfitting problem. Do you have any intuition about why performs worse than other models?\n\n4. Do you have any specific application in mind? I just wonder some example tasks where contexts are given as inputs.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper308/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Attentive Neural Processes", "abstract": "Neural Processes (NPs) (Garnelo et al., 2018) approach regression by learning to map a context set of observed input-output pairs to a distribution over regression functions.
