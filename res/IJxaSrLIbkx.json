Indeed, that's a great point and often explainable models address the \"why\" and rarely the \"why not\" that can help identify the features guiding the change in the class. \nThe ideas presented are compelling and it is good to see that we can re-use state of the art AI first order logic (FOL) statements in the field of explainable models. The references are excellent. \nHowever, the paper suffers from several drawbacks: \n1- The setting is limited to ML models that are expressed as a set of FOL sentences\n2- Discretization of numerical features is required. We know static discretization can be problematic (large versus small interval); no discussion is in the paper to how to address this point\n3- More details should be presented about SHAP since this is the main method the authors compare to;\n4- Figure 1 part c) is not explained. There seems to be missing parentheses in the FOL statement;\n5- The experimental section is rather weak.  The example on the real-vs-fake digit is not clear.

Comparison to Shap (using correlation) is not discussed.\nThe second experiment. provides some statistics on the time, number of abductive and contrastive explanations. Perhaps it would have been good to provide other examples of the importance of extracting both explanations and how pertinent they are.

In addition, we analyzed SHAP aiming to illustrate possible uses of our work. We did try Anchor, but the tool was too slow for the examples we considered. As a result, we focused on analyzing SHAP. The same general comment applies to the work of Dhurandhar et al., i.e. the conclusions would be aligned with what we observed for SHAP.\n\nThank you for the pointer to the work of [Karimi et al.]. This work will be cited, as it also exploits FOL to represent ML models, and it tackles contrastive explanations. However, our work not only offers a simpler and more efficient approach for computing contrastive explanations, it also proves the hitting set relationship between the two kinds of explanations. Our claim of being more efficient is\njustified by the results presented in [Karimi et al.], which scales to a few ReLU units, by the results presented in our paper, but also by the results presented in the papers our work builds upon.\n\nWe feel ICLR is a suitable venue for our work. There are several papers on using formal methods in ML that have been published at ICLR in recent years.\n\nFinally, regarding footnote 9, we note that there is nothing wrong with it. It is well-known that one can encode non-linear arithmetic in FOL. This is actually available in a wide range of SMT solvers. We can add a comment about this to the paper.\n\n**What to change in the paper:**\n- We will include the missing reference to [Karimi et al.].

We ask the reviewer to clarify why FOL might be perceived as a limitation. As commented in the response to reviewer 4, FOL tools are fairly flexible in what they allow modeling; this includes non-linear arithmetic. For example, a wide class of neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions, boosted decision trees, etc., can be easily expressed using FOL. As we mentioned above, we can express models with nonlinear activation functions as well.\n\n2. Technically, we do not need to discretize features. Note that the proposed approach is perfectly general and *constraint-agnostic*, e.g. it allows us to reason with real or integer-valued features (at the potential cost of efficiency and/or decidability). The computation of prime implicants when reasoning about real-valued domains has been studied before, e.g. [*Isil Dillig, Thomas Dillig, Kenneth L. McMillan, Alex Aiken: Minimum Satisfying Assignments for SMT. CAV 2012: 394-409*](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-31424-7_30). However, we should note that this was not the goal of the paper. The goal is to develop formal approaches for computing and enumerating contrastive explanations and, more importantly, to demonstrate the hitting set duality between the two types of explanations.\n3. Additional details regarding SHAP will be added to the paper.\n4. We will complete the analysis of Figure 1. Thanks for noticing this.\n5. The purpose of the experiments was twofold: (1) to demonstrate that enumeration of explanations can scale to realistic ML models and (2) to get a better perception of what SHAP's explanations correspond to using the proposed apparatus of rigorous contrastive explanations - this is to demonstrate possible uses of our work. We note that the purpose of this analysis was not to *\"compare to SHAP\"*. We will clarify the digit example. We re-emphasize that the objective was to show scalability and applicability, which we did.\n6. We will improve readability for the final version.\n\n**What to change in the paper:**\n- We will add detail on SHAP.\n- We will complete the description of Figure 1.\n- We will improve the presentation of the experiments."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2937/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2937/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On Relating \"Why?\" and \"Why Not?\" Explanations", "authorids": ["~Alexey_Ignatiev1", "~Nina_Narodytska1", "nicholas.asher@irit.fr", "~Joao_Marques-Silva1"], "authors": ["Alexey Ignatiev", "Nina Narodytska", "Nicholas Asher", "Joao Marques-Silva"], "keywords": ["Explanability", "contrastive explanations", "duality"], "abstract": "Explanations of Machine Learning (ML) models often address a \u2018Why?\u2019 question.

Contrastive explanations answer the why not question, while standard explanations (abductive in this paper's language), answer why. This paper formulates the problem as a first order logic problem and then leverages what seems like classic algorithms from that domain to learn these explanations. First, I want to point out that I have no expertise in first order logic, so this review is perhaps an educated guess as to the quality of this work. \n\nClarity/Writing\nThe writing is relatively clear and straightforward. One issue is with the citations: there is a missing bracket with the citations, which then makes them part of the sentence and ultimately distracting. \n\nQuality/Significance. \nContrastive explanations could be useful for a variety of tasks and importantly provide actionable insights about how to change a sample to satisfy positive rating. In that regard, the goal of this work is a worthy one. I cannot judge the quality of this work since I donot have any expertise in formal logic. \n\nQuestions\nWhat is the difference between the contrastive explanations as defined here and what watcher et. al. and the literature calls counterfactual explanations? \n\nI am somewhat surprised at the computational performance from the results presented here; these seem much faster than I would have expected. It seems like the task of identifying a contrastive explanation, for the discretized data set, should be NP-Hard. Is this the case? \n\nIn looking at figure 2, I can't really see the differences in attribution for CXp for the real data vs the fake one. How does the CXp help distinguish real from fake data? In the summary of results, the authors conclude that the CXps enumeration provide insight into the behavior of the classifier. However, the behavior is not discussed nor is any insight provided. What are the authors referring to? \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2937/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2937/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On Relating \"Why?\" and \"Why Not?\" Explanations", "authorids": ["~Alexey_Ignatiev1", "~Nina_Narodytska1", "nicholas.asher@irit.fr", "~Joao_Marques-Silva1"], "authors": ["Alexey Ignatiev", "Nina Narodytska", "Nicholas Asher", "Joao Marques-Silva"], "keywords": ["Explanability", "contrastive explanations", "duality"], "abstract": "Explanations of Machine Learning (ML) models often address a \u2018Why?\u2019 question.
