The core idea is to perform a random projection of the data (which is supposed to decrease the impact from adversarial distortions). The approach is empirically tested on the following data: MNIST, CIFAR, and SVHN.\n\nThe paper is moderately well written and structured. Command of related work is ok, but some relevant refs are missing (e.g., Kloft and Laskov, JMLR 2012). The empirical results actually confirm that indeed the strategy of reducing the dimensionality using random projections reduces the impact from adversarial distortions. This is encouraging. What the paper really lacks in my opinion is a closer analysis of *why* the proposed approach works, i.e., a qualitative empirical analysis (toy experiment?) or theoretical justification. Right now, there is no theoretical justification for the approach, nor even a (in my opinion) convincing movitation/Intuition behind the approach. Also, the attack model should formally introduced.\n\nIn summary, I d like to encourage the authors to further investigate into their approach, but I am not convinced by the manuscript in the current form. It lacks both in sound theoretical justification and intuitive motivation of the approach. The experiments, however, show clearly advantages of the approach (again, here further experiments are necessary, e.g., varying the dose of adversarial points).

As in the example that follows, if the adversary wants to make anomalies seem normal at test time, it should move normal points outward from the normal point cloud (eg making a 9 look like a weird 7).\n\nAs s_attack increases, the anomaly data points are moved farther away from the normal data cloud, altering the position of the separating hyperplane.  -- This seems backwards from Fig 2.  From (a) to (b) the red points move closer to the center while in (c) they move further away (why?).  The blue points seem to consistently become more dense from (a) to (c).\n\nThe attack model is too rough.  It seems that without bounding D, we can make the model arbitrarily bad, no?  Assumption 1 alludes to this but doesn't specify what is \"small\"?  Also the attack model is described without considering if the adversary knows the learner's algorithm.

And the paper does not contribute novelty to representation learning, therefore, it is not a good fit for the conference. Detailed critiques are as following:\n1. The idea proposed by the authors seems too quite simple. It is just performing random projections for 1000 times and choose the set of projection parameters that results in the highest compactness as the dimensionality reduction model parameter before one-class SVM.\n2. It says in the experiments part that the authors have used 3 different S_{attack} values, but they only present results for S_{attack} = 0.5. It would be nicer if they include results for all S_{attack} values that they have used in their experiments, which would also give the reader insights on how the anomaly detection performance degrades when the S_attack value change.\n3. The paper claims that the nonlinear random projection is a defence against adversary due to the randomness, but there is no results in the paper proving that other non-random projections are susceptible to adversary that is designed to target that projection mechanism and nonlinear random projection is able to get away with that. And PCA as a non-random projection would a nice baseline to compare against.\n4. The paper seems to misuse the term \u201cFalse positive rate\u201d as the y label of figure 3(d/e/f). The definition of false positive rate is FP/(FP+TN), so if the FPR=1 it means that all negative samples are labeled as positive. So it is surprising to see FPR=1 in Figure 3(d) when feature dimension=784 while the f1 score is still high in Figure 3(a). From what I understand, the paper means to present the percentage of adversarial examples that are misclassified instead of all the anomaly examples that get misclassified. The paper should come up with a better term for that evaluation.\n5. The conclusion, that robustness of the learned model increases wrt the integrity attacks increases when the projection dimension becomes lower, cannot be drawn from Figure 3(d). Need more experiment on more dimensionality to prove that. \n6. In the appendix B results part, sometimes the word \u2019S_attack\u2019 is typed wrong.

To address this, we propose a defense mechanism that is based on a contraction of the data, and we test its effectiveness using OCSVMs. The proposed approach introduces a layer of uncertainty on top of the OCSVM learner, making it infeasible for the adversary to guess the specific configuration of the learner. We theoretically analyze the effects of adversarial perturbations on the separating margin of OCSVMs and provide empirical evidence on several benchmark datasets, which show that by carefully contracting the data in low dimensional spaces, we can successfully identify adversarial samples that would not have been identifiable in the original dimensional space. The numerical results show that the proposed method improves OCSVMs performance significantly (2-7%)", "pdf": "/pdf/e300aaa0ef5246eda4d05d03b9748fe910c3c460.pdf", "TL;DR": "A novel method to increase the resistance of OCSVMs against targeted, integrity attacks by selective nonlinear transformations of data to lower dimensions.", "paperhash": "weerasinghe|unsupervised_adversarial_anomaly_detection_using_oneclass_support_vector_machines", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nsandamal2018unsupervised,\ntitle={Unsupervised Adversarial Anomaly  Detection using One-Class Support Vector Machines},\nauthor={Prameesha Sandamal Weerasinghe and Tansu Alpcan and Sarah Monazam Erfani and Christopher Leckie},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJgd7m0xRZ},\n}", "keywords": ["anomaly detection", "one class support vector machine", "adversarial learning"], "authors": ["Prameesha Sandamal Weerasinghe", "Tansu Alpcan", "Sarah Monazam Erfani", "Christopher Leckie"], "authorids": ["pweerasinghe@student.unimelb.edu.au", "tansu.alpcan@unimelb.edu.au", "sarah.erfani@unimelb.edu.au", "caleckie@unimelb.edu.au"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "duedate": 1511845199000, "tmdate": 1515642450404, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper449/Official_Review", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper449/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper449/AnonReviewer3", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper449/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper449/AnonReviewer2"], "reply": {"forum": "BJgd7m0xRZ", "replyto": "BJgd7m0xRZ", "writers": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper449/AnonReviewer[0-9]+", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "review": {"required": true, "order": 2, "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}"}, "rating": {"required": true, "order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"]}, "confidence": {"required": true, "order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"]}}}, "nonreaders": [], "expdate": 1519621199000, "cdate": 1515642450404}}}], "count": 5}
