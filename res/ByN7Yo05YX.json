We have some further responses:\n\nComplexity:\nWe agree, and apologise for our misinterpretation.  From a pragmatic perspective, we just wanted to explain that many decisions made in the implementation of ANTs in our case (e.g. choices of primitive modules, optimiser and its scheduling, etc) were based on accepted practices in deep learning research. From a theoretical perspective, we agree that as a natural consequence of attempting to combine the two approaches, improving the optimisation of ANTs would face challenges of both, and we believe this would be a worthwhile research question to pursue. \n\nInterpretability:\nThe tree-topology is a strong structural prior that enforces a particular sparse structure by which features are shared and separated in a hierarchical fashion. Such sparsity might approximately arise in a feedforward neural networks, but is not explicitly enforced and is difficult to track. For example, in our work, the tree structure approximately partitioned the input space into disjoint subsets (mostly grouping together images of certain classes), each of which is processed by a separate neural network whose early layers are more shared and deeper layers are more specific to respective subsets. \n\nHowever, that said, our proposed method learns such sparsity based on validation loss. As you point out, I believe if you have good \u201cprior\u201d knowledge about what might constitute \u201cgood\u201d splits (e.g. purity of classes, known hierarchical structures in data, etc), encouraging the tree-structure to account for it would benefit the performance/interpretability of the resultant model.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper433/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper433/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper433/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adaptive Neural Trees", "abstract": "Deep neural networks and decision trees operate on largely separate paradigms; typically, the former performs representation learning with pre-specified architectures, while the latter is characterised by learning hierarchies over pre-specified features with data-driven architectures.

H. (page 19) to demonstrate that our method can work on different domains/tasks. Using the same training setup we have produced results for ANTs as well as a large variety of baselines. This is a challenging dataset for standard NNs, with the 3 top-performing methods all being tree-based: SDTs (a specific form of ANTs), GBTs and ANTs. The best configuration for GBTs requires an order more parameters than the ANT, so taken together, these results (see Tab. 7) show the benefits of both representation learning and partitioning of the data space. We also perform the same ablation study that we did for MNIST and CIFAR-10, and show that, again, both nonlinear routers and transformers are key components of the ANT algorithm (see Tab. 8).\n\nAs the reviewer points out, experiments on larger datasets (e.g. ImageNet) would be more interesting and useful for showing scalability.

My main points of critique are:\n\n1.  Combining DT & NN \nI have doubts that the way you combine DT &NN  you get the \"Best of both world\". In some ways your architecture also \nshares disadvantages of both:\n\n1.1 Interpretability\nBecause each node in the tree can a neural network (with arbritrary complexity), this approach looses one central advantage of DT, that is the interpretability of the result.    Each node in the tree can perform arbritrary complex (and hierarchical) \ncomputations. The authors only show one particular example (Fig. 2a), where the model has learned is a reasonable \nstructure.\n\n1.2 Complexity:\nThe whole architecture is much more complex than either a neural network or a decision tree. I expect that therefore training these is not easy, and expert knowledge in either DT  or NN may not be enough to use this model.\n\n\n2. Limited experiments\n\n2.1 The authors only consider 2 experiments from vision (MNIST & CIFAR 10) while proposing a universal method.  To show universality the authors should use data sets from different domains (e.g UCI data sets)\n\n2.2 The authors argue that a  strength of the method   is  that it uses a low number of parameters on average for a forward path (compared to the total parameter size).  I don't find this argument to be convincing. In the limit this would imply a high memorization of the  data.  Also, a similar case can be made for standard CNN, when a particular filter is mostly inactive for some data points.\n\n2.3 The interpretability of DT compared to NN I mentioned earlier.  To make the argument that their method learns the\nhierarchical structure of the data , the authors should have added experiments to support this, where  such a hierarchical structure is clearly present and can be evaluated empirically.\n\n\n--\n\nIn light of the extended experiments w.r.t. to 2.1 I increased my score from 5 to 6.  Overall, I still have doubts about the interpretability and complexity of the proposed method.  \n\nComplexity:  \"but all the intuitions needed would come solely from training NN\".    I disagree with this response.   The architecture is a mix between a tree (hard, decision-tree like error surface,  non-local) and neural network (smooth, mostly convex error surface). This also implies that the training process and its behavior will possess patterns and challenges of both approaches. \n\nInterpretability:  I think the method misses \"priors\" that enforce credit assignment.  Partitioning the problem in subp-roblems should be done via the tree components, whereas processing (such as image filtering) should be done in the network nodes. However,  the method does not enforce, or encourage this behavior, for instance\nvia constraints:   also nodes can do partitioning (because neural networks can approximate decision trees)  and edges can do processing (e.g. decisions-trees can be used for mnist).\n\nSo I still believe this to be a borderline paper, however, the experiments support a more general applicability.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper433/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Adaptive Neural Trees", "abstract": "Deep neural networks and decision trees operate on largely separate paradigms; typically, the former performs representation learning with pre-specified architectures, while the latter is characterised by learning hierarchies over pre-specified features with data-driven architectures.

To this end we have now included a full set of results on the SARCOS robot inverse dynamics dataset for multivariate regression [1] in Supp. Sec. H. (page 19). Using the same training setup we have produced results for ANTs as well as a large variety of baselines. This is a challenging dataset for standard NNs, with the 3 top-performing methods all being tree-based: SDTs (a specific form of ANTs), GBTs and ANTs. The best configuration for GBTs requires an order more parameters than the ANT, so taken together, these results (see Tab. 7) show the benefits of both representation learning and partitioning of the data space. We also perform the same ablation study that we did for MNIST and CIFAR-10, and show that, again, both nonlinear routers and transformers are key components of the ANT algorithm (see Tab. 8).\n\nAdditionally, we have also included results from ensembling ANTs (Supp. Sec. I, page 20), demonstrating improved performance on all 3 datasets, including close to state-of-the-art performance on MNIST [2] with an order of magnitude less parameters.\n\n[1] Vijayakumar, S., & Schaal, S.

We hope to interact with you here to fully clarify and address your concerns and questions. Below are our initial responses to your comments.\n\n1.1 & 2.3 (interpretability)\nANTs add representational power in exchange for some interpretability (but ANTs do not lose any representational power compared to standard NNs). However, we believe that the hierarchical structure of the model still provides a new means for interpreting its decision making process. As noted in the paper, we can observe exemplar-based hierarchies in which every routing decision divides certain classes/categories of data; this relates to other interpretability methods such as finding images which maximally activate a given neuron [1]. This could, for example, be used to localise a point of routing failure if an ANT makes the wrong decision during inference. As you note, a similar specialisation can occur in certain filters in conventional CNNs, but the fully distributed representation makes localisation of failures very difficult. \n\nRegarding the evaluation of the quality of hierarchical structures, we are unaware of any quantitative metric that can be used when the ground truth is unknown or ambiguous; for instance, we know that there is no hierarchical generative process behind the construction of the MNIST digits dataset. More importantly, we think that human intuitions on relevant hierarchical structures do not necessarily equate to optimal clustering of data and thus such quantification might be quite difficult. Rather, what we would like to highlight is the ability of ANTs to learn when to share or separate the representation of data to optimise end-task performance, which gives rise to automatically discovering such hierarchies (such as the cherry-picked example in Fig. 2). \n\n1.2 (complexity)\nThe complexity of tuning ANTs is indeed more than that of NNs or DTs, but all the intuitions needed would come solely from training NNs.\n\n2.2. (memorization)\nWe are unsure if we have understood your criticism, so please do let us know if we do not correctly address your concerns. A common definition of memorisation is that of a model overfitting to the training set and hence failing to generalise to the validation and test sets [2]. Because the tree growth mechanism utilises early stopping [3], ANTs adapt their complexity to the training dataset and generalise well, even when trained on very small datasets (Fig 3. left).\n\nWe perceive the high performance of greedy routing as the appropriate specialisation/construction of a hierarchy of experts [4], where the final branches/leaves only need to account for specific partitions of the data; see also Table 6 for an ablation where inverting routing reduces performance catastrophically. Even if this specialisation can occur in certain filters in a conventional CNN, conventional CNNs lack the explicit hierarchy of ANTs. Another benefit of conditional computation, as used in ANTs, is that single-path inference is lightweight [5], as opposed to traditional NNs, which require engaging every parameter during the forward pass.\n\n[1] Girshick, R., Donahue, J., Darrell, T., & Malik, J.

We would be grateful if we could engage in a constructive discussion to address your questions. \n\nFor your first point, due to the representation learning properties of ANTs, they are more similar to NNs than DTs in that they are more prone to overfitting than bias. We mitigate overfitting by utilising early stopping on validation error. We have also shown that the progressive growth of the architecture defends against overfitting on small training datasets (Fig. 3). That said, ensembles of neural networks (NNs) have also long been used for reducing bias [1], so we could equally train an ensemble of ANTs to mimic the random forest approach.  \n\nFor your second point, we would like to note that different models have different trade-offs - Gaussian processes are extremely data efficient, but scale poorly to large datasets, while NNs have the opposite properties. Our goal with ANTs is not to compete with the the large amount of research into optimising architectures and regularisation methods that are needed to get state-of-the-art results, but show that our proposed model is able to achieve reasonably high accuracies whilst retaining the important properties of DTs; (1) ability to learn hierarchical clustering of data, and (2) the data-driven architectures. This is in line with other research into novel architectures, such as capsule networks [2], or NN-hybrids such as neural processes [3], which have been evaluated on smaller datasets.\n\n[1] Hansen, L.

We unite the two via adaptive neural trees (ANTs), a model that incorporates representation learning into edges, routing functions and leaf nodes of a decision tree, along with a backpropagation-based training algorithm that adaptively grows the architecture from primitive modules (e.g., convolutional layers). ANTs allow increased interpretability via hierarchical clustering, e.g., learning meaningful class associations, such as separating natural vs. man-made objects. We demonstrate this on classification and regression tasks, achieving over 99% and 90% accuracy on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, and outperforming standard neural networks, random forests and gradient boosted trees on the SARCOS dataset. Furthermore, ANT optimisation naturally adapts the architecture to the size and complexity of the training data.", "keywords": ["neural networks", "decision trees", "computer vision"], "authorids": ["ryutaro.tanno.15@ucl.ac.uk", "kailash.arulkumaran13@imperial.ac.uk", "d.alexander@ucl.ac.uk", "antcrim@microsoft.com", "adityan@microsoft.com"], "authors": ["Ryutaro Tanno", "Kai Arulkumaran", "Daniel C.
