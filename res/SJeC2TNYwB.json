The reviewers thus wanted empirical comparisons to methods designed for this setting, i.e. traditional statistical tests for comparing distributions.

The paper first empirically demonstrates that the likelihood of out-of-distribution data has a larger difference between training mode and testing mode, then provides a possible theoretical explanation for the phenomenon. The proposed scoring function utilizes such likelihood differences in a permutation test for detecting out-of-distribution data. The evaluation is performed on two small in-distribution image datasets and four out-of-distribution datasets with three types of generative models.\n\nWe recommend a weak accept. Its clarity is good, and the strength of the paper has three parts. The first is the thorough observation of the likelihood changes between different modes of batch-normalization. Second, the theoretical explanation for the observed phenomenon is sound. The example in Figure 2 gives a good intuition of how mis-specification can happen. The last is the strong performance on the out-of-distribution detection with generative models.\n\nHowever, I have some concerns about the design of the scoring function (Section 5), which looks like it is carefully tuned:\n1. Why do the authors use the permutation score ($T_{b,r1,r2}$) instead of likelihood difference ($\\delta_{b,r1,r2}$)? The likelihood difference itself seems like it could be a good indication for OoD detection.\n2. Why do the authors use interpolation between training and evaluation? It introduces extra hyperparameters (r1, r2) for the method. Is the performance sensitive to the choice of r1 and r2?\n\nOne minor issue:\n3.

As soon as the problem is changed to \"classify between OoD batches\" and not single samples, there are a large number of possible statistical tests one can perform to perform OoD (T-test between likelihoods of each batch) and the problem becomes *much* easier. In some ways, this makes things more well-defined (hard to compare distributions when one of them is just a single sample from an arbitrary distribution). \n\nHowever, that brings me to a big concern I have with the evaluation protocol. The batch size used for train/evaluation is rather large (64, this detail is hidden in the Appendix and I would have appreciated the number put in the main experiments section). If you take a likelihood model and evaluate on 64 samples from SVHN, you are all but guaranteed to sample a sample with *exceedingly* low likelihood, which dominates the mean statistic, making it possible to separate SVHN batch from CIFAR10 batches. I suspect that OoD datasets have plenty of these \"extremely low likelihood\" examples that will drag the mean likelihood down a lot.\n\nThis is consistent with your batch normalization experiments: in training mode, the likelihood is computed from mean activations over a batch of OoD samples, several of which probably contribute to the low likelihoods. In evaluation mode, likelihoods for each OoD sample are evaluated independently, which results in a similar observation to prior work showing that CIFAR10 likelihoods are inaccurate for SVHN. In other words, I think there is a mistake made here: it is the phenomenon that *batch likelihoods*, not *batch norm*, that is responsible for this method working well. One experiment that is missing from your paper (and would prove my hypothesis wrong) would be if you adapted the OoD criteria to compare the *mean* likelihoods in the evaluation mode, and show that for OoD datasets, the difference between batches still remains small.  \n\nNits:\n- \"...such as learning a mixture of Gaussians\", I believe this toy example was on univariate gaussians, not mixtures.\n- Choi et al. 2018 and should also be included in the citation that \"CIFAR10 gives higher likelihood estimates to SVHN than CIFAR10 ones\" (this was a concurrent discovery between the two papers)\n- Choi et al. 2018 is not the right citation for \"we evaluate the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and average precision (AP)\" for each binary classification task, a more appropriate one would be Hendryks and Gimpel 2017.\n- No doubt the authors realized already but Page 7 has some \"related work still needs some work, but there....\" which should be deleted.\n- It took me awhile to find the batch size used in training and evaluation mode (64), which was on page 16."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper800/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper800/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unsupervised Out-of-Distribution Detection with Batch Normalization", "authors": ["Jiaming Song", "Yang Song", "Stefano Ermon"], "authorids": ["jiaming.tsong@gmail.com", "yangsong@cs.stanford.edu", "ermon@cs.stanford.edu"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Likelihood from a generative model is a natural statistic for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples.

We argue that batch normalization for generative models challenges the traditional \\emph{i.i.d.} data assumption and changes the corresponding maximum likelihood objective. Based on this insight, we propose to exploit in-batch dependencies for OoD detection. Empirical results suggest that this leads to more robust detection for high-dimensional images.", "pdf": "/pdf/2993eb2b8a5888fa1757b8b3cbb4db549a3fdaf1.pdf", "paperhash": "song|unsupervised_outofdistribution_detection_with_batch_normalization", "original_pdf": "/attachment/b33861b3e79e57871e2b1949723fb2bd82641b3e.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nsong2020unsupervised,\ntitle={Unsupervised Out-of-Distribution Detection with Batch Normalization},\nauthor={Jiaming Song and Yang Song and Stefano Ermon},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJeC2TNYwB}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
