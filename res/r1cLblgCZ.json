The authors show that for their application, better performance is obtained when the network is only trained to reconstruct a subset of the data measurements. The paper also presents some visualizations the similarity structure of the learned representations and proposes a window-based method for processing the data.\n\nAccording to the paper, the experiments are done using a data set which is obtained from measurements of an industrial production process. Figure 2 indicates that reconstructing fewer dimensions of this dataset leads to lower MSE scores. I don\u2019t see how this is showing anything besides the obvious fact that reconstructing fewer dimensions is an easier task than reconstructing all of them.  The only conclusions I can draw from the visual analysis is that the context vectors are more similar to each other when they are obtained from time steps in the data stream which are close to each other. Since the paper doesn\u2019t describe much about the privately owned data at all, there is no possibility to replicate the work. The paper doesn\u2019t frame the work in prior research at all and the six papers it cites are only referred to in the context of describing the architecture.\n\nI found it very hard to distil what the main contribution of this work was according to the paper. There were also not many details about the precise architecture used. It is implied that GRU networks and were used but the text doesn\u2019t actually state this explicitly. By saying so little about the data that was used, it was also not clear what the temporal correlations of the context vectors are supposed to tell us. \n\nThe paper describes how existing methods are applied to a specific data set. The benefit of only reconstructing a subset of the input dimensions seems very data specific to me and I find it hard to consider this a novel idea by itself. Presenting sequential data in a windowed format is a standard procedure and not a new idea either. All in all I don't think that the paper presents any new ideas or interesting results.\n\nPros:\n* The visualizations look nice.\n\nCons:\n* It is not clear what the main contribution is.\n* Very little information about the data. \n* No clear experiments from which conclusions can be drawn.\n* No new ideas.\n* Not well rooted in prior work.\n", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Recurrent Auto-Encoder Model for Multidimensional Time Series Representation", "abstract": "Recurrent auto-encoder model can summarise sequential data through an encoder structure into a fixed-length vector and then reconstruct into its original sequential form through the decoder structure.

As a result, it is quite difficult to judge the merits and novelty of the paper.\n \nOther issues:\nsome contribution claims highlighted in the Discussion Section, i.e., Section 4, are arguable and should be further extended. For example, the authors claim that the proposed LSTM-based autoencoder networks can be natively scaled up to data with very high dimensionality. I would like the authors to explain it in more details or empirically demonstrate that, since a LSTM-based model could be computationally expensive. As another example, the authors claim that reducing the dimensionality of the output sequence is one of the main contributions of the paper.

It is sourced from a large compressor unit and the names of all sensors are also attached in the appendix. \n\nFor the related works, we've expanded this section a lot. Traditional methods based on DTW (non-NN) have been cited in the paper. Also more recently published NN-based models such as those auto-encoder applications relating to time series, video and audio have been added too.  We have not found any RNN auto-encoder research relating to large-scale industrial sensor like the one we showcase. Closest are the ones relating to wearable sensors (accelerometers + gyroscope, also cited in the updated paper) but the number of dimensions involved is much smaller.\n\nThe benefit of partial reconstruction is not mathematical but purely practical (I also explained this for another reviewer). That reconstruction a selected subset of sensors allows the vector representation to reflect the underlying states of various aspects of the industrial system. Practically, engineers and operators don't need to know whether a machine has failed. Instead, they need to know which part of the machine failed and what kind of failure mode occured (clusters can be found in PCA space of the context vector, which reflects different operating states). This is useful for operators because the raw data is completely unlabelled, by using the proposed approach they can identify the cluster of the current context vector in an on-line setting. Then they can further deduce the operating states of the machine which helps with diasnostic/maintenance.\n\nThe model uses encoder/decoder with three layers.

We source the sensor data from an large-scale industrial compressor situated at a natural gas terminal. Also a summary diagram was added to provide better understanding of the problem.\n\nSecondly, we've added related works (both NN-based algorithms and non-NN works in this area too). We also found that most of the previous related works were about wearable sensors, where the number of sensor measurements are relatively low comparing with the use case we present in this paper. One contribution of the study is that we applied recurrent aut-encoder model on multidimensional time series where the dimensionity is quite high (hundreds on sensors at a large-scale industrial gas compressor) and empirically demonstrate that the vector representation can effectively summarise multidimensional sequences.\n\nThe model specification was also added. Encoder/Decoder have three layers RNN with LSTM neurons and the hidden dimension is 400.\n\nNevertheless we have also repeated the same experiment with a different configuration to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach. The graphical visualisation is added to the main text as example two.\n\nPartial reconstruction of the original sequence is beneficial for two very simple reasons: (1) that it is an easier task; and (2) for large-scale industrial processes it is often very hard to diagnose where the problem comes from. A complete auto-encoder where the full input is reconstructed thru the RNN decoder would simply summarise the entire industrial process.
