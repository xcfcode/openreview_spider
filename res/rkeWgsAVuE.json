This approach is known as \"SPEN\" (Structured Prodection Energy Networks).\n\nTo the opposite of traditional SPENs, this article suggests to combine the energy estimation with a random search; that is, during training, for a given input x, after having computed the optimal output y according to the learned energy landscape, one explores randomly around y to search for solutions leading to better rewards. This information is then used to adapt the energy landscape.\nThis approach is new, to my knowledge, and makes perfect sense. It also fits the workshop topic (no strongly labeled data).\n\nExperiments on a significant task show improvement other methods.\n\nThe paper is nicely written, easy to read, even for complete beginners, despite the 4 page limitation.\n", "rating": "4: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper51/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper51/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Search-Guided, Lightly-Supervised Training of Structured Prediction Energy Networks", "authors": ["Amirmohammad Rooshenas", "Dongxu Zhang", "Gopal Sharma", "Andrew McCallum"], "authorids": ["pedram@cs.umass.edu", "dongxuzhang@cs.umass.edu", "gopalsharma@cs.umass.edu", "mccallum@cs.umass.edu"], "keywords": ["light supervision", "structured prediction", "indirect supervision", "domain knowledge"], "abstract": " In structured output prediction tasks, labeling ground-truth training output is often expensive.
