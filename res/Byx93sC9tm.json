Again, the main difference between the classical ensembles, where one initializes the networks with random initializers (as done by Lakshminarayanan et al. and us as well) and the dropout approach is that our approach of dropout is *not* deterministic. That mask is sampled, so it will have a mask with some given probability. \n\"With dropout, we sample binary variables for every input\npoint and for every network unit in each layer (apart from\nthe last one). Each binary variable takes value 1 with probability\npi for layer i. A unit is dropped (i.e. its value is set\nto zero) for a given input if its corresponding binary variable\ntakes value 0. We use the same values in the backward\npass propagating the derivatives to the parameters.\" \n\nFurthermore, I think one of the best explanations is given in this relatively new paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09208.pdf\n\n2.

Sorry I do not follow the argument. Obviously, fixing the seed of the random number generator leads to a deterministic output of the neural network, but this also holds for dropout. As one can fix the seed for sampling mini-batches or initializing the weights, one can also fix the seed for sampling from the Bernoulli distribution which leads to the exact same dropout mask. Besides that, why does one want to fix the seed for the method by Lakshminarayanan et al. at the first place? So the question why the method by Lakshminarayanan et al. is to be considered a deterministic ensemble technique remains open.\n\n\n2. The paper only compares an ensemble of neural networks where each networks is initialized with different random weights to an ensemble of neural networks where each networks is trained with Dropout MC. It is true that the first method resembles the work by Lakshminarayanan et al. (even though it is not clear whether they use the same proper scoring rule).

It uses random initialization of the neural network parameters as well as random shuffling of the data points to obtain diverse models (see Section 2.4 in the corresponding paper). Furthermore, Lakshminarayanan et al. already mentioned that one also can use other common ensemble techniques such as bagging, however it might lead to suboptimal behavior.\n\n\n* About the novelty * \n\nThe paper only shows that the mode collapse happens for Dropout MC, which apparently leads to overconfident predictions and that ensembles help to cure this. As already said above, this has been investigate by others before (Lakshminarayanan et al.).\n\nThe novel part of the paper, compared to Beluch et al. which showed that ensembles of neural network perform better than a Bayesian neural network trained with Dropout MC, is to also train the individual ensemble components with Dropout MC. I still think the novelty is not sufficient for acceptance and that the paper would be much more convincing if the authors could present a comparison to these existing methods.\n\n\n* About related work *\n\nSorry, I was not very clear about that. What I mean is that there are other active learning settings such as Bayesian optimization or Bandits, where one learns a model while collecting data.

We first refer to your main comments and then answer each point in part. \n\nThe work of Lakshminarayanan et al. indeed showed that deterministic ensembles can improve on the performance of MC-dropout techniques and provides a foundation for ours. And as Beluch et al. (2018) showed, this can be valuable in an active learning setting. However, our work differs in two major ways: \n\ni) We focus on showing the uncertainty representation in these methods suffer from overconfident predictions and that combining the two methods into a stochastic ensemble can be of great benefit and improve on the quality of the uncertainty.\n\nii) We believe the true novelty to be in applying them in an active learning setting, and in particular on a small dataset problem (i.e. the size of the final dataset acquired during AL is only a small fraction of the entire available unlabelled dataset). As you mentioned, data is notoriously scarce and deep learning methods rarely work on small dataset problems. \n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing us to the work of Huand et al. Indeed this is an interesting method that would allow us to most likely achieve similar or better results with less computational overhead. This is definitely something we will consider for future work, but it is somehow out of the main scope of the paper, which was to show the power of combining MC-dropout with ensembles in the active learning setting. Taking into account more advanced ensemble methods is definitely of interest.\nIn terms of the Bayesian Optimization literature, this is definitely of interest if we are to focus on hyper-parameter tuning for our models, but we fail to see the connection of the work you mentioned to our active learning examples. Our focus was not on fine-tuning our models. \n\nIn relation to your specific points, we answer these below: \n\n1) Gal has already showed in his PhD thesis that MC-Dropout almost always performs best in terms of prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality assessment when compared to alternative Bayesian neural network approaches such as Probabilistic Back Prop and other variants of stochastic gradient MCMC methods. The aim of our paper was to improve upon MC-Dropout in the context of active learning, which would invariably translate into better performance w.r.t. other Bayesian NN approaches.\n2) Beluch et al. (2018) showed that going beyond 3 networks in their deterministic ensemble method does not add any significant improvements in terms of performance. Therefore, we used this number when benchmarking against their method.\n3) The aim of the paper was to improve upon the state-of-the-art in active learning for the image classification task. We specifically chose this task due to its relevance to the real world especially in the medical imaging industry. We agree that a more comprehensive study could be done in order to asses the viability of our method for ML tasks other than image classification. As for other neural network architectures, we chose the one used in the benchmarked methods. \n4) Results are averaged over 5 multiple independent runs. We will include both this and confidence scores in a revised version of our paper.

For example, a 10 \\% increase for only 300 samples acquired, could make a huge difference in a critical field where active learning is most valuable.

They empirically show that there exists the mode collapse problem due to the MC dropout which can be regarded as a variational approximation. The authors introduce an ensemble of MC-Dropout models with different initialization to remedy this mode collapse problem. \n\nThe paper is clearly written and easy to follow. It is interesting to empirically show that the mode collapse problem of MC-Dropout is important in active learning. \n \nThe major concern I have is that the ensemble of MC-Dropout models is not an approximation of the posterior anymore. Each MC-Dropout model is an approximation of the posterior, but the ensemble of them may not. Therefore, it is a little misleading to still call it Bayesian active learning. Also, the ensemble of MC-Dropout models does not have the theoretic support from the Bayesian perspective. \n\nThe motivation for the proposed method is to solve the mode collapse problem of MC-Dropout, but using ensemble loses the Bayesian support benefit of MC-Dropout. So it seems not a reasonable solution for the mode collapse problem of MC-Dropout. It is not clear to me why we need to add MC-Dropout to the ensemble. What is the benefit of DEBAL over an ensemble method if both of them do not have Bayesian theoretic support?\n\nIn terms of the empirical results, the better performance of DEBAL compared to a single MC-Dropout model is not supervising as Beluch et al. (2018) already demonstrated that an ensemble is better than a single MC-Dropout.

We demonstrate empirically that our ensemble method yields faster convergence of CNNs trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 \ndatasets.", "keywords": ["Active Learning", "Deep Learning", "Bayesian Neural Networks", "Bayesian Deep Learning", "Ensembles"], "authorids": ["remus.p.pop@gmail.com", "patric.fulop@ed.ac.uk"], "authors": ["Remus Pop", "Patric Fulop"], "TL;DR": "We present a method for Deep Bayesian Active Learning combining MC-Dropout with Ensemble Models", "pdf": "/pdf/9e88fa8e666198b5fce006cde973942d163c6c87.pdf", "paperhash": "pop|deep_ensemble_bayesian_active_learning_adressing_the_mode_collapse_issue_in_monte_carlo_dropout_via_ensembles", "_bibtex": "@misc{\npop2019deep,\ntitle={Deep Ensemble Bayesian Active Learning : Adressing the Mode Collapse issue in Monte Carlo dropout via Ensembles},\nauthor={Remus Pop and Patric Fulop},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byx93sC9tm},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper735/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234388080, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "Byx93sC9tm", "replyto": "Byx93sC9tm", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper735/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335791630, "tmdate": 1552335791630, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper735/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 14}
