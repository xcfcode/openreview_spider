Theoretical analysis of scalability and sample complexity are conducted for cases where both the feature function and the context-to-reward mapping function are linear. Experiments were conducted in both a simulated driving domain and a medical treatment domain to compare the three proposed algorithms empirically. Empirical results for using a deep network as the contextual mapping function is also provided.\n\nAs a special case of IRL for POMDPs, the contextual IRL problem (with latent contexts) is an interesting research topic that is of interest to researchers working on generalizing IRL to a greater range of real-world applications. This paper was written with clarity and detailed descriptions of experiments. The authors presented their algorithms with thorough theoretical analysis. However, further ablation study and proofs are needed to demonstrate the proposed problem formulation and algorithms outperform existing IRL frameworks.\n\nThe authors motivate the problem of COIRL from the formulation of contextual MDP by Hallak et al. (2015). However, the referenced work of Hallak et al. (2015) (published as a preprint on arXiv) does not provide a sufficient argument/evidence for why or in what cases this particular formulation, especially when the context is observed (as assumed by this paper), is better than alternative ones, such as directly modeling the context as part of the state. When a discrete number of contexts exist (as in the simulated driving domain: average vehicle v.s. ambulance), the proposed problem can be reduced to solving a set of normal IRL problems, i.e. learning a reward function under each observed context. For continuous context variables (such as age and weight for patients in the medical treatment domain), an intuitive solution is to model them as part of the state/feature and run normal IRL algorithms. However, the authors did not analyze or show in either of their experiments how existing IRL algorithms compare with the proposed algorithms. Without further explanation, the authors claim, in the fourth paragraph of section 1, that \u201c..Apprenticeship Learning algorithms that try to mimic the expert cannot be used..\u201d, yet it is not trivial to understand why the proposed formulation and algorithms would outperform existing methods/baselines. \n\nLastly, it would be more insightful to the readers if the authors can provide some discussion on how they would extend their algorithms to the more interesting/practical case where the context is not directly observed and analyze how latent contexts would affect the performance/complexity of their proposed algorithms.\n\nOverall, this is a well-written paper on an exciting research topic but lacks sufficient analysis and experimental results to support the significance of the intended contributions.\n\n\nReference (from the paper): \n\nHallak, A., Di Castro, D., & Mannor, S. (2015). Contextual Markov decision processes. arXiv preprint arXiv:1502.02259.\n\n\n==================================\n\n\nEdit after rebuttal period: \n\n- The updated version of the paper includes preliminary results of comparisons with alternative methods and shows that COIRL does have better scalability for modeling problems with large number of observable contexts. It would be great if the authors can show how the baseline performs in the two original experiments as well to understand the improvements gained from adopting COIRL for these problems.\n\n- As stated before, I think COIRL is an exciting research topic on its own. While many recent works on IRL focuses on generalizing to complex problem with deep neural nets as function approximation tools, it is important to analyze the underlying problems from bottom up (in smaller domains and with assumptions that may not always hold) in order to better understand the limits of different solutions. I'd certainly love to see more follow-up works on this topic and how it can be extended to more complex problems.\n\n- Hence, after carefully reading the authors responses and the updated version of the paper, I changed my decision to 'Weak Accept'.\n\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper532/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper532/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Contextual Inverse Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Philip Korsunsky", "Stav Belogolovsky", "Tom Zahavy", "Chen Tessler", "Shie Mannor"], "authorids": ["philip.korsunsky@gmail.com", "stav.belo@gmail.com", "tomzahavy@gmail.com", "chen.tessler@gmail.com", "shie@ee.technion.ac.il"], "keywords": ["Contextual MDP", "Inverse Reinforcement Learning", "Reinforcement Learning", "Mirror Descent"], "TL;DR": "We analyze contextual Markov decision processes in an inverse reinforcement learning setting.

The primary contribution of this work is the formulation of inverse reinforcement learning (for restricted spaces of context-dependent reward functions) as a convex optimization problem.  Based on this formulation, the paper describes several IRL algorithms based on approaches to solving convex and non-convex optimization problems, including variations of mirror descent, and evolution strategies (in principle allowing for the optimization of reward functions with arbitrary parametric representations).  The algorithms presented in this work all assume that computing an optimal policy for a specific reward function is a relatively inexpensive subroutine, which limits their applicability to domains where such planning is straightforward.  Experimental results are presented for a simple highway driving domain, as well as a simulated patient treatment domain constructed from real-world clinical data.\n\nWhile the paper focuses one contextual IRL as its key contribution, the paper fails to sufficiently motivate the contextual IRL problem as a useful specialization of inverse reinforcement learning.  While there are clearly problems where a distinct 'context' can be identified, it isn't clear what advantage is gained by considering the context as a separate set of features, as opposed to treating the context as an additional set of state features which do not change within an episode.  With the latter formulation, many existing approaches to inverse reinforcement learning or imitation learning would be applicable.  The specific formulation of the reward as the product of the context and state features is somewhat more flexible than limiting the reward to linear functions of both, but it would be straightforward to apply the proposed algorithms to the case where the state and context are concatenated, and the reward is a quadratic function of state-context vector.\n\nThe experimental results are not particularly useful in evaluating the proposed algorithms, as the tasks involved are relatively simple, discrete-state MDPs (with continuous state features), and more importantly, no comparisons with existing IRL approaches are provided.

In our paper, we mentioned two examples, Xu et al. (2018), and Fu et al. (2019). We thank the reviewer for providing additional references, and we will be happy to add them in a later revision. At the beginning of Section 5, we have added a theoretical explanation for why learning a contextual policy is an (NP-complete) hard problem from a computational perspective. While this explanation should not deter practitioners from trying to learn such policies (there probably exist many cases where this should be possible), from a theoretical point of view, there also exists cases where learning such a policy should not work. To the best of our knowledge, we provided the first algorithm with theoretical guarantees and final sample complexity in this setting. \n\nMore specifically, the first two papers that the reviewer mentioned (Yunzhu et al. and Babes et al.) do not follow the COIRL problem formulation. The context of this problem is assumed to be hidden or latent. The approach that is taken follows a \"hierarchical\" formulation: at first, a cluster (contexts) is identified, and then a cluster-specific policy is learned for each context. By design, these methods assume a finite context space while our model works in continuous context spaces. The third work by Dipendra et al. learns a policy that is a function of both the context and the state, which we already argued to be NP-hard.\n\nOur approach avoids these difficulties by taking a model-based approach -- learning a reward function that is a function of the context and inferring the reward for each context. \nThe downside of our approach is that we need to compute the optimal policy for each context. However, as we have argued, we focus on the regime where the context space is rich and diverse, and the MDP is relatively small (please see a detailed comment about it in our response to reviewer 4). Thus, from a computational point of view, our approach is highly efficient in this setup (see Section 5 for discussion and examples). \n\nKelvin Xu, Ellis Ratner, Anca Dragan, Sergey Levine, and Chelsea Finn.

While our work is motivated by applications in the medical regime, we believe that the model also fits various web applications such as personalized advertisement, conversational chatbots, etc. All of these problems share the following properties: 1) Planning is essential - there is more than a single decision to make, and the consequences of decisions impact later decisions (in contrast to supervised learning). 2) Planning for a specific user is not that hard -- once the context is known, each MDP is solvable. 3) The user/context space is rich and diverse: there are many different users, and each one of them requires a specialized treatment. \n\nSpecifically, in the dynamic treatment regime, there are many contexts. In our experiments, there are thousands of demonstrations, and each one of these demonstrations corresponds to a unique and different patient (context). \n\nWe would also like to mention that this paper takes a bottom-up approach. We believe that understanding the fundamental mechanics of COIRL in the \u05f4tabular MDP - large context regime\u05f4, theoretically and empirically, will allow us to move forward later to the large MDP regime. In the paper, we demonstrated that our method could be extended to the setting that the mapping from contexts to rewards is nonlinear, and we hope to extend our results to more regimes in future work. Nevertheless, we believe that the \u05f4tabular MDP - large context regime\u05f4  is attractive on its own and has exciting use cases, as we mentioned above. \n\nthe authors"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper532/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper532/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Contextual Inverse Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Philip Korsunsky", "Stav Belogolovsky", "Tom Zahavy", "Chen Tessler", "Shie Mannor"], "authorids": ["philip.korsunsky@gmail.com", "stav.belo@gmail.com", "tomzahavy@gmail.com", "chen.tessler@gmail.com", "shie@ee.technion.ac.il"], "keywords": ["Contextual MDP", "Inverse Reinforcement Learning", "Reinforcement Learning", "Mirror Descent"], "TL;DR": "We analyze contextual Markov decision processes in an inverse reinforcement learning setting.

In the case of IRL, the dynamics are usually learned from samples before an IRL/AL algorithm is used (as in MWAL/Abeel&Ng). In COIRL, we can use the same method in [1] to learn the contextual dynamics before to the inverse learning step, in which we use the dynamics to calculate feature expectations for all contexts (which is the only place where the dynamics are needed). Our algorithms are otherwise unaffected by contextual dynamics. For these reasons, we consider estimating the dynamics to be an orthogonal/precursory problem, but we will happy to change/make this comment more clear. \n\nSafety-critical applications. \nWhile constantly reviewing AI systems' actions is impractical, we believe that in such safety-critical applications it is actually essential in the foreseeable future. In the medical treatment regime using ML without doctor supervision is not likely to happen soon. Compared to what is currently being introduced in the industry - doctors using ML-powered tools, e.g. detection of cancerous growths in images - our method does shift the load and responsibility slightly towards the agent.\nWe would also like to comment that the subgradient based algorithms do not require such supervision so essentially, if this supervision is not a constraint, they should be preferred,\n\nFinally, we believe that our methods can be extended to problems that do not necessarily have a tabular state space and where the dynamics are unknown. This can be achieved, for example, by using DRL algorithm to compute the optimal policy for each context while a different network is learning the mapping from contexts to rewards.

The reviewer had concerns regarding the scalability of the COIRL algorithms and the lack of comparison with existing IRL methods. Let us address those issues. \n\nScalability.\n\nBy formulating the COIRL problem as a convex optimization problem we were able to derive subgradient based algorithms. We analyzed those algorithms in the linear case (for which we developed theoretical guarantees), but we would like to refer the reviewer to the experiments that we performed in the nonlinear setup using DNNs (figure 2). In these experiments, the subgradient of the loss is computed (instead of a gradient) and the rest of the DNN is differentiated with backpropagation. In addition, following the reviewer's response, we performed an additional experiment with a nonlinear mapping (but now in the offline medical regime), which can be found on the new version of the paper  (figure 4, and a short paragraph below it). We would like to point out that the theoretical derivation of the subgradient allowed us to make the extension to DNNs in a straight forward manner. We view the \"move\" from a theoretical understanding of the COIRL problem to a DNN implementation to be of high novelty and importance. \n\nAs the COIRL problem is new,  we believe that formulating and providing theoretical guarantees to it is highly important. Considering the discrete state space MDP was crucial for comparing the sample complexity results with those of previous IRL/AL papers. Finally, from a theoretical point of view, introducing the exponential weights algorithm allowed us to obtain algorithms that scale well to problems with high dimensional feature and context spaces and also makes the COIRL problem to be computationally comparable with standard IRL. \n\nComparison with existing IRL methods. \nWe have added a section in which we compare COIRL to IRL in a large MDP (section 3.4). In particular, we discuss how the contextual model significantly reduces the cost of the inner loop (in which an optimal policy is computed). This is what makes the COIRL feasible in high-dimensional problems where standard IRL algorithms may fail due to this exact issue.\nIn the new section mentioned previously, we provide a comparison with standard IRL in order to highlight the advantages of COIRL. We will also add simulations for this large MDP model shortly. \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper532/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper532/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Contextual Inverse Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Philip Korsunsky", "Stav Belogolovsky", "Tom Zahavy", "Chen Tessler", "Shie Mannor"], "authorids": ["philip.korsunsky@gmail.com", "stav.belo@gmail.com", "tomzahavy@gmail.com", "chen.tessler@gmail.com", "shie@ee.technion.ac.il"], "keywords": ["Contextual MDP", "Inverse Reinforcement Learning", "Reinforcement Learning", "Mirror Descent"], "TL;DR": "We analyze contextual Markov decision processes in an inverse reinforcement learning setting.

They  propose different algorithms for learning the function and evaluate their algorithms on a driving simulator and a sepsis treatment problem (based on real data from the MIMIC corpus).\n\nI think this is a good paper, studying an interesting problem and proposing useful solutions, so it should be accepted. The paper could be improved by putting more focus on the presentation of the studied problem and its variants (also the ones the authors mention their approach is easy to generalize to) and reducing a little the focus on the algorithm. In total they propose three algorithms and give convergence guarantees for all of them. Of course this analysis is important but I found it somewhat distracting from the main flow of the paper. Maybe these guarantees could be moved into a separate section.\n\nA few more points:\n* Please comment on why you see estimating contextual transition dynamics as an orthogonal problem.\n* In the last paragraph of the conclusion you talk about a safety critical application. For which applications do you think this is practical? I would assume that constantly reviewing of an AI systems' actions is very impractical. (But I agree on these aspects being important.)\n* One of the main limitations of this work seems to be that the CMDP\\M has to be known. Please comment on how one could expand the analysis/applications/experiments to extend to the case where the CMDP is not known.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper532/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper532/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Contextual Inverse Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Philip Korsunsky", "Stav Belogolovsky", "Tom Zahavy", "Chen Tessler", "Shie Mannor"], "authorids": ["philip.korsunsky@gmail.com", "stav.belo@gmail.com", "tomzahavy@gmail.com", "chen.tessler@gmail.com", "shie@ee.technion.ac.il"], "keywords": ["Contextual MDP", "Inverse Reinforcement Learning", "Reinforcement Learning", "Mirror Descent"], "TL;DR": "We analyze contextual Markov decision processes in an inverse reinforcement learning setting.
