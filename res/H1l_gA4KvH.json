Of course, the proposed approach is quite a bit faster. However, the paper does not provide a sense of whether these values are actually useful. In practice, would one want to wait longer to get a better quality result, or are the numbers obtained with the proposed approach usable? \n\nWe emphasize that zero-order methods are not baselines from previously published work but are our proposed methods. It is also important to note that zero-order and Taylor 1 (Deep Surrogate Model) are complementary, meaning they can work together in a hybrid fashion. We show in the appendix such results where we alternate between using zero-th order and Taylor-1 depending on the descent trajectory. See Algorithm A, Table 3 and Figure 4 for the details. This hybrid strategy provides the best computational time /accuracy tradeoff.  \n\nIt is worth mentioning that even without the hybrid strategy, configurations produced by our approach including Taylor-1 are practically usable. We consider for this purpose as a baseline configuration with no pores (kappa_reference=1 W/m/K), Taylor-1 produces configurations that give roughly 20-fold reduction of thermal conductivity (kappa/kappa_reference=0.05) with respect to the case with no pores, while controlling the mechanical stability. This may translate into promising nanostructured thermoelectric materials  in practice (See Mildred S. Dresselhaus et al 2007).\n\nNew Directions for Low\u2010Dimensional Thermoelectric Materials.

We provide a general response and address each reviewer separately point by point below.\n\nWe motivate the problem from the physical design standpoint because the black-box nature is appealing in the context in which constraints are solutions to complex and expensive PDE solvers. However, our framework is generally applicable to other tasks. We give two such examples: (i) in the black-blox adversarial learning, the gradient of the classifier is not available while the number of evaluations/queries is limited. Our approach can be used to generate a diverse set of adversarial examples (assuming we have samples to train the surrogate model) (see Srinivasan et al 2019); (ii) sampling under black box knowledge constraints where the likelihood and its gradient are not available is ubiquitous beyond the inverse design problem we consider. See for example learning under constraints (Hu et al 2018). \n\nWe note that both zero-order and surrogate deep models for Langevin sampling are our own contributions in the constrained setting. Apart from the application side, we make a concrete theoretical contribution by corroborating our approach with convergence analysis.\n\nWe made the following updates to our manuscript following the reviewers\u2019 suggestions:\n\n1. Added the lower bound to the step size in Theorem 2 for S-PMLC as pointed by the Reviewer 1 and its Corollary.\n\n2. Added a hybrid method using zero-order and Taylor-1 surrogate model, that alternates between gradient-free and gradient of the surrogate depending on the decrease in the potential function (Objective). This hybrid strategy offers the best trade-off in accuracy and computation. The details can be found in Appendix A with results in Table 3 and Figure 4.\n\n3.

It should be mentioned that the work of Shen et al. (2019) deals with the unconstrained case that can not be directly applied to our problem of interest. \n\nQ2: \u201cOverall it\u2019s hard to comment on the tightness of the analysis as the non-error versions are also unclear of the tightness of the bounds... Overall the theory in this part seems very loose in terms of bounds as exponential factors in dimensions start to appear and in that regard seems quite preliminary but it\u2019s hard to comment on whether its natural or can be improved.\u201d\n\nPlease note that in our bounds we inherit this dependency on dimension from the white box sampling as shown in Bubek et al and in Brosse and Moulines. It is hard to improve on those bounds in the black box setting, since our gradient free methods or the surrogate models are approximations of the white box setting. \n\nQ3: \u201cNevertheless the paper is a little lacking of novelty in the sense that it brings together many existing ideas and provides an analysis of the effect of bringing them together but none of the theory significantly improves over the existing theory.\u201d\n \nWe clarify here that our main innovation in this paper is (i) formulating the constraint satisfaction problem as a sampling from a Boltzmann distribution; (ii) proposing constrained gradient free methods (zero-order) and surrogate models for the black-box sampling problem. We analyzed our proposed methods. Even though we don\u2019t improve on the existing theory in the white box sampling (when the potential of the Boltzmann distribution is known), we present novel methods backed with a theory for the black-box sampling case that was not studied before in the constrained setting. Black-box sampling is of practical interest in many situations such as  inverse design that we consider or adversarial robustness. See also general comment for other applications. \n\nQ4: \u201cRegarding theorem 1 SPLMC convergence  (and corollaries of the theorem) -  I find it surprising that there is no lower bound assumption on eta in terms of K - only an upper bound. This seems wrong particularly as the theorem as stated then allows eta to be set extremely small while K is finite, in which case there should be no convergence theorems at all. The condition on eta should be a theta(f (K)) for some f type of condition like in the second part of the theorem. I would suggest the authors to look into the theorem - or clarify why this is the case.\u201d\n\nGreat catch. We agree that the step size \\eta should have a lower bound. More precisely, in part 1 of Theorem 2 (S-PLMC), from Bubeck et al. \\eta in \\Theta(R^2/K), the step size must be lower bounded by R^2/K up to some constant. We have fixed this in the manuscript. Thanks! \n\n\nQ5: \u201cI am confused by the presentation of Shi et al results as there is no penalty appearing for the approximation error due to an RKHS, only a finite sample penalty. Does the result assume that phi belongs to the function class of the RKHS in question?

The result of this multi objective optimization problem can be also used to further investigate different configurations in different tasks  (generalization via pareto front sampling)?\u201d\n\nIndeed, multi-objective Bayesian optimization is related to our approach and we discussed this in our paper (See Remark 1). However, while Bayesian optimization can produce one single optimal configuration at a time, our method produces a set of candidates. In most applications after the optimal configuration(s) is produced, it is tested in silico or in wet lab to assess its optimality. Sampling approach allows having a ranked set of optimal configurations, which gives the designer the choice to choose among the ones that work the best in reality.  \n\nQ2: \u201cThe authors note that their approach is closely related to Shen et al. (2019). However, there is no algorithmic comparison in the experiments. Can the work of Shen et al. (2019) also be applied to the constraint setting?\u201d\n\nShen et al. 2019 approach is not applicable to the constrained setting. The need of the projection step or the proximal step is crucial for the constrained setting, which is not used in Shen et al 2019. Indeed, zero-order projected and proximal Langevin are one of the main contributions of our paper.\n\nQ3: \u201cHow crucial or restricting is the assumption of log-concave and smooth target distributions? Which constraint satisfaction problems fall into this class? Can you provide some examples?\u201d\n\nThe log-concave and smoothness assumptions are  standard and  crucial for the  analysis of Langevin sampling (see Bubek et al, Moulines et al). Note also that these are standard assumptions in convex optimization. Showing that the zero order methods and surrogate models converge in this setting is a first sanity check for the validity of our approach, and this was assumed also for example in Shen et al 2019 for the unconstrained setting. \n\nIn our nano-porous design application, both constraints, which are solutions to PDE solvers, are neither smooth nor log-concave. Raginsky et al extended  the analysis to the non convex case for the unconstrained Langevin. Extending their analysis to the constrained case is non-trivial and is beyond the scope of our paper, but is indeed an important direction for future work.  \n\nNon-convex Learning via stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics: a non asymptotic analysis. Maxim Raginsky, Sasha Rakhlin, Matus Telgarsky.\n\n\nQ4: \u201cThe authors use for approximating the gradients a neural network with 4 hidden layers (with 128, 72, 64 and 32 ReLU neurons) and fine tune the networks in a grid search manny. Which parameters were fine tuned? What were the input and output dimensions. I assume 10 kappa and 10 sigma values were the predicted outputs in individual networks.\u201d\n\nWe mainly fine-tuned the learning rate and decay. The fine-tuning description was hidden by Figure 1 at the end of page 8 in our previous version.\n\nThe input dimension is 110, including 20 (x, y)-coordinates of 10 pores and 90 pairwise pore-pore distances along x-axis and y-axis. For each input pattern, we use one network to estimate electrical conductivity value and the other network for mechanical conductivity. Hence, the output is a scalar.\n\n\u201cMinor Issues\u201d\nThank you for your careful reading.

They consider the specific situation where the constraints are a solution of a complicated PDE solver and hence the derivatives or specific functional forms of the constraint cannot be obtained. They repose the problem as sampling from a Gibbs distribution whose potential contains constraints as penalties in a Lagrangian fashion. They now wish to sample from the Gibbs distribution using Langevin diffusion.  The Langevin process requires a derivative of the gradient. The setting does not allow for that and therefore the authors propose two approaches - \n\n1. Constructing the gradient from zeroth order entries of a gaussian smoothed potential (much like works of Nesterov et al on zero order optimization). \n2. Using a parameteric function class (like an RKHS or a neural network) to learn a function which well approximates the gradient of the constraints as well given zeroth order constraint evaluations. \n\nFor the latter, the authors propose two approaches. Hermite learning which directly approximates the error on the gradient as well as the function evaluation. However this involves a separate estimate of the gradient (via a zero order approach such as Gaussian smoothing). An alternative which seems more sample efficient is to do direct learning from zero order samples by penalizing first-order Taylor approximation between given points. \n\nThe authors provide a theoretical analysis of the all the approaches and sub-approaches given above and further provide experiments to evaluate this on a problem from material design. I am not at all familiar with the domain of the experiments to comment on competing approaches. As far as I can see the authors also compare only their own proposed algorithms which are many. I will focus on the theoretical analysis which seems to form the bulk of the paper anyway. \n\nThe theoretical analysis seems quite rigorous as it begins by first providing a basic guarantee for constrained langevin sampling when gradients are computed with error. The non error gradient part of this analysis has been established before and the authors mention the references appropriately. I have a couple of questions regarding the precise statements of the theorem that i will ask towards the end of the review. Overall its hard to comment on the tightness of the analysis as the non-error versions are also unclear of the tightness of the bounds. Nevertheless the bounds achieved do not look much worse than the non-error counterparts and are easy to implement. The rest of the bounds focus on achieving low error in approximation of the gradients in various settings. Overall the theory in this part seems very loose in terms of bounds as exponential factors in dimensions start to appear and in that regard seems quite preliminary but its hard to comment on whether its natural or can be improved. \n\nOverall the paper is a rigorous treatment of multiple components that would go into the problem of sampling zero order constrained sets and merges many ideas which can all be useful. Nevertheless the paper is a little lacking of novelty in the sense that it brings together many existing ideas and provides an analysis of the effect of bringing them together but none of the theory significantly improves over the existing theory.\n\nSome questions I have regarding the theorem statements \n\nRegarding theorem 1 SPLMC convergence  (and corollaries of the theorem) -  I find it surprising that there is no lower bound assumption on eta in terms of K - only an upper bound. This seems wrong particularly as the theorem as stated then allows eta to be set extremely small while K is finite, in which case there should be no convergence theorems at all. The condition on eta should be a theta(f (K)) for some f type of condition like in the second part of the theorem. I would suggest the authors to look into the theorem - or claify why this is the case. \n\nI am confused by the presentation of the Shi et al results as there is no penalty appearing for the approximation error due to an RKHS, only a finite sample penalty. Does the result assume that phi belongs to the function class of the RKHS in question? Probably yes and in that case that should be specified. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper934/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper934/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Surrogate-Based Constrained Langevin Sampling With Applications to Optimal Material Configuration Design", "authors": ["Thanh V Nguyen", "Youssef Mroueh", "Samuel C.

These approximations improve the computational efficiency by a factor of 17  compared to related black box sampling approaches (Shen et al.). \nAs a non-domain expert I cannot evaluate the importance of the contributions or the complexity of the tasks. However, given the well written and clearly structured presentation, the theoretical proofs and the generality of the constraint solver (with learned approximated gradients), I would vote for accepting the paper. \n\nOpen questions:\n- How does the approach relate to \"multi-objective Bayesian optimization\". The result of this multi objective optimization problem can be also used to further investigate different configurations in different tasks  (generalization via pareto front sampling)?\n\n- The authors note that their approach is closely related to Shen et al. (2019). However, there is no algorithmic comparison in the experiments. Can the work of Shen et al. (2019) also be applied to the constraint setting? \n\n- How crucial or restricting is the assumption of log-concave and smooth target distributions? Which constraint satisfaction problems fall into this class? Can you provide some examples?  \n\n- The authors use for approximating the gradients a neural network with 4 hidden layers (with 128, 72, 64 and 32 ReLU neurons) and fine tune the networks in a grid search manny. Which parameters were fine tuned? What were the input and output dimensions. I assume 10 kappa and 10 sigma values were the predicted outputs in individual networks. \n\nMinor Issues:\n- Some paragraph titles to no end with a dot, e.g., \"Optimization approaches\" in page 8\n- The last sentence in page 8 is incomplete. \n- The computational speed up is a factor of 17 (page 9) or 15 (page 10)?\n- Typo in page 13: after the target output is properly normalization"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper934/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper934/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Surrogate-Based Constrained Langevin Sampling With Applications to Optimal Material Configuration Design", "authors": ["Thanh V Nguyen", "Youssef Mroueh", "Samuel C.

Consider, for example, the trade-off between thermal resistance, electrical conductivity, and mechanical stability needed to design a nano-porous template with optimal thermoelectric efficiency.  To that end, we leverage the posterior regularization framework andshow that this constraint satisfaction problem can be formulated as sampling froma Gibbs distribution.  The main challenges come from the black-box nature ofthose physical constraints, since they are obtained via solving highly non-linearPDEs. To overcome those difficulties, we introduce Surrogate-based Constrained Langevin dynamics for black-box sampling. We explore two surrogate approaches. The first approach exploits zero-order approximation of gradients in the Langevin Sampling and we refer to it as Zero-Order Langevin. In practice, this approach can be prohibitive since we still need to often query the expensive PDE solvers. The second approach approximates the gradients in the Langevin dynamics with deep neural networks, allowing us an efficient sampling strategy using the surrogate model. We prove the convergence of those two approaches when the target distribution is log-concave and smooth.
