The authors did the \"dirty job\" of running all the experiments all over again in a fair setting, without making model selection on the test set, showing that many of current \"SOTA\"s in point cloud processing do not really deserve this definition. \n\nI find very unjust the decision of rejecting this article solely on the fact that it has no academic novelty, since\n\n 1. as shown by this very paper, many works that were considered \"novelty\" perform at most on par with simple baselines such as multi-view camera;\n 2. this paper wouldn't have been written if researchers had followed the good ol' academic principles, such as not selecting the model that best performed on the test set.\n\nThe AC argued that this article highlights the problem without giving a solution. This is also untrue, since the author propose multiple protocols for a fair experimental setting, providing the possible combinations of models, data augmentations and loss functions, that researchers in the future can adopt to obtain a *comparable* result with the current, revised and *retested* \"SOTA\". They also *suggest*  which protocol is the best one and should be followed, contrarily to what is stated in the AC comment.\n\nR2 suggests that this could be better suited as a technical report. I agree, in the sense that this could be a good technical report, but this is not a good point for rejecting this article, in my opinion. First, there are other examples of articles like this, even one published in this very conference: in [1], the authors showed that a simple MLP baseline over-perform most GNN models. Second, providing a new \"ranking\" of the current models is of great importance to novel research, since new valid works in the same field might not be published since they do not stand against unfair results.\n\nLastly, but not by importance, I find very unjust the decision of the AC to reject this paper after 3/4 of the reviewers voted for an accept, with 7-7-7-4. Although it might be the right thing to do in some circumstances, going against the decision of a committee should be accompanied by a solid motivation. The only point of the AC in their comment is that the experiments alone are not enough for carry the paper, even though the authors empirically prove their point that a simple baseline beats the current state-of-the-art. \n\n[1] F.

Substantial experiments are conducted to show how the auxiliary factors affect the evaluation results and the proposed method can perform at similar level compared with state-of-the-art methods.\n\nOn the whole, I think this is a good paper as it addresses one of the most important problem of current research in point cloud classification.  We need to distinguish what actually brings the performance improvement: is it the evaluation scheme or the new model architecture itself. Extensive experiments show that 1) different methods indeed use different protocols and 2) data augmentation, loss function, voting play important role in the model performance. It's valuable to know what kind of data augmentation and loss function can improve performance generally in controlled setting. The paper is well written, rigorous and easy to follow.

Is it because RSCNN/DGCNN use feedback from test set?\n(2)For performance in Table 6,  do you train the the state-of-the-art method with the same protocol for SimpleView?\n(3)Have you tried what the performance would be given different amount of data for different architecture under same protocol?\n(4)For other more sophisticated operations in related projection-based methods, have you tried to see if they are useful under same protocol?\n\n--------\nAfter discussion:\n\nAfter reading the author's response as well as the opinions from other reviewers, I will stick to my original rating.

The author(s) also show a simple projection based baseline SimpleView that can work surprisingly well on point cloud classification task. They evaluate methods on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets.\n-----------------\nPros:\n1. The paper is well written and easy to follow.\n2. The author(s) conduct detailed break-downs on the evaluation protocols used by various modern point processing models, which I think is valuable to research on point cloud data. It is also surprising that factors beyond architecture design can make such a difference in the evaluation. I think following the same evaluation protocol can be very helpful for subsequent research. This also indicates evaluating point processing models solely on ModelNet40 might not be a good practice since it poses bias to some augmentation/architecture, which might be false if models are applied in real-world data. These messages are worth to be known by the community.\n3. The author(s) also show that a surprisingly simple baseline that makes use of different view projections can work quite well on point cloud object detection.\n-----------------\nCons:\n1. It would be nice if the author(s) can include some failure mode analysis on different models. Since the SimpleView does not operate directly on point clouds, it might have distinctive failure modes compared with other models. It might be helpful for designing point cloud processing models in the future.\n2. It is unsure how such projection-based methods, like the MVCNN and SimpleView, handle larger scenes (e.g. with covered objects or a scene scan in autonomous driving scenarios) and per-point tasks such as part segmentations.\n-----------------\nMisc:\n1.

Through extensive experiments, this paper reveals that there seem no real improvements due to the proposed model architecture in the last two years and all performance improvements come from the training/testing setup and hyperparameter tuning. \n\nPaper Strengths:\n1. This paper provides important findings of the source of performance improvements in the domain of point cloud classification. If the findings are correct, it will imply that many efforts prior work has been put in terms of innovating new network architecture are not very effective as we expected, sometimes might be less useful than using a better training/testing protocol. \n2. The presentation (language and logic) of the paper is clear (though part of the reason is that there is no involving technical description ), I really enjoy reading this paper, and I appreciate the authors for their efforts.\n3. The provided experiments are really extensive, with 7 tables and 2 datasets, which makes the findings quite convincing. \n\nPaper Weaknesses:\n1. As this paper has written, there is no scientific novelty in the paper. In my mind, It is totally okay to not propose any new method/architecture but it would be nice to see a solution to the revealed problem. Specifically, this paper has revealed an important problem that prior work in innovating network architecture does not seem to clearly bring improvements. However, there is no clear solution/direction proposed in the paper to this problem. What should we do as a community next? Should researchers in point cloud classification stop innovating these useless and sophisticated network architectures? Should we just limit our research by exploring different types of data augmentation? I would guess the answer to these questions is no. But then, what should we do? It would be nice if the paper can bring further insight into this direction\n2. The paper\u2019s findings/claims are mostly based on experiments, so it would be nice if the paper can release its code to be used by the community and validate if it is really true that the efforts put in neural network architecture are not useful in terms of performance in point cloud classification. Without careful validation by the community, the strong claim made in this paper could be misleading and discouraging further research for innovating new approaches in this domain\n3. Although many quantitative experiments are provided, it would be nice if this paper can add more qualitative analysis to help readers understand where the improvements are. \n4. I believe there are 100+ methods proposed in the recent 3 years at many conferences/journals for point cloud processing and classification, but only 4 are evaluated in this paper. It would be nice if the authors can add more representative baselines to validate the claims in order to double confirm if it is true that there is no performance gain from the architecture side. It might be possible that the claim is true within the compared 4 baselines and there might be other methods which really improves performance solely because they have a better network\n\nDetailed Comments\n1. It might be good to combine the third contribution in the introduction with the second one?\n2. In the section of \u201cour protocol\u201d, this paper uses the fixed set of 1024 points instead of re-sampling different points at each epoch. Why? As the paper described, using the re-sampling point strategy can effectively increase the training dataset of points, which is good. It would be nice to justify why not using such a good strategy. Also, this strategy is fair unlike the one using feedback from the test set which is kind of cheating. \n3. In the section of \u201cgenerating depth images from point cloud\u201d, this paper uses two strategies, one using the minimum depth of all points which makes sense to me. But the latter one which uses a weighted average of depth does not seem to be reasonable as it is essentially creating imaginary non-existing points which correspond to the averaged depth\n\nJustification:\n\nMy decision is made mainly because I feel the findings in this paper are important and need to be shared with the community. Sometimes, people care too much about novelty and try to design more and more sophisticated networks. If it turns out these innovative networks do not really bring performance gain, we need to re-think what we should do. However, there are spaces to be improved in this paper as I pointed out above. It would be nice to see some revision in the final version if the paper is accepted, including potential solutions/directions about where we should go and more analysis (qualitative and baselines) to support the claim.\n\nPost-rebuttal review\n\nAfter reading the authors' responses and other reviews, I would like to stick to my original rating to accept this paper. Though there are minor problems that I still have concerns (e.g., why not using re-sampling for all methods which is a better strategy than using fixed points), I am satisfied with the responses to my primary concerns about the paper. \n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper59/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper59/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Revisiting Point Cloud Classification with a Simple and Effective Baseline", "authorids": ["~Ankit_Goyal1", "~Hei_Law2", "~Bowei_Liu2", "~Alejandro_Newell2", "~Jia_Deng1"], "authors": ["Ankit Goyal", "Hei Law", "Bowei Liu", "Alejandro Newell", "Jia Deng"], "keywords": ["3D Vision", "Point Cloud Processing"], "abstract": "Processing point cloud data is an important component of many real-world systems.

Since the SimpleView does not operate directly on point clouds, it might have distinctive failure modes compared with other models. It might be helpful for designing point cloud processing models in the future.\u201d**\n\nThanks for the suggestion. We now add qualitative analysis in the paper. We show examples of examples where both SimpleView and PointNet++ fail, as well as examples where one of them fails and the other succeeds. Qualitatively, we find that the failure modes of SimpleView and PointNet++ are similar. We also find that a major failure mode in both SimpleView and PointNet++ is the confusion between the \u2018flower_pot\u2019 and \u2018plant\u2019 category, which could be because of lack of color information.\n\n**\u201cIt is unsure how such projection-based methods, like the MVCNN and SimpleView, to handle larger scenes (e.g. with covered objects or a scene scan in autonomous driving scenarios) and per-point tasks such as part segmentations.\u201d**\n\nActually, prior works have used projection-based methods for segmentation in large scenes, which suggests that projection-based methods could handle large scenes and per-point tasks. Although, these methods have been relatively more involved than SimpleView. Some notable ones are [1] and [2], which we also referred to in our paper. In [1], the point cloud density is used to create scene meshes, which are then rendered at different scales using a mesh renderer. In [2], a scene point cloud is rederered for different modalities like color, depth and surface normal. Information from multiple modalities is then fused to generate the point-wise predictions.\n\n[1] Alexandre Boulch, Bertrand Le Saux, and Nicolas Audebert.

We chose a fixed set because it is the setting used by the very initial works (PointNet and PointNet++) that established the point cloud classification.

The depth of the points on the surface is averaged to get the depth at a pixel location. Though other strategies could be used, we find the weighted average strategy to be simple, efficient and effective (it works slightly better than the minimum depth strategy on the validation set).

It is encouraging that you found our work impactful and important; our paper very clear and well presented; and our experiments extensive and convincing. We address your concerns below: \n\n**\u201cthere is no clear solution/direction proposed in the paper to this problem. What should we do as a community next? Should researchers in point cloud classification stop innovating these useless and sophisticated network architectures? Should we just limit our research by exploring different types of data augmentation? I would guess the answer to these questions is no. But then, what should we do? It would be nice if the paper can bring further insight into this direction\u201d**\n\nThanks for the suggestion. We added a discussion in the revised version (under Sec. 5) describing what we believe could be a future direction for point cloud classification. \n\nSpecifically, our results show that for future progress we should control for protocols while comparing network architectures. Our code base could serve as a useful resource for developing new models and comparing them with prior works. Our results show that the existing evidence for point-based methods is not as strong when auxiliary factors are properly controlled for, and that SimpleView is a strong baseline. But our results are not meant to discourage future research on point-based methods. It is still entirely possible that point-based methods come out ahead with additional innovations. We believe it is beneficial to explore competing approaches, including the ones that are underperforming at a particular time,  as long as the results are compared in a controlled manner. \n\n**Release the code**\n\nYes we will open-source our code.\n\n**\u201cAlthough many quantitative experiments are provided, it would be nice if this paper can add more qualitative analysis to help readers understand where the improvements are.\u201d**\n\nThanks for the suggestion. We have now added qualitative analysis in the paper (a revised version has been uploaded). We show examples where both SimpleView and PointNet++ fail, as well as examples where one of them fails and the other succeeds. Qualitatively, we find that the failure modes of SimpleView and PointNet++ are similar. We also find that a major failure mode in both SimpleView and PointNet++ is the confusion between the \u2018flower_pot\u2019 and \u2018plant\u2019 category, which can be due to lack of color information.\n\n**\u201cIt would be nice if the authors can add more representative baselines to validate the claims in order to double confirm if it is true that there is no performance gain from the architecture side. It might be possible that the claim is true within the compared 4 baselines and there might be other methods which really improves performance solely because they have a better network\u201d**\n\nThanks for the suggestion. In the revised version, we have expanded Table 7 to add comparisons with more methods. Most of the models are officially implemented in Tensorflow or Caffe while our codebase is in Pytorch. So given the time constraints, we could not reimplement the baselines ourselves and hence we use the reported numbers in the papers. We make comparisons to these methods by using the information provided in the papers and analyzing the official code. For each of these methods, we identify the protocol they used and compare their reported performance to SimpleView and PointNet++ in the closest protocol we evaluated. We can see that both SimpleView and PointNet++ perform as well as or better than prior methods, which corroborates  our conclusions.\n\n**\u201cIt might be good to combine the third contribution in the introduction with the second one?\u201d**\n\nThanks for the suggestion. We combine the third and second contributions in the revised version."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper59/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper59/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Revisiting Point Cloud Classification with a Simple and Effective Baseline", "authorids": ["~Ankit_Goyal1", "~Hei_Law2", "~Bowei_Liu2", "~Alejandro_Newell2", "~Jia_Deng1"], "authors": ["Ankit Goyal", "Hei Law", "Bowei Liu", "Alejandro Newell", "Jia Deng"], "keywords": ["3D Vision", "Point Cloud Processing"], "abstract": "Processing point cloud data is an important component of many real-world systems.

It is encouraging that you found our work valuable. Following we address your concerns:\n\n**\u201cAlthough such detailed reviews over the training protocols are helpful, the authors failed to propose any novel methods or evaluation metrics\u201d;  \u201cThis paper lacks academic insights and novelty, making it more like a technical report.\u201d;  \u201cI will consider it as a valuable technical report, instead of an appropriate academic paper for ICLR.\u201d**\n\t\nWe respectfully disagree that our paper lacks academic insights and novelty. Our paper presents two surprising findings that were not present in the current literature  and contradict conventional wisdom.\n\nFirst, we show that auxiliary factors independent of network architecture make a huge difference in performance and obscure the effect of novel architecture. This goes against the perception that improvement in performance is primarily due to novel architectures. Second, we show that a very simple projection based method outperforms sophisticated point based models, which challenges the assumption in the field that point based methods are superior choices for point cloud classification.\n\nWe respectfully disagree that the lack of a novel method or evaluation metric is necessarily a reason for rejection. There are different kinds of research contributions warranting publication. Proposing a novel method or metric is only one of them. A novel method or metric has never been a requirement for acceptance to ML conferences, in particular ICLR. \n\nIn fact, papers similar to ours, which do not  propose any novel method or metric, but uncover important results by revisiting prior work, have been accepted to ICLR and other top-tier ML venues. For example, Melis et al. [1], in their ICLR 2017 paper, reevaluate neural methods in NLP and show how LSTMs outperform more recent methods.  Similarly, Dhillon et al. [2], in their ICLR 2019 paper, show how a simple baseline that remained mostly unnoticed outperforms many sophisticated few-shot algorithms. Similar papers which revisit the past progress and/or propose simple and effective baselines have also been published at other top-tier ML venues [3, 4].\n\n[1] Melis, G\u00e1bor, Chris Dyer, and Phil Blunsom. \"On the state of the art of evaluation in neural language models.\" ICLR (2017).\n\n[2] Dhillon, Guneet S., Pratik Chaudhari, Avinash Ravichandran, and Stefano Soatto. \"A baseline for few-shot image classification.\" ICLR (2019).\n\n[3] Martinez, Julieta, Rayat Hossain, Javier Romero, and James J. Little. \"A simple yet effective baseline for 3d human pose estimation.\" ICCV (2017).\n\n[4] Musgrave, Kevin, Serge Belongie, and Ser-Nam Lim. \"A metric learning reality check.\" ECCV (2020).\n\n**\u201cIn practice, when we evaluate or re-implement these deep point cloud networks, we naturally attempt to add and remove some basic tricks. I believe there are a lot of people already knowing what has been explored in this paper.\u201d**\n\nWe respectfully disagree that our results are widely known in the community. If the auxiliary factors we identified are widely known to significantly improve performance, we should expect them to be adopted or controlled for in most papers, especially the more recent ones, but evidence from existing papers suggests the opposite. For example: \n\n- One of our findings is that using the smooth loss can significantly improve performance. However, among the approaches we considered, only DGCNN used this smooth loss, and none of the earlier works (PointNet, PointNet++, PointCNN) and the later ones (RSCNN, DensePoint, Point-ASNL) used it. No paper mentioned it, including the DGCNN paper itself. We only found out through the open source code of DGCNN. \n\n- One of our findings is that removing the rotation augmentation used by earlier works (PointNet, PointNet++) significantly improves performance. Many recent methods (DGCNN, RSCNN, DensePoint) do not use rotation augmentation, but do not control for it when making comparisons with earlier works.\n\n- One of our findings is that in many recent methods (DGCNN, RSCNN, DensePoint), the model is evaluated on the test set after every epoch during training and the model with the best test performance is used for evaluation. However, in many earlier methods (PointNet, PointNet++) only the model after the last training epoch is used for evaluation. We find that this difference in the evaluation scheme makes a significant difference in performance, but we do not find any mention of controlling for this factor in the published papers.\n\nFinally, even if our results were widely known to experts, the fact that they are not apparent from existing literature would indicate a serious issue, making it even more valuable to have our paper published. We believe it would be troubling  and counterproductive if  important facts were  widely known to specialists but could not  be found by non-specialists through reading published papers.

As claimed, earlier work like PointNet++ can still achieve comparable performance to more recent methods. Such observations are useful, as different methods are supposed to be developed and measured under a unified setting. Moreover, the authors investigated a new projection-based SimpleView method by converting point clouds into depth images, achieving SOTA performance without pretrained CNNs.\n\nAlthough such detailed reviews over the training protocols are helpful, the authors failed to propose any novel methods or evaluation metrics (notice the SimpleView is also a commonly used methods in other multi-view framework), resulting in relatively inadequate novelty and originality. In practice, when we evaluate or re-implement these deep point cloud networks, we naturally attempt to add and remove some basic tricks. I believe there are a lot of people already knowing what has been explored in this paper. Nevertheless, this work still has a great practical value that helps us quantitatively understand how different protocols influence several commonly-used models. Moreover, different methods are compared only for point cloud classification task on ModelNet40, which only rely on global feature and cannot fully demonstrate the representation ability among different methods. For SimpleView, providing the image resolution is preferred.  Additionally, some typos, e.g. in \"randon\" in Table 1, should also be corrected. \n\nPros:\nThis paper investigates protocols for various point cloud networks for point cloud classification, with an observation that simple PointNet++ and SimpleView can already achieve competitive performance\n\nCons:\nThis paper lacks academic insights and novelty, making it more like a technical report. Besides, it only focuses on the classification task, which cannot convincingly conclude the representation ability of different methods.
