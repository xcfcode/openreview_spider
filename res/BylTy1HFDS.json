Authors justify the proposed method via the proof that the reconstruction ability of a set of features bounds its performance in downstream supervised learning tasks. The algorithm that iteratively eliminates features using learned per-feature corruption rates is proposed.\n\nThe fundamental of this paper is built on the argument that the optimal approach is to select a set of features that can accurately reconstruct all the remaining features for the settings where they will be used in downstream prediction tasks. Authors studied the performance losses of linear and nonlinear models by using the defined imputation losses.  Some concerns are listed as follows:\n1. the theorem based on strong assumptions that all learned models are optimal. The applicability of the theoretical results to general prediction model is still questionable. \n2. only the prediction problems of least square (linear or nonlinear) are studied. It is not equivalent to the downstream supervised learning tasks. It is just a special case study.\n3. It is unclear how to get the conclusion from Theorem 1 that the linear imputation loss is equal to the sum of eigenvalues. Please clarify it in details.\n\nThe RFE-like algorithm is used to solve (7). However, the sensitivity measures used in Algorithm 1 seems to take the different optimization problems since additional regularization terms are added. This is different from RFE where a single SVM optimization problem is used and the ranking score is solely based on the learned SVM classifier. The discussion on the inconsistency of learning h_{\\theta} and the sensitivity measures could be interesting. \n\nIn the experiments, authors did not mention the parameter settings of all compared methods. It is known that the unsupervised feature selection methods incorporate priors with usually various parameters. For fair comparisons, it is better to report the properly tuned results since these parameters are often data-dependent. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1485/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1485/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep unsupervised feature selection", "authors": ["Ian Covert", "Uygar Sumbul", "Su-In Lee"], "authorids": ["icovert@cs.washington.edu", "uygars@alleninstitute.org", "suinlee@cs.washington.edu"], "keywords": ["Single cell rna", "microarray", "feature selection", "feature ranking"], "TL;DR": "To perform well in downstream prediction tasks, features are selected by learning a \"restricted autoencoder\" that iteratively eliminates features that aren't necessary for accurate reconstruction.", "abstract": "Unsupervised feature selection involves finding a small number of highly informative features, in the absence of a specific supervised learning task.

So the proposed method is a bit incremental.\n\n2) Time complexity of the proposed method should be discussed.\n\n3) Experimental results are not convincing at all due to the following reasons:\n  a) Only one baseline (out of 9) was proposed after 2011. Outperforming these decade old approaches is not very difficult. There has been much progress on unsupervised feature selection and several hundred papers in this area have been published in the past 5 years.  The author should include more recent state-of-the-art baselines.\n  b) When tuning the hyper-parameters (e.g., \\lambda) for the proposed method and baseline methods (UDFS) on validation dataset, the author should list the value range used in the parameter search. Also, as unsupervised feature selection methods, using validation dataset (which has supervision labels) to choose parameters is not a fair way, as it does use supervision information.\n  c) Unsupervised feature selection papers in the past 5 years typically use 6~8 datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness while this paper only shows results on 2 datasets.\n\nGiven the reasons above, this paper needs improvement in many aspects and not ready to publish in its current form.\n\n\n[1] Zhu et al.

We justify our approach through a novel proof that the reconstruction ability of a set of features bounds its performance in downstream supervised learning tasks. Based on this theory, we present a learning algorithm for RAEs that iteratively eliminates features using learned per-feature corruption rates. We apply the RAE framework to two high-dimensional biological datasets\u2014single cell RNA sequencing and microarray gene expression data, which pose important problems in cell biology and precision medicine\u2014and demonstrate that RAEs outperform nine baseline methods, often by a large margin.", "pdf": "/pdf/a1877f890edb2848c812ac7335b44db546bf716f.pdf", "paperhash": "covert|deep_unsupervised_feature_selection", "original_pdf": "/attachment/a1877f890edb2848c812ac7335b44db546bf716f.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\ncovert2020deep,\ntitle={Deep unsupervised feature selection},\nauthor={Ian Covert and Uygar Sumbul and Su-In Lee},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BylTy1HFDS}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
