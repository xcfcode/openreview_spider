Briefly, as long as you can define the Lie group explicitly as a connected matrix Lie group, you can obtain the structure constants directly.\n\nFor some more detail, take for example the homogeneous Galilean group $\\text{HG}(1,3)$. For this group, the representations are not all known, and yet the structure constants of the Lie algebra are available e.g. on the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_transformation). This is because the structure constants can be obtained from just a single representation, such as the one we use for everyday physical calculations.\nMore explicitly, we can generate many random elements of this group, apply the matrix logarithm to obtain elements of the Lie algebra, and find a complete basis of this algebra as a vector space. Then we just have to decompose the commutator of each pair $(i,j)$ of basis elements (indexed by $k$) to obtain the constants $A_{ijk}$."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper461/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper461/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Irreducible Representations of Noncommutative Lie Groups", "authorids": ["~Noah_Shutty1", "casimir.wierzynski@intel.com"], "authors": ["Noah Shutty", "Casimir Wierzynski"], "keywords": ["equivariance", "object tracking", "equivariant neural networks", "deep learning", "point cloud", "lie group", "lie algebra", "lorentz group", "poincar\u00e9 group"], "abstract": "Recent work has constructed neural networks that are equivariant to continuous symmetry groups such as 2D and 3D rotations.

The main idea is that for low $n$, combinatorial constraints along with the multiplicative norm penalty of our loss function make it impossible to converge to any other representation. This explains why LearnRep can find, say, the $n=3$ dimensional representation of SO(3). The question remains, why does the loss function converge at all, given that it appears nonconvex? Here, once again for a low $n$, the number of parameters is small ($\\propto n^2$); heuristically it is therefore unsurprising that LearnRep converges within finite time.\n\nOur experiments were designed to carefully characterize the behavior of LearnRep and SpacetimeNet.\nFirst, we demonstrated that LearnRep converges to irreducible representations of $\\text{SO}(3,1), \\text{SO}(2,1),$ and $\\text{SO}(3)$. To this end we created a novel technique to characterize and visualize the tensor product structure of general Lie group representations.\nWe then produced artificial 3D and 4D point cloud datasets based on MNIST, which contain just 64 points per sample and are a toy model of event camera or LIDAR data. We trained the first Poincar\u00e9-equivariant object tracking models on these datasets and showed they can obtain reasonable accuracy while maintaining a rigorous guarantee of motion-equivariance.\nThese experiments provide motivation to scale up the SpacetimeNet architecture to real datasets with $\\sim 10^3$ points per sample. This will require overcoming engineering hurdles, e.g. there is currently a $O(N^2)$ complexity of the forward pass when there are $N$ points per sample. They also motivate applying LearnRep to Lie groups whose representations are uncharacterized, such as the homogeneous Galilean group.\nBoth the LearnRep algorithm and the SpacetimeNet model break new ground, and our experimental results provide a solid foundation for the future directions mentioned above."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper461/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper461/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Irreducible Representations of Noncommutative Lie Groups", "authorids": ["~Noah_Shutty1", "casimir.wierzynski@intel.com"], "authors": ["Noah Shutty", "Casimir Wierzynski"], "keywords": ["equivariance", "object tracking", "equivariant neural networks", "deep learning", "point cloud", "lie group", "lie algebra", "lorentz group", "poincar\u00e9 group"], "abstract": "Recent work has constructed neural networks that are equivariant to continuous symmetry groups such as 2D and 3D rotations.

Did you consider other choices?\n\nThis is a great question and we added a bit of additional explanation around this point. The norm penalty of course causes the loss function to diverge at the trivial representation (all 0 matrices). However, it also exhibits other divergences whose importance we did not emphasize. Briefly, the maximum over $T_i$ gives a divergence whenever any $T_i$ approaches the 0 matrix, preventing the formation of any representation which is trivial for a nontrivial subgroup. For instance, $\\text{SO}(3)$ is a subgroup of $\\text{SO}(3,1)$, so without this property the learned representations may just be $\\text{SO}(3)$ representations.\n\n\nIn section 2.5 you mention Tensor Product Nonlinearities. Where did you end up using them in the paper?\n\nTensor product nonlinearities are used in the forward pass of SpacetimeNet (section 3.2). The layer update rule for the representation at some spacetime point x includes a term for each other point $y$, which is the (decomposed) tensor product of representations at $y$ with (a representation equivariant to) the displacement vector $y-x$. We have tried to make this more clear in section 3.2.\n\nWe will upload a revised draft shortly to fix these typos and add some clarification.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper461/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper461/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Irreducible Representations of Noncommutative Lie Groups", "authorids": ["~Noah_Shutty1", "casimir.wierzynski@intel.com"], "authors": ["Noah Shutty", "Casimir Wierzynski"], "keywords": ["equivariance", "object tracking", "equivariant neural networks", "deep learning", "point cloud", "lie group", "lie algebra", "lorentz group", "poincar\u00e9 group"], "abstract": "Recent work has constructed neural networks that are equivariant to continuous symmetry groups such as 2D and 3D rotations.

Such representations can manage many kind of operation like rotation, translation, Lorentz boost... The interest of such representations is important since many application must be insensitive to some modification.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nReasons for score:\n\nOverall, I vote for rejecting (see cons for more details). The framework is very interesting but too complex to have a large audience. Furthermore some clues are missing on how the equivariance are declared.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nPros:\n\n1. This paper proposes a very generic framework for learning equivariant representations. This is of broad interest.\n\n2. Lie groups are able to manage many kind of transformations, thus the framework could lead to new application of deep learning.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nCons:\n\n1. The tensor A (the structure constants) of the algebra seems the main element of the whole framework. The construction of such tensor is unclear and seems non-trivial. For a given set of transformations, how can we derive the structure constants? The authors must explain this point.\n\n2. The equilibrium between appendix and main article is not good. Some figures are cited into the main article while they are in the appendix. On the other side, a large part of the paper is used to introduce the Lie groups. Perhaps a good way to reduce the complexity of he paper would be to take one example as introduction and lets the more formal parts in the appendix. As such the paper is too complex to catch the audience it merits.\n\n3. The experiments are not useful as we don't have any description on how there are done. For example on section 5.1 how the structure constants are given. Are they learnt or estimated?\n\n##########################################################################\n\nQuestions during rebuttal period:\n\nPlease address and clarify the cons above, especially point 1.\n\n#########################################################################\n\nSome typos: \n\npage 4: representation instead of \"represenation\"\n\npage 6: Adam instead of \"adam\"\n\npage 6: please put parenthesis for the Adam paper citation", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper461/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper461/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Irreducible Representations of Noncommutative Lie Groups", "authorids": ["~Noah_Shutty1", "casimir.wierzynski@intel.com"], "authors": ["Noah Shutty", "Casimir Wierzynski"], "keywords": ["equivariance", "object tracking", "equivariant neural networks", "deep learning", "point cloud", "lie group", "lie algebra", "lorentz group", "poincar\u00e9 group"], "abstract": "Recent work has constructed neural networks that are equivariant to continuous symmetry groups such as 2D and 3D rotations.

The technique of using optimization for finding irrep is simple and appears to be novel and effective. A complete introduction of the preliminary knowledge about group theory is presented in this paper, which reduces some of the difficultly for reader who is not familiar with this topic.\n\n- *Weakness*: One contribution claimed in this paper is the SpacetimeNet for object-tracking task. So I expect the proposed model can be evaluated through more realistic data sets instead of just MNIST. Also, as a person who is not very familiar with this task, I think it would be helpful to add some illustration on how the dataset is built and how the model is evaluated. Currently the experimental section seems to be difficult to follow due to the lack of explanation. \n\n In addition, I am wondering how LearnRep is properly motivated and analyzed? Specifically, I am not sure why the resulted representation from LearnRep is irreducible. Currently the irreducibility has only been demonstrated through experiments, and there is no motivation about how the loss function is derived. So I think it could help if the author can present some theoretical analysis about the correctness of the learned group representations.\n\n====  Reason for scoring ====\n\nOverall, the topic for finding irrep is important and suitable for presenting in ICLR. My main concern is on the experiment section, which needs more realistic dataset and explanation to demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of the proposed model/method. I think moving most of the contents in Sec.2 to the appendix for space, and adding more experiments and illustrations mentioned above can greatly enhance the soundness of this paper.\n\n \n\n ", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper461/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper461/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Irreducible Representations of Noncommutative Lie Groups", "authorids": ["~Noah_Shutty1", "casimir.wierzynski@intel.com"], "authors": ["Noah Shutty", "Casimir Wierzynski"], "keywords": ["equivariance", "object tracking", "equivariant neural networks", "deep learning", "point cloud", "lie group", "lie algebra", "lorentz group", "poincar\u00e9 group"], "abstract": "Recent work has constructed neural networks that are equivariant to continuous symmetry groups such as 2D and 3D rotations.

The algorithm is tested on SO(3), SO(2, 1), and SO(3, 1). In addition to this, the paper proposes SpaceTimeNet, a Poincar\u00e9-equivariant neural network architecture, and applies this architecture to an object-tracking task involving MNIST digits moving uniformly through space.\n\n------------------------------------------\nStrengths and weaknesses:\n\nThe paper proposed a well-motivated algorithm for learning irreducible group representations and performed sensible checks against well-studied Lie groups. The proposed Poincar\u00e9-equivariant convolutional network was similarly well-motivated, and the experimental results were promising.\n\nAs it stands, I\u2019m assigning a score of 5. I like the paper and think that it would be a good workshop paper but is not ready for the main conference. The reason for this is that the theoretical contributions, while novel, are not large enough on their own, and the experimentation to support the theoretical contributions are not extensive enough to demonstrate that the theoretical contributions demonstrate a major step forward in terms of functionality.\n\nGoing forward, I think the paper could be improved by including more thorough experimentation for both LearnRep and SpaceTimeNet.
