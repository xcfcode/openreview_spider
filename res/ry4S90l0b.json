Thirdly and fourthly, the results might seem similar for both self-training methods but they still show an improvement over a non-self-trained GAN which is one of the goals of our paper. The difference is more important with the CIFAR-10 results. \n2. We did not say \"has had few success\", we said \"has had a few success\". The former means that there was little success while the latter means that there were successes, which is what we claim. If the question is on the choice of the word \"few\" vs \"many\", then okay we can change \"few\" to \"many\". \n3. Okay, we will rearrange the layout. \n4. The Basic Self-Training scheme might seem obvious and straightforward but the second self-training method should not be considered obvious: label inversion, disagreement calculation and multiple subset candidates is not necessarily something that anyone can think about on top of their head.

Many things seem obvious in hindsight but a priori we cannot know for sure if these things will work out or not. \n\nThe Basic Self-Training method may seem obvious but the Improved Self-Training method is not obvious. Thinking about selecting multiple subsets of unlabelled data and inverting their labels to check their effect on the decision boundary is not something that people would immediately think about. In fact, it is not even obvious why this might work. The original paper testing this method presented theoretical justification as to why it is a good idea to try on simple hypotheses but not on a complex one such as GANs. \n\nOne of the goals of the paper was to test the self-training method specifically on GANs to see how it can be applied to them. Using a baseline that is not a GAN does not seem to provide information towards that goal. The MNIST results appear equivalent in both self-training methods but they still show an improvement over a non-self-trained GAN which is one of the goals we wanted to achieve with this paper.\n\nAlthough one method seems obvious to use, no other publications seem to have done a similar proof of concept. Moreover, the second self-training method used should not be thought of as obvious; label inversion, disagreement calculation and multiple subset candidates is not necessarily something that anyone can think about on top of their head.
