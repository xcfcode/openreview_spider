Here the focus is on GNNs used in the context of natural language processing. \n\nThe authors argue that the following three properties of a method are desirable:\n\n(1) The method should identify relevant paths across layers as paths are natural ways to present GNN reasoning patterns;\n(2) Be tractable, that is, allow the computation of paths in an efficient manner;\n(3) Be faithful.\n\nThe authors discuss existing post-hoc XAI approaches and the ways in which they do not meet at least one of the above desiderata.\n\n(A friendly comment here: perhaps it would be better to tone down the language just a little bit. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m convinced that paths are the most natural way to present GNN reasoning patterns, for instance. They are one possible way. Also, what is and isn\u2019t faithful is still not really rigorously defined in the literature and your definition could be made a bit more specific.)\n\nAt this point, it would also make sense to define/make more explicit what you mean by \u201cedge\u201d and \u201cpaths\u201d which you want to remove/retain to explain the behaviour of the GNN. Do you mean edge as in \u201cedge between the input graph\u2019s nodes in the computation graph induced by the GNN for one node\u201d? Or do you mean \u201cedge between neurons in the computation graph \u2026\u201d. Making this more concrete allows the user to follow your claims and reasoning better. \n\nThe proposed method belongs to the class of perturbation-based methods. It is very similar to prior work [1] and the authors should focus a bit more on similarities and differences in comparison to [1]. It seems the major difference is in the gating mechanism which is soft in [1] and in the application domain (image CNNs vs. GNNs). The lack of detailed discussion of [1] is especially problematic in the context of what the authors refer to as amortization. This seems to be crucial and makes a significant difference empirically yet is not discussed beyond a brief mention that this was introduced in [1]. The impression I currently have is that the paper is an application of [1] to GNNs. \n\nOne weakness of the proposed approach compared to prior work on explaining GNNs seems to be that it can only mask edges and not features. Is my understanding correct?\n\nThe experiments are well-designed and executed as far as I can tell. I am a proponent of the synthetic data experiments of the GNNExplainer and was happy to see them. It is interesting how well the integrated gradient method works compared to the GNNExplainer. I also like the NLP applications of GNNs and the corresponding experiments. Here, however, I would have wished to see a comparison again with integrated gradients and GNNExplainer. Is there a reason for not making such a comparison?\n\nOverall I think this is a well-written and executed paper. The main problem is that it is very similar to prior work and doesn\u2019t make enough of an effort to carve out the differences and similarities. The missing discussion of amortization is especially problematic, as it seems to be the decisive factor in the proposed method's performance. \n\n[1] Karl Schulz, Leon Sixt, Federico Tombari, and Tim Landgraf.

We apologize for being a bit vague in that part of our response. It was taking some time to compute the exact statistics and make sure they are exactly comparable with each other.\n\nNow, we have included analysis of GNNExplainer and Integrated Gradients (IG) on the Question Answering task in the new revision of the paper (see paragraph 4 in Section 5 and especially Appendix K) and summarize the key points below.\n\nWhile it is generally hard to judge the faithfulness of an interpretation method on a real task, we can identify pathologies in the attribution provided by both GNNExplainer and Integrated Gradients.\n\nGNNExplainer mostly keeps only edges at the top layer of the GNN, driving the rest close to 0 (see Figure 9 and Table 7 in Appendix). We could interpret this as suggesting that the bottom layers are unimportant. However, removing the bottom GNN layer from the QA models yields a 26% drop in performance (Table 6), a much larger drop than from removing the top one (-7%). How is that possible? What GNNExplainer does is to find a very specific subgraph configuration yielding the same output as the original model. It only retains edges pointing to the vertices corresponding to the answer chosen by the original model (e.g., both mentions of \"Japan\" from Figure 3) in the top layer. Doing this, due to the structure of the QA model, guarantees that the answer will be \"Japan\". It is an artifact of optimization on the test set, i.e. a manifestation of what we refer to in the paper as a 'hindsight bias', and reminiscent of the pathologies discussed by Feng et al. (2018).\n\nThe situation with IG is similar, though for a different reason (see discussion of IG's shortcomings in Appendices K and F). It also under-estimates the importance of bottom layers (also in Figure 9). Renormalization (within each layer) may help us answer questions about the relative importance of edges in each individual layer, but it is not the only question we may want to ask. We cannot answer such practically relevant questions as \"which edges in the input graph are most important across the model?\" (an edge type useful in the bottom layer will always be 'discriminated against'); \"which layers are important?\" or \"which paths are important?\".\n\nIn contrast, the importance of layers determined by leave-one-layer-out experiments is consistent with GraphMask: most edges it retains are also in the bottom layer (Table 2)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2026/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2026/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Interpreting Graph Neural Networks for NLP With Differentiable Edge Masking", "authorids": ["~Michael_Sejr_Schlichtkrull1", "~Nicola_De_Cao1", "~Ivan_Titov1"], "authors": ["Michael Sejr Schlichtkrull", "Nicola De Cao", "Ivan Titov"], "keywords": ["Graph neural networks", "interpretability", "sparse stochastic gates", "semantic role labeling", "question answering"], "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular approach to integrating structural inductive biases into NLP models.

(2020). That being said, we disagree that the methods are \u2018very similar\u2019.\n\nThere are many differences besides the methods (besides 1. and 2. which you acknowledge):\n1. We use HardConcrete which results in completely dropping the edge, whereas they add Gaussian noise\n2.  Their input attributions are for CNNs and only on the image domain\n3.  The objectives are different: ours is to maximize the number of dropped edges while maintaining the same performance as the original model, theirs is to minimize a linear combination of cross-entropy (w.r.t. gold standard) and an estimate of the mutual information. \n4. They make strong assumptions about the feature distribution (independent Gaussians). While it may be reasonable for images, it is questionable in our case. If the estimates are off, their objective and hence attributions are not faithful\n5. Their amortization relies on the states of the entire network. When applied to GNNs, it would, e.g., imply that decisions which edges to drop in hop 1 will be done based on the information available in the last hop. It results in the \u2018hindsight bias\u2019, similarly to not using any amortization. Instead, we do it incrementally, i.e. masks are predicted using the information available at the current hop.\n\nThese differences are not arbitrary, they affect what conclusions one can make from analysis. E.g., in QA we see that COMPLEMENT edges are not useful in hops 2 and 3. Given that the computation is incremental (i.e. 5.) and the edges have been gated by exactly 0 (i.e. 1.), this implies that we can safely drop these edges completely and not propagate over them. There are no such guarantees for their method.\n\nFurther, we implemented Schulz et al. (2020).  The best results we can obtain on the artificial test set is 43% F1. If we replace their amortization, which relies on information from \u201cfuture\u201d states (see 5. above), with ours, which relies on information available at the current hop, we obtain 52% F1, still much lower than 99% F1 with our method. See the new revision.\n\nTo answer your other questions:\n\n> **One weakness of the proposed approach compared to prior work on explaining GNNs seems to be that it can only mask edges and not features.**\n\nIt should be straightforward to generalize this framework to masking edge and node features (i.e. adding HardConcrete gates for these features), however, we have not experimented with it. For SRL, this is indeed interesting to see if it is the dependency labels which are important, or just the presence of a dependency relation.\n\n> **I would have wished to see a comparison again with integrated gradients and GNNExplainer [on real data].  Is there a reason for not making such a comparison?**\n\nWe ran preliminary experiments using GNNExplainer on the QA task and the explanations were nonsensical. In most examples it retained only the subset of edges between text mentions referring to the predicted answer. This is a clear manifestation of hindsight bias. It is similar to the situation with QA models trained on SQuAD, where Erasure selects the answer span as an explanation [1].  For integrated gradients, the scores of edges in different layers will be on a different scale, making much of our multi-layer GNN analysis impossible (e.g., the ones in Table 3). We will compute the statistics and report it in a subsequent revision, hopefully before the end of the discussion period. \n\n> **I\u2019m not sure I'm convinced that paths are the most natural way to present GNN reasoning patterns, for instance. They are one possible way.**\n\nWe added a sentence to the introduction, clarifying that we are focusing on a specific problem, identifying which edges and paths are relevant.  \n\n> **make more explicit what you mean by \u2018edge\u2019**\n\nWe now refer to the graph as an \u2018input graph\u2019 when motivating the task, to distinguish it from the computation graph.\n\n[1] Shi Feng, Eric Wallace, Alvin Grissom II, Mohit Iyyer, Pedro Rodriguez, Jordan Boyd-Graber.

We previously tried dropping all the remaining edges, which significantly harms performance (a drop of 13.4 points accuracy for QA, and respectively a 22.8 and 26.6 points F1-score for the SRL models with and without LSTM). Following your suggestion, we have also measured performance dropping a quarter/half/three quarters of the retained edges in addition to those already dropped by GraphMask. For question answering, the results are as follows:\n\n| Retained edges     | Accuracy |\n|--------------------|----------|\n| 100% (Orig. model) |     59.0 |\n|    27% (GraphMask) |     58.6 |\n|             20.25% |     55.2 |\n|              13.5% |     52.8 |\n|              6.25% |     47.7 |\n|                 0% |     45.2 |\n\nAs can be seen, dropping the edges marked useful by our technique, even just 25% of them, significantly hurts the model. At the same time, the 73% of edges GraphMask marks superfluous can be dropped with only a 0.4% loss in performance. A similar trend can be observed for SRL -- see Appendix J of our revised submission.\n\n> **Could we treat [the change in retained edges] as a way to measure how much structural information is captured by the encoder?  What would change with BERT/Roberta?**\n\nYes, using DiffMask as a way to probe for differences between encoders and reveal properties of contextualized embedding is an interesting direction, thank you for this suggestion. Studying the role of encoders was also the primary motivation for experiments on SRL, where we compared explanations when using the LSTM encoder vs using static embeddings. With LSTMs, the GNN component focuses primarily on long dependencies (Figure 4),  suggesting that short dependencies (and local context in general) are accurately captured by the LSTM itself.  The differences could be even more striking with contextualized encoders.\n\n> **How we can further use such kinds of explanations to build a better/robust/faithful model?**\n\nIt is easy to imagine how such explanations can suggest ways to reduce or simplify models.  For example in our Question Answering experiments, COMPLEMENT edges appear not beneficial in hops 2 and 3 for Question Answering, so considerably smaller graphs could be used in these hops, reducing computation (see also our reply to AnonReviewer1). Regarding building more interpretable models, one option to try is to use the sparsification objective at training time, encouraging a simpler and more interpretable flow of computation."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2026/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2026/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Interpreting Graph Neural Networks for NLP With Differentiable Edge Masking", "authorids": ["~Michael_Sejr_Schlichtkrull1", "~Nicola_De_Cao1", "~Ivan_Titov1"], "authors": ["Michael Sejr Schlichtkrull", "Nicola De Cao", "Ivan Titov"], "keywords": ["Graph neural networks", "interpretability", "sparse stochastic gates", "semantic role labeling", "question answering"], "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular approach to integrating structural inductive biases into NLP models.

For the synthetic task there is no difference. For Question Answering there is a 0.4% drop, while for SRL there is respectively a 0.62% and 0.79% drop for the LSTM+GNN and GNN-only models.  The fact that we can drop so many edges without hampering performance provides evidence that the dropped edges were indeed not beneficial.\n\n> **Can we increase the percentage of masking nodes? Does it govern by the \u03bb?**\n\nWe can drop more edges at the cost of performance by increasing the tolerance parameter \u03b2 in equation 5. In our experiments we keep \u03b2 very small to minimize the performance difference after masking.\n\n> **Can we use the suggested algorithm for other NLP tasks that use GNN models such as [1, 2, 3]?**\n\nYes, we believe so.

For each edge in the GNNs, the authors introduce a learnable hard gate which indicates whether this edge could be erased or not. The gates can be trained together with the model in a fully differentiable way. By analyzing the GNN models' behavior on two tasks -- question answering and semantic role labeling, the authors find that a large proportion of edges could be dropped without deteriorating the performance of the model. At the same time, the remaining edges could be used for interpreting model predictions.\n\n*Strength of the paper*:  \n1. The idea to erase edges in GNNs is intuitive and straightforward, but how to do it properly is the problem. This paper introduces a simple yet viable method to deal with it. This kind of technique is potentially useful to analyze other models' behavior.\n\n2. The experiments are well designed including both qualitative analysis, quantitative results, and reasonable ablation to show the effectiveness of their method. The thorough analysis conducted by the authors also contains useful insights of the model's behavior which is consistent with the literature.\n\n3. The authors have done a thorough literature review and clearly state where does this paper stands.\n\n*Comments*:\n\n1. I really like the synthetic experiment designed in the paper which distinguishes the explanation proposed in the paper from others to be faithful. However, from my point of view, the task introduced here is too simple to say that such kind of faithfulness could be generalized to the real setting. I am curious if you further drop a small proportion of the remaining edges, how would it affect the performance?\n\n2. Those model-dependent post-hoc explanations are interesting, I am curious how those explanations (remaining edges) would change if you have different encoders like BERT/Roberta. Could we treat it as a way to measure how much structural information is capture by the encoder? Also, other than the post-hoc explanation, do you have any idea of how we can further use such kinds of explanations to build a better/robust/faithful model?\n\n*Reason for score*: Overall, I vote for accepting this paper. I like the idea of differentiable masking and the way the authors use to build faithful explanations for GNNs. The experimental results and analysis provide new insights to this area.

The proposed method uses a single-layer NN classifier to predict  whether an edge can be dropped. It further uses L0 norm to encourage sparsity and amortizes parameter learning over a training dataset to avoid the hindsight bias. The method is experimented on a toy dataset (to demonstrate its faithfulness) and two real NLP tasks (multi-hop question answering and semantic role labeling). There are some interesting discussions based on the edge pruning results of these 2 tasks.\n\nStrengths\n- The paper proposes a novel interpretation method for GNNs. The method is technically interesting and well-motivated.\n- The discussions for the QA and SRL models are thorough and interesting and provide useful insights. For example, the analysis shows that GNN-only models rely more on the paths for arguments farther away from the predicates, compared to LSTM-GNN models.\n- The paper is well-written overall.\n\nWeaknesses\n- Some technical details are omitted. For example, \u201camortization\u201d is only briefly mentioned in the last part of the introduction with a citation to Shultz et al., (2020).

The main idea is to remove redundant edges for each layer of GNN after training the model. To find the redundant edges, the authors suggest minimizing the difference between the output of GNN with the original graph and inputs and the output of GNN with sub-graphs that remove some edges. The loss function forms the L0 norm with the Lagrange multiplier. The algorithm also learns baseline edge information that can replace the values of target edges. Experiment with synthetic datasets shows that suggested algorithms can find the important edges for the task rather than others that find only part of the important edges. Experiments on question answering and semantic role labeling with the real dataset, the suggested algorithm shows the percentage of retained edges and evidence that support the usefulness of the GNN algorithm for the task rather than LSTM.\n\nThe main strength of this paper is suggesting a sound and straightforward learning algorithm identify important edges for the task from the trained GNN model. Even the idea is simple; it can make people understand the GNN models better. I like to read the synthetic experiment section since it makes me admit to why the suggested algorithm much better than other algorithms. I also like to see the usefulness of the algorithm for the real NLP dataset.\n\nWhat concerns me most is the lack of explanation about the amortized. The authors mentioned it in the Introduction section with Schulz et al. 2020 paper. But it is hard to imagine the amortized and non-amortized algorithms in the experiment sections. Following the result in Figure 2, amortization is a key factor in identifying the important edges. Could the authors explain it more about this on the suggested algorithm?\n\n\n\nOverall, I admit that the suggested algorithm is a sound method to increase the interpretability of GNN models. But I have some questions that I want to listen to the author\u2019s responses.\n\n\nQuestions\n- How much drop the performance after masking? I know that the goal of masking is interpretability, not performance. But I am curious about it since if there are few drops, then we can identify informative sub-graphs by masking.\n- Can we increase the percentage of masking nodes? Does it govern by the $\\lambda$?\n- Can we use the suggested algorithm for other NLP tasks that use GNN models such as [1, 2, 3]?\n\nTypos\nWe investigate in Tables 3 and 3 on page 8\n\nReference\n[1] https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1026/\n[2] https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16329\n[3] https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1149/ ", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2026/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2026/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Interpreting Graph Neural Networks for NLP With Differentiable Edge Masking", "authorids": ["~Michael_Sejr_Schlichtkrull1", "~Nicola_De_Cao1", "~Ivan_Titov1"], "authors": ["Michael Sejr Schlichtkrull", "Nicola De Cao", "Ivan Titov"], "keywords": ["Graph neural networks", "interpretability", "sparse stochastic gates", "semantic role labeling", "question answering"], "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular approach to integrating structural inductive biases into NLP models. However, there has been little work on interpreting them, and specifically on understanding which parts of the graphs (e.g. syntactic trees or co-reference structures) contribute to a prediction. In this work, we introduce a post-hoc method for interpreting the predictions of GNNs which identifies unnecessary edges. Given a trained GNN model, we learn a simple classifier that, for every edge in every layer, predicts if that edge can be dropped. We demonstrate that such a classifier can be trained in a fully differentiable fashion, employing stochastic gates and encouraging sparsity through the expected $L_0$ norm. We use our technique as an attribution method to analyze GNN models for two tasks -- question answering and semantic role labeling -- providing insights into the information flow in these models. We show that we can drop a large proportion of edges without deteriorating the performance of the model, while we can analyse the remaining edges for interpreting model predictions.", "one-sentence_summary": "We present a novel post-hoc interpretation method for graph neural networks, and apply it to analyse two models from the NLP literature.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "schlichtkrull|interpreting_graph_neural_networks_for_nlp_with_differentiable_edge_masking", "pdf": "/pdf/57426959ac4fb7404f8b571713efb9795322ed3d.pdf", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Spotlight", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nschlichtkrull2021interpreting,\ntitle={Interpreting Graph Neural Networks for {\\{}NLP{\\}} With Differentiable Edge Masking},\nauthor={Michael Sejr Schlichtkrull and Nicola De Cao and Ivan Titov},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=WznmQa42ZAx}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
