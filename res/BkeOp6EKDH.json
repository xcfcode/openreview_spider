In fact, most DR methods (t-SNE, LargeVis, UMAP) have multiple tunable parameters. Tuning the default values are mainly based on domain knowledge and the overall performance on a number standard datasets. Our default choice of parameters may not be optimal for every dataset. However, we show that TriMap has little sensitivity to choice of these parameters (please see Figures 2 and 3).\n\n2) Although you make a valid point about global accuracy of DR methods, there has been no prior attempts to quantify these properties. Additionally, there exists no clear definition of the global accuracy. The global score, introduced in our paper, is in fact the first attempt to quantify the performance of a DR method in preserving the relative placements of the clusters. Note that it might be possible to define more complicated notions of global accuracy (for instance, using polynomial axis in the low-dimensional embedding to reflect the non-linearity). However, none of these approaches would be computationally feasible for very large datasets (~millions of points). Also, note that defining the global score in terms of PCA is equivalent to using second-order statistics (i.e. variance) of the data. Defining a global score based on other notions of distance than the Euclidean distance (i.e. Bregman PCA) is out of the scope of the current paper.\n\nOur claim that \"GS is the only measure\" means the only measure among the standard measures of DR (nearest-neighbor accuracy, trustworthiness-continuity, AUC, etc.). Indeed, any monotonically increasing transformation would have similar properties. We will clarify that sentence.\n\n3) The subset of triplets \\mathcal{T} is carefully sampled for each dataset. We show in Figure 3 that roughly a linear number of triplets for each dataset is sufficient to create the embedding. Please see the paragraph at the end of page 4 for a detailed description of the sampling procedure. The fast runtime of the method stems from the fact that it requires fewer computations than the other methods. The computational cost as well as the memory requirement of TriMap grows linearly after the initial NN search step. We are surprised that faster performance of the method is listed as the weakness of the method!"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper825/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper825/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "TriMap: Large-scale Dimensionality Reduction Using Triplets", "authors": ["Ehsan Amid", "Manfred K.

Please note that results of TriMap look significantly different than the linear projection results of PCA (for instance, see the Epileptic Seizure results). However, TriMap preserves \"roughly\" the same structure as the PCA result in most cases (e.g. MNIST and Fashion MNIST results). This includes relative placement of the clusters and existence of outliers (see the result on TV News). Please note that the global score by no means is the optimal score for assessing the performance of a DR method in terms of global accuracy. However, it can reflect the crude placement of the clusters to some extent. \n\nEmpirically, we have tried random initialization and we did not observe significant difference in the final results. However, initialization to the PCA solution provides faster convergence (i.e. fewer number of iterations) to the final solution (as pointed out in the paper).\n\nGreat point about balancing local and global measures! In fact we are considering this as a possible future direction. However, a careful tuning of the loss to strike a balance would be crucial. Nevertheless, the point of the current paper is to address some of the global properties that the other DR methods may fail to reflect.\n\nWe tried to justify each component in our method and show the reasoning for choosing each default value. In fact, most DR methods (t-SNE, LargeVis, UMAP) have multiple tunable parameters. Tuning the default values are mainly based on domain knowledge and the overall performance on a number standard datasets.

Many important technical decisions on this method seem arbitrary, including the parametrization of functions (e.g., s, \\omega, \\zeta, etc) and values of hyperparameters (e.g., \\gamma and \\delta). For function forms, the authors should justify why particular parametrization has been chosen; for the hyperparameters, the authors should clearly explain how they are picked---maybe using domain knowledge or tuned on data? \n\n2. The argument for ``global score\u2019\u2019 is not clear enough. There are at least two points that need clarification. \n\nFirst, ``non-local\u2019\u2019 is not equal to ``global\u2019\u2019. The proposed method indeed considers non-local (or non-near) points while learning embeddings, which helps preserve non-local information. But I am not convinced that the preserved information is actually global. Maybe what helps is to first define ``global\u2019\u2019 in a dimensionality reduction context. \n\nSecond, the definition of ``global score\u2019\u2019 depends on another baseline method (i.e. PCA), which seems odd. A principled evaluation (or a score) should be method-independent. What seems right to me is to compute global score (i.e. how much global information has been preserved) by comparing to some statistics in the (high-dim) x space, not to another method. \n\nMoreover, the authors had a strong claim that the proposed ``GS is the only DR performance measure that can reflect this property\u2019\u2019---it doesn\u2019t sound right and why one can\u2019t just use another score which is monotonic wrt the proposed score? The authors mentioned that ``PCA has the lowest possible MRE\u2019\u2019---but this is only right up to the use of a linear transformation and F-norm, so this shouldn\u2019t be a justification for my questions above. \n\n3. What is the reason for the successful runtime? \n\nThe authors didn\u2019t clarify why the proposed method is theoretically faster than the baselines. \n\nWhat I noted is: the authors chose a subset \\mathcal{T} for the TriMap method and used \\mathcal{T} throughout the paper---is it a typo or is a subset always chosen? If the latter holds, then how was it chosen and how large is it compared to the training data used by other methods? In the end, is the proposed method faster because it uses less data? \n\nBesides the weakness above, I also suggest the authors evaluate their method with some extrinsic evaluations. What\u2019s currently used is only intrinsic---the embeddings are trained to preserve relative distances and are evaluated on a trade-off between local accuracy and the defined global score. It is fine because extensive visualizations are provided and readers can subjectively judge the quality of the learned embeddings. However, the experimental section can be stronger if the authors can show the learned embeddings are better at helping some downstream tasks than other baselines (by preserving non-local information?). \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper825/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper825/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "TriMap: Large-scale Dimensionality Reduction Using Triplets", "authors": ["Ehsan Amid", "Manfred K.

From the definition, this measure has preferences to the linear projection model such as PCA, so the score becomes lower for non-linear projection methods such as t-SNE and UMAP.  The illustrated S-shape example in Figure 1 somehow demonstrate the difference of the proposed method with PCA, t-SNE and UMAP, but the usage of the embedding is not clear since Figure 1(d) looks like a 2-d visualizing of the original 3-d data visualized from certain angle.

It might be interesting and more important to see how to get the better embedding with a balanced score for a given data since GS and AUC seems always opposite measures.\n\nThe TriMap method defines the loss of triplet based on unnormalized weighting schema and the weights are adjusted by applying a non-linear transformation that emphasizes the small weights.
