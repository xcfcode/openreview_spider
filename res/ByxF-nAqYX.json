However:\ni) a linear DR does not work (as shown on the toy XOR example)\nii) non-linear DR methods (Isomap, t-SNE, MDS, LLE) rely on the local Euclidean distance in the original space, that might be arbitrarily corrupted by random features.\niii) The non-linear DR method in LLUFS (denoising auto-encoder with D-D/2-D/4-D/8-D/4-D/2-D neural architecture) yields stable results (e.g. 98% same features are in the top 100 selected features for all datasets w.r.t. different initialisations).\n\nQ2: \"The LLE method is based on the assumption that if the high-dimensional data is locally linear,\nit can be projected on a low-dimensional embedding which is also locally linear.\nTransitioning from a locally linear high-dimensional data to a lower dimension makes sense because there exists higher degree of freedom\nin the higher dimension. However, making this assumption in the opposite direction is not very intuitive.\nWhy would the features that do not conform to the local linearity of the low-dimensional structure (which itself is obtained via a non-linear mapping) are insignificant?\"\n\nA2: The approach assumes that\n* X (the initial data in D dimensions) can be mapped onto Z (latent space in D/8 dimensions) with no or little loss of information;\n* From Z, the idea is to find among X_sub (all datasets defined from X by selecting a subset of features) the best mapping in the LLE sense. From Z (dimension D/8) to X_sub, the decrease in dimensionality is still high (the evaluation considers the selected top-100 features, with 100 << D/8 except for Madelon). \n\n\nQ3: \"Finally, there are no theoretical guarantees on the performance of the method. Is there any guarantee that, e.g. given one noisy feature in high dimension, the method will find that feature, etc.?\"\n \nA3: You are right, there is no theoretical guarantees for LLUFS. To our best knowledge, the evaluation of all unsupervised FS methods (including ours) is based on a supervised setting.  \n\nQ4 : \"Minor: what is the complexity of the method compared to the competing methods? What is the runtime? Is this a practical approach on large datasets?\"\n\nA4 : Theoretically: Besides the complexity of learning the Auto-Encoder, the time complexity of the prior agglomerative hierarchical clustering is O(D**2) with D the number of features (up to logarithmic terms). This complexity motivates the extension proposed in the paper, to use the feature correlation within the Auto-Encoder loss to deal with redundancy (section 3.3).\nThe time complexity of the nearest neighbor search is O(D/8 n**2) with D/8 the dimension of Z and n the number of points. \nThe time complexity of computing the W matrix is  O(D/8 n k**3) with k the number of neighbors set to 6 in all problems. \nEmpirically, LLUFS is slower than LAP, SPEC, MCFS and faster than NDFS.

This might be true for most real world datasets, \nbut I believe the degree of clustered-ness may vary by dataset. It will be nice to discuss effect of this. \nFor example, if most data points are concentrated on a particular area not being well clustered, \nhow much this approach get affected? If possible, it will be great to formulate it mathematically, but qualitative discussion is still useful.\"\n\nA1 : Given the absence of label information, unsupervised FS algorithms rely on the assumption that there is some sort of \"intrisic structure\" to the data. \nUnsupervised approaches [1,2,3,4,5] assume that there are some clusters, which can be well-separated by an appropriate feature subset. \nAs these clusters are defined in the initial feature space, they depend on the Euclidean distance which is arbitrarily corrupted from irrelevant features \n(except for [5] , which iteratively learns a new distance during selection).\n\nLLUFS proposes another strategy: \n* An auto-encoder achieves the non-linear dimensionality reduction and constructs features, defining a compressed version Z of the initial data X;\n* We now search for the subset of initial features, defining X_sub such that, if we applied LLE dimensionality reduction on Z, X_sub would be a perfect candidate (in the sense of preserving the local structure defined from W, with Z ~= WZ). \n* The gain is that the combinatorial optimization problem of finding the best subset of features of size d can be solved in a straightforward way as the score of each feature is its distorsion: ranking the initial features by increasing distorsion, the optimal set of features is the top d features.\n\n\nQ2 : \"For the dimension reduction, the authors used autoencoder neural network only. What about other techniques like PCA or SVD?\"\n\nA2 : Non separable clusters (the XOR problem) cannot be captured from a linear dimensionality reduction (PCA, SVD) method.\nIt is true that we could have used other non-linear dimensionality reduction methods (Isomap or MDS) to define a latent representation, instead of Auto-Encoder. However, Isomap and MDS depend on the Euclidean distance in the initial feature space, thus with same weakness as said in A1. \n\n\n\"It seems x_j is missing in Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma formula.\"\n\nYou are right.

The idea is to first apply a dimensionality reduction method on the input data X to find a low-dimensional representation Z. Next, each point in Z is represented by a linear combination of its nearest neighbors by finding a matrix W which minimizes || Z  - WZ||. Finally, these weights are used to asses the distortion of every feature in X by considering the reconstruction loss in the original space.\n\nComments: There are multiple shortcomings in the motivation of the approach. First, the result of the dimensionality reduction drastically depend on the method used. It is well known that every DR method focuses on preserving certain properties of the data. For instance, PCA preserves the global structure while t-SNE works locally, maximizing the recall [1]. The choice of the DR method should justify the underlying assumption of the approach. I expect that the results of the experiments to change drastically by changing the DR method.\n\nSecond, the LLE method is based on the assumption that if the high-dimensional data is locally linear, it can be projected on a low-dimensional embedding which is also locally linear. Transitioning from a locally linear high-dimensional data to a lower dimension makes sense because there exists higher degree of freedom in the higher dimension. However, making this assumption in the opposite direction is not very intuitive. Why would the features that do not conform to the local linearity of the low-dimensional structure (which itself is obtained via a non-linear mapping) are insignificant?\n\nFinally, there are no theoretical guarantees on the performance of the method. Is there any guarantee that, e.g. given one noisy feature in high dimension, the method will find that feature, etc.?\n\nMinor: what is the complexity of the method compared to the competing methods? What is the runtime? Is this a practical approach on large datasets?\n\nOverall, I do not agree with the assumptions of the paper nor convinced with the experimental study. Therefore, I vote for reject.\n\n[1] Venna et al. \"Information retrieval perspective to nonlinear dimensionality reduction for data visualization.\" Journal of Machine Learning Research 11, no.
