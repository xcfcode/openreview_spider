The major concern raised by the reviewer is the application of our method to more realistic settings, such as GANs. In the response below; we give some insights and directions to apply our method in such settings. We have uploaded an additional pdf which shows the difference between the old submission and the new one, so that the reviewers can quickly check the changes that have been made.\n\n**Q**: \u201cIt\u2019s not clear how to apply these methods towards more realistic problems we may want to solve. For example, in optimizing GANs, how do the distribution of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian compare during training (for medium-scale problems with say 1-5k parameters) with the distributions you investigate?\u201d\n\n**A**: We have now added to the paper Figure 1 showing the spectrum of a GAN at initialization. This shows a spectral density with strong similarities to the circle law, i.e., it satisfies Assumption 5. However, there are still technical limitations to the direct implementation of the proposed method to GANs. For example, this work is limited to deterministic methods, although we hope to open the way to more efficient stochastic methods in future work.\n \n\n**Q**: \u201cIs there a useful distinction between how one would implement worst-case and average-case algorithms in situations where we don\u2019t have a tight understanding of the eigenvalue distribution?\u201d\n\n**A**: When one doesn't have a tight understanding of the eigenvalue distribution it is possible to approximate it with a parametric model: for instance, [Martin et al., Implicit Self-Regularization in Deep Neural Networks: Evidence from Random Matrix Theory and Implications for Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01075) show in Section 4 that the spectrum of neural networks is surprisingly predictable in the over-parametrized case. We expect such property to hold for GANs (in Figure 1, we intuitively see that the GAN spectrum has a circularly symmetric distribution that could easily be fitted), although this is out of the scope of our study. \nFinally, in the case where one uses an optimal average-case algorithm on a problem whose eigenvalues distribution does not fit the expected one, it may happen that the average-case method will be suboptimal (compared to the worst-case one) for early iterations. Hopefully, as we showed in Section 5 of our paper, the optimal algorithm in the average-case (and its rate) converges to the optimal algorithm in the worst-case.\n\n**Q**: \u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me what assumptions are needed at some points in the paper. [...] Prop 5.2 says it requires the assumptions of Theorem 4.2 which again says it requires the assumptions of Theorem 2.1.\u201d. \n\n**A**: $A$ is skew-symmetric in the part relating to bilinear games, that is, Section 3 and Proposition 5.1 in Section 5. Throughout the paper, when we talk about bilinear games we refer to _zero-sum_ bilinear games, and we drop the _zero-sum_ part for shortness and because it is also the terminology used by Azizian et al. We already mentioned that we deal with zero-sum games in the first sentence of Section 3, but we have emphasized it by stating it explicitly. In Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 we no longer state the results referring to the Assumptions of Theorem 2.1, but we refer to the Assumptions 1 and 2 directly. In Proposition 5.1 we now state that the setting is the one of Theorem 3.1 and in Proposition 5.2 we keep referring to the assumptions of Theorem 4.2 for shortness.\n\n**Q**: \u201cIt\u2019s unclear to me what is meant by \u201cFor bilinear games, since the average-case optimal algorithm is average-case optimal algorithm of an optimization algorithm.\u201d.\n\n**A**: We have rephrased the sentence, removing the typo. What we mean is that in Theorem 3.1 we see that the average-case optimal first-order method to find solutions of a *bilinear game* is the average-case optimal first-order method for the *minimization of the Hamiltonian* of the game. Hence, we just need to find the asymptotic version of the average-case optimal first-order method for the minimization of the Hamiltonian of the game, which was studied by Scieur & Pedregosa (2020).\n\n**Q**: \u201cSome terms are not defined explicitly in the main body of the text before being used. For example, D_{C, R}.\u201d.\n\n**A**: We now define this instance the first time it is used.\n\n**Q**: \u201cThe paper states \u201cThis result complements [1], proved that Polyak Heavy Ball algorithm on the Hamiltonian is asymptotically worst-case optimal.\u201d [...] Could you elaborate on this?\u201d. \n\n**A**: In section 3, we added a paragraph comparing our average-case results with those of Azizian et al. (2020). We also added a pointer to section 3 in the introduction after this sentence.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper540/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper540/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Average-case Acceleration for Bilinear Games and Normal Matrices", "authorids": ["~Carles_Domingo-Enrich1", "~Fabian_Pedregosa1", "~Damien_Scieur3"], "authors": ["Carles Domingo-Enrich", "Fabian Pedregosa", "Damien Scieur"], "keywords": ["Smooth games", "First-order Methods", "Acceleration", "Bilinear games", "Average-case Analysis", "Orthogonal Polynomials"], "abstract": "Advances in generative modeling and adversarial learning have given rise to renewed interest in smooth games.

We have uploaded supplementary material showing the difference between the old submission and the new one, so that the reviewers can quickly check the changes that have been made.\n\n**Q**: \u201c[...] the contribution of this paper is still not very informative to me [...] So what\u2019s the difficulty for extending symmetric matrix to diagonalizable matrix?\u201d \n\n**A**: There are crucial differences from the symmetric to the normal setting. The major technical difficulty arises at Theorem 2.1 (analog of Theorem 2.1 in Pedregosa and Scieur 2020, but in the complex plane): indeed, the eigenvalues of normal matrices are potentially complex. This makes the problem of finding the optimal polynomial much more difficult. Indeed:\n- In the real case (i.e. symmetric matrices), the sequence of optimal polynomials is the sequence of orthogonal polynomials w.r.t. the weight function lambda mu(lambda). \n- In our case, the optimal polynomial no longer follows such a nice property, as the optimal one is a linear combination of orthogonal polynomials (see Theorem 2.3). This also implies that the optimal algorithm in the average case for normal matrices may not follow a three-term recurrence (as opposed to the ones in Pedregosa and Scieur, 2020).\n\n**Q**: \u201cSo what\u2019s the benefit of introducing complex instead of real.\u201d \n\n**A** : Complex eigenvalues allow us to analyze the average-case convergence of non-symmetric vector fields like the ones that arise in GAN training. For example, the eigenvalues of the matrix in bilinear games lie in the imaginary line. Therefore, their expected spectral density is a measure in the complex plane and it would not be possible to analyze them using real eigenvalues as has been done previously in (Pedregosa and Scieur, 2020).\n\n**Q**: \u201cThe writing can be improved by e.g. providing more discussions instead of just stacking the propositions and theorems.\u201d\n\n**A**: We have uploaded an additional pdf which shows the difference between the old submission and the new one. We have improved the writing mainly in the following ways: \n- In Subsection 2.4 we provide a clearer explanation of the limitations we encounter when going from the symmetric matrix setting to the normal matrix setting.\n- In Section 3 we have added an in-depth comparison paragraph with previous work, and in Subsection 4.1 we have emphasized the comparison with previous work by adding a paragraph title.\n- In the Conclusion, we have added a paragraph about how our framework could possibly be used for GAN training.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper540/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper540/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Average-case Acceleration for Bilinear Games and Normal Matrices", "authorids": ["~Carles_Domingo-Enrich1", "~Fabian_Pedregosa1", "~Damien_Scieur3"], "authors": ["Carles Domingo-Enrich", "Fabian Pedregosa", "Damien Scieur"], "keywords": ["Smooth games", "First-order Methods", "Acceleration", "Bilinear games", "Average-case Analysis", "Orthogonal Polynomials"], "abstract": "Advances in generative modeling and adversarial learning have given rise to renewed interest in smooth games.

Average-case optimal methods are proposed for some distributions on eigenvalues for the Jacobian of the games vector-field. Also, a connection is made between average-case optimal methods in bilinear games and optimally solving the Hamiltonian.\n \n \nStrengths:\n\nThe paper presents methods that improve on worst-case optimal algorithms for learning in games by using average-case optimal algorithms.  Numerical experiments confirm a reasonable benefit in the ill-conditioned regime.\n\nThe algorithm in (11) is easy to implement in the asymptotic regime -- ex., with (19).\n\nTheorem 3.1 which connects optimal methods with minimization on the Hamiltonian highlights a recurring theme in the analysis of these kinds of problems, which other authors may be able to use in the future.\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nThere are limited experimental results,  but they do succinctly show the expected results from average-case optimization in their setup.  \n\nIt\u2019s not clear how to apply these methods towards more realistic problems we may want to solve.  For example, in optimizing GANs, how do the distribution of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian compare during training (for medium-scale problems with say 1-5k parameters) with the distributions you investigate?  Is there a useful distinction between how one would implement worst-case and average-case algorithms in situations where we don\u2019t have a tight understanding of the eigenvalue distribution?\n\nIt\u2019s not clear to me what assumptions are needed at some points in the paper.  When do we need A to be skew-symmetric (i.e., a zero-sum bilinear game)? Should Thm 3.1 be for \u201czero-sum bilinear games\u201d instead of bilinear games in general?  If the zero-sum assumption is required, it might be worthwhile emphasizing when it is/isn\u2019t needed when talking about \u201cbilinear games\u201d.  Prop 5.2 says it requires the assumptions of Theorem 4.2 which again says it requires the assumptions of Theorem 2.1.  I find this difficult to read and would appreciate a summary of the assumptions required directly at each step.\n \n \nMy recommendation is to accept the paper with a 7.  Studying learning in games is an important problem in machine learning, and establishing average-case algorithms complements recent worst in worst-case bounds for bilinear games. The asymptotic algorithms presented are simple to use for some eigenvalue distributions. The experimental results are weak, but almost unnecessary given the strong theoretical results.  If there were proposed ways (and results) to leverage the average-case algorithm variants in more-general setups like GANs I would raise the score.\n \n \nThe following point did not affect my score but may help the authors:\n \nIf you are pressed for space to add details, it\u2019s not clear to me that you need to re-state the result Prop 5.1 in the main body.\n \nIt\u2019s unclear to me what is meant by \u201cFor bilinear games, since the average-case optimal algorithm is average-case optimal algorithm of an optimization algorithm.\u201d\n \nSome terms are not defined explicitly in the main body of the text before being used.  For example, D_{C, R}. However, this did not strongly hinder comprehension.\n \nThe paper states \u201cThis result complements [1], proved that Polyak Heavy Ball algorithm on the Hamiltonian is asymptotically worst-case optimal.\u201d  It\u2019s unclear to me how this is shown in their paper.
