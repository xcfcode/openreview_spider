Please find the responses inline below.\n\n(1) I think the authors over-state their claims of no loss in accuracy, in Table 2 we see a clear loss in accuracy from MobileNets to MobileNets + Hybrid Filter Banks.\n\nPlease note that the results reported for hybrid filter banks are from a single run of our training procedure, we believe the 0.51% accuracy drop can be bridged with more training hyperparameter exploration. We will add the updated results with more hyperparameter exploration in the final version. In any case we will change the text appropriately to reflect the reviewer\u2019s concerns.\n\n(2) I think a better venue for this research may be a more systems-focused conference or journal.\n\nWhile we agree this paper has a system-focused contribution in terms of proposing a novel hardware accelerator consisting of both MAC and adder units for efficient execution of ternary weight networks, the primary focus throughput the paper is the model compression of MobileNets\u2019 already highly optimized network, the discussion of issues around quantizing MobileNets to ternary weights and subsequent development of a ML solution to address that. Hence, we submitted the work to a ML conference where we feel attendees will find more value and interest in this work.\n\n(3) I think this research is quite incremental over MobileNets.\n\nPlease see answer to Q1 of Review #1.  Approximately 2x compression in model size and 28% saving in energy with no degradation in inference throughput or little degradation in accuracy is not an incremental contribution for an already compact and compute-efficient architecture like MobileNets.  This paper provides the new best-in-class result for this task.\n\n(4) I think this research is unlikely to spur further research strains.\n\nWe strongly believe that this work will spur further research strains because of the following reasons:\na)\tThe research community has put significant effort into quantizing ResNet architecture to ternary values while preserving the accuracy of full-precision model [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. Considering the fact that MobilNet family of networks (1x1 convolutions) have fueled tremendous progress in the design and organization of resource-efficient architectures in recent years, it is highly likely that the MobileNet-like compute-efficient networks will be the next target for ternary quantization. \nb)\tTo the best of our knowledge, the hybrid filter banks proposed in this work is a first step towards quantizing the already compute-efficient MobileNets architecture to ternary values with a negligible loss in accuracy on a large-scale dataset, such as ImageNet. The Table 2 in Page 13 of reference [4] paper further shows the evidence of our claim.\n\nReferences:\n(1)\tKuan Wang et al., \u201cHAQ: Hardware-Aware Automated Quantization with Mixed Precision\u201d, CVPR 2019\n(2)\tRon Banner et al., \u201cPost-training 4-bit quantization of convolution networks for rapid-deployment\u201d, NeurIPS 2019\n(3)\tYoni Choukroun et al., \u201cLow-bit Quantization of Neural Networks for Efficient Inference\u201d, ICCV 2019 workshop\n(4)\tChristos Louizos et al., \u201cRelaxed Quantization for Discretized Neural Networks\u201d, ICLR 2019\n(5)\tJiwei Yang et al., \u201cQuantization Networks\u201d, CVPR 2019\n(6)\tRuihao Gong et al., \u201cDifferentiable Soft Quantization: Bridging Full-Precision and Low-Bit Neural Networks\u201d, ICCV 2019\n(7)\tSangil Jung et al., \u201cLearning to Quantize Deep Networks by Optimizing Quantization Intervals with Task Loss\u201d, CVPR 2019\n\n\n(5) There is a significant amount of compute and training complexity required to reduce the model size, e.g. versus model pruning or tensor decomposition. It seems this research would be incredibly difficult to reproduce.\n\n(a)\tThe training of hybrid filter banks requires finding the appropriate division of output channels to be generated from either full-precision or ternary weight filters at each layer to explore the best cost-accuracy tradeoffs. Model pruning and tensor decomposition techniques also must find either the appropriate sparsity factors or the appropriate sizes of the tensor decomposed matrices during training to meet the required cost-accuracy tradeoffs. From our experience hybrid filter banks require similar training complexity to that of the training complexity of model pruning and tensor decomposition techniques.\n(b)\tFurthermore, note that the model pruning and the tensor decomposition techniques (few cited in section 5, Related Work) are orthogonal to our compression scheme, they can be used in conjunction with hybrid filter banks to further reduce model size and computational complexity (likely at the cost of accuracy).\n(c)\tHybrid filter banks compression scheme is profitable and generalizable to other network architectures (ResNet dominated with 3x3 convolutional layers) as well (please see answer to Q1 to Review# 3).\n(d)\tWe are happy to release the training infrastructure for hybrid filter banks to ease reproducibility of our work.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2533/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2533/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["dibakar.gope@arm.com", "jesse.beu@arm.com", "urmish.thakker@arm.com", "matthew.mattina@arm.com"], "title": "Ternary MobileNets via Per-Layer Hybrid Filter Banks", "authors": ["Dibakar Gope", "Jesse G Beu", "Urmish Thakker", "Matthew Mattina"], "pdf": "/pdf/1411dc4f885bb68f4f1081cd367870d510b56da1.pdf", "TL;DR": "2x savings in model size, 28% energy reduction for MobileNets on ImageNet at no loss in accuracy using hybrid layers composed of conventional full-precision filters and ternary filters", "abstract": "MobileNets family of computer vision neural networks have fueled tremendous progress in the design and organization of resource-efficient architectures in recent years.

Comparison to prior work:\n\n(a)\tWe haven\u2019t found a work that attempt to quantize the weights of MobileNet to ternary or binary values for either CIFAR10, ImageNet or any other dataset. Table 2 in Page 13 of reference [1] further supports this claim. Prior works on ternary quantization [1,2,3,4] primarily evaluate the ResNet architecture on different datasets. To the best of our knowledge, the hybrid filter banks proposed in this work is a first step towards quantizing the already compute-efficient MobileNets architecture to ternary values with a negligible loss in accuracy on a large-scale dataset, such as ImageNet.\n(b)\tTo address your concern, we have since evaluated the ResNet-20 architecture with hybrid filter banks on the CIFAR-10 dataset to demonstrate its efficacy over other state-of-the-art ternary quantization techniques and its generalizability to other neural network architectures, especially to architectures dominated with 3x3 convolutional layers. ResNet-20 has 19 3x3 convolutional layers. Hybrid filter banks for ResNet-20 consistently achieves a better accuracy for different hidden layer widths when compared to the accuracy reported in StrassenNets [5] while ensuring improvement or no degradation in inference throughput. For example, the Hybrid ResNet-20 with the Alpha = 0.25 and the r = 0.75*cout configuration achieves an accuracy of 91.55% when compared to the accuracy 90.62% observed by StrassenNets with r = 0.75*cout. The accuracy of full-precision ResNet-20 is 92.1. All other configurations consistently outperform the state-of-the-art StrassenNets, demonstrating the generalizability and effectiveness of hybrid filter banks to 3x3 convolutional layers. We will add the performance results of hybrid filter banks for ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10 in the final version.\n\nAlpha = The fraction of channels generated in an output feature map from the full-precision weight filters\nr = The hidden layer width of a strassenified convolution layer (ternary weight filters)\n\n(c)\tIn this work, we compare hybrid filter banks against StrassenNets and TWN. We will compare hybrid filter banks to the other ternary quantization techniques (such as, TTQ [6] and ABC-Net which are published before StrassenNets [5]) and add their performance results in the final version. As StrassenNets already showed better performance results over the prior ternary quantization methods [6], we concentrated our effort to demonstrate improvement over StrassenNets for MobileNet-like already compact and compute-efficient architecture on a challenging dataset. Furthermore, we believe that when the prior ternary quantization schemes such as TWN, TTQ, ABC-Net could not preserve the accuracy for over-parameterized and less compute-efficient ResNet (in comparison to MobileNet), we should not expect preservation of accuracy for the already compact and compute-efficient MobileNets for these techniques.\n\nReferences:\n(1)\tChristos Louizos et al., \u201cRelaxed Quantization for Discretized Neural Networks\u201d, ICLR 2019\n(2)\tJiwei Yang et al., \u201cQuantization Networks\u201d, CVPR 2019\n(3)\tRuihao Gong et al., \u201cDifferentiable Soft Quantization: Bridging Full-Precision and Low-Bit Neural Networks\u201d, ICCV 2019\n(4)\tSangil Jung et al., \u201cLearning to Quantize Deep Networks by Optimizing Quantization Intervals with Task Loss\u201d, CVPR 2019\n(5)\tMichael Tschannen et al., \u201cStrassenNets: Deep learning with a multiplication budget\u201d, ICML 2018\n(6)\tChenzhuo Zhu et al., \"Trained Ternary Quantization\", ICLR 2017\n\n\n2. Little blurry figures.\nThank you for pointing to this out; we will fix that in the final version.\n\n\n3. Current framework to MobileNetV2?\n\n(a)\tYes, it is absolutely possible to apply the current framework and Hybrid Filter Banks to MobileNetV2. In the limited rebuttal time, we could only evaluate MobileNetV2 on the ImageNet dataset with one initial set of model hyperparameters associated with hybrid filter banks approach. The initial results with MobileNetV2 is promising, incurring as little as 2.62% accuracy loss compared to the uncompressed MobilNetV2 *with only the first set of hyperparameters we chose *.  We believe the small accuracy drop can be bridged with more model hyperparameters (e.g., appropriate division of output channels to be generated from either full-precision or ternary weight filters at each layer, appropriate value of hidden layer width for ternary weight filters, etc.) exploration associated with hybrid filter banks approach\n(b)\tFurthermore, due to the rebuttal time constraint and long training time of MobileNetV2 on ImageNet we could not apply knowledge distillation (as exploited by the StrasseNets baseline and our hybrid filter banks, mentioned at the end of Section 3).  Knowledge distillation historically improves accuracy by another 1-2%. We will add the performance results for MobileNetV2 with hybrid filter banks in the final version."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2533/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2533/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["dibakar.gope@arm.com", "jesse.beu@arm.com", "urmish.thakker@arm.com", "matthew.mattina@arm.com"], "title": "Ternary MobileNets via Per-Layer Hybrid Filter Banks", "authors": ["Dibakar Gope", "Jesse G Beu", "Urmish Thakker", "Matthew Mattina"], "pdf": "/pdf/1411dc4f885bb68f4f1081cd367870d510b56da1.pdf", "TL;DR": "2x savings in model size, 28% energy reduction for MobileNets on ImageNet at no loss in accuracy using hybrid layers composed of conventional full-precision filters and ternary filters", "abstract": "MobileNets family of computer vision neural networks have fueled tremendous progress in the design and organization of resource-efficient architectures in recent years.

Using this proposed quantization method, we quantized a substantial portion of weight filters of MobileNets to ternary values resulting in 27.98% savings in energy, and a 51.07% reduction in the model size, while achieving comparable accuracy and no degradation in throughput on specialized hardware in comparison to the baseline full-precision MobileNets.", "keywords": ["Model compression", "ternary quantization", "energy-efficient models"], "paperhash": "gope|ternary_mobilenets_via_perlayer_hybrid_filter_banks", "original_pdf": "/attachment/1411dc4f885bb68f4f1081cd367870d510b56da1.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\ngope2020ternary,\ntitle={Ternary MobileNets via Per-Layer Hybrid Filter Banks},\nauthor={Dibakar Gope and Jesse G Beu and Urmish Thakker and Matthew Mattina},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1lVhxSYPH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
