We will answer these questions in this thread. \n\n-   \"The correlation intuition given in the introduction isn\u2019t quite right...\" \nThe correlation intuition during training motivates us to design the proposed Kronecker-factorized covariance matrix, which works as an inductive bias when there is not enough training data to lead to the right level of correlation. This is empirically verified on the MNIST dataset when the training dataset is small.\n\n-   \"The approximate notion of empirical Bayes is not well justified...\"  \nWe agree with the reviewer that the argument works when the distribution is concentrated, but we would like to point out that when the training size is large enough, under some regularity conditions, the posterior distribution is indeed concentrated. The problem lies in the unimodality of the likelihood function, which usually does not hold in the case of NNs, but if all the modes (in terms of w) are equivalent, then the maximization of the LHS and RHS of Eq. (2) are equivalent, so this does not affect the choice of \\theta.\n\n-   \"This is because the optimization of the model parameters still remains approximate...\" \nAgain, we agree with the reviewer that due to the nonconvexity of NNs, Line 2 of Alg. 1 is not guaranteed to find a global solution, hence the limiting point of Alg. 1 is only a stationary point, from which it is very hard to theoretically analyze the properties of the final estimator. This is indeed one of the main difficulties we encountered during our analysis, and it is not clear to us at this point there is a way to get around of this problem, but it is definitely an interesting problem that deserves further investigation.\n\n-   \"A couple of comments about algorithm 1...\" \nThanks for pointing out the conflicting notation! We have fixed this in our updated version of the paper. The role of the constants u and v are used to prevent possible degenerate solutions due to the fact that the positive definite cone is an open set, hence it is possible that the objective function is unbounded. Constants u and v essentially make the domain compact, from which it is guaranteed that the optimal solution exists. \n\nIn experiments, we can choose the value by cross-validation. Based on our experience, u = 1e-3 and v = 1e3 should work for the datasets used in this paper.\n\n-   \"The experimental results are a bit oversold...\" \nThis is a great question. We would like to bring the reviewer's attention that in Fig. 3 we also show the cross-entropy loss on the test sets, by which we want to show that these better local optima found during training also generalize better on the test set. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper403/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper403/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper403/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning From the Experience of Others: Approximate Empirical Bayes in Neural Networks", "abstract": "Learning deep neural networks could be understood as the combination of representation learning and learning halfspaces.

This paper is too heuristic, but the results are encouraging.", "review": "This paper first proposes an intuition that when training, neural network weights tend to be correlated. It then suggests to make this correlation more specific, and does so using a heuristic algorithm based on approximate empirical Bayes.\n\nThe paper is generally well written, in the sense that everything that is done is clearly stated. However why things are done the way they are is less clear.\n\n-\tThe correlation intuition given in the introduction isn\u2019t quite right (if the training does it anyway, why try to push it even more?). The better way to think about the benefit of correlations is to say that some weak form of weight sharing may help.\n\n-\tThe approximate notion of empirical Bayes is not well justified.  The arguments given are all about concentration and essentially unimodality. The successive MAP perspective is interesting, but again not clear why we the joint maximization of (4) won\u2019t place us far from the smoothed version of (1).\n\n-\tNot only is the AEB principle a heuristic, but the implementation via Algorithm 1 is itself a heuristic to this heuristic. This is because the optimization of the model parameters still remains approximate (due to the local search aspect), even if the optimization of the hyperparameters is shown to be exactly solvable. In the end we end up with a stationary point of the AEB objective, for which we have even less theoretical insight, even if the empirical evidence is promising.\n\n-\tA couple of comments about algorithm 1. First, the \\theta notation is flipped to refer to the model parameters, instead of the hyperparameters, and it should be fixed. Second, the role of the constant u and v is a bit unclear. On the surface, they provide extra regularization to the hyperparameters. But then, how do we choose them?\n\n-\tThe experimental results are a bit oversold. First, we have SGD methods that do thrive in smaller batch size regimes, and it\u2019s disingenuous to handicap them with larger batch sizes, when they were performing comparable at smaller ones. It *is* interesting that AED makes the learning batch-size insensitive, and I wish that was elaborated more, to see if it\u2019s a prevalent property in other data sets too. Also, the authors define better local optima is by saying that they reach a lower value of training loss. This is claimed and shown. Usually we think of them as those leading to better generalization. This is claimed, but not shown that these are indeed those that generalize better. Figure 3 (which I assume shows training cross-entropy) shows one outcome among many (the many that are averaged in the other plots), and it could very well be that this outcome did not generalize as well.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, I believe this paper is another welcome push to introducing empirical Bayes ideas into neural networks (though it\u2019s not the first), and the empirical evidence seems to indicate that there is indeed something there to investigate further, so I give it a weak accept.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper403/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning From the Experience of Others: Approximate Empirical Bayes in Neural Networks", "abstract": "Learning deep neural networks could be understood as the combination of representation learning and learning halfspaces.

We would like to point out this work does NOT use Kronecker factorization of the covariance matrices. Instead, the main idea here is to approximate the Hessian matrix (which is also the Fisher information matrix when optimizing log-likelihoods) using Kronecker factorization to approximate the curvature of the loss function in second-order optimization methods. While in our work the Kronecker factorization is enforced on the covariance matrices of the matrix-variate prior distribution.\n\n2.  \"https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02390\". Again, the Kronecker factorization is used to approximate the Hessian in this paper as well, not the covariance matrices. \n\n3.  \"https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02117\". There are three main differences here. First, we focus on the Empirical Bayes method with matrix-variate normal prior, while in this work it is the tensor normal distribution that is used for multitask learning. Second, the optimization formulation is different: while we explicitly take into account the positive definite constraint in (5) and (10), the one in this work needs to have a fudge factor (see Eq. (11)) to avoid the pathological case encountered during optimization. Third, and perhaps most importantly, we propose a block coordinate descent algorithm that has analytic closed form solution to optimize both covariance matrices, while the optimization alg. used in the paper is purely gradient descent for all the parameters. \n\n\n- \"Results are reported on a simple regression task (SARCOS) and multiclass classification problems (MNIST & CIFAR10) using a neural network with a single hidden layer.\" \nWe politely disagree with the reviewer. Both networks in both experiments contain multiple hidden layers, and we also extend the approach so that it could be applied into convolution layers as well.\n\n- \"Moreover, \"in all the experiments, the AEB algorithm is performed on the softmax layer...\"\nWe would like to point out that we also did experiments with all the layers, and results are discussed in the second paragraph of the ablation study section. We also extend our approach to convolutional layers, see the first paragraph of the ablation study and Fig. 4 for more details. \n\n- Figure 5 does not really exhibit interesting learned structure in the correlation matrix.

We hope to take this chance to clarify several misconceptions that the reviewer had about the paper. At a high level, we want to emphasize that the contributions in this paper, including the empirical Bayes framework with Kronecker factorized prior for learning neural nets and the proposed optimization algorithm, are novel.\n\nMajor comments:\n- \"The use of empirical Bayes is not novel in the context of neural networks...\" \nWe will highlight the connections and differences of these three works with ours here. \n1.  \"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6864-an-empirical-bayes-approach-to-optimizing-machine-learning-algorithms.pdf\". This paper mainly discusses Bayes Empirical Bayes method for choosing the hyper-hyperparameters of ML models, a.k.a., the Type-III MLE method, see Eq. (3) in the paper. As a comparison, our approach could be understood as a Type-II MLE method. On the technical side, this paper does not deal with matrix-variate prior with Kronecker structure, and it proposes to use Monte Carlo sampling to approximate both the marginal likelihood and the prior distribution (in order to optimize the hyper-prior distribution over \\lambda in the paper). While in our work we study the specific matrix-variate prior with Kronecker product that is well motivated from learning neural networks, and we propose an analytic solution that could be computed in closed form to find the MAP, which means we don't use any Monte Carlo samplings. \n\n2.  \"Recasting Gradient-Based Meta-Learning as Hierarchical Bayes\". Note that we have already discussed this paper in the last paragraph of page 2. A high-level summary: instead of using point estimate, this paper discusses about approximating the marginal distribution using the Laplacian method. Again, this paper does not talk about the specific Kronecker factorization prior, and the context of this paper is to interpret the meta-learning algorithm from the perspective of EB, which is very interesting, but is orthogonal to our approach. \n\n3.  \"Conditional Neural Processes\". To the best of our knowledge, this paper discusses about how to incorporate inference in the Gaussian process into a NN training regime. It does not talk about Empirical Bayes nor Kronecker-product prior.\n\n\n- \"In particular, one iteration of credit assignment via backpropagation in a one-layer neural network does not adequately describe the complex interactions between parameters of a nonlinear model over the course of an optimization procedure such as the one used in line 2 of Algorithm 1\"\nWe would like to point out that Line 2 in Alg. 1 does not only optimize the network in one iteration, instead, it optimizes the network until a stationary point has been found. This can be found in the optimization paragraph in the experiment section and can also be seen from Fig. 3, where there are only two outer blocks and each inner loop optimizes the network in 50 iterations. \n\n\n- \"The submission lacks clarity on the assumptions entailed by using the proposed methodology, namely that the Kronecker factors are assumed positive definite.\" \nPlease check the constraints in the optimization problems in Eq. (5) and (10), which have explicitly made it clear that both are positive definite.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper403/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper403/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper403/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning From the Experience of Others: Approximate Empirical Bayes in Neural Networks", "abstract": "Learning deep neural networks could be understood as the combination of representation learning and learning halfspaces.

Given a setting of the neural network weights, the Kronecker factors can be found in closed form by solving a convex optimization problem. \n\nStrengths:\n+ The paper provides a thorough theoretical motivation for computing a positive definite factorization of the regularization term in the empirical Bayes setup.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The novelty of the method is overstated.\n- The method is claimed to be efficient, but each iteration requires an inner loop of solving a MAP problem (via gradient descent on the negative log likelihood with an extra regularization term), which is at least as expensive as a standard training run.\n- The submission lacks precise technical writing, and many technical details appear in inappropriate places, such as the introduction.\n- The experimental evaluation is not strong.\n\nMajor comments:\n- The use of empirical Bayes is not novel in the context of neural networks despite the submission's claim that \"Existing studies on\nparametric empirical Bayes methods focus on the setting where the likelihood function and the prior are assumed to have specific forms\" (pg. 1). In particular, see e.g., https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6864-an-empirical-bayes-approach-to-optimizing-machine-learning-algorithms.pdf, https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08930, https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01613 for the use of non-conjugate likelihoods in empirical Bayes.\n- The cited motivation for the use of a matrix-variate normal prior over the weights of a neural network is weak. In particular, one iteration of credit assignment via backpropagation in a one-layer neural network does not adequately describe the complex interactions between parameters of a nonlinear model over the course of an optimization procedure such as the one used in line 2 of Algorithm 1. In addition, a learned prior can be used to introduce additional correlations between parameters, so it is strange to describe the learned prior as \"capturing correlations\" resulting from a single weight update.\n- The submission lacks clarity on the assumptions entailed by using the proposed methodology, namely that the Kronecker factors are assumed positive definite. For instance, the logdet function is defined for positive definite (PD) matrices, the results in the paragraph titled \"Approximate Volume Minimization\" hold only for PD matrices, and the InvThresholding procedure is valid for only the same class. It should additionally be noted that this assumption is *not* required for a Kronecker factorization to be defined.\n- The submission makes heavy use of Kronecker factorization, but neglects to cite works that use a similar factorization of the covariance matrices for neural network applications (e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05671, https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02390). Furthermore, the method bears a strong similarity to https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02117 in learning a Kronecker-factored covariance structure between parameters of a neural network. Can the authors comment on the similarities and differences?\n- Results are reported on a simple regression task (SARCOS) and multiclass classification problems (MNIST & CIFAR10) using a neural network with a single hidden layer. Moreover, \"in all the experiments, the AEB algorithm is performed on the softmax layer\" (pg. 7) and the justification for this in the \"Ablations\" section is opaque to me. Was a similar restriction used for L2 weight decay regularization? I can't interpret how thorough the evaluation is without such details. It is also not clear that the approach is extensible to more complex architectures, or that there would be a significant empirical benefit if this is done. \n- Figure 5 does not really exhibit interesting learned structure in the correlation matrix. Why not plot a visualization of the learned prior, rather than the weights?\n\nMinor comments:\n- The submission needs to be checked for English grammar and style.\n- abstract: \"Learning deep neural networks could be understood as the combination of representation learning and learning halfspaces.\" This is unclear.\n- pg. 2: \"Empirically, we show that the proposed method helps the network\nconverge to better local optima that also generalize better...\"  What is a \"better\" local optimum?\n- Section 3.1 describes empirical Bayes with point estimates. Please make it clearer that this methodology is not itself a contribution of paper by citing prior work.\n- pg. 5: \"Alg. 1 terminates when a stationary point is found.\" What exactly is the stopping criterion?\n- pg. 6: The labels in Figure 2 are extremely small. Moreover, please keep the y-axis range constant.\n- pg. 6, Figure 2 caption: \"AEB improves generalization under both minibatch settings and is most beneficial when training set is small.\" Do the CIFAR10 results not show the opposite effect, that the regularization is most beneficial when the training set is large?\n- pg. 7: \"Batch Normalization suffers from large batch size in CIFAR10\" weird wording\n- pg. 8: \"One future direction is to develop a better approximate solution to optimize the two covariance matrices from the marginal log-likelihood function.\" This is unclear.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper403/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning From the Experience of Others: Approximate Empirical Bayes in Neural Networks", "abstract": "Learning deep neural networks could be understood as the combination of representation learning and learning halfspaces.
