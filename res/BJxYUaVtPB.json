The paper replaces the previously proposed conventional statistical models with a deep learning architecture and achieve superior performance than some of the baselines. The experiments show the efficacy of the proposed methods.\n\nI have some major concerns with this paper. These are described below:\n\n1.  The paper presentation is not very clear. The paper contains many imprecise statements. The problem is not setup very well. \n(a) The abstract and the introduction  contains vague statements with no proper description of what the technique is about. \n(b) In introduction, the authors start with discussing 1-sized pairwise comparisons, and then suddenly are discussing in-group items effects at the end of the third paragraph, so that means they are talking about M-sized comparisons with M > 1. This adds to the confusion.\n(c) The same things holds true for the first paragraph in \"Main Contribution\". Since the authors are using deep learning frameworks, this does not mean the authors \"can infer the underlying models accurately.\" I am not sure what the authors wanted to convey with this statement. \n(d) The reason I am being very stringent with impreciseness of the statements is majorly after reading the first statement in the Motivation section. It says, \"Our decision to incorporate two modules R and P into our architecture has been inspired by SOME state-of-the-art algorithms developed under CERTAIN statistical models, which have been shown\ntherein to be OPTIMAL.\" Please avoid using some, certain, optimal when they are not defined properly in the paper yet.\n \n 2. The paper mentions multiple times that it does not use statistical models tailored for a dataset or application but instead use deep neural networks. In my opinion, NN is just another form of statistical model that captures statistical patterns of comparisons and in-group interaction.  They are not following the same modeling assumptions as others but have created their own in some sense. The authors may want to rephrase those statements.\n\n3. The evaluation metric for the datasets that author consider is the prediction accuracy. I am not sure why the authors evaluate on cross entropy as well in Table 1, since both are closely related (CE is a consistent surrogate of accuracy). Can you please explain? However, I liked that they compared the methods with other metrics in Table 2. \n\n4. In problem setup, please mention M > 1. For M = 1, the problem is similar to [1] and many solutions have been proposed for that. \n\n5. I am not sure how the R and P modules capture what the authors want them to capture. I would suggest the authors to include that when they first discuss R and P modules.\n\n6. In equations 7, it is not clear how the function R(.,.,.,) and P(.,.,.) defined? Is it similar to what is described in equation 5?\n\n7. The training procedure contains the standard details; however, it is not clear to me how the modules R, P, and G interact during training.\n\nOverall, I believe the paper has a descent idea and contains satisfactory experimental results; however, the presentation of the paper is very weak at this moment. \n\n[1] Joachims, Thorsten. \"Optimizing search engines using clickthrough data.\" Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining. ACM, 2002.\n\n---- After Rebuttal ---\n\nI thank the authors for providing response to my questions and making edits to the paper. My clarity on boxes R and G has become better; however, I am still not totally convinced. Also, the presentation of the paper could be further improved. Therefore, I would keep the same score.

To make our paper more convincingly present the incorporation of the inductive bias of state-of-the-art algorithms and the addition of trainable parameters, we revised our paper based on the feedback. Below, we left detailed information of the changes for each of Reviewer 2's comments.\n\n(Scalability): We appreciate that Reviewer 2 pointed out the unclear presentation of our scalability argument. We made an attempt to make our writing clearer by clarifying our notation and revising our explanation. Please refer to the text in blue on page 3 (notation summary), and page 6 (around equations (7) and (8)).\n\n(R/P interaction): As Reviewer 2 pointed out, the activations of R/P are mutually exclusive. We could introduce more parameters so that both reward and penalty influences can be factored in per group comparison outcome, for example, by modifying the summand in equation (6) as follows: y_{AB} ( a*R + b*P ) + (1 - y_{AB}) ( (1-a)*R + (1-b)*P ) where a and b are new parameters. However, we thought it would further complicate the architecture and training procedure. Thus, we designed R/P particularly as in the current setup (where a = 1 and b = 0) for simplicity without losing intuitiveness.\n\n(Cross entropy loss): The cross entropy loss may not serve as a universal metric. Let us elaborate more on the use of cross entropy loss and prediction accuracy, and show that they are complementary rather than interchangeable. For example, from the last column in Table 1, our algorithm achieves CE loss of 0.81+ and prediction accuracy of 0.60+. The random predictor, on the other hand, always achieves CE loss of 0.69+ (= -ln(0.5)) and prediction accuracy of 0.5 (these numbers hold regardless of the ground-truth distribution). We can see that compared to the random predictor, although our algorithm shows a worse CE loss, it shows a better prediction accuracy. Worse CE losses do not always translate into worse prediction accuracies. Hence, it is informative to measure both and evaluate algorithms from multiple angles. We present this point using a concrete toy example in our revision. Please refer to the text in blue on page 9.\n\n(Baselines): As far as we know, [Menke-Martinez08] is the only NN-based algorithm available that can be applicable to our problem setup. Since additional (deep) NN-based algorithms are not available, we compared our algorithm with [Menke-Martinez08] only. Also, to demonstrate that our algorithm can be universally applicable, we compared it with other baselines that specify the underlying model to a certain statistical model. We agree that these baselines do not leverage the capability of automatic differentiation and optimization. However, this further highlights the main contribution of our work. Since our algorithm leverages the aforementioned capability, it demonstrates consistently better performances across various domains, compared to the other baselines that show inconsistent performances.\n\n(Rank Centrality Extension): We could consider variants of Rank Centrality where the group utility is computed differently than the summation of the individual utilities, and include them in our experiments. However, please note that we included HOI-SGD, which was developed to capture more delicate in-group interactions, as another baseline. We think it can be considered to be a supplementary attempt to bolster our adaptation of Rank Centrality.\n\n(Notation): We added a new paragraph in the problem setup section to clarify the notation used throughout the paper.

We hope that Reviewer 1 kindly understands the inevitable trade-off in writing and also our hard decision.\n\n1-(b): We revised the paper so that M > 1 is clearly stated in the problem setup (page 5).\n\n1-(c),(d): We revised the main contribution paragraph and motivation section to make our writing more precise and clearer. Please refer to the text in blue on pages 2, 4 and 5 in our revision.\n\n2: In addressing the comments from the reviewers, we made changes throughout the paper. Reviewer 1 may find no such statements now.\n\n3: We elaborated more on the use of both cross entropy loss and prediction accuracy in our revision. Please refer to the text in blue on page 9.\n\n4: As per Reviewer 1's comment, we explicitly stated that M > 1 in our revision (page 5).\n\n5: In an attempt to clarify our intention, we revised the motivation section. Please refer to the text in blue on pages 4 and 5.\n\n6: Unfortunately, descriptive definitions of R() and P() (as in equation (5)) are not available, since two separate NNs learn functions R() and P() by adjusting their weights. Since the functions are unknown in practice, we construct NN modules in order to learn them from data. Precise relations between reward/penalty and utility input are thus not descriptive.\n\n7: Please refer to Figure 1 on page 4. Let us focus on R only. At iteration t+1, R takes as input the refined individual estimates from previous iteration t. At iteration t, the values of both R and P are used to refine these estimates (according to equation (6)). This means that P's effect at iteration t propagates through both R and P at iteration t. The same goes for P. Hence, the effects of R and P are interleaved across multiple iterations."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper568/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper568/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Match prediction from group comparison data using neural networks", "authors": ["Sunghyun Kim", "Minje jang", "Changho Suh"], "authorids": ["koishkim@gmail.com", "jmj427@lunit.io", "chsuh@kaist.ac.kr"], "keywords": ["Neural networks", "Group comparison", "Match prediction", "Rank aggregation"], "TL;DR": "We investigate the merits of employing neural networks in the match prediction problem where one seeks to estimate the likelihood of a group of M items preferred over another, based on partial group comparison data.", "abstract": "We explore the match prediction problem where one seeks to estimate the likelihood of a group of M items preferred over another, based on partial group comparison data.

First, we can replace module G by a descriptive statistical model (such as BTL-sum, BTL-product, etc.) without changing modules R/P and investigate various aspects such as performance and training time. This will enable us to evaluate the effectiveness of module G. Second, we can combine modules R/P into a single NN and investigate performance and training time. This will also enable us to justify our choice of separating R and P, which is now based on simplicity and intuitiveness.\n\nWe agree that further ablation studies would provide a stronger justification for our proposed architecture.

The authors design a special architecture for this task inspired by previous manually designed algorithms. The authors show empirical superior performance. \n\nThe idea seems potentially interesting. I think if the authors can convincingly show that they incorporate the inductive bias of previous manually designed algorithms, and sprinkle in some trainable parameters and optimization, this could be a good paper. However, I have several concerns about the paper. \n\nI am confused about the argument about scalability. Given the input sets A and B, how are the \u201ccurrent utility\u201d computed. Some function from a set to a fixed dimensional vector is still necessary. How is this computed? In Eq(7) it seems that the input to P is a set, but this contradicts what is claimed (it is a fixed length vector?). \n\nIn Eq.(6) it seems that only one of R and P is multiplied by a non-zero coefficient. Does this basically mean we use R network when label is 0 and P network when label is 1. How is this design choice justified? \n\nIn the synthetic experiments, a cross entropy loss of 0.5+ seem very bad for binary classification. For example if the model just predicts p=0.5 (random guess) the loss should be better. It seems that the synthetic data labels are generated randomly. These dataset decisions should be better explained and justified. I think deriving the conclusion \u201cThis implies that our algorithm can be universally applied to achieve consistently high performances in a wide range of real-world match prediction applications.\u201d from four synthetic datasets seem far-fetched. \n\nFor the real world experiments, the method seems to perform marginal better on average. I think one small issue I have is as before, these accuracies (and cross entropy) are not much better than random guess, and sometimes worse. Also note that the baselines are not deep neural networks, so do not leverage the capability of automatic differentiation and optimization. \n\nThe authors\u2019 adaptation for Rank Centrality involves summing up the weights; this does not model their interaction and seem to be a weak baseline. \n\nWriting: I had some difficulty following the paper. \n\nI was confused about the notation. I didn\u2019t find the definition for many symbols such as the ones in Figure 2. \n\nA very large fraction of the paper (2 pages) describe existing work in detail, and explain which component of the prior work is manifested (philosophically) in the current work. I think this is unnecessarily cumbersome because the current work seems to be a natural instantiation of a modern neural network to this task. Alternatively if the authors can explain the connection more concretely (i.e some parameters learned by the neural network recovers models in prior work) the arguments can be convincing.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper568/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper568/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Match prediction from group comparison data using neural networks", "authors": ["Sunghyun Kim", "Minje jang", "Changho Suh"], "authorids": ["koishkim@gmail.com", "jmj427@lunit.io", "chsuh@kaist.ac.kr"], "keywords": ["Neural networks", "Group comparison", "Match prediction", "Rank aggregation"], "TL;DR": "We investigate the merits of employing neural networks in the match prediction problem where one seeks to estimate the likelihood of a group of M items preferred over another, based on partial group comparison data.", "abstract": "We explore the match prediction problem where one seeks to estimate the likelihood of a group of M items preferred over another, based on partial group comparison data.

This keeps the architecture scalable when facing large data sets in the real world.\n* The empirical result looks satisfactory on several data sets across different domains.\n* The theoretical foundation is sound.\n\nI would hope that the authors will make some effort in making the paper more approachable and  practical:\n* A more detailed motivation section for the architecture will make it much easier for the readers to understand.\n* A conclusion plus future work section could come in handy for future researchers."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper568/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper568/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Match prediction from group comparison data using neural networks", "authors": ["Sunghyun Kim", "Minje jang", "Changho Suh"], "authorids": ["koishkim@gmail.com", "jmj427@lunit.io", "chsuh@kaist.ac.kr"], "keywords": ["Neural networks", "Group comparison", "Match prediction", "Rank aggregation"], "TL;DR": "We investigate the merits of employing neural networks in the match prediction problem where one seeks to estimate the likelihood of a group of M items preferred over another, based on partial group comparison data.", "abstract": "We explore the match prediction problem where one seeks to estimate the likelihood of a group of M items preferred over another, based on partial group comparison data.
