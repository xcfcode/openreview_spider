There is a question of significance, and this is due to the fact that the empirical comparisons are still very limited. The task is an artificial one derived from MNIST. I would call this \"toy\" as well. On this toy task, the approach isn't that much different from MAML, which is not in of itself a problem, but it would be interested to have a less superficial discussion of the differences.\n\nThe authors mention that they didn't have time for a larger empirical study.

The first contribution of the paper is a novel PAC-Bayesian risk bound. This risk bound serves as an objective function for multi-task machine learning. A second contribution is an algorithm, called LAP, for minimizing a simplified version of this objective function. LAP algorithm uses several training tasks to learn a prior distribution P over hypothesis space. This prior distribution P is then used to find a posterior distribution Q that minimizes the same objective function over the test task. The third contribution is an empirical evaluation of LAP over toy dataset of two clusters and over MNIST.\n\nWhile the paper has the title of \"life-long learning\", the authors admit that all experiments are in multi-task setting, where\nthe training is done over all tasks simultaneously. The novel risk bound and LAP algorithm can definitely be applied to life-long setting, where training tasks are available sequentially. But since there is no empirical evaluation in this setting, I suggest to adjust the title of the paper. \n \nThe novel risk bound of the paper is an extension of the bound from [Pentina & Lampert, ICML 2014]. The extension seems to be quite significant. Unlike the bound of [Pentina & Lampert, ICML 2014], the new bound allows to re-use many different PAC-Bayesian complexity terms that were published previously. \n\nI liked risk bound and optimization sections of the paper. But I was less convinced by the empirical experiments. Since \nthe paper improves the risk bound of [Pentina & Lampert, ICML 2014], I expected to see an empirical comparison of LAP and optimization  algorithm from the latter paper. To make such comparison fair, both optimization algorithms should use the same base algorithm, e.g. ridge regression, as in [Pentina & Lampert, ICML 2014]. Also I suggest to use the datasets from the latter paper.  \n\nThe experiment with multi-task learning over MNIST dataset looks interesting, but it is still a toy experiment. This experiment  will be more convincing with more sophisticated datasets (CIFAR-10, ImageNet) and architectures (e.g. Inception-V4, ResNet). \n\nMinor remarks:\nSection 6, line 4: \"Combing\" -> \"Combining\"\nPage 14, first equation: There should be \"=\" before the second expectation.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Lifelong Learning by Adjusting Priors", "abstract": "In representational lifelong learning an agent aims to continually learn to solve novel tasks while updating its representation in light of previous tasks.

I read the paper with interest, but I have two concerns about the main theoretical result (Theorem 1, lifelong learning PAC-Bayes bound).\n* Firstly, the bound is valid for a [0,1]-valued loss, which does not comply with the losses used in the experiments (Euclidean distance and cross-entropy). This is not a big issue, as I accept that the authors are mainly interested in the learning strategy promoted by the bound. However, this should clearly appear in the theorem statement.\n* Secondly, and more importantly, I doubt that the uaw of the meta-posterior as a distribution over priors for each task is valid. In Proposition 1 (the classical single-task PAC-Bayes bound), the bound is valid with probability 1-delta for one specific choice of prior P, and this choice must be independent of the learning sample S. However, it appears that the bound should be valid uniformly for all P in order to be used in Theorem 1 proof (see Equation 18). From a learning point of view, it seems counterintuitive that the prior used in the KL term to learn from a task relies on the training samples (i.e., the same training samples are used to learn the meta-posterior over priors, and the task specific posterior).  \n\nA note about the experiments:\nI am slightly disappointed that the authors compared their algorithm solely with methods learning from fewer tasks. I would like to see the results obtained by another method using five tasks. A simple idea would be to learn a network independently for each of the five tasks, and consider as a meta-prior an isotropic Gaussian distribution centered on the mean of the five learned weight vectors.\n\nTypos and minor comments:\n- Equation 1: \\ell is never explicitly defined.\n- Equation 4: Please explicitly define m in this context (size of the learning sample drawn from tau).\n- Page 4, before Equation 5: A dot is missing between Q and \"This\".\n- Page 7, line 3: Missing parentheses around equation number 12.\n- Section 5.1.1, line 5: \"The hypothesis class is a the set of...\"\n- Equation 17: Q_1, ...

Actually, such methods can be seen as minimizing a bound on the generalization error, but with a complexity terms of the  KLD  between posterior and prior, which is less tight than the bounds in the paper.  We compared the results of  such an objective ( which is referred to as LAP-KLD in section 6) and showed that it performed much worse.\n\n* We rewrote the proof - hopefully it is clearer.  (see section 3.2 for overview and 8.1 for the full proof).\nIn section 8.2  we also added a bound in which the the KL term can vanish at a rate of 1/m (number of samples) if the empirical error is low.
