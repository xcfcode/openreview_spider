In the revised paper, we have performed comparisons to both TA-GAN (NeurIPS2018) and Obj-GAN (CVPR2019), introduced additional ablation studies, and added results on text-to-face-image generation. The main additions to the paper are highlighted in blue. Below we first respond to all reviewers.\n\n1) Additional baselines are included:\n\nIn the original version, for the text-to-image generation task, we focused on comparing to StackGAN++, HDGAN, and AttnGAN, as shown in Table 1, mainly because these models and the proposed ones only need texts as the input to generate images at the testing stage. In the revised paper, we have followed your suggestions to add comparisons to TA-GAN and Obj-GAN, which both require additional information beyond texts as the input.\n\n1.1) Comparison with TA-GAN:\n\nTA-GAN is not applicable to the conventional text-to-image (T2I) generation task as it also requires a real image as part of the input. For this reason, we have now compared to it on the same image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks considered in TA-GAN. We have added Section 3.3 to provide quantitative evaluations, which show that VHE-raster-scan-GAN performs slightly better than TA-GAN on image-to-text retrieval while slightly worse on text-to-image retrieval. Note TA-GAN needs to extract its text features based on the fastText model  (Bojanowski et al., 2017) pre-trained on a large corpus, while VHE-raster-scan-GAN learns everything directly from the current dataset in an end-to-end manner.\n\n1.2) Comparison with Obj-GAN:\n\nWe have added Obj-GAN for comparison into Table 1 and example images in Figs. 13 and 27, with some discussion added in Section 3.1 and Appendix G. For T2I generation, while Obj-GAN, with the help of object bounding boxes and labels, clearly outperforms the other methods in terms of the FID score, it underperforms VHE-raster-scan-GAN in terms of both the IS score and the visual quality and diversity of the generated images.  Besides the need of a pre-trained bi-LSTM word vectors, similar to StackGAN++, HDGAN, and AttnGAN, it also needs more side-information: the bounding boxes and labels of the objects in the images to train box and shape generators. By contrast, our proposed models build relationships between the original images and texts directly, without any extra pre-trained linguistic models or side-information on object bounding boxes and labels, making them easier to use in practice. \n\n2) Additional ablation studies are performed:\n\nWe have added additional ablation studies across different modules. The original version included the following models for ablation studies: PGBN+StackGAN++, VHE-StackGAN++, VHE-L3 (without GAN part), and VHE-raster-scan-GAN with different layers of document decoder. In the revised paper, as shown in Fig. 1, we have added two new models for ablation study, whose results are shown in Table 2, and added related discussion in Section 3.1. These additional ablation studies have further demonstrated the benefits of having both the stacking structure and raster-scan structure that is invented in this paper.\n\n3) On the versatility of the proposed deep generative models:\n\nWe'd like to emphasize that our proposed deep generative models achieve state-of-the-art results in T2I tasks, while not being designed solely for that purpose. They provide bidirectional transformations that make them distinct from existing models that can only provide unidirectional transformations. As discussed in the paper, ours are able to perform not only T2I tasks given short texts, but also T2I tasks given textual attributes (Fig. 3a and Fig. 7) or long documents (Fig. 3b and Fig. 8), image to text generation (Fig. 6a), random noise to image and text pairs generation (Fig. 6b), and image to image reconstruction (Fig. 19). Moreover, VHE-raster-scan-GAN exploits the explicit hierarchical relationships between images and text (Figs. 4 and 5) to help us to achieve the state-of-the-art results on text-based zero-short-learning tasks (Table 4).\n\nBelow please find our response to each individual reviewer.

We'd like to strongly argue against these comments that were used to support the low rating. Please see our point-by-point response below.\n\nFirst, we emphasize that the proposed VHE-GANs are deep generative models that can not only perform text-to-image generation tasks, but also many other tasks, such as text based zero shot learning (image-to-text) and noise to image-text pairs generation. Please see our \"Response to All\" on the versatility of the proposed models. \n\nSecond, a key motivation of the paper is to build VHE-raster-scan-GAN. While it does include a variety existing modeling components, both the VHE-GAN framework, which integrates various components for bidirectional image-text modeling, and the raster-scan structure, which leads to state-of-the-art results in a variety of tasks, are first proposed in this paper. Please see our \"Response to All\" on additional ablation studies that have been added to better demonstrate the importance of having both the stacking structure and raster-scan structure. \n\nThird, we did explain the intuition of why using the the PGBN deep topic model (together with the raster-scan structure) in multiple places, such as in the last paragraph of Section 2.2, first paragraph of Section 2.3, and last paragraph of Section 3.1. More specifically, a key intuition behind VHE-raster-scan-GAN is to use the PGBN deep topic model to help capture hierarchical semantic structures, which are related to coarse-to-fine visual concepts with the help of the raster-scan structure, as visually demonstrated in Figs. 4, 5, 21-23 and a variety of comparisons between VHE-StackGAN++ and VHE-raster-scan-GAN. Higher layer topics are mainly related to the general shapes and colors of objects, or backgrounds, while the lower layer ones are focused on finer details. VHE-raster-scan-GAN exploits the hierarchical semantic structure, which matches coarse-to-fine visual concepts, to gradually refine its generation under the proposed VHE-GAN framework.\n\nFourth, we note in the original submission, we did include AttnGAN for comparison in Table 1, and an ablation study in Table 4 to examine the effect of varying the depth of PGBN used in VHE-raster-scan-GAN, as discussed in the last paragraph of Section 3.2. In Fig. 2 of our original manuscript, we did not show the results of AttnGAN as it provided  no results on Flower.\n\nTo address your concerns, we have now added AttnGAN into Fig. 2 and more results of AttnGAN in Appendices C.2 and C.3 in our revised paper, included two additional variations of VHE-raster-scan-GAN for ablation studies, and added both TA-GAN and Obj-GAN into comparisons. The newly added discussions and results have been highlighted in blue in the revised paper.

Note limited by the rebuttal time and our computational resource, these examples facial images at 128 *128 resolution were generated from a relatively small network trained with only 20 epochs. We are working on adding more training epochs and increasing the network size and image resolution to further improve these preliminary results, which will be included in our next revision. We are also seeking facial image datasets with textual descriptions beyond only attributes (it seems that we might need to build them by our own), which will be our future work.\n\nWe released the code on Google drive to help better preserve anonymity.

The model also functions for tagging and annotating images - performing well compared to models designed *only* for this task.\n\nThe authors have done a commendable job adding detail, further analysis, and experiments in the appendix of the paper. Combined with the included code release, this paper should be of interest to many. \n\nMy chief criticisms come for the density of the paper - while it is difficult to dilute such a complex model to 8 pages, and the included appendix clarifies many questions in the text body, it would be worth further passes through the main paper with a specific focus on clarity and brevity, to aid in the accessibility of this work. \n\nAs usual, more experiments are always welcome, and given the strengths of GAN based generators for faces a text based facial image generator could have been a great addition. The existing experiments are more than sufficient for proof-of-concept though.\n\nFinally, though this version of the paper includes code directly in a google drive link it would be ideal for the final version to reference a github code link - again to aid access to interested individuals. Being able to read the code online, without downloading and opening locally can be nice, along with other benefits from open source release. However the authors should release the code however they see fit, this is more of a personal preference on the part of this reviewer.\n\nTo improve my score, the primary changes would be more editing and re-writing, focused on clarity and brevity of the text in the core paper."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1185/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1185/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variational Hetero-Encoder Randomized GANs for Joint Image-Text Modeling", "authors": ["Hao Zhang", "Bo Chen", "Long Tian", "Zhengjue Wang", "Mingyuan Zhou"], "authorids": ["zhanghao_xidian@163.com", "bchen@mail.xidian.edu.cn", "tianlong_xidian@163.com", "zhengjuewang@163.com", "mingyuan.zhou@mccombs.utexas.edu"], "keywords": ["Deep topic model", "image generation", "text generation", "raster-scan-GAN", "zero-shot learning"], "TL;DR": "A novel Bayesian deep learning framework that captures and relates hierarchical semantic and visual concepts, performing well on a variety of image and text modeling and generation tasks.", "abstract": "For bidirectional joint image-text modeling, we develop variational hetero-encoder (VHE) randomized generative adversarial network (GAN), a versatile deep generative model that integrates a probabilistic text decoder, probabilistic image encoder, and GAN into a coherent end-to-end multi-modality learning framework. VHE randomized GAN (VHE-GAN) encodes an image to decode its associated text, and feeds the variational posterior as the source of randomness into the GAN image generator. We plug three off-the-shelf modules, including a deep topic model, a ladder-structured image encoder, and StackGAN++, into VHE-GAN, which already achieves competitive performance. This further motivates the development of VHE-raster-scan-GAN that generates photo-realistic images in not only a multi-scale low-to-high-resolution manner, but also a hierarchical-semantic coarse-to-fine fashion. By capturing and relating hierarchical semantic and visual concepts with end-to-end training, VHE-raster-scan-GAN achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide variety of image-text multi-modality learning and generation tasks.
