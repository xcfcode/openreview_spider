While there is nothing in principle wrong with this, it makes objective comparison between different algorithms difficult. Though we thank you for pointing out that including such plots would improve the paper.\n\nHow do results vary with lambda? We did not thoroughly investigate the role of lambda (the weighting of the D(P_Z, Q_Z) term) on disentanglement. We simply fixed a value for this for which we observed good performance of WAEs on benchmark tasks not related to disentanglement.\n\nWe agree that results in the 5-variable sprites seem to be good only for a small set of the parameters we searched over. There is still progress to be made, even in this simple problem.\n\nHow much does the variance regularization term contribute to the results? This is the key to our results.

They find that that WAEs yield lower reconstruction errors when at similar levels of accuracy of the disentanglement metric proposed by Higgins et al. \n\nThis seems like a completely reasonable workshop submission to me. My only point of criticism would be that the authors could do a better job of comparing to related (and in some cases very recent) related work. There have been a relatively large number of recent proposals for modifications of the VAE objective aid learning of disentangled representations. Many of these objectives incorporate terms that depend on the aggregated posterior. This includes objectives that minimize the total correlation between latent variables such as proposed by Kim and Mnih, as well as (more recently) Chen et al. and Gao et al. \n\nPerhaps the most closely related example is the InfoVAE by Zhao et al, which if I understand correctly is equivalent to the WAE when c is the cross entropy and D_Z is the KL divergence (although admittedly I was not immediately able to figure out from the Wasserstein VAE paper whether there is some optimal transport stuff that factors into the WAE objective in a way that I don't understand). Assuming this method is not equivalent to the InfoVAE, then it would be interesting to see a direct comparison between these two methods. In other words, do we get better disentangled relative to the \u03b2-VAE because we regularize using a D_Z(Q_Z, P_Z) that compares the aggregate posterior to the prior (which is also the case in the InfoVAE) or is it the case that WAEs also outperform the InfoVAE? \n\nOn a related note, I was not able to find what the divergence measure D_Z(Q_Z, P_Z) the authors use. Is this a GAN-style objective, the MMD, or simply the KL divergence? Note in this context that Kim & Mnih also use a GAN-style discriminator to minimize the total correlation. \n\nMinor\n\n- What is the difference between P_G(X | Z) and G(Z) here?\n\nReferences\n\n1.
