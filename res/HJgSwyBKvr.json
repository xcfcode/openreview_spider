We will adjust our paper accordingly to emphasize that consistency and restrictiveness are primarily intended as tools for theoretical analysis.\n\nRegarding your hypothesis that using consistency and restrictiveness metrics for model selection will select for less informative models, our finding on synthetic datasets is that this is not the case (Appendix G provides visualizations of the models selected by consistency. The latent interpolations indicate that the representations are informative). As such, we believe that uninformativeness is unlikely to be a confounder for Figure 4. To verify this, we will investigate this further and check, for example, that the (high-consistency + high-restrictiveness) models in Figure 4 are not attributable to uninformativeness. We apologize for not conducting this analysis before the rebuttal deadline, but we are confident about our hypothesis and will commit to releasing this analysis when it is ready.\n\nFor non-synthetic datasets where $g(Z)$ and $g^*(S)$ are likely to deviate considerably from each other, we agree that using solely consistency/restrictiveness for model selection may be biased toward uninformativeness models. One potential way to defend against uninformative models would be to estimate the mutual information between $X$ and $Z$ (which can be done in an unsupervised manner) and restrict model selection to models above a certain information threshold. Ultimately, however, we believe that model selection is best done with a proper disentanglement scoring rule, and that the development of such a scoring rule is still an open and important question."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1764/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1764/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Weakly Supervised Disentanglement with Guarantees", "authors": ["Rui Shu", "Yining Chen", "Abhishek Kumar", "Stefano Ermon", "Ben Poole"], "authorids": ["ruishu@stanford.edu", "cynnjjs@stanford.edu", "abhishk@google.com", "ermon@cs.stanford.edu", "pooleb@google.com"], "keywords": ["disentanglement", "theory of disentanglement", "representation learning", "generative models"], "TL;DR": "We construct a theoretical framework for weakly supervised disentanglement and conducted lots of experiments to back up the theory.", "abstract": "Learning disentangled representations that correspond to factors of variation in real-world data is critical to interpretable and human-controllable machine learning.

The goal of this paper is to clarify some confusion regarding the concept of disentanglement in the current literature, and to build up a theoretical framework that clarifies the guarantees actually conferred by several popular weak supervision methods. And we hope that you will re-assess the merits of our paper with this perspective in mind.\n\n\nOn the Significance of our Theoretical Analysis\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nFirst, we would like to emphasize the inherent value of studying the theoretical guarantees of various weak supervision methods. Theorem 2 shows that existing approaches such as restricted-labeling in style-content disentanglement literature do not actually provide disentanglement guarantees. In contrast, employing our calculus and Theorem 1 allows us to design weak supervision methods that guarantee disentanglement. We believe our demonstration is of inherent value, as it exemplifies the theoretical analysis of guarantees that have so far eluded the disentanglement community. In light of the findings in Locatello et al. (2019) regarding the existing literature's reliance on model inductive bias, we hope the reviewer will agree that providing a proper theoretical framework for understanding weak supervision is both timely and valuable.\n\n\nOn the Significance of the Synthetic Experiments\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nThe experiment section can broadly be divided into two categories:\n\n1. Experiments to test our theoretical guarantees (Sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.3)\n\nSections 6.2.1 and 6.2.3 primarily serve as demonstrations that the guarantees in Theorem 1 can be achieved in practice with machine learning models on synthetic datasets. Since ground truth factors are available on synthetic datasets, we used this as an opportunity to take extensive measurements to validate the various facets of our theoretical statements (Figures 3-5 and 7-16). Furthermore, the synthetic datasets that we chose are common benchmarks used in the existing disentanglement literature (Locatello et al. 2019; Burgess et al. 2018; Kim et al. 2018; Ridgeway et al. 2018; Denton et al. 2017; Mathieu et al. 2016; Watters et al. 2019). The performances of our models on existing disentanglement metrics (Figure 13) can also be directly compared with the scores reported in Locatello et al. (2019).\n\nWe agree that the use of non-synthetic data would further enhance the validation of these theoretical guarantees, but we hope that this does not detract from the legitimacy and extensive nature of our existing experiments.\n\n2. Experiments that assess the gap between theory and practice (6.2.2)\n\nFigure 4 of Section 6.2.2 addresses the following question: if Theorem 2 states that disentanglement is not guaranteed in, for example, style-content disentanglement, why have we as a community not established this as common knowledge yet? \n\nFigure 4 shows that the correlation between consistency and restrictiveness is quite strong across models tested across a broad range of hyperparameters. This finding leads us to make the following two conclusions.\n\n1. It is easy to mistake the practical reliability of style-content disentanglement as a theoretical guarantee. \n\n2. The practical reliability of style-content disentanglement is poorly understood and we wish to call attention to the need to provide a proper theoretical characterization of this reliability.\n\nWe believe both conclusions are important in contextualizing the current literature on weakly supervised disentanglement, and hope that more researchers will be aware of these findings. \n\n\nOn the Practicality of Weak Supervision Methods with Guarantees\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSince our paper shows examples of weak supervision methods that guarantee disentanglement, the reviewer is rightfully concerned about whether these methods can scale in practice.\n\nWe believe that the scalability of these methods ultimately need to be addressed on a case-by-case basis in practice. While not within the scope of our paper, we acknowledge that the following questions are both important and challenging:\n\n1. What is the actual cost of weak supervision methods with guarantees for a particular setting? \n\n2. Are there settings that admit cheaper types of weak supervision methods with guarantees, compared to the specific methods analyzed in this paper?\n\n3. In what settings are weak supervision methods (that do not have guarantees) practically reliable? And when they are reliable, why are they reliable?\n\nWe believe our paper naturally inspires these important questions. If the reviewer believes it is appropriate, we would like to include these questions as concluding thoughts in the paper to facilitate further discussion on weakly supervised disentanglement.

The authors propose to decompose disentanglement into two distinct concepts: consistency and restrictiveness. Then, a calculus of disentanglement is introduced to reveal the relationship between restrictiveness and consistency. The proposed concepts are applied to analyze weak supervision methods. \n\nThis paper is well structured. The presentation is easy to follow. The problem discussed is important to the machine learning community. The concepts discussed are supported by a large number of experiments. \n\nThe assumption that disentanglement can be decomposed into consistency and restrictiveness might be flawed. Let us consider a generator $g(Z)$  that always generates the same image for all $Z \\sim p(Z)$. Note that $g(Z)$ gives perfect consistency and perfect restrictiveness as defined in Equation (3) and (6). However, we consider $g(Z)$ is a bad generator, and we do not think the corresponding latent representation $Z$ achieves perfect disentanglement. Note that such $Z$, in general, gives low values in the existing disentanglement metrics.\n\nThis implies that we might need to introduce a third component to disentanglement, which I call it relevance. We should additionally assume that different $z_{ \\setminus I}$ leads to different generated images. It might be challenging to measure relevance quantitatively under the probabilistic framework, but I believe this is necessary. \n\nIn summary, I think the idea presented is interesting and useful. I believe this paper is promising and impactful after proper revision.  However, I do not recommend acceptance because it looks technically flawed. \n\nMinor:\nIn Figure 5, the illustration is clear to me, but I am not sure how the vertical axis simultaneously represents two variables $z_2, z_3$.\nIn the table on page 5, $n$ represents the number of dimensions, right?\n\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1764/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1764/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Weakly Supervised Disentanglement with Guarantees", "authors": ["Rui Shu", "Yining Chen", "Abhishek Kumar", "Stefano Ermon", "Ben Poole"], "authorids": ["ruishu@stanford.edu", "cynnjjs@stanford.edu", "abhishk@google.com", "ermon@cs.stanford.edu", "pooleb@google.com"], "keywords": ["disentanglement", "theory of disentanglement", "representation learning", "generative models"], "TL;DR": "We construct a theoretical framework for weakly supervised disentanglement and conducted lots of experiments to back up the theory.", "abstract": "Learning disentangled representations that correspond to factors of variation in real-world data is critical to interpretable and human-controllable machine learning.

Now I understand that the 3 distribution matching cases in Theorem 1 imply $G(Z) \\overset{d}{=} g^*(S)$, which is a prerequisite for consistency and restrictiveness.\n\nI suggest the authors explicitly state that the consistency and restrictiveness defined in Equations (6) and (10) are more for theoretical analysis, rather than a practical metrics for disentanglement performance; because these metrics do not measure the informativeness. Note that $G(Z) \\overset{d}{=} g^*(S)$ is not likely to be true in practice. Therefore, if one uses consistency and restrictiveness metrics for model selection, it is very likely that a less informative model will be selected. In fact, I suspect the high correlation in Figure 4 $c(i)$ and $r(i)$ are due to the informativeness of the model, rather than the true relationships between consistency and restrictiveness. Because it has been observed that some disentanglement models, such as $\\beta$-VAE, give worse reconstructions when better disentanglement is achieved. This might suggest that in practice, a model that achieves a better disentanglement is likely to be less informative.\n\nI have updated my review rating because my major concerns are addressed."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1764/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1764/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Weakly Supervised Disentanglement with Guarantees", "authors": ["Rui Shu", "Yining Chen", "Abhishek Kumar", "Stefano Ermon", "Ben Poole"], "authorids": ["ruishu@stanford.edu", "cynnjjs@stanford.edu", "abhishk@google.com", "ermon@cs.stanford.edu", "pooleb@google.com"], "keywords": ["disentanglement", "theory of disentanglement", "representation learning", "generative models"], "TL;DR": "We construct a theoretical framework for weakly supervised disentanglement and conducted lots of experiments to back up the theory.", "abstract": "Learning disentangled representations that correspond to factors of variation in real-world data is critical to interpretable and human-controllable machine learning.

Overall it is a good contribution, but the message of the paper is not clear.  The authors propose two notions: consistency and restrictiveness, which they don't imply each other. However, the experiment on real data shows that they are highly correlated.   Up until the experiment section, the paper is well written (although a bit verbose). It seems that it is great but unfinished work.\n\nThe paper is well written, but in my opinion, there is too much verbosity on page 4-5 on rather trivial definitions consistency and restrictiveness and a big box in the calculus of disentanglement that steals space from the main results.  In my opinion, those sections can be reduced so that other theorem can be covered. In my opinion, the theorem nine should be part of the main text. \n\nI understand the definition of \"Sufficiency for Disentanglement \" but it is not clear why it is important. Sure, it is a strong definition that says for any  $\\mathcal{H}$ (and not a subset) the algorithm ($\\mathcal{A}$) should be able to match the distribution of the observation but why is it a big deal according to the next paragraph?\n\nI don't see any proof that Eq.11 should be between [0,1]. Yes, g is optimal, and if you enter suboptimal values to it, one expects the nominator to be less than dominator. However, g a function that is optimal in expectation, which does not mean for every s value it nominator is less than the denominator. In fact, some of the values in fig 3 are small negatives.\n\nFig 3 is not explained well: you are showing normalized consistency and restiveness. First of all, what is the dataset you tried this on? Second, why some values are negative?! These are supposed to be between [0,1]. Third, what is the take-home-message of this figure? the first two matrices from left show that the factors are consistent b/c they are almost diagonal. The third one from left shows that the algorithm you used is not restrictive? Then are you suggesting this as a metric of evaluation? I am not sure I understand the first figure from the right.\nOverall, the authors perform a significant amount of experiments, but they did a poor job in summarizing the results.\nFinally, the authors claim \n                  \"...We believe this correlation between consistency and restrictiveness to have been a general source of confusion in the disentanglement literature, causing many to either observe or believe that restricted labeling or share pairing on $S_i$ (which only guarantees consistency) is sufficient for disentangling Si ...\" \n\nEach of those methods should be analyzed separately to ensure that their algorithms do not induce restiveness. I just don't see the natural connection between your figure 4 and this conclusion that you made.\n\nMinor:\nWhere is the proof for Theorem 1? In the Supp, it starts with Theorem 8, I guess you meant Lemma 8? You need to clean up the Supp so that one can find the proof easily.

Figure 3 is a condensed version of a subset of the results shown in Figures 7, 8, 9, and 10. The key goal of Figure 3 is to verify our hypothesis that: restricted / share / rank pairing on a particular factor guarantees consistency on that factor, and that change pairing on a particular factor guarantees restrictiveness on that factor. \n\nAs stated in the captions, this hypothesis predicts that the diagonal components of the heatmap should have the highest scores. And indeed, this is generally the case. Even for the third heatmap, the diagonal components of the heatmap achieve the highest scores by a statistically significant margin (Figure 8 column 1 provides additional quantile information not displayed in the heatmap). \n\nWe believe the reviewer\u2019s concern is moreso regarding why the margin of improvement (of diagonal v. non-diagonal scores) appears to be smaller for restrictiveness than for consistency. It is worth noting that single-factor restrictiveness measures the expected L2-discrepancy over a single factor, whereas single-factor consistency measures the expected L2-discrepancy over (n - 1) factors. This, we believe, is the main contributor to why restrictiveness scores tend to be higher than consistency scores on the off-diagonal elements. While we do not have a complete explanation for why Factors 3/4/5 for Shapes3D tended to have even higher off-diagonal restrictiveness scores than Factors 0/1/2, we note that Factors 0/1/2 control the color attributes (wall color, floor color, shape color) whereas Factors 3/4/5 control non-color attributes (object size, object shape, and azimuth). \n\nRegarding the right-most figure: each column represents a specific intersection experiment. For example, column 0 is trained on a weak supervision of S_{0, 1, 2} and S_{0, 3, 4, 5}. Thus, by the calculus of intersection, only consistency of factor 0 (i.e. S_0) is guaranteed. \n\n\nRegarding the Use of Consistency and Restrictiveness as Metrics\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe wish to emphasize that consistency and restrictiveness are intended primarily as concepts that establish the theoretical guarantees possible with weak supervision, and not as metrics that should be used in practice for evaluating disentanglement. In our paper, we converted these concepts into metrics (i.e. normalized consistency and restrictiveness scores) solely as a means of probing the behavior the models and for checking whether the behavior is consistent with our theoretical guarantees. \n\nAs probes, normalized consistency and restrictiveness also allow us to identify models that are consistent but not restrictiveness for a particular factor (and vice versa). As evident from Figure 4, such models do exist. We have added appendix B to illustrate two prototypical examples of models from disentanglement_lib that are consistent but not restrictive (and vice versa) that we found using our normalized consistency and restrictiveness probes across the population of 12800 pretrained models.\n\nWhile we do have some experiments demonstrating that summary statistics using consistency/restrictiveness can serve as reasonable surrogate metrics for the selection of disentangled models (see Figure 16 and Appendix F), we believe the development of a proper disentanglement scoring rule remains an open problem. We note that the primary goal of this paper is not to develop such a metric. Our goal is to clarify some confusion regarding the concept of disentanglement in the current literature, and to build up a theoretical framework that clarifies the guarantees (or lack thereof) that are actually conferred by various weak supervision methods."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1764/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1764/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Weakly Supervised Disentanglement with Guarantees", "authors": ["Rui Shu", "Yining Chen", "Abhishek Kumar", "Stefano Ermon", "Ben Poole"], "authorids": ["ruishu@stanford.edu", "cynnjjs@stanford.edu", "abhishk@google.com", "ermon@cs.stanford.edu", "pooleb@google.com"], "keywords": ["disentanglement", "theory of disentanglement", "representation learning", "generative models"], "TL;DR": "We construct a theoretical framework for weakly supervised disentanglement and conducted lots of experiments to back up the theory.", "abstract": "Learning disentangled representations that correspond to factors of variation in real-world data is critical to interpretable and human-controllable machine learning.

We wish to address your concerns as follows.\n\nRegarding the message of the paper\n-------------------------------------------------\nThe goal of this paper is to clarify some confusion regarding the concept of disentanglement in the current literature, and to build up a theoretical framework that clarifies the guarantees actually conferred by several popular weak supervision methods\n\n\nRegarding the seeming verbosity of the definitions\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs evident from Figure 2, consistency and restrictiveness are distinct concepts that play critical roles in theory. We agree that there is a noticeable contrast in the simplicity of the intuition of consistency/restrictiveness versus the lengthy mathematical description. Although those concepts are intuitive, the mathematical formalism we give is carefully designed with several important subtleties in mind:\n\n1. The specific sampling procedure in Eq (1, 2) and Eq (4, 5) are important for ensuring that the definition of disentanglement allows for correlated but interpretable features (similar to Suter et al 2018). We note that many existing definitions for disentanglement break down when the ground truth factors are correlated, and so we believe it is important to break away from the trend of making the definition of disentanglement implicitly reliant on the assumption of statistically independent ground truth factors.\n\n2. Since consistency and restrictiveness are asymmetric concepts, generator-side consistency and restrictiveness and encoder-side consistency and restrictiveness are highly related, but not completely identical concepts. And this is the reason why Theorem 1 explicitly provides guarantee for both generator and encoder-side consistency.\nWe aim to further simplify our exposition in future iterations of the paper.\n\n\nRegarding the Sufficiency for Disentanglement Formalism\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe primary significance of this section is in formalizing what is meant by particular supervision method being insufficient. Our definition of sufficiency aims to distinguish the guarantees that arise solely from the choice of supervision versus the inductive bias of architecture or the objective function. Locatello et al.\u2019s impossibility result is restricted to a specific kind of learning algorithm (matching p_data(x) with p_theta(x)). In contrast, our definition for sufficiency is agnostic to the choice of learning algorithm and inductive bias.\n\n\nRegarding normalized consistency/restrictiveness scores\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe proof for why the score is bounded between [0, 1] directly follows from Lemma 1 in the Appendix I.2.1. We have updated the paper to make this connection explicit. Because the scores in the figure are estimated via monte carlo sampling, the monte carlo estimator is not guaranteed to be within the interval [0, 1]. However, we hope it is evident from the magnitude of the negative numbers (and from Figures 8, 9, 10) that the small negative values are noisy estimates of a score of zero."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1764/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1764/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Weakly Supervised Disentanglement with Guarantees", "authors": ["Rui Shu", "Yining Chen", "Abhishek Kumar", "Stefano Ermon", "Ben Poole"], "authorids": ["ruishu@stanford.edu", "cynnjjs@stanford.edu", "abhishk@google.com", "ermon@cs.stanford.edu", "pooleb@google.com"], "keywords": ["disentanglement", "theory of disentanglement", "representation learning", "generative models"], "TL;DR": "We construct a theoretical framework for weakly supervised disentanglement and conducted lots of experiments to back up the theory.", "abstract": "Learning disentangled representations that correspond to factors of variation in real-world data is critical to interpretable and human-controllable machine learning.

We would like to address your concern regarding the issue of degenerate generators that always output the same image for all choices of $Z$. In our paper, we referred to such a latent space $Z$ as being \u201cuninformative\u201d.\n\nThis scenario is explicitly prevented by our requirement, stated on page 3, that our analysis is subject to the condition that \u201c$g(Z)$ =d= $g^*(S)$ are equal in distribution\u201d. We would like to emphasize that the decomposition of disentanglement into restrictiveness and consistency is appropriate when this condition ($g(Z)$ =d= $g^*(S)$) is satisfied, otherwise we would indeed be admitting degenerate models that have uninformative latent spaces. We addressed this point once again on page 6, stating that\n\n\u201cThe distribution matching requirement $g(Z)$ =d= $g^*(S)$ ensures latent code informativeness, i.e., preventing trivial solutions where the latent code is uninformative (see Theorem 7 for formal statement)\u201d\n\nIn the appendix, Theorem 7 formalizes what it means for the latent space to be informative and states that informativeness of the latent space is guaranteed when $g(Z)$ =d= $g^*(S)$. The formal statement and proof are available on Page 33.\n\nIn other words, our proposed concepts of consistency and restrictiveness are best thought of as complementing latent code informativeness, and not as replacements for checking the informativeness of the latent code. We also wish to note that our theoretical guarantees in Theorem 1 explicitly require $g(Z)$ =d= $g^*(S)$. This is because the distribution matching setup in Theorem 1 implies distribution matching of $g(Z)$ with $g^*(S)$. \n\nAs such, with respect to our theoretical analysis, we hope that you will agree that our submission takes careful measures to explicitly combat the type of degeneracy that you pointed out. \n\nIn practice, when distribution matching is not guaranteed, we fully support that practitioners should check for both latent code informativeness in addition to restrictiveness and consistency. Ultimately, we note that generator restrictiveness and consistency are concepts that complement latent code informativeness, and not replacements for it. We will strive to make this point even clearer when we update the paper.\n\n---\n\nRegarding minor comments:\nIn Figure 2, the way to interpret the vertical axis is that each row corresponds to a randomly sampled choice of $(z_2, z_3)$. This is stated in the caption as, \u201ceach row denotes a fixed choice of $(z_2, z_3)$\u201d. \n\nIn the calculus, you are correct that $n$ denotes the number of dimensions. We shall make this point clear when updating our paper. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1764/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1764/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Weakly Supervised Disentanglement with Guarantees", "authors": ["Rui Shu", "Yining Chen", "Abhishek Kumar", "Stefano Ermon", "Ben Poole"], "authorids": ["ruishu@stanford.edu", "cynnjjs@stanford.edu", "abhishk@google.com", "ermon@cs.stanford.edu", "pooleb@google.com"], "keywords": ["disentanglement", "theory of disentanglement", "representation learning", "generative models"], "TL;DR": "We construct a theoretical framework for weakly supervised disentanglement and conducted lots of experiments to back up the theory.", "abstract": "Learning disentangled representations that correspond to factors of variation in real-world data is critical to interpretable and human-controllable machine learning.

Indeed, we expected Full-Label GAN to outperform the weakly-supervised GANs and were also surprised to find in Figure 12 that Change and Share pairing noticeably outperformed Full-Label on a number of metrics on the Cars3D dataset. While this could be attributable to a number of possible confounders (optimization issue, architectural differences, etc), our main hypothesis is that this is because one of the factors of variation in Cars3D is car-type (with labels {0, 1, \u2026, 182}), for which an ordinal representation in a single dimensional continuous latent variable may be inappropriate. \n\nWe had chosen for simplicity to use only continuous latent variables in all of our experiments (this experimental design choice mirrors the Locatello 2019 study. We shall make this point explicit when we update the paper appendix). This means that Full-Labeling (and Rank Pairing), which imposes a specific ordering for how the car types are embedded along the latent dimension z3 (if one-indexing), may have trouble with using z3 to encode the car-type in the order prescribed by the actual labels. In contrast, Change and Share pairing do not have to adhere to the ordering prescribed by the car-type label. We believe this additional flexibility allowed for the Change/Share models to choose a more favorable ordering when casting car-type into a single-dimensional continuous representation, thus enabling better encoding of car-type into the latent variable z3. \n\nThis hypothesis is consistent with our interpretation of Figure 13, which shows the normalized consistency score for each label. Notice in (Figure 13, Cars column, Row 3) that Change/Share models significantly outperformed Rank/Full-Label on normalized consistency of the car-type factor, indicating that the Rank/Full-Label models had difficulty learning a representation of car-type that is consistent with the car-type labels.\n\nAs for SmallNORB, Figure 12 shows that Full-Label GAN is the top performer in 2 / 6 metrics, and a top-2 performer 5 / 6 metrics. As such, we do not think we can definitively claim that the weakly supervised GANs outperform Full-Label GAN on SmallNORB.\n\n=====\n\nWe have also uploaded an anonymized version of our code to: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VjMNOD3uFrCx4nZSgLlKrVLVbluPnGPa\n\nPlease let us know if you have any trouble running it.

Recently, concerns about the viability of learning disentangled representations in a purely unsupervised manner has spurred a shift toward the incorporation of weak supervision. However, there is currently no formalism that identifies when and how weak supervision will guarantee disentanglement. To address this issue, we provide a theoretical framework to assist in analyzing the disentanglement guarantees (or lack thereof) conferred by weak supervision when coupled with learning algorithms based on distribution matching. We empirically verify the guarantees and limitations of several weak supervision methods (restricted labeling, match-pairing, and rank-pairing), demonstrating the predictive power and usefulness of our theoretical framework.", "pdf": "/pdf/fe139691ffa60ed928c8d3d09427af0ec8ff675b.pdf", "paperhash": "shu|weakly_supervised_disentanglement_with_guarantees", "code": "https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/weak_disentangle", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nShu2020Weakly,\ntitle={Weakly Supervised Disentanglement with Guarantees},\nauthor={Rui Shu and Yining Chen and Abhishek Kumar and Stefano Ermon and Ben Poole},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgSwyBKvr}\n}", "full_presentation_video": "", "original_pdf": "/attachment/95ba345160f930a623cc62eca27c0d7f4f488416.pdf", "appendix": "", "poster": "", "spotlight_video": "", "slides": ""}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"required": true, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).
