The proposed model sets a new state-of-the-art on the CBT dataset; the new gating mechanism also improves over scalar gates without linguistic features on SQuAD and a twitter classification task. \n\nIntuitively, the vector-based gate working better than the scalar gate is unsurprising, as it is more similar to LSTM and GRU gates. The real contribution of the paper for me is that using features such as POS tags and NER help learn better gates. The visualization in Figure 3 and examples in Table 4 effectively confirm the utility of these features, very nice! \n\nIn sum, while the proposed gate is nothing technically groundbreaking, the paper presents a very focused contribution that I think will be useful to the NLP community.

It covers all the necessary prior work and compares the proposed method with previous similar models.\n\nI liked the ablation study that shows quite clearly the impact of individual contributions.\nAnd I also liked the fact that some (shallow) linguistic prior knowledge e.g., pos tags ner tags, frequency etc. has been used in a clever way. \nIt would be interesting to see if syntactic features can be helpful.\n\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Words or Characters?

We believe the inductive bias we introduce is helpful, with the following reasons:\n1. One of our baseline models uses the concatenation of character-level representation, word-level representation, and the features as the input, followed by multiple layers of LSTMs. If we only consider the feedforward depth, this model is essentially a deep feedforward network applied on the flat concatenation, so this can serve as a baseline to show that simple concatenation followed by feedforward layers fails to learn efficient representation.\n2. The number of layers is tuned as a hyper-parameter on the development set, and further increasing the number of layers increases the number of parameters and leads to overfitting. In contrast, fine-grained gating actually reduces the number of parameters, compared to concatenation.\n3.
