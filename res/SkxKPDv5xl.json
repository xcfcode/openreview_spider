This is an interesting and somewhat unintuitive result that I think warrants a bit more discussion.\n- To make sure that the model can properly model larger context it is necessary to carry the information from the past. In this model this is mostly due to passing the relevant information (e.g. phoneme-like sounds) from one 32ms chunk to the next one (stateful RNN) during Truncated BPTT. It is that some part of the memory of each tier is responsible to keep track of the broader context.\n\n> Lacking details e.g. which value of \"r\" is used for the different tiers, how many units per layer, ...\n- Added to the recent version. Please see the recent comment for changelog. Specifically, frame size values are FS_1 = FS_2 = 2 and  FS_3 = 8. 1024 GRU units per layer were showed the best performance and each tier has one layer RNN.\n\n> \"I think a comparison in terms of computational cost, training time and number of parameters would also be very informative.\"\n- Comparison: (Our re-implementation of WaveNet) vs. (SampleRNN)\nNumber of parameters (1M) vs. (21M) *\nApproximated training time memory footprint (10GB) vs. (5GB)\nMini-batch size (8) vs (128)\nTraining time (7 days) vs. (3 days)\n* We made sure to make the WaveNet model as big as possible while still fitting in one (large) GPU per model.\n\n> \"Surprisingly, Table 1 shows a vanilla RNN (LSTM) substantially outperforming this model [WaveNet] in terms of likelihood, which is quite suspicious as LSTMs tend to have effective receptive fields of a few hundred timesteps at best. One would expect the much larger receptive field of the Wavenet model to be reflected in the likelihood scores to some extent. Similarly, Figure 3 shows the vanilla RNN outperforming the Wavenet reimplementation in human evaluation on the Blizzard dataset. This raises questions about the implementation of the latter. Some discussion about this result and whether the authors expected it or not would be very welcome.\"\n- When we were replicating their results, although we were trying our best to replicate them, we had no frame of reference to compare to except for the unconditional samples. The best speculation as why LSTM is getting better numbers is similar to what I have stated in response to your first question: it is a combination of TBPTT and stateful RNN when training. This seems to be a great approximation of training on really long sequences in audio data.\n\n> Why 2-tier is outperforming the 3-tier model for music?\n- We did not expect that, but for any dataset and architecture structure, there is an optimal depth. Considering that this is a deep RNN (which introduces a form of recurrent depth, here very large) and the hypothesis that it is difficult to train such architectures in the first place, it is possible that alternative training procedures could yield better results with a deeper model.\n\n> \"This choice of upsampling method is not motivated. Why not just use linear interpolation or nearest neighbour upsampling? What is the advantage of learning this operation? Don't the r linear projections end up learning largely the same thing, give or take some noise?\"\n- The same argument is applicable to upsampling in CNNs [1] but it works better there. So we decided to borrow the same technique. There should be no problem using other methods. However if this module helps the final model, even slightly, and takes away the burden of upsampling from each individual tier, there is no reason not to use it. In addition, for small upsampling ratio this will learn the same thing give or take some noise but as the ratio grows there will be more structure which can be captured by a learned operation.\n\n> The third paragraph of Section 2.1.1 indicates that 8-bit linear PCM was used. This is in contrast to Wavenet, for which an 8-bit mu-law encoding was used, and this supposedly improves the audio fidelity of the samples. Did you try this as well?\n- Mu-law was recently tested. This is a harder representation to model and takes more time to train on. We can get good results that you can find in (https://soundcloud.com/samplernn/sets/mu-law). By the time WaveNet came out we were done by most of the experiments so due to time constraints we did not attempt to re-do everything.\n\n> Section 2.1 mentions the discretisation of the input and the use of a softmax to model this discretised input, without any reference to prior work that made the same observation. A reference is given in 2.1.1, but it should probably be moved up a bit to avoid giving the impression that this is a novel observation.\n- Citation was moved up.

The model is trained end-to-end and evaluated using log-likelihood and by human judgement of unconditional samples, on three different datasets covering speech and music. This evaluation shows the proposed model to compare favourably to the baselines.\n\nIt is shown that the subsequence length used for truncated BPTT affects performance significantly, but interestingly, a subsequence length of 512 samples (~32 ms) is sufficient to get good results, even though the features of the data that are modelled span much longer timescales. This is an interesting and somewhat unintuitive result that I think warrants a bit more discussion.\n\nThe authors have attempted to reimplement WaveNet, an alternative model of raw audio that is fully convolutional. They were unable to reproduce the exact model architecture from the original paper, but have attempted to build an instance of the model with a receptive field of about 250ms that could be trained in a reasonable time using their computational resources, which is commendable.\n\nThe architecture of the Wavenet model is described in detail, but it found it challenging to find the same details for the proposed SampleRNN architecture (e.g. which value of \"r\" is used for the different tiers, how many units per layer, ...). I think a comparison in terms of computational cost, training time and number of parameters would also be very informative.\n\nSurprisingly, Table 1 shows a vanilla RNN (LSTM) substantially outperforming this model in terms of likelihood, which is quite suspicious as LSTMs tend to have effective receptive fields of a few hundred timesteps at best. One would expect the much larger receptive field of the Wavenet model to be reflected in the likelihood scores to some extent. Similarly, Figure 3 shows the vanilla RNN outperforming the Wavenet reimplementation in human evaluation on the Blizzard dataset. This raises questions about the implementation of the latter. Some discussion about this result and whether the authors expected it or not would be very welcome.\n\nTable 1 and Figure 4 also show the 2-tier SampleRNN outperforming the 3-tier model in terms of likelihood and human rating respectively, which is very counterintuitive as one would expect longer-range temporal correlations to be even more relevant for music than for speech. This is not discussed at all, I think it would be useful to comment on why this could be happening.\n\nOverall, this an interesting attempt to tackle modelling very long sequences with long-range temporal correlations and the results are quite convincing, even if the same can't always be said of the comparison with the baselines. It would be interesting to see how the model performs for conditional generation, seeing as it can be more easily be objectively compared to models like Wavenet in that domain.\n\n\n\nOther remarks:\n\n- upsampling the output of the models is done with r separate linear projections. This choice of upsampling method is not motivated. Why not just use linear interpolation or nearest neighbour upsampling? What is the advantage of learning this operation? Don't the r linear projections end up learning largely the same thing, give or take some noise?\n\n- The third paragraph of Section 2.1.1 indicates that 8-bit linear PCM was used. This is in contrast to Wavenet, for which an 8-bit mu-law encoding was used, and this supposedly improves the audio fidelity of the samples. Did you try this as well?\n\n- Section 2.1 mentions the discretisation of the input and the use of a softmax to model this discretised input, without any reference to prior work that made the same observation. A reference is given in 2.1.1, but it should probably be moved up a bit to avoid giving the impression that this is a novel observation.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SampleRNN: An Unconditional End-to-End Neural Audio Generation Model", "abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel model for unconditional audio generation task that generates one audio sample at a time.

MLP vs RNN: Modelling nearby samples is relatively easy and adding another RNN is making the model more complex and slower to train; there is no need to run an RNN if it is getting input from couple of past samples, there is no long-term dependency there. Besides that, if a memoryless module can cope with that, there is no reason theoretically to think that a RNN cannot accomplish the same.\n\n- Re. upsampling:\n> Why can't the high-frequency module just read the same (repeated) state of low frequency module?\nThe high-frequency module can certainly do that; we would consider this still a sort of upsampling (nearest-neighbor).\n\n> And if you want to have a transformation there, why make it r linear projections? This seems both a redundant and weak modeling choice.\nOne argument for r separate projections (c_1=W_1*h_t,...,c_r=W_r*h_t) is that the RNN, roughly, should be modeling p(x_{t+1}...x_{t+r}|x0...xt). Considering the case where the lower module is an MLP which is run r times with the same state vector as input, there's no easy way for it to know which part of that state vector to pay attention to (i.e. what the current timestep is) otherwise. Also, our approach of upsampling with r linear projections is exactly equivalent to upsampling by adding zeros and then applying a linear convolution. This is sometimes called \"perforated\" upsampling in the context of CNNs. It was first demonstrated to work well in [1], and is a fairly common upsampling technique.\n\n[1] Dosovitskiy, Alexey, Jost Springenberg, Maxim Tatarchenko, and Thomas Brox. \"Learning to Generate Chairs, Tables and Cars with Convolutional Networks.\" (2016)."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SampleRNN: An Unconditional End-to-End Neural Audio Generation Model", "abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel model for unconditional audio generation task that generates one audio sample at a time.

However, I must clearly state that the way that you have defined your model lacks any mathematical formalism. The main definition in the paper is literally Figure 1, with literally 2 equations in the whole paper, where one of them is just defining an ordered cascade definition of a joint distribution (eq 1). It is stated that each of the modules operates on a different FS_k time window, but how are these combined with the previous h-vector and with the one coming from the upper modules is not stated and remains a mystery, unless I go and read your code. Also interestingly enough the lowest level module uses an MLP rather than some form of an RNN to combine the observation in its window and the conditioning vector c. I'm very confused on why is that the case, and did you just stack all of the FS_1 vectors and input them to the MLP? Did you try to have another RNN there rather than an MLP? Does this implies that at every new iteration t, we need to compute the MLP at every level a new? \n\nAlso your answer to Soroush Mehri 3) - \"You can find the code and best found hyper-parameters in the following Github repo\" is really unsatisfactory. As a researcher I will need to spent several hours digging trough your code, written in Theano, which for that matter many people might have never used before, in order to just understand what exactly are you doing. On the other hand you can just explain in probably 3 equations the whole model and another 2 sentences about what were the number of hidden units etc... Also speaking about research, you should NOT just report the best chosen hyper parameters. The whole community will benefit a lot more if you list all of the things you tried and how well did they do (if needed add this in an Appendix). \n\nI really hope you guys take this constructively and write at least the model definition better."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SampleRNN: An Unconditional End-to-End Neural Audio Generation Model", "abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel model for unconditional audio generation task that generates one audio sample at a time.

It affects the generalization and diversity of generated samples in a sense that model will favor the dominant category.\nRe. 1.2) We do not have any conditional models.\n\nRe. 2) Thanks for noting that. You are correct that it will mitigate this problem and not solve it. We will clarify this point in the next update along with the following experiment on a related note.\nWe trained our best model --SampleRNN (3-tier)-- on a dataset of 2 speakers, one male and one female, each with almost 10 hours of audio. We observed that it learned to stay consistent generating samples from the same speaker without having any knowledge about the the speaker ID or any other conditioning information. This effect is more apparent here in comparison to the unbalanced Onomatopoeia that sometimes mixes two different categories of sounds.\nAnother experiment was conducted to test the effect of memory and study the effective memory horizon. We inject 1 second of silence in the middle of sampling procedure in order to see if it will remember to generate from the same speaker or not. Initially when sampling we let the model generate 2 seconds of audio as it normally do. From 2 to 3 seconds instead of feeding back the generated sample at that timestep a silent token (zero amplitude) would be fed. From 3 to 5 seconds again we sample normally; feeding back the generated token. We did classification based on mean fundamental frequency of speakers for the first and last 2 seconds. In 83% of samples SampleRNN will generate from the same person in two separate segments. This is in contrast to a model with fixed past window like WaveNet where injecting 16000 silent tokens (3.3 times the receptive field size) is equivalent to generating from scratch which has 50% chance (assuming each 2-second segment is coherent and not a mixed sound of two speakers)."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SampleRNN: An Unconditional End-to-End Neural Audio Generation Model", "abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel model for unconditional audio generation task that generates one audio sample at a time.

The results in WaveNet paper are only subjective comparisons with models that have been trained with conditioning information while we are showing quantitative (NLL) and qualitative (AB test) results for unconditional models.\nMost importantly, the baseline RNN that we are presenting is trained on quantized raw audio samples which is the same for all other compared models. The LSTM-RNN-based statistical parametric model [1, 2] cited in WaveNet paper is outputting acoustic features (conditioned on linguistic features), spectral enhancement was applied and afterward waveform was generated using Vocaine Vocoder. So they are different despite their similarity in the names. The main purpose of reporting RNNs in our work as a baseline was to show that it can be improved upon by a hierarchical structure such as one presented in SampleRNN model.\nB. We are aware of the fact that the quality of our WaveNet samples is not close to the ones from original paper. However, with no code, details, nor even any performance measure reported, we spend more than enough time and resources on re-implementation that could have been easily spent on increasing the quality of presented work. Hence, penalizing us solely because of that would be unfair and we hope that the publication of our paper might prompt them to share more details with the community.\n\nRe. 3)  You can find the code and best found hyper-parameters in the following Github repo:\nhttps://github.com/soroushmehr/sampleRNN_ICLR2017\n\n[1] Zen, Heiga, and Ha\u015fim Sak. \"Unidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural network with recurrent output layer for low-latency speech synthesis.\" In 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 4470-4474.

Which one produces the numbers presented in the results section?\n\n2) The results show RNN is consistently better than Wavenet, and some cases by a large margin, which is contrary to what the Wavenet paper reports. The paper did mention in 3.1 the implementation is probably different for the original paper. But if wavenet numbers are not better than simple RNN, the experimental comparisons between SampleRNN and wavenet are hence untrustworthy. It leads to questions whether the theoretical benefits \"In contrast to WaveNets, we have the ability to use information from arbitrary past by using stateful RNNs\" is useful or not.\n\n3) Reproducibility. The paper complained in section 3.1 \"but owing to missing details of architecture and hyperparameters\" that they cannot reproduce the wavenet model. In the paper, what recurrent unit (GRU or LSTM) and what's the configuration of those units (cell size etc) are used in the final SampleRNN that generated results? More details would be great.
