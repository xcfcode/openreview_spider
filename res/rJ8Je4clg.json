Note that this is generally true for all DQN approaches, and ours is no different.\n\nAbout bounds:\nNote that the max over the different lower bounds is not necessarily attained for close by steps (k=1). Particularly at the beginning of training the tightest bounds are actually obtained for large values of k. Intuitively this can be understood when considering high rewards in a maze environment that have been propagated to MDP states a few locations away. Hence we disagree with R1s claim that the maximum lower bound arises from neighboring states, i.e., the max is L_j,1.\n\nNote that L_j,0 is the term used in the standard DQN cost function, i.e., y_j = L_j,0, and we aim at regressing to that value. In fact we could include it as an additional constraint, e.g., as both a lower bound and an upper bound. This would only change the relative weight between the terms however, hence no need to further pursue this direction.\n\nUsage of a target network to compute y_j = L_j,0 is common practice. Hence it seems intuitive to follow the same idea for the bounds.\n\nAbout empirical evaluation:\nWe decided to focus on a comparison with vanilla DQN because the proposed technique can be combined with almost all of the later improvements, e.g., n-step Q-learning, actor-critic methods, double-DQN etc. In addition, we felt it is important to assess the differences to the core technique on a large number of tasks. Therefore we conduct experiments on a variety of different benchmarks as opposed to cherry-picking a few examples. We think using few benchmarks and many algorithms is just as reasonable as using many benchmarks and few algorithms. Both is unfortunately not possible given our current resource constraints.

My one major worry about the paper is that the experiments don\u2019t show that the main new idea is what actually leads to the improvement over DQN/D-DQN.\n\nThe proposed final objective in Equation 4 augments the standard Q-learning loss with two terms. Each of the additional terms is a one-sided L2 loss between the estimated Q-value and a certain n-step return.\n\nn-step returns and lambda returns have long been used to speed up reward propagation in reinforcement learning. The difference is that they have been previously used with the standard (two-sided) L2 loss. Their benefits have been shown in the classical RL literature (see [1], [2]) and more recently with deep architectures (see [3], [4], [5]). For example, [4] showed clear benefits from using n-step returns on Atari and TORCS and Retrace(lambda) [5] significantly outperformed DQN on Atari.\n\nSince this paper is really proposing a different way of using n-step returns, I think it\u2019s important to compare it to the standard ways of using them. Have you done any comparisons to DQN with n-step returns as targets or any other return-based method? It would also be good to empirically show what the effect of including the full return R_j into the lower bound is.

This leads to faster convergence, as shown on the Atari Learning Environment benchmark.\n\nThe paper is well written and easy to follow. The core idea of using relaxed inequality bounds in the optimization problem is original to the best of my knowledge, and results seem promising.\n\nThis submission however has a number of important shortcomings that prevent me from recommending it for publication at ICLR:\n\n1. The theoretical justification and analysis is very limited. As far as I can tell the bounds as defined require a deterministic reward to hold, which is rarely the case in practice. There is also the fact that the bounds are computed using the so-called \"target network\" with different parameters theta-, which is another source of discrepancy. And even before that, the bounds hold for Q* but are applied on Q for which they may not be valid until Q gets close enough to Q*. It also looks weird to take the max over k in (1, ..., K) when the definition of L_j,k makes it look like the max has to be L_j,1 (or even L_j,0, but I am not sure why that one is not considered), since L*_j,0 >= L*_j,1 >= ... >= L*_j,K. Neither of these issues are discussed in the paper, and there is no theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of the proposed method.\n\n[Update: some of these concerns were addressed in OpenReview comments]\n\n2. The empirical evaluation does not compensate, in my opinion, for the lack of theory. First, since there are two bounds introduced, I would have expected \"ablative\" experiments showing the improvement brought by each one independently. It is also unfortunate that the authors did not have time to let their algorithm run longer, since as shown in Fig. 1 there remain a significant amount of games where it performs worse compared to DQN. In addition, comparisons are limited to vanilla DQN and DDQN: I believe it would have been important to compare to other ways of incorporating longer-term rewards, like n-step Q-Learning or actor-critic. Finally, there is no experiment demonstrating that the proposed algorithm can indeed improve other existing DQN variants: I agree with the author when they say \"We believe that our method can be readily combined with other techniques developed for DQN\", however providing actual results showing this would have made the paper much stronger.\n\nIn conclusion, I do believe this line of research is worth pursuing, but also that additional work is required to really prove and understand its benefits.\n\nMinor comments:\n- Instead of citing the arxiv Wang et al (2015), it would be best to cite the 2016 ICML paper\n- The description of Q-Learning in section 3 says \"The estimated future reward is computed based on the current state s or a series of past states s_t if available.\" I am not sure what you mean by \"a series of past states\", since Q is defined as Q(s, a) and thus can only take the current state s as input, when defined this way.\n- The introduction of R_j in Alg. 1 is confusing since its use is only explained later in the text (in section 5 \"In addition, we also incorporate the discounted return R_j in the lower bound calculation to further stabilize the training\")\n- In Fig. S1 the legend should not say \"10M\" since the plot is from 1M to 10M", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Play in a Day: Faster Deep Reinforcement Learning by Optimality Tightening", "abstract": "We propose a novel training algorithm for reinforcement learning which combines the strength of deep Q-learning with a constrained optimization approach to tighten optimality and encourage faster reward propagation.

Error bars would also be helpful to judge stability over different random seeds.\n\nAs mentioned in the paper, this method could be combined with D-DQN.

The upper bounds and lower bounds are then also deterministic. For stochastic MDPs, we can still formulate a similar constrained optimization problem but with constraints that hold for the expected value of the environmental dynamics. Then we can still apply the quadratic penalty method to remove these constraints and formulate the objective function with expectations in the penalty functions. In this way, we apply the Jensen's inequality to move the environmental expectation operator outside of the quadratic function and show that one can apply stochastic gradient descent algorithm to minimize the relaxed upper bound of the objective function. Indeed, the deterministic objective function in the current paper can be seen as an empirical upper bound of the objective function in the stochastic setting. In this way, we can apply the optimality tightening to stochastic MDPs.

Using the quadratic penalty function method, the objective function can be different during training. When there were violated constraints, we added extra quadratic function(s) to the objective function, and thus the scale (or norm) of gradient can usually be larger. This might cause instability in gradient descent, e.g. RMSprop used in this paper. To make training more stable, we multiplied the gradient by 1/(1+\\lambda) or 1/(1+2*lambda) if only one bound was considered or two bounds were considered, respectively. We found that this rescaling technique improved the training in our experiments. We believe that there are other possible approaches to address this practical issue.
