Please see the experiment section as well as the appendix for the synthesis results. These are all we have got, without cheery picking. As can be seen, our method can generate meaningful and varied images. We haven\u2019t had time to tune the code. In fact, we had to recruit a new author (Ms. Ruiqi Gao) to help us run the code due to our various time constraints. With more careful tuning (including increasing image resolution), we expect to further improve the quality of synthesis. \n\nAbout the comparison with separate training method by either Algorithm D for descriptor or Algorithm G for generator individually, the separate training methods currently cannot produce synthesis results that are comparable to those produced by the cooperative training. This illustrates the advantage of cooperative training over separate training. In fact, the main motivation for this work is to overcome the difficulty with separate training by cooperative training.  \n\nWe have added a quantitative comparison with GAN for the face completion experiment, because our method is intended as an alternative to GAN.  Our original code was written in MatConvNet. We moved to TensorFlow in order to use existing code of GAN. We then rewrote Algorithm G in TensorFlow for image completion. GAN did not do well in this experiment. We are still checking and tuning our code to improve GAN performance. \n\nWe want to emphasize that we are treating the following two issues separately:\n\n(1) Train-test split and quantitative evaluation of generalizability. \n(2) Image synthesis judged qualitatively. \n\nWhile the face completion experiment is intended to address (1), the synthesis experiment is intended to address (2).  In fact, the generator network captures people\u2019s imagination mainly because of (2) (at least this is the case with ourselves), and some GAN papers are more qualitative than quantitative. \n\nWe will continue to work on experiments, to further address the questions raised by the reviewers and to continue to strengthen the quantitative side. \n\nWe have also made some minor changes to incorporate the reviewers\u2019 suggestions on wording and additional references. \n\nAs to the energy function, in particular, f(Y; W), for the descriptor, it is defined by a bottom-up ConvNet that maps the image Y to a score (very much like a discriminator), and we give the details of this ConvNet in the experiment section. We feel we made this clear in the original version. \n\nAs to equation (8), we have expanded the derivation. Equations (16) and (17) are about finite step Langevin dynamics. \n\nFinally please allow us to make some general comments regarding our paper. Our paper addresses the core issue of this conference, i.e., learning representations in the form of probabilistic generative models. There are two types of such papers: \n\n(1) Build on the successes of GAN. \n(2) Explore new connections and new routes. \n\nWe believe that papers in these two categories should be judged differently. Our paper belongs to category (2). It explores the connection between undirected model (descriptor) and directed model (generator). It also explores the connection between MCMC sampling (descriptor) and ancestral sampling (generator). Furthermore, it explores the new ground where two models interact with each other via synthesized data. We have also tried hard to gain a theoretical understanding of our method in appendix. \n\nThere have been a lot of papers in category (1) recently. We hope that the conference will be more open to the relatively fewer papers in category (2). In fact we are heartened that all three reviewers find our work interesting, and we can continue to improve our experiments. \n\nThanks for your consideration, and thanks for your comments that have helped us improve our work. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Cooperative Training of Descriptor and Generator Networks", "abstract": "This paper studies the cooperative training of two probabilistic models of signals such as images.

The descriptor is trained via standard maximum likelihood, with Langevin MCMC for sampling. The generator is trained to generate likely samples under the DEM in a single, feed-forward ancestral sampling step. It can thus be used to shortcut expensive MCMC sampling, hence the reference to \u201ccooperative training\u201d.\n\nThe above idea is interesting and novel, but unfortunately is not sufficiently validated by the experimental results. First and foremost, two out of the three experiments do not feature a train /test split, and ignore standard training and evaluation protocols for texture generation (see [R1]). Datasets are also much too small. As such these experiments only seem to confirm the ability of the model to overfit. On the third in-painting tasks, baselines are almost non-existent: no VAEs, RBMs, DEM, etc which makes it difficult to evaluate the benefits of the proposed approach.\n\nIn a future revision, I would also encourage the authors to answer the following questions experimentally. What is the impact of the missing rejection step in Langevin MCMC (train with, without ?). What is the impact of the generator on the burn-in process of the Markov chain (show sample auto-correlation). How bad is approximation of training the generator from ({\\tilde{Y}, \\hat{X}) instead of ({\\tilde{Y}, \\tilde{X}) ? Run comparative experiments.\n\nThe paper would also greatly benefit from a rewrite focusing on clarity, instead of hyperbole (\u201cpioneering work\u201d in reference to closely related, but non-peer reviewed work) and prose (\u201ctale of two nets\u201d). For example, the authors fail to specify the exact form of the energy function: this seems like a glaring omission.\n\nPROS:\n+ Interesting and novel idea\nCONS:\n- Improper experimental protocols\n- Missing baselines\n- Missing diagnostic experiments\n\n[R1] Heess, N., Williams, C.

In the new scheme, termed cooperative training, the two networks train together and assist each other: the generator network provides samples that work as initial samples for the descriptor network, and the descriptor network updates those samples to help guide training of the generator network.\n\nThis is an interesting approach for coupling the training of these two models.  The paper however is quite weak on the empirical studies.  In particular:\n- The training datasets are tiny, from sets of 1 image to 5-6.  What is the reason for not using larger sets?  I think the small datasets are leading to over training and are really masking the true value of the proposed cooperative training approach.\n- For most of the experiments presented in the paper it is hard to assess the specific value brought by the proposed cooperative training approach because baseline results are missing.  There are comparisons provided for face completion experiments - but even there comparisons with descriptor or generator network trained separately or with other deep auto-encoders are missing.  Thus it is hard to conclude if and how much gain is obtained by cooperative training over say individually training the descriptor and generator networks.\n\nAnother comment is that in the \u201crelated work\u201d section, I think relation with variational auto encoders (Kingma and Welling 2013) should be included.\n\nDespite limitations mentioned above, I think the ideas presented in the paper are intuitively appealing and worth discussing at ICLR.

We take only one sample after running a finite number of Langevin steps within each learning iteration, mainly because of the auto-correlation between consecutive steps. During the learning algorithm, the parameters change gradually, so that the target distribution of the Langevin dynamics also changes gradually. We therefore only take one sample from the last Langevin step within each learning iteration as a matter of burn-in.  Of course this may be overly cautious, and we may instead average over the second half of the Langevin chain or take more samples as you suggested. We can do experiments to study this issue.  \n\nAbout using one Monte Carlo sample in each learning iteration versus averaging many samples, the learning algorithms for both the descriptor and the generator are stochastic gradient or stochastic approximation of Robbins-Monro, where the expectation is replaced by a single Monte Carlo sample in each iteration. The algorithm converges because it essentially accumulates the effects of the Monte Carlo samples over the iterations, so that the Monte Carlo variance is gradually eliminated. The basic idea is that instead of generating many Monte Carlo samples with fixed parameters, we may keep updating the parameters while generating these samples with the gradually changing parameters. Of course the contrast between one sample versus many samples is not mutually exclusive. We may use a small number of samples as a middle ground, and we can do experiments to study this issue. This is similar to the mini-batch training algorithm in supervised learning, which is also of Robbins-Monro type. \n\nThe cooperative training is beneficial to both the descriptor and generator. For the descriptor, each Langevin chain is initialized from a fresh independent sample provided by the generator, thus eliminating auto-correlation between samples of different learning iterations. Without the generator, we may have to run persistent chains, which may take a long time to explore the sample space due to auto-correlation between different learning iterations. For the generator, it learns from synthesized samples where the latent factors are known, so that the learning is effectively supervised. \n\nIt appears that we may insert the generator in the loop of any MCMC for any target distribution. The generator helps rejuvenate the MCMC by supplying fresh independent samples in each iteration, while the MCMC guides the generator towards the target distribution. In the end, we can generate independent samples from the target distribution using the learned generator directly without MCMC. \n\nThanks again for your question, which helps us clarify our presentation. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Cooperative Training of Descriptor and Generator Networks", "abstract": "This paper studies the cooperative training of two probabilistic models of signals such as images.
