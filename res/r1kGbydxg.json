Since the only evaluation is on trajectory tracking, it's also not even clear (as pointed out by other reviewers) to what degree these results will generalize to other tasks. In fact, a contrarian view might be that PD tracking is specifically a good fit for trajectory tracking with a known reference trajectory, but might be a poor fit for accomplishing a particular task, where more open-loop behaviors might be more optimal. The passive compliance of MTUs is also shown to often not be beneficial, but it's again not clear whether this might in fact be an artifact of the trajectory tracking task.\n \n But perhaps more problematically, the primary conclusions of the paper are of limited relevance when it comes to design of algorithms or models (or at least, the authors don't discuss this), but are more relevant for practitioners interested in applying deep RL for learning controllers for articulated rigid body systems such as robots or virtual characters. As such, it's not clear what fraction of the ICLR audience will find the paper relevant to their interests.\n \n I would strongly encourage the authors to continue their research: there is a lot to like about the present paper, including an elegant reinforcement learning methodology, rigorous empirical results for the specific case of trajectory following, and some very nice videos and examples."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Locomotion Skills Using DeepRL: Does the Choice of Action Space Matter?", "abstract": "The use of deep reinforcement learning allows for high-dimensional state descriptors, but little is known about how the choice of action representation impacts the learning difficulty and the resulting performance.

This paper doesn\u2019t provide all the answers, but it shows that output representations do matter (for locomotion): they significantly impact the learning rate, robustness, overall performance, and policy query rate.\n\n2) Many methods for continuous action spaces use physics-based simulations of locomotion as one of their key examples. However, the use of torques as the defacto unit of action is rather arbitrary; it ignores the notion that the passive properties of  actuation mechanisms, e.g., muscles, can make a significant contribution to motion control, i.e., \u201cintelligence by mechanics\u201d (Blickhan et al., 2007).This can be thought of as a kind of partitioning of the computations between the control and the physical system. Our paper provides a first look at the impact of such \u201cpartitioning\u201d.\n\n3) A question that we would like to draw more attention to is: should musculo-tendon systems (as seen in nature) and other actuation details be considered as part of the control policy or part of the environment?  I.e., can they be safely ignored because the control policy would \u201clearn the useful aspects\u201d anyhow? \n\nRe: generalization of results\n\nHere are our thoughts on this;  we will update the paper to reflect these.\n\n1) Admittedly, we do not provide a concrete answer for the generalization to arbitrary objective functions, and we will clearly state this in the paper. However physics-based locomotion is commonly used as an example in continuous-action RL work. While we do optimize for only one reward function (imitation), we do explore results for different characters, different motions, different query rates, and overall policy robustness. We believe that these are all critical dimensions for testing capabilities and generalization for locomotion control. The imitation objective can also be used as a motion prior and so it is likely to be useful more generally.  It further allows us to produce more natural motions (subjectively speaking) than previously seen for similar work. We hope that the capability of learning more natural locomotion policies, even if this arrives in part via the objective function rather than a theoretical advancement, will be of broad interest to the ICLR community.\n\n2) We believe that no single action parameterization will be the best for all problems. However, since objectives for motion control problems are often naturally expressed in terms of kinematic properties, higher-level actions such as target joint angles and velocities may be effective for a wide variety of motion control problems. We hope that our work will help open discussions around the choice of action parameterizations.\n\nRe: specificity of results to the use of a reference pose cost\n\nWhile the reward terms are mainly calculated according to joint positions and velocities, the real challenge for the control policy lies with: (a) learning to compensate for various state-dependent forces, such as gravity and ground-reaction forces, and (b) learning strategies such as foot-placement that are needed to maintain balance for all the locomotion gaits. The reference pose terms provides no information on how to achieve these \u201chidden\u201d aspects of motion control that will ultimately determine the success of the locomotion policy. There is also only a weak correlation between the action space and the actual reference poses for any of the action spaces; the action space trajectories illustrated in Figure 11 are all quite different from the actual right hip angle trajectory (not shown, but it varies smoothly over time).\n\nRe: considering more realistic physical constraints (e.g. actuator constraints, communication delays etc. on real robots) could greatly improve the impact of this work. (Anon Rev 1)\n\nWe enforce torque limits and joint limits, which are shared across all actuation models. We do not currently include activation time delays for any of the models.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Locomotion Skills Using DeepRL: Does the Choice of Action Space Matter?", "abstract": "The use of deep reinforcement learning allows for high-dimensional state descriptors, but little is known about how the choice of action representation impacts the learning difficulty and the resulting performance.

We do not currently have the data available to evaluate the sensitivity of the learning with respect to the amount of exploration noise. However while we were manually tuning the values for each action parameterization, we have found the performance to be fairly robust to reasonable ranges of values. Of course, if the covariance of the distribution is too small, then learning will be slow, while excessively large amount of exploration noise can cause the agent's behaviour to be unstable, resulting in frequent falling. As is often the case in RL, there is a large number of hyperparameters and other design decisions that need to be made, but in our experience, once a reasonable set of choices has been found, it tends to work well across the various examples.\n\nThe NCR, with no discounting, is used only for evaluating the performance of policies. During training, discounting is still applied when performing Bellman backup to update the value function [Algorithm 1, Line 21]. The discount factor was tuned with a manual line search on a subset of the examples, to improve final performance and learning speed.\n\nWe believe that with more computational power to performance a more systematic search of the hyperparameter space will lead to better overall performance.

We believe there is a dependency between the reward function and the action space. One trivial example would be a reward that simply tries to minimize the control torques exerted on the joints. In this case the torque policy will be trivial while the PD and velocity policies may be more complex. However, we would like to point out that though the reward terms are mainly calculated according to joint positions and velocities, there are implicit objectives, such as gravity compensation, contact configurations, and end effector forces, which are non-trivial functions of joint positions and velocities.\n\nWe believe that no action parameterization will be the best for all problems, but since objectives for motion control problems are often naturally expressed in terms of kinematic properties, higher-level actions such as target joint angles and velocities might be effective for a wide variety of motion control problems. We hope that this work will help open more discussions around the choice of action parameterizations.\n\nIn the case of an impedance controller, we suspect the local feedback provided by PD and velocity controllers may still prove beneficial."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Locomotion Skills Using DeepRL: Does the Choice of Action Space Matter?", "abstract": "The use of deep reinforcement learning allows for high-dimensional state descriptors, but little is known about how the choice of action representation impacts the learning difficulty and the resulting performance.
