Still, we believe a mathematical treatment brings a lot of value, because it increases precision and generality, and establishes a bridge between fields.\n\nThe value of generality is exemplified by the fact that the mathematical theory carries over almost without change to the continuous setting.\n\nBy highlighting connections to advanced mathematical concepts and explaining them in a simple manner in the context of CNNs, we hope to foster future cross-fertilization between mathematics and machine learning. On the one hand, our work may provide an entry point for mathematicians and physicists who want to contribute to machine learning. On the other hand, machine learning researchers may benefit from the knowledge in the mathematical literature (as we have), but this requires knowing where to look.

It is also a very old idea in image processing and goes back to Simoncelli, Freeman, Adelson, as well as Perona/Greenspan and others in the early 1990s.  This paper approaches it through a formal treatment of group theory.  But at the end of the day the idea seems pretty simple - the feature representation of a transformed image should be equivalent to a transformed feature representation of the original image.  Given that the authors are limiting their analysis to discrete groups - for example rotations of 0, 90, 180, and 270 deg. - the formalities brought in from the group theoretic analysis seem a bit overkill.  I'm not sure what this buys us in the end.  it seems the real challenge lies in implementing continuous transformations, so if the theory could guide us in that direction it would be immensely helpful.\n\nAlso the description of the experiments is fairly opaque.

The paper overall reads well; there is a real effort to explain the math accessibly, though some small improvements could be made.\n\nThe theory is general enough to include continuous transformations, although the experiments are restricted to discrete ones. While this could be seen as a negative point, it is justified by the experiments, which show that this set of transformations is powerful enough to yield very good results on CIFAR.\n\nAnother form of intertwiner has been studied recently by Lenc & Vedaldi [1]; they have studied equivariance empirically in CNNs, which offers an orthogonal view.\n\nIn addition to the recent references on scale/rotation deep networks suggested below, geometric equivariance has been studied extensively in the 2000's; mentioning at least one work would be appropriate. The one that probably comes closest to the proposed method is the work by Reisert [2], who studied steerable filters for invariance and equivariance, using Lie group theory. The difference, of course, is that the focus at the time was on kernel machines rather than CNNs, but many of the tools and theorems are relatable.\n\n\nSome of the notation could be simplified, to make the formulas easier to grasp on a first read:\n\nWorking over a lattice Z^d is unnecessarily abstract -- since the inputs are always images, Z^2 would make much of the later math easier to parse. Generalization is straightforward, so I don't think the results lose anything by it; and the authors go back to 2D latices later anyway.\n\nIt could be more natural to do away with the layer index l which appears throughout the paper, and have notation for current/next layer instead (e.g. pi and pi'; K and D instead of K_{l+1} and K_l).\n\nIn any case I leave it up to the authors to decide whether to include these suggestions on notation, but I urge them to consider them (or other ways to unburden notation).\n\n\nA few minor issues: Some statements would be better supported with an accompanying reference (e.g. \"Explicit formulas exist\" on page 5, the introduction of intertwiners on page 3).

The general ideas and concepts (decomposition of representations into irreducibles, intertwiners, etc.) remain roughly the same, but a formally correct treatment would have to be much more technical, which could make the material inaccessible to most machine learning researchers. More importantly perhaps, we have not actually implemented and evaluated our method for continuous groups. Doing so would require dealing with discretization and approximation, which may or may not work well in practice. In summary, we believe discrete groups to be a natural starting point, and believe the method can be extended to continuous groups, but we leave this for future work.\n\nThank you for those references, both look very interesting. I have looked at both papers briefly (and will do a more thorough reading soon). Here is my initial impression.\nKanazawa et al.: this paper proposes a scale-invariant convolution operation. I understand this as a group equivariant convolution (Cohen & Welling 2016) followed by a scale-pooling (It should be noted that Kanazawa et al. precedes our previous work). In our previous paper we found that for rotations, pooling to gain invariance is superior to standard convolution but less effective than equivariant convolution without pooling, but it remains to be seen whether that is true for scaling as well. Another difference to our current work is that Kanazawa et al. do not use representation theory, which allows us to reduce the number of parameters per filter bank, by constraining the latter to lie in the subspace of intertwiners. On the other hand, scaling is a continuous transformation, and hence is beyond the capabilities of our method as presented in this paper.\n\nMarcos et al.: this paper introduces a rotation equivariant convolution + rotation pooling operation, which is implemented by rotating each filter using a fixed set of angles. As mentioned before, we found rotation pooling to be suboptimal. On the other hand, Marcos et al. managed implement the method for an arbitrary set of angles instead of just 4 by using interpolation, and show good results on texture recognition.\n\nWe will discuss both of these references in our paper."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Steerable CNNs", "abstract": "It has long been recognized that the invariance and equivariance properties of a representation are critically important for success in many vision tasks.

I've answered your questions below.\n\n- is there code available for this work?\nWe will publish the code, but we would like to clean it up first. We do have code for our previous paper on group equivariant networks, which is a special case of steerable CNNs:\nhttps://github.com/tscohen/GrouPy\nhttps://github.com/tscohen/gconv_experiments\n\nNote that while G-Convs are mathematically equivalent to steerable convs with regular features, they are implemented differently. The G-Conv is implemented as \"filter indexing\" + \"classical convolution\". Filter indexing involves taking a filter bank and turning it into a larger (e.g. 8x) filter bank through a fixed indexing operation. In the steerable convolution, the filter indexing is replaced by a more general block-sparse linear map (the intertwiner basis). In the case of regular features, this linear map is a permutation matrix, and indeed multiplication by a permutation matrix could be implemented as an indexing operation.\n\n- how difficult (time-consuming) to train steerable CNNs on dataset such as ImageNet?\nComputing a steerable convolution (at train time) involves a block-sparse linear transformation to obtain a filter bank, followed by a classical convolution using that filter bank (at test time the block-sparse linear transformation can be pre-computed). The bulk of the computation time is in the classical convolution, so roughly, the computation time is determined by the size of this filter bank. In practice, steerable convolutions allow you to create bigger filter banks, so computation time is increased proportionally.\n\nHowever, because of increased parameter sharing the gradients for G-Convs and steerable convs are much less noisy, and optimization is much faster in terms of number of updates required. In our experience, this largely offsets the increase in computation time that comes from having bigger filter banks, but we have yet to investigate this systematically and quantify it properly.\n\nAt this point (2016), the bottleneck will likely be GPU memory: with a reasonable batch size you will probably run out of memory before you get to the optimal model size. This situation could be improved substantially through code optimization and multi-GPU training (or waiting for better hardware).\n\n- How does steerable CNN compare against common CNNs such as ResNet or Inception in well-benchmarked tasks such as image classification? I feel the experiment section can be strengthened by add such results.\nI agree. While results on CIFAR usually transfer well to imagenet (e.g. ResNets), it would be nice to do more benchmarking. We have relatively modest computational resources so we have not yet tried to run on imagenet yet. I'm currently at OpenAI working on unrelated (deep reinforcement learning) projects, but would be happy to assist anyone wanting to try G-convs and steerable convs on larger datasets.\n\n- Is there any reason besides mathematical simplicity to choose p4m? what about other group in the wallpaper group set?\nThe main reason for working with p4m is indeed mathematical simplicity. Since we are introducing a number of abstract concepts that are likely new for most ML researchers, we think that having a single concrete running example makes the paper more readble.\n\nHowever, the general theory is directly applicable to any discrete group, including all wallpaper groups in 2D and space groups in 3D. The theory also applies to other groups like permutation groups. Permutation-steerable neural networks could be useful for learning from data with permutation symmetry (chapter 5 of the  great book \"Group Representations in Probability and Statistics\" by Persi Diaconis gives some examples). \n\nOf all the wallpaper groups and space groups, the most interesting ones are \"split groups\" (AKA \"symmorphic groups\"). This means that each transformation in the group can be written as the composition of a transformation that leaves the origin invariant (e.g. rotation about the origin) and a translation. For these groups, the steerable convolutions can be implemented efficiently using a single call to the classical conv routine. This is very important if you want to use steerable convolutions now, but in the future all kinds of steerable convolutions can be implemented efficiently  with custom GPU code (in fact, it is likely that the group representation structure can be exploited to make these networks much faster than standard neural nets).\n\n- What are possible huddles to extend it to continuous group? What if we want to just consider finite group such as D_n instead of continuous group such as SO(2)?\nSteerable CNNs can be implemented for any discrete space with a discrete group acting on it. Strictly speaking D_n does not act on Z^2, because it could send integer coordinates (m,n) to non integer points in the plane. It seems like some kind of interpolation would be necessary to deal with this. Before publishing our previous paper \"Group Equivariant Convolutional Networks\", we experimented a little bit with interpolation to rotate filters, but couldn't get it to work very well. From preliminary experiments it seems that the interpolation artefacts / approximation errors would accumulate with depth, eventually destroying equivariance. It is quite possible that with more effort, and perhaps some signal processing tricks, this can be made to work.\n\nNow that we have steerable CNNs, other approaches may be possible as well. In the literature on steerable filters, as well as most of signal processing, the mathematical theory is developed for the continuous case, and the transition to discrete data is either glossed over or justified with some bandlimit assumption. Similarly, we could develop the theory for continuous groups and then discretise somehow. As long as the (irreducible) representations of H are finite-dimensional (which is the case if H is compact), it should be possible to compute (either analytically or numerically) the (approximate) intertwiner bases. Another approach could be to learn representations that are approximately equivariant by introducing some auxiliary loss functions.\n\nTomaso Poggio's group has published a number of interesting theoretical papers that work with locally compact (not compact) topological groups, e.g. [1]. Although these papers don't deal with group representation theory, and are not concerned with implementation details, they could give some hints about how to approach the continuous case.\n\n- PS: In the sentence right after equation (6) there is an equation for \\pi_{l+1}, there is g on the LHS, I assume g should also appear on the RHS? \nYes, that's another typo.
