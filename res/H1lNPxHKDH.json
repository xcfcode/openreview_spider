The main change is an expanded discussion in Section 5.1 regarding the order of smoothness in our Sobolev norm bounds, as requested by Reviewer 1.\n\nAdditionally, we have made some small changes to Section 5.3. Previously, we claimed in Proposition 5 that *all* continuous piecewise linear functions with compact support have infinite R-norm. However, there was a flaw in our proof, and we needed to weaken the result slightly. Namely, for the result to hold, we need to make some extra conditions on the boundary sets separating the regions on which the function is linear. We discuss these conditions in detail in Appendix I with an updated proof of the result. These conditions are met for a broad class of piecewise linear functions, including the pyramid function in Example 4, and so the change to Proposition 5 does not affect our depth separation result."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2356/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2356/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["gongie@uchicago.edu", "willett@uchicago.edu", "daniel.soudry@technion.ac.il", "nati@ttic.edu"], "title": "A Function Space View of Bounded Norm Infinite Width ReLU Nets: The Multivariate Case", "authors": ["Greg Ongie", "Rebecca Willett", "Daniel Soudry", "Nathan Srebro"], "pdf": "/pdf/a4decc1cb86c7fbba42a437c2315e29ac79c8894.pdf", "TL;DR": "We characterize the space of functions realizable as a ReLU network with an unbounded number of units (infinite width), but where the Euclidean norm of the weights is bounded.", "abstract": "We give a tight characterization of the (vectorized Euclidean) norm of weights required to realize a function $f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^d$ as a single hidden-layer ReLU network with an unbounded number of units (infinite width), extending the univariate characterization of Savarese et al.

In the univariate case, it is straightforward to show that a minimum norm solution is given by a linear spline with knots at the sample locations, since the function space norm is essentially the second-order total-variation penalty. In the multivariate case, we know that a minimum norm solution is given by an interpolating piecewise linear function, but due to the more complicated function space description involving a Radon transform, we found it difficult to give a more concise description than this.\n\n* perhaps the results of Section 5.1 should be contrasted with those of Bach (2017, e.g. Prop. 5), which only require ~ d/2 derivatives instead of ~ d here, albeit with stronger requirements, for essentially the same functional space (though the approximation result is obtained from an associated RKHS, which is smaller).\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have added discussion in Section 5.1 comparing our result with Bach 2017, and explaining why ~d order derivatives are necessary in our setting. The difference in derivative order comes from the fact that we consider an L^1-type Sobolev norm (i.e., sum of the L^1 norms of derivatives) and not an L^2-type Sobolev norm, as considered in Bach 2017. For an L^1-type Sobolev norm, the scaling ~d is optimal in the sense that this is the scaling required for a sequence of functions approaching a \u201cpoint evaluation\u201d (i.e., f(x) = 1 if x=x_0 and 0 otherwise) to have unbounded norm. Whereas, for an L^2-type Sobolev norm, the required scaling for this to occur is ~d/2.\n\n* are the results on radial bump functions intended to provide insight on approximation or depth separation? what was the motivation behind this section?\n\nThese results were meant to build intuition for dealing with the R-norm where we can obtain more explicit expressions, and to illustrate how the R-norm scales with dimension for a certain class of bump function, which could be important for future approximation and generalization results. We have added a sentence addressing this at the beginning of Section 5.2.\n\nOther minor comments/typos:\n- after Prop. 1: \"intertwining\" appears twice\n- eq. (22): missing f in l.h.s.\n- eq. (23): is the first minus sign needed?\n- before Thm. 1: point to which Appendix\n- Section 4.1, \"In particular, this is what would happen ... d+1\": this should be further explained\n- Section 4.1, final paragraph, \"in order R-norm to be\": rephrase\n- Section 5.4, \"required norm with three layers is finite\": which norm? maybe point to a reference? Also, Example 5 could be explained in further detail\n- Section 5.5: what is an RKHS semi-norm? you'd always have ||f|| = 0 => f = 0 in an RKHS, by the reproducing property\n\nThank you for your careful reading. We have addressed all these issues in the revision. \nIn particular, the d+1 scaling of derivatives is described in more detail in Sec. 5.1. And the issue of our claim about RKHS norms versus semi-norms is addressed with a footnote on page 10. \nFinally, you are correct that in Eq. (23) the first minus sign is not needed, but we prefer to leave it there to make subsequent derivations tidier,  such as Example 1, and many proofs in the Appendix."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2356/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2356/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["gongie@uchicago.edu", "willett@uchicago.edu", "daniel.soudry@technion.ac.il", "nati@ttic.edu"], "title": "A Function Space View of Bounded Norm Infinite Width ReLU Nets: The Multivariate Case", "authors": ["Greg Ongie", "Rebecca Willett", "Daniel Soudry", "Nathan Srebro"], "pdf": "/pdf/a4decc1cb86c7fbba42a437c2315e29ac79c8894.pdf", "TL;DR": "We characterize the space of functions realizable as a ReLU network with an unbounded number of units (infinite width), but where the Euclidean norm of the weights is bounded.", "abstract": "We give a tight characterization of the (vectorized Euclidean) norm of weights required to realize a function $f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^d$ as a single hidden-layer ReLU network with an unbounded number of units (infinite width), extending the univariate characterization of Savarese et al.

I thus recommend acceptance.\n\nA few comments:\n* is it possible to obtain precise characterizations of interpolating solutions in this setting (other than a mere representer theorem with ReLUs), as done in Savarese et al (2019, Theorem 3.3) for the univariate case?\n\n* perhaps the results of Section 5.1 should be contrasted with those of Bach (2017, e.g. Prop. 5), which only require ~ d/2 derivatives instead of ~ d here, albeit with stronger requirements, for essentially the same functional space (though the approximation result is obtained from an associated RKHS, which is smaller).\n\n* are the results on radial bump functions intended to provide insight on approximation or depth separation? what was the motivation behind this section?\n\nOther minor comments/typos:\n- after Prop. 1: \"intertwining\" appears twice\n- eq. (22): missing f in l.h.s.\n- eq. (23): is the first minus sign needed?\n- before Thm. 1: point to which Appendix\n- Section 4.1, \"In particular, this is what would happen ... d+1\": this should be further explained\n- Section 4.1, final paragraph, \"in order R-norm to be\": rephrase\n- Section 5.4, \"required norm with three layers is finite\": which norm? maybe point to a reference? Also, Example 5 could be explained in further detail\n- Section 5.5: what is an RKHS semi-norm? you'd always have ||f|| = 0 => f = 0 in an RKHS, by the reproducing property"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2356/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2356/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["gongie@uchicago.edu", "willett@uchicago.edu", "daniel.soudry@technion.ac.il", "nati@ttic.edu"], "title": "A Function Space View of Bounded Norm Infinite Width ReLU Nets: The Multivariate Case", "authors": ["Greg Ongie", "Rebecca Willett", "Daniel Soudry", "Nathan Srebro"], "pdf": "/pdf/a4decc1cb86c7fbba42a437c2315e29ac79c8894.pdf", "TL;DR": "We characterize the space of functions realizable as a ReLU network with an unbounded number of units (infinite width), but where the Euclidean norm of the weights is bounded.", "abstract": "We give a tight characterization of the (vectorized Euclidean) norm of weights required to realize a function $f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^d$ as a single hidden-layer ReLU network with an unbounded number of units (infinite width), extending the univariate characterization of Savarese et al.
