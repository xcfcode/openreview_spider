The noise derives from the limited transferability of source-domain features, the unknown number of target-domain identities, and the imperfect results of the clustering algorithm. \n\nThe proposed framework, Mutual Mean-Teaching (MMT), performs pseudo label re\ufb01nery by optimizing the neural networks under the joint supervisions of off-line re\ufb01ned hard pseudo labels and on-line re\ufb01ned soft pseudo labels. Inspired by the teacher-student approaches (Reference: Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017; Reference: Zhang et al., 2018b), the proposed MMT framework provides robust soft pseudo labels in an on-line peer-teaching manner to simultaneously train two same networks. The networks gradually capture target-domain data distributions and thus re\ufb01ne pseudo labels for better feature learning.\n\nThe main contribution is proposing an unsupervised framework (MMT) capable of tackling the noise problem in state-of-art UDA methods for person re-identification, via producing reliable soft labels in order to achieve better performance.

We really appreciate the comments for improving the clarity of statements and experimental verifications. The manuscript is revised accordingly, and the responses to your main concerns are listed below.\n\n\n[QUESTION 1]\nThe paper lacks a survey of works on handling noisy labels.\n\n[RESPONSE 1]\nWe incorporate more related works on handling noisy labels in Section 2 marked as blue. Besides, we also experimentally compared with the most relevant method, Co-teaching (Han et al., NIPS 2018), mentioned by the reviewer on unsupervised person re-ID settings. The results in Table 1 show that our method is significantly better than Co-teaching by at least 6% mAP with the same ResNet-50 backbone.\n\nImplementation details and further analysis are presented in Section 4.3. Co-teaching could not tackle the real-world challenges in unsupervised person re-ID since it is designed for general close-set recognition problems with manually generated label noise. More importantly, it does not explore how to mitigate the label noises for the triplet loss as our method does.\n\n\n[QUESTION 2]\nWhy the temporal averaging of model parameters prevents the two models from being the same?\n\n[RESPONSE 2]\nIntuitively, when removing temporal average models, Net 1 is directly trained to approach the predictions of Net 2 with on-the-fly parameters $\\theta_2^{(T-1)}$ at iteration $(T-1)$.\nIn our MMT, Net 1 is optimized toward the predictions of Net 2 with averaging model parameters $E^{(T)}[\\theta_2]$ which is ensembled from iteration $(0)$ to iteration $(T-1)$.\nObviously, temporal average models provide more complementary and independent predictions which act as more robust soft pseudo labels in our framework, since the parameters are more de-coupled with larger time intervals.\n\nExperimental evidences are shown in Section A.1. The KL-divergence between predictions of two temporal averaging models is much larger than that of two plain networks during the training.\n\n\n[QUESTION 3]\nWhy are the noisy hard labels used? What is the performance when only soft labels are used for model updates?\n\n[RESPONSE 3]\nThe noisy hard pseudo labels are utilized since the hard classification loss is the foundation for capturing the target-domain data distributions. The soft labels for classification loss are almost uniform and uninformative at early epochs, since the initial network could not correctly distinguish between different identities on the target domain. Independently training with such smooth and noisy soft pseudo labels, the networks in our framework would soon collapse due to the large bias.\n\nWith regularization by only soft pseudo labels, i.e. removing both the hard classification loss and the hard triplet loss, the framework totally fails with performances even lower than the pre-trained model on the source domain (new result in Table 2 denoted as \u201cBaseline+MMT-500 (only $\\mathcal{L}^t_{sid}$ & $\\mathcal{L}^t_{stri}$)\u201d).\n\nWe further investigate the contributions of the hard classification loss and hard triplet loss in our proposed framework separately. The experimental results are shown in Table 2 (marked in blue) and we observe that the hard classification loss is essential to our framework while the hard triplet loss is not absolutely necessary. Detailed analysis and explanations are listed in Section 4.4, namely \u201cNecessity of hard pseudo labels in proposed MMT\u201d.\n\n\n[QUESTION 4]\nWhy the weighting factors are different between softmax and triplet losses?\n\n[RESPONSE 4]\nWe empirically searched the weights $\\lambda^t_{tri}$ and $\\lambda^t_{id}$ on the Duke-to-Market task with $M_t=500$ pseudo classes and IBN-ResNet-50 backbone. The searched hyper-parameters are directly used in other settings.\n\nFrom our observation, we found that the soft softmax-triplet loss has larger weight than the soft classification loss, since it is much easier to predict robust soft labels for softmax-triplets, which only has two classes, i.e. positive and negative.\n\nTo further investigate the influence of $\\lambda^t_{tri}$ and $\\lambda^t_{id}$, additional experiments are conducted in Section A.2 during rebuttal. We claim that our framework is not sensitive to the weighting factors as we outperform state-of-the-arts with all tested hyper-parameters, except when the hard classification loss is eliminated ($\\lambda^t_{id}=1.0$). We have analysed the necessity of hard classification loss in [RESPONSE 3].\n\n\n[QUESTION 5]\np.1 (Zhang et al., 2018b) and p.5 (Zhang et al., 2019a) are missing in references.\n\n[RESPONSE 5]\nThese two works have been listed in the references in our initial submission.\np.1 (Zhang et al., 2018b): \u201cYing Zhang, Tao Xiang, Timothy M Hospedales, and Huchuan Lu.

We really appreciate the comments for improving the clarity of statements and experimental verifications. The manuscript is revised accordingly, and the main concerns are listed as below.\n\n\n[QUESTION 1]\nWhat's the difference between Net 1 and Net 2 in Figure 2?\n\n[RESPONSE 1]\nThe main differences lie in three aspects.\n(1) The two networks are initialized with different weights.\n(2) Image batches are fed into the two networks with separately random perturbations,\n(3) The two networks are optimized under different supervisions, i.e. regularized by separate soft pseudo labels which are generated by the other network.\n\n\n[QUESTION 2]\nIt seems Net 1 and Net 2 are redundant.\n\n[RESPONSE 2]\nNo, they are not. The two networks are complementary due to the differences introduced in [RESPONSE 1]. With the proposed mutual mean-teaching scheme, the two networks can continuously learn different knowledge from the soft pseudo labels generated by the other networks. Such design effectively refines the pseudo label noise in the unsupervised person re-ID task.\n\nExperimental results also verify the effectiveness of learning from dual networks. We conduct sufficient ablation studies in Table 2. Specifically, \u201cBaseline+MMT-500(w/o $\\theta_2$)\u201d denotes the experiment with only one network left which is supervised by its own temporal average model. Significant performance drops from 63.1% to 58.2% in terms of mAP on Market-to-Duke task with ResNet-50 are observed by keeping only one network in our proposed framework.\n\nThe effectiveness of collaborative training with multiple networks have also been verified in more general tasks.\n(1) DualNet (Hou et al., 2017) improved the image recognition accuracies by learning complementary and richer features with double feature encoders.\n(2) Deep mutual learning (Zhang et al., 2018b) performed model distillation between a pool of simple student networks and achieved better performances than the typical one-way transferring from a pre-trained static large (teacher) network.\n(3) For semi-supervised learning, Dual Student (Ke et al., 2019) broke the performance bottleneck of conventional teacher-student network by introducing to adopt two student networks with more de-coupled parameters for peer teaching.\n(4) Similar pipelines are also employed on noisy labels, for instance, Co-teaching (Han et al., 2018) simultaneously trained two same networks and conducted noisy labels detection by selecting clean data for each other.\n\nHowever, existing methods with two peer networks mostly focused on close-set recognition problems and could not tackle the challenges in the task of open-set unsupervised person re-ID studied in our paper. More importantly, compared to the partial or noisy labels provided by their tasks, the unsupervised person re-ID remains a more challenging problem with no label at all.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The proposed method benefits from ground-truth information of the target domain, which makes the comparison unfair.\n\n[RESPONSE 3]\nWe conducted additional experiments with different values of $M_t$ on MSMT17 dataset during the rebuttal period. Results of the newly added Market-to-MSMT17 task in Table 1 show that the best performances are achieved when $M_t = 1500$, which is much larger than the actual identity numbers (1041).

However, domain diversities between different datasets pose an evident challenge for adapting the re-ID model trained on one dataset to another one. State-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods for person re-ID transferred the learned knowledge from the source domain by optimizing with pseudo labels created by clustering algorithms on the target domain. Although they achieved state-of-the-art performances, the inevitable label noise caused by the clustering procedure was ignored. Such noisy pseudo labels substantially hinders the model's capability on further improving feature representations on the target domain. In order to mitigate the effects of noisy pseudo labels, we propose to softly refine the pseudo labels in the target domain by proposing an unsupervised framework, Mutual Mean-Teaching (MMT), to learn better features from the target domain via off-line refined hard pseudo labels and on-line refined soft pseudo labels in an alternative training manner.  In addition, the common practice is to adopt both the classification loss and the triplet loss jointly for achieving optimal performances in person re-ID models. However, conventional triplet loss cannot work with softly refined labels. To solve this problem, a novel soft softmax-triplet loss is proposed to support learning with soft pseudo triplet labels for achieving the optimal domain adaptation performance.
