However, there is still a mismatch even with 1-step Q-learning because the bootstrapped target is also computed from the TreeQN. More specifically, there can be a mismatch between the optimal action sequences computed from TreeQN at time t and t+1 if the depth of TreeQN is equal or greater than 2. Thus, the author's response is still not convincing to me.\nI like the overall idea of using a tree-structured neural network which internally performs planning as an abstraction of Q-function, which makes implementation simpler compared to VPN. However, the particular method (TreeQN) proposed in this paper introduces a mismatch in the model learning as mentioned above. One could argue that TreeQN is learning an \"abstract\" planning rather than \"grounded\" planning. However, the fact that reward prediction loss is used to train TreeQN significantly weakens this claim, and there is no such an evidence in the paper. \nIn conclusion, I think the research direction is worth pursuing, but the proposed modification from VPN is not well-justified.\n\n# Summary\nThis paper proposes TreeQN and ATreeC which perform look-ahead planning using neural networks. TreeQN simulates the future by predicting rewards/values of the future states and performs tree backup to construct Q-values. ATreeC is an actor-critic architecture that uses a softmax over TreeQN. The architecture is trained through n-step Q-learning with reward prediction loss. The proposed methods outperform DQN baseline on 2D Box Pushing domain and outperforms VPN on Atari games.\n\n[Pros]\n- The paper is easy to follow.\n- The application to actor-critic setting (ATreeC) is novel, though the underlying idea was proposed by [O'Donoghue et al., Schulman et al.].\n\n[Cons]\n- The proposed method has a technical issue.\n- The proposed idea (TreeQN) and underlying motivation are almost same as those of VPN [Oh et al.], but there is no in-depth discussion that shows why TreeQN is potentially better than VPN. \n- Comparison to VPN on Atari is not much convincing. \n\n# Novelty and Significance\n- The underlying motivation (planning without predicting observations), the architecture (transition/reward/value functions applied to the latent state space), and the algorithm (n-step Q-learning with reward prediction loss) are same as those of VPN. But, the paper does not provide in-depth discussion on this. The following is the differences that I found from this paper, so it would be important to discuss why such differences are important.\n\n1) The paper emphasizes the \"fully-differentiable tree planning\" aspect in contrast to VPN that back-propagates only through \"non-branching\" trajectories during training. However, differentiating TreeQN also amounts to back-propagating through a \"single\" trajectory in the tree that gives the maximum Q-value. Thus, the only difference between TreeQN and VPN is that TreeQN follows the best (estimated) action sequence, while VPN follows the chosen action sequence in retrospect during back-propagation. Can you justify why following the best estimated action sequence is better than following the chosen action sequence during back-propagation (see Technical Soundness section for discussion)?\n\n2) TreeQN only sets targets for the final Q-value after tree backup, whereas VPN sets targets for all intermediate value predictions in the tree. Why is TreeQN's approach better than VPN's approach? \n\n- The application to actor-critic setting (ATreeC) is novel, though the underlying idea of combining Q-learning with policy gradient was proposed by [O'Donoghue et al.] and [Schulman et al.].\n\n# Technical Soundness\n- The proposed idea of setting targets for the final Q-value after tree backup can potentially make the temporal credit assignment difficult, because the best estimated actions during tree planning does not necessarily match with the chosen actions. Suppose that TreeQN estimated \"up-right-right\" as the best future action sequence the during 3-step tree planning, while the agent actually ended up with choosing \"up-left-left\" (this is possible because the agent re-plans at every step and follows epsilon-greedy policy). Following n-step Q-learning procedure, we end up with setting target Q-value based on on-policy action sequence \"up-left-left\", while back-propagating through \"up-right-right\" action sequence in the TreeQN's plan. This causes a wrong temporal credit assignment, because TreeQN can potentially increase/decrease value estimates in the wrong direction due to the mismatch between the planned actions and chosen actions. So, it is unclear why the proposed algorithm is technically correct or better than VPN's approach (i.e., back-propagating through the chosen actions in the search tree).\n \n# Quality\n- Comparison to VPN on Atari is not convincing because TreeQN-1 is actually (almost) equivalent to VPN-1, but the results show that TreeQN-1 performs much better than VPN on many games. Since the authors took the numbers from [Oh et al.] rather than replicating VPN, it is possible that the gap comes from implementation details (e.g., hyperparameter). \n\n# Clarity\n- The paper is overall easy to follow and the description of the proposed method is clear.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "TreeQN and ATreeC: Differentiable Tree-Structured Models for Deep Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Combining deep model-free reinforcement learning with on-line planning is a promising approach to building on the successes of deep RL.

This fits into the recent line of work on implicit planning where forms of models are learned to be useful for a prediction/planning task. The proposed architecture performs something analogous to a full-width tree search using an abstract model (learned end-to-end). This is done by expanding all possible transitions to a fixed depth before performing a max backup on all expanded nodes.

In both domains, TreeQN and AtreeC are compared to a DQN architecture, but it wasn\u2019t clear to me that this is the right baseline. Indeed TreeQN and AtreeC share the same conv stack in the encoder (I think?), but also have the extra capacity of the tree on top. Can the performance gain we see in the Push task as a function of tree depth be explained by the added network capacity? Same comment in Atari, but there it\u2019s not really obvious that the proposed architecture is helping. Baselines could include unsharing the weights in the tree, removing the max backup, having a regular MLP with similar capacity, etc.\n\nPage 5, the auxiliary loss on reward prediction seems appropriate, but it\u2019s not clear from the text and experiments whether it actually was necessary.

Just because the transition function is shared and the model could learn to construct a tree, when trained end-to-end the system is not sufficiently constrained to learn this specific behaviour. More to a point. I think the search tree perspective is interesting, but isn\u2019t this just a deeper model with shared weights? And a max operation? It seems no loss is used to force the embeddings produced by the transition model to match the embeddings that you would get if you take a particular action in a particular state, right? Is there any specific attempt to visualize or understand the embeddings inside the tree? The same regarding the rewards. If there is no auxiliary loss attempting to force the intermediary prediction to be valid rewards, why would the model use those free latent variables to encode rewards? I think this is a pitfall that many deep network papers fall, where by laying out a particular structure it is directly inferred that the model discovers or follows a particular solution (where the latent have prescribed semantics). I would argue that is rarely the case. When the system is learned end-to-end, the structure does not impose the behaviour of the model, and is up to the authors of the paper to prove that the trained model does anything similar to expanding a tree. And this is not by showing final performance on a game. If indeed the model does anything similar to search, than all intermediary representations should correspond to what semantically they should. \nIgnoring my verbose comment, another view is that the baseline are disadvantaged to the treeQN, because they have less parameters (and are less deep which has a huge impact on the learnability and expressivity of the deep network). \n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "TreeQN and ATreeC: Differentiable Tree-Structured Models for Deep Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Combining deep model-free reinforcement learning with on-line planning is a promising approach to building on the successes of deep RL.

We really appreciate your time and effort in trying to reproduce our results; this is a great initiative. We read through your report and online code, and identified several issues and important bugs that we list and discuss below. We intend to open source our code in time (after the anonymous review period), but are happy to correspond further in advance of that, if you\u2019re interested in attempting further to reproduce our results.\n\nIssues in the report:\n    - All results on the Box pushing environment seem to be off. The average reward is negative, even for the DQN baseline. This suggests there is something fundamentally different in your implementation.\n    - Cartpole is not a suitable test environment. It is a very simple environment and there is no reason to believe that ad-hoc planning is required or helps. Indeed, any reasonably tuned algorithm should reach a performance ceiling on this toy task, so there is no reason TreeQN should outperform DQN. \n    - Appendix: \u201cunsure which part of the network is minimized\u201d -- we aren\u2019t sure where the misunderstanding lies (whole network is trained end-to-end and overall loss is minimized)\n    - In our paper \u201cDQN\u201d refers to the architecture rather than the training algorithm, which is n-step Q-learning as described in the background section -- we do not use a replay buffer. However, we hope and expect that a proper TreeQN implementation would help with off-policy training data as well, and it is worth investigation.\n\nErrors in code:\n    TreeQN (Tensorflow implementation)\n        - The Q-learning algorithm implementation for TreeQN looks wrong. You need to compute targets using the target network evaluation of next_states. In line 74 of TreeQNModel.py these targets are computed using the current state, and do not include the observed reward.\n        - Action selection should use the online network rather than the target network.\n    ATreeC (Pytorch implementation)\n        - For the CNN encoder (our encoder) there doesn\u2019t appear to be any residual connection or nonlinearity (nonlinearities between layers are crucial!) in the transition function.\n        - The value module should be a different set of parameters from the critic\u2019s fully-connected layer, as shown in fig. 3 of our paper. We can make this more clear in the paper.\n        - There should be an auxiliary loss on the reward prediction; we use this for both TreeQN and ATreeC.\n        - Don\u2019t subtract the critic value from Q estimates; critic heads are not used in policy at all. The \u201cQ-estimates\u201d from the tree should go straight into a softmax to produce the policy.\n        - For your fully-connected variant of ATreeC\u2019s encoder, try using the residual connection just for transition function; don\u2019t add again the original inputs from before the encoder layers.\n        - NB: there may be a more fundamental issue, as the failure of any algorithm to learn in fig. 3 of the report is surprising.\n\nHyperparameters:\n    - We will update the paper to include: discount factor gamma=0.99, and the target networks are updated every 40000 environment transitions; for both box-pushing and Atari."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "TreeQN and ATreeC: Differentiable Tree-Structured Models for Deep Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Combining deep model-free reinforcement learning with on-line planning is a promising approach to building on the successes of deep RL.

However, this mismatch appears for *any* model estimating the optimal Q* with partially on-policy bootstraps. The weakly grounded internal temporal semantics of our architecture do not exacerbate this problem, but simply render more explicit the mechanism for estimating Q*.\nIn 1-step Q-learning, or when using policy gradients, this model-objective mismatch does not appear. In practice, n-step Q-learning targets help to stabilise and speed learning despite the unusual combination of on- and off- policy components in the targets. However, it is true that 1-step Q-learning, or policy gradients, provides objectives more consistent with our overall approach.\n\nRegarding the comparison to VPN algorithmically:\nFollowing the best estimated action sequence removes a mismatch between the use of the model components at training and test-time: in our approach, the components are freely optimised for their use in estimating the optimal action-value or action-probability, rather than trained to match a greedy bootstrap with an on-policy internal path. We believe it is crucial to maintain an equivalent context at training and evaluation time.\nThis is also the motivation for optimising Q only after the full tree backup, rather than also after partial backups. We want to learn a model that is as good as possible within the specific architecture we use, rather than across a class of related architectures with varying tree-depths. It is possible that such transfer learning could help in some problems. However, it is important to note that intermediate value estimates are still used, as they are mixed into the final prediction during the backup.\nConstructing the full tree at each time-step frees us to make value estimates for all (root-node) actions, which enables the extension to ATreeC -- something that can\u2019t easily be done with VPN. This extension is more about using an *architecture* designed for value-prediction in the context of policy gradients, rather than using *algorithmic* components of Q-learning with policy gradients as in the work of [O'Donoghue et al., Schulman et al.].\nOur overall strategy also simplifies training, as the whole model can be used as a drop-in replacement for an action-value or policy network, without recombining the components in a different manner for on-policy training segments, target evaluation, and testing. In our view this is a valuable contribution over VPN.\n\nRegarding the experimental comparison to VPN, it is clear that some details of hyperparameters or implementation constitute a large part of the difference (as most clearly seen in the different baseline DQN results).

Explicit grounding, or lack thereof, is merely a means to the end of maximising task performance. Therefore, while the empirical question of how explicitly to ground the model is fascinating, we believe the quality of the paper should not be measured in terms of how explicitly the model is grounded. See also the answer to the anonymous comment from 21st of November below.\n\nWe found that grounding the reward function (which takes intermediate embeddings as input) with an explicit loss did help performance, so we included that in the objective (see Sec. 3.2). However, we found that explicitly grounding the latent representations based on a reconstruction loss did not help. In the paper, we also discuss reasons why one should avoid such objectives when constructed in the observation space. Also note that intermediate value predictions are mixed into the final prediction. While this doesn\u2019t force a grounding, it encourages each of the intermediate embeddings to correspond to a valid state embedding.\n\nThe key idea behind our paper is that the architecture that makes sense for a grounded model (e.g., tree-planning) should still provide a useful inductive bias for a learned model that is only weakly grounded or not grounded at all.\n\nConcerning baselines, our preliminary experiments showed that simply adding more parameters via width or depth to a DQN architecture did not result in significant performance gains, which we will make clear in the paper. A large-scale investigation of such architectures and their combination with auxiliary losses on many Atari games may be infeasible for us, but we have added to the appendix a figure demonstrating the limitations of naively adding parameters to DQN on the box-pushing domain."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "TreeQN and ATreeC: Differentiable Tree-Structured Models for Deep Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Combining deep model-free reinforcement learning with on-line planning is a promising approach to building on the successes of deep RL.

Furthermore, we present ablation studies that demonstrate the effect of different auxiliary losses on learning transition models.", "pdf": "/pdf/3602500a5732910dc9bbd51fae258a78e0d4a908.pdf", "TL;DR": "We present TreeQN and ATreeC, new architectures for deep reinforcement learning in discrete-action domains that integrate differentiable on-line tree planning into the action-value function or policy.", "paperhash": "farquhar|treeqn_and_atreec_differentiable_treestructured_models_for_deep_reinforcement_learning", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nfarquhar2018treeqn,\ntitle={Tree{QN} and {AT}reeC: Differentiable Tree Planning for Deep Reinforcement Learning},\nauthor={Gregory Farquhar and Tim Rocktaeschel and Maximilian Igl and Shimon Whiteson},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1dh6Ax0Z},\n}", "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "deep learning", "planning"], "authors": ["Gregory Farquhar", "Tim Rockt\u00e4schel", "Maximilian Igl", "Shimon Whiteson"], "authorids": ["gregory.farquhar@cs.ox.ac.uk", "tim.rocktaeschel@gmail.com", "maximilian.igl@gmail.com", "shimon.whiteson@gmail.com"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "duedate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "tmdate": 1512791685903, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper468/Public_Comment", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["~"], "reply": {"replyto": null, "forum": "H1dh6Ax0Z", "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*|\\(anonymous\\)"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*|\\(anonymous\\)", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "value-dropdown": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Authors_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Reviewers_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Area_Chairs_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 0, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper468/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper468/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper468/Area_Chair"], "cdate": 1512791685903}}}], "count": 13}
