This allows understanding of both efficacy of multiplicative interaction (i.e., MI vs MLP), and the common between multiplicative-type models (e.g., hypernetworks, FiLM, gating,  attention etc). The authors also find MI models able to achieve a state-of-the-art performance on language modeling (WikiText-103) and reinforcement learning problems(DMLAB-30), along with several toy examples. \n\nStrengths: \n*The discussed MI subject is important research area, the paper presents the vast related work, proven by the fact MI techniques appears in many recent models.\n* The authors  did comprehensive evaluation to show importance and usefulness of multiplicative interactions. A  toy regression experiment to show superiority of MI vs MLP . A Reinforcement learning task, i.e DMLAB-30 on par with the state-of-the-art model, but with simple model (i.e., less parameters). A sequence prediction with an alternative embedding technique that improves both accuracy and number of needed parameters. \n* The paper is of high quality: well organized, clear, with good supporting figures.  \n\nWeaknesses:\n* I suggest a better explanation how the suggested models compare to state-of-the-art models.  Currently, it is hard to assess the impact. For instance, proposed model alternate existing baselines, such as PopArt, or is completely novel?  \n* Although mentioned, it's not the focus of this work, the paper should have discussed attention models more.  Specifically recent years multimodal attention relied on multiplicative interactions. Therefore, at least in this domain multiplicative interactions are not \"under-appreciated\". Relevant papers: [1, 2, 3, 4] - advancement of multiplicative interactions over the years, [5] - introduce co-attention, [6] - introduce higher-order interactions (between three vectors), [7] - introduce bilinear attention .\n\nTo conclude, multiplicative interactions are extremely important, and I find the paper exploration useful. In addition,  the paper is of high quality, and with satisfied experiments to prove their claims.

We have revised the paper with an increased discussion of these papers. Our specific reasoning for not including more discussion around attention networks originally was that their efficacy is often attributed not just to multiplicative interactions but also their ability to make connections across vast temporal horizons. We thus felt a more detailed study to tease apart these two functions was needed, which was out-of-scope for this work. However the paper links are certainly relevant, as we already some works in  VQA and the works linked are able to combine both attention and such bilinear systems. We have thus expanded the overall related work. \n\nWe have also expanded the discussion around PopArt and other baselines. We feel that the performance gain from PopArt is orthogonal as it addresses a different underlying issue: namely the difference in reward/loss scales in RL. As such these two methods could be combined.

Thus even controlling for parameters we can see there is a large gain in performance using such multiplicative interactions and believe this rules out the confounding factor you mention. We will add these results in the appendix once they have finished running completely. \n\nRe default LSTM cell: Would you able to clarify what you mean by \u201creplacing\u201d the cell?

Part of our aim in writing this was to provide a concise study into multiplicative interactions and we will definitely take on board the comments to make this case stronger. \n\nThe point about where multiplicative interactions are *not* needed is very valid. We ran some preliminary experiments which showed that they were not out of the box useful in such classification domains. Our intuition was that this was not a domain where different contextual streams were being combined per-se, and that this probably explained the lack of improvement. As a large part of the study considers combining such streams of information, we thought these experiments were out-of-scope and didn\u2019t include them. We respectfully disagree with the comment that the experiments are light: we believe the results across large scale RL, and LM, combined with improvements in neural processes and the exploratory toy domains provide diverse and compelling evidence that these methods are widely applicable. \n\nOn the point about bottle-neck size: we will make this clearer in the paper. What we found was that bottleneck was not too important in determining results. What was true was that below a certain size the network could not learn but there was no large improvement in increasing it above 64 (ie 2048 \u2014> 64). \n\nRe LSTM gating: We don\u2019t think the proposed form obviates the need for LSTM gating \u2014 as the gating itself can be seen as a diagonal version of the proposed form with added non-linearities. We think what we do show is there is not *enough* such gating inside an LSTM. Specifically, the added multiplicative interactions between x and h_t improve performance significantly. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper684/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper684/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multiplicative Interactions and Where to Find Them", "authors": ["Siddhant M.

To make the paper more thorough, it would be nice to see cases where multiplicative interactions are *not* needed, e.g. if one sticks multiplicative interactions in a network trained to classify MNIST or CIFAR-10, do they help at all? If not, why not?\n - Further ablation studies would also benefit the paper. For example, in the language modeling section, how would the results change with varying bottleneck size? With a completely diagonal approximation? Finally, LSTMs already have multiplicative interactions in them (via gating, as mentioned in the paper). Would the proposed form of multiplicative interaction obviate the need for LSTM gating all together?\n\nWith additional experiments this paper could be a strong accept and recommended reading for many first year grad students.

Multiplicative interactions can be viewed as an effective way of integrating contextual information in a network. Through a series of thorough empirical experiments, this paper demonstrates superior performance on a variety of tasks (RL, sequence modeling) when a such multiplicative interaction module is incorporated.\n\nThe framework seems applicable for learning tasks where a latent variable or context embedding presents. And the paper hypothesizes that multiplicative interactions can help introduce desirable inductive biases, therefore leading to improved generalization performance. However, the theoretical intuition and justification for such hypothesis is missing, which weakens the contribution of the paper. \n\nIn Table 1, the model LSTM with Multiplicative Decoder has more parameters (105M) than the vanilla LSTM in comparison (88M). It\u2019d be good to provide a more fair comparison by slightly increasing the capacity of baseline LSTM model (e.g., using larger output dimension to match the capacity). This will rule out the cofounding factor that the improved performance is due to the algorithm instead of increased model capacity. \n\nIn Section 8, it\u2019d be convincing if the authors can also report results for replacing default LSTM cell with multiplicative interactions. In paragraph 3, the authors only discussed the feasibility conceptually, without providing experimental results to support this argument. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper684/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper684/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multiplicative Interactions and Where to Find Them", "authors": ["Siddhant M.
