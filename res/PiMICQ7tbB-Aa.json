The first method is looking at the variance of hidden nodes when inputs vary on some aspects but stay the same in others.  The second method is looking at the relative activity of the hidden nodes when additional input features are subsequently added. The hope is to identify some \u201cGrandmother\u201d like cells in a DBN which would be selective of faces and digits.\r\n\r\nOverall I think the paper is somewhat interesting in it\u2019s motivation of probing the DBN to see the meaning of each hidden layer units. However, DBNs are notoriously hard to interpret due to the fact that it is a distributed representation. While i think the paper is in the right direction, the method presented are very simplistic and it is not clear what can be concluded. In particular, it is somewhat expected that if we remove the nodes which are modified by when a face image changes a face+digit, then what remains can better reconstruct the face. Is training performed sequentially on the three datasets 1,2, and 3?\r\n\r\nAnother issues is that the digit is just so much brighter than the face, making this problem easier, what happens if you use the digit with the similar intensity as the face? my suspicion is that the DBN would have a lot of trouble with that.\r\n\r\nPossible way to make this a good paper would be to use the hidden node discovered as a form of detector. It would perform worse than a discriminatively trained detector but it would be interesting to see a comparison."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Distinction between features extracted using deep belief networks", "decision": "submitted, no decision", "abstract": "Data representation is an important pre-processing step in many machine learning algorithms.
