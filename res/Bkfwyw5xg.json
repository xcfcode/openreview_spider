It is indeed hard to find any universal insight. However, after revisiting our experimental results and re-organizing the experiment section, we draw the following conclusions according to specific tasks and are excited to share with you:\n\t\t1.Dependency-based context type does not get all the credit for capturing functional similarity. Bound context representation also plays an important role, especially for GBOW.\n\t\t2.Syntactic word analogy benefits less from bound context representation. Bound context representation already contains syntactic information, which makes it difficult to capture this information based on the input word-context pairs.\n\t\t3.Bound context representation is suitable for sequence labeling task, especially when it is used along with dependency-based context.\n\t\t4.On text classification task, different contexts do not affect the final performance much. Nonetheless, the use of pre-trained word embeddings is crucial and linear context type with unbound representation is still the best choice.\n\tFor more details, please see our revised experiment section.\n\tAs for the GloVe model, we just need a few more days to re-run it for the best configuration. We promise that the results will be added before January 14th (Saturday). So sorry for the delay.\n\tWe sincerely thank you for the detailed and constructive reviews. Please do kindly leave comments and suggests to help us further improve this work. \n\nCheers,\nAuthors of this paper.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Investigating Different Context Types and Representations for Learning Word Embeddings", "abstract": "The number of word embedding models is growing every year.
