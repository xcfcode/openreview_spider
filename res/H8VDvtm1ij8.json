For similar reasons as to why isotonic regression, while being non-parametric, does not overfit, normalizing flows fit only on one dimensional CDFs will also not overfit. However, the more variables you condition on or the more variables you train on jointly, the more likely the flow can overfit.  In the extreme case, if you give all the features to the recalibration step, the model is doing exactly what was done during the calibration step, i.e. equally susceptible as the calibration step, if not more so due to the smaller validation set.\n\n2. *The paper focuses on aleatoric uncertainty.

If we are considering recalibration, then we are interested in a model that is, at the very least, capable of modeling any arbitrary quantile of a distribution.  When using a full distribution we arrive at a model that, when properly calibrated, gives access to not only arbitrary quantiles, but other statistics such as the mean, variance, and other higher moments.  In the multivariate case it also allows us to access correlations.  It is important to note that using a full distribution achieves this with a single model whereas using loss functions that only model a single statistic would require one model per statistic of interest.  In addition, it would preclude any downstream likelihood use cases (e.g., anomaly detection) as well as anything that makes use of the generative model (e.g., samples).\n\n\n2. *b) whether we should expect recalibration to behave like a regularizer*\n\nIf we view the test error as MSE, then one could view calibration/recalibration as a regularizer since the model capacity has to be used to both accurately learn the mean as well as all other higher order moments of the distribution.\n\n3. *e) why the Kuleshov et al method can't be used to calculate test error*\n\nThe reason isotonic regression cannot be used to compute test MSE is because the model is CDF to CDF, and so either you can try to sample from it but you would have to find the inverse of the model or you can try to compute the log likelihood which you would do by trying to understand the change of variables implied by the nonparametric method. In both cases, the methods aren\u2019t impossible but are not naturally incorporated into isotonic regression, discounting the fact that isotonic regression also cannot handle conditional variables.\n\n4. *What does the new visualization answer?*\n\nThe goal of the CDF performance plot is to show the calibration performance across different subsets of the data (where in the original example, we were binning by the model\u2019s mean prediction). In order to simplify the presentation and focus more on the usage of normalizing flows, we show the same content via CDF Q-Q Plots.\n\n5. *Doesn't justify meaningful ways the method is different from existing methods*\n\nThanks for the feedback, we have updated the introduction and conclusion to better justify how normalizing flows differ from isotonic regression. The main benefits here are that normalizing flows can be trivially extended to being conditional and multivariate. Conditional recalibration was mentioned in Kuleshov et al. (2018), but the technique there is using a ConditionalGaussian, instead of something non-parametric like isotonic regression. We specifically use QuAR Flows as opposed to other normalizing flows and conditional distributions as they are highly flexible (making it comparable to isotonic regression) and computationally efficient.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2333/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2333/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Normalizing Flows for Calibration and Recalibration", "authorids": ["~Achintya_Gopal1", "~Aaron_Key1"], "authors": ["Achintya Gopal", "Aaron Key"], "keywords": ["recalibration", "normalizing flows", "uncertainty"], "abstract": "In machine learning, due to model misspecification and overfitting, estimates of the aleatoric uncertainty are often inaccurate.\nOne approach to fix this is isotonic regression, in which a monotonic function is fit on a validation set to map the model's CDF to an optimally calibrated CDF.

As noted in the paper, the only restriction that is imposed by using normalizing flows for recalibration is that we assume the original model outputs a full distribution that has closed-form likelihoods.  This could be as simple as a Gaussian and as complex as another normalizing flow.\n\n5. *How is normalizing flow extended to multivariate calibration?*\n\nSection 4.3 addresses the extension to multivariate calibration.

Why do we need normalizing flows for this at all? Any model can be recalibrated using any other model here. Is there some special reason for normalizing flows here?*\n\nNormalizing flows allow us to recast the recalibration problem as a maximum likelihood problem.  Due to their monotonicity by construction, we are able to retain a tractable, explicit density in the recalibrated model, from which we can then recover any statistic. \n\n2. *The new plot introduced is more confusing than illuminating. I really didn't follow it at all. It is very crowded and takes a lot of inspection to understand what is going on. I suspect all of this could have been visualized much clearer by using a handful of simpler plots that are straightforward.*\n\nThank you for the feedback.  In order to maintain the focus of the paper on the usage of normalizing flows for recalibration we have presented the results in a more familiar, albeit less complete, manner with multiple QQ plots.\n\n3. *The benchmarks do not really compare against very competitive models. The authors choose to use a model that was only pushed to the arxiv a month ago as the baseline. Why? Then the alternative choices are strawmen: a Bayesian linear regression model, a variational dropout model, etc. There is a wealth of conditional distribution estimation literature with companion code publicly available on github (NADE, MAF, MDNs, etc). Why not use those?*\n\nThe conditional flow model used (QuAR) was chosen as it is an evolution of residual flows that retains most, if not all, of the performance while improving on the computational efficiency.  The alternatives are chosen as examples of other models that are used to attempt to model the aleatoric uncertainty in regression problems.\n\nFor other deep learning approaches to modeling conditional distributions such as NADE and MAF, in the one dimensional case, they reduce down to the ConditionalGaussian that we used. Some techniques do replace the output distribution with mixtures or other analytical distributions; however QuAR Flows were shown to be able to handle mixtures as well as interesting shapes like a Uniform (where other techniques would struggle unless it was assumed that the output is uniformly distributed).\n\n4. *Does this really help us do anything new? Is this just \"my model is 0.1% better on 8 UCI datasets than 4 other models\"? Seems like a pretty uninspiring result if that's the idea.*\n\nThe intent is not to show that we can recalibrate models better on the UCI datasets, but rather that normalizing flows have competitive performance in the space of problems that isotonic regression can solve, while also maintaining a tractable density from which we can calculate any statistic (in direct contrast to isotonic regression).

It builds off a method proposed by Kuleshov et al (2018). The newly proposed method has the following steps:\n  1) Train a conditional density model for a regression outcome y given an input x on training data. The authors use conditional normalizing flows for this task.\n  2) For each set of points (x_t, y_t) in a validation set, pass an input x_t to the model in step 1 to learn an induced CDF for the output F_t(). Calculate F_t(y_t), i.e. the induced CDF evaluated at the actual output, and use another flow-based density model to learn the distribution of the CDF values. If the model in step 1 is perfectly calibrated, this density should be uniform, but in practice it seldom is.\n  3) For future data points, the composition of densities in steps 1) and 2) provide a new, uncertainty-calibrated density.\n\nThe overall problem area is interesting, important, and underexplored. There has been a lot of work on calibration estimates for classification tasks, but there are less methods for regression. Using flows here is a cool idea. Any exact density model can be used for the method above, and normalizing flows are a good solution because they are monotonic by construction. \n\nThat being said, after reading the paper, I'm not convinced that the proposed method is a significant improvement over the method by Kuleshov et al. that it's building off of. Kuleshov et al. proposes a similar 2-step process, but instead of explicitly learning a distribution over the induced CDF values, it uses an isotonic regression to calibrate the CDF. Looking at the experimental results, it seems that the isotonic recalibration performs on par with the flow recalibration in terms of test set calibration error. \n\nPut another way, why should someone use flow-based recalibration instead of isotonic recalibration? A possible answer mentioned in the paper is that flow-based recalibration can be used to compute distribution statistics, such as the mean, while isotonic recalibration cannot compute these statistics. (Side question: why can't the isotonic recalibration be used to compute the mean? It seems like isotonic recalibration explicitly transforms an inverse-CDF to another inverse-CDF. Can't distribution statistics be imputed from this transformed inverse-CDF?). \n\nEven though flow recalibration can compute distribution statistics, the MSE never improves after flow recalibration; in some instances, it gets worse. What is the benefit of having distribution statistics? On the one hand, the worsened MSE might be expected behavior. Is uncertainty calibration expected to behave like a regularizer? If so, that should be stated and discussed in the paper. If not, then of course we shouldn't expect improvements in MSE after recalibration, because we're changing the model that had the best training-set performance. This could explain the results we see. In any case, there should be some justification in the paper for a) why computing distribution statistics is important, b) whether we should expect recalibration to behave like a regularizer, c) a discussion about the tradeoff between calibration performance and model error, and d) an illustration of scenarios where distribution statistics are crucial [and e), why the Kuleshov et al method can't be used to calculate test error].\n\nAdditionally, the paper proposes a way to visualize recalibration results. To be honest, I found the CDF performance plot confusing and hard to interpret. How should we interpret the x-axis (are predictions standardized, and if not, what units are they in)?

The approach uses normalizing flows to transform an existing model's predictions into a prediction that better matches the empirical quantiles to the theoretical quantiles. After this remapping procedure, the authors introduce a new plot to visualize calibration. Empirical benchmarks are run on a suite of UCI datasets.\n\nReview:\n\nI'm not sure what is really that interesting here. My high-level problems:\n\n- The remapping that the authors propose is just using a normalizing flow with a simple quantile calibration. Why do we need normalizing flows for this at all? Any model can be recalibrated using any other model here. Is there some special reason for normalizing flows here?\n\n- The new plot introduced is more confusing than illuminating. I really didn't follow it at all. It is very crowded and takes a lot of inspection to understand what is going on. I suspect all of this could have been visualized much clearer by using a handful of simpler plots that are straightforward.\n\n- The benchmarks do not really compare against very competitive models. The authors choose to use a model that was only pushed to the arxiv a month ago as the baseline. Why? Then the alternative choices are strawmen: a Bayesian linear regression model, a variational dropout model, etc. There is a wealth of conditional distribution estimation literature with companion code publicly available on github (NADE, MAF, MDNs, etc). Why not use those?\n\n- Does this really help us do anything new? Is this just \"my model is 0.1% better on 8 UCI datasets than 4 other models\"? Seems like a pretty uninspiring result if that's the idea.\n\nOverall, I just don't know what to see as the big contribution here. The paper feels a little rushed and could use a slower, more methodical pace where the authors carefully think through the contribution(s) and why they're necessary. A more thorough comparison to related work is also called for.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2333/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2333/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Normalizing Flows for Calibration and Recalibration", "authorids": ["~Achintya_Gopal1", "~Aaron_Key1"], "authors": ["Achintya Gopal", "Aaron Key"], "keywords": ["recalibration", "normalizing flows", "uncertainty"], "abstract": "In machine learning, due to model misspecification and overfitting, estimates of the aleatoric uncertainty are often inaccurate.\nOne approach to fix this is isotonic regression, in which a monotonic function is fit on a validation set to map the model's CDF to an optimally calibrated CDF.
