For the case where limited resources are available in the target low-resource language (e.g. a dictionary, pretrained embeddings, parallel text), multi-task learning is incorporated into the model. The approach is evaluated in terms of document classification performance using several combinations of source and target language.\n\nMain strengths:\n\n1. The paper is well written. The model description in Section 2 is very clear and precise.\n2. The proposed approach is simple but still shows good performance compared to models trained on corpora and dictionaries in the target language.\n3. A large number of empirical experiments are performed to analyse different aspects and the benefits of different target-language resources for multi-task learning.\n\nMain weaknesses:\n\n1. The application of this model to document classification seems to be new (I am not a direct expert in document classification), but the model itself and the components are not (sequence models, transfer learning and multitask learning are well-established). So this raises a concern about novelty (although the experimental results are new).\n\n2. With regards to the experiments, it is stated repeatedly that the DAN model which are compared to uses \"far more resources.\" The best ALL-CACO model also relies on several annotated but \"smaller\" resources (dictionaries, parallel text, embeddings). Would it be possible to have a baseline where a target-language model is trained on only a small amount of annotated in-domain document classification data in the target language? I am proposing this baseline in order to answer two questions. (i) Given a small amount of in-domain data for the task at hand, how much benefit do we get from additionally using data from a related language? (ii) How much benefit do we get from using target-language resources that do not address the task directly (dictionaries, embeddings) compared with using a \"similar\" amount of data from the specific task?\n\nOverall feedback:\n\nThis is a well-written paper, but I think since the core of the paper lies in its empirical evaluation, the above experiments (or something similar) would greatly strengthen the work.\n\nEdit: I am changing my rating from 5 to 6 based on the authors' response.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1554/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Exploiting Cross-Lingual Subword Similarities in Low-Resource Document Classification", "abstract": "Text classification must sometimes be applied in situations with no training data in a target language.

In our preliminary experiment, using a larger dictionary slightly improves test accuracy for the CACO models, but the improve becomes marginal as the dictionary is larger. Note that CLWE-based models are strictly more expressive than character-based models and have many more parameters (CLWE learns a separate vector for each word). Therefore, CLWE-based models are more suitable for high-resource settings, while our model is specifically designed for the low-resource setting, which we focus on in this paper.\n\nOur model is still useful in the high-resource setting though. In our updated draft, we experiment on feeding CLWE as extra features to a CACO classifier, and the test accuracies are significantly higher (on average) than only using CLWE as features (COM in Table 1). Therefore our model is useful even when we have enough resources to train a good CLWE.\n\nReviewer 2 asks what happens if we apply parallel projection on RCV2. In our preliminary experiment, using parallel project does not improve test accuracy on RCV2, because we already have a rather large set of high-quality labeled data. Therefore, we choose not to apply PP on RCV2.\n\nReviewer 2 asks about how the lambdas in Eq. 11 are tuned. As mentioned in the appendix, we use the same hyperparameters (including the lambdas) for all language pairs, and they are tuned on a held-out set of one \u201cdev\u201d language pair (it-es). In particular, we find it helpful to use a smaller lambda_e, which implies that the mimick task is less helpful than the other two auxiliary tasks.\n\nReviewer 2 asks why language identifiers hurts the performance. Using language identifier allows the embedder to behave differently for the two languages. In practice, this added expressiveness could lead to overfitting the training dictionary. Consequently, the embedder might assign very different representations to orthographically similar words from the two languages. This could prevent generalization through orthographic features and decrease test accuracy.\n\nReviewer 2 asks why our experiment results are asymmetric, and why the performance gains are better for some language pairs. In general, the effectiveness of *any* existing cross-lingual transfer technique varies across languages, and there is no guarantee that the results should be symmetric. In our case, we hypothesize the differences in morphology between languages plays an important role. This is an important research question that we wish to investigate in future work.\n\nReviewer 2 asks why using two source languages helps and what happens when we further increase the number of source languages. One simple explanation for the accuracy improvement is that training on two source languages has a regularization effect and prevents the model from overfitting to a particular language. Unfortunately, our dataset has a limited number of languages, and we could not experiment with more (related) source languages. Please let us know if there are other text classification datasets with more languages.\n\nIn our updated draft, we try to clarify reviewer 2\u2019s questions to provide more explanations for experiment results. Please let us know if you have any additional questions or suggestions."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1554/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1554/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1554/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Exploiting Cross-Lingual Subword Similarities in Low-Resource Document Classification", "abstract": "Text classification must sometimes be applied in situations with no training data in a target language.

The approach is reasonable, albeit somewhat unexciting, as the basic underlying ideas are in the vein of Pinter et al. (2017), even if applied on a different task.\n\nThe main concern I have with the paper is that it leaves much open in terms of exploring the dimension of (dis)similarity: How does the model perform when similarity decreases across language pairs in the transfer? The paper currently offers a rather biased view: the couplings French-Italian-Spanish, Danish-Swedish are all very closely related languages, and Amharic-Tigrinya are also significantly related. Outside these couplings, there's a paragraph to note that the method breaks down (Table 5 in the appendix). Sharing between Romance and Germanic languages is far from representative of \"loosely related languages\", for all the cross-cultural influences that the two groups share.\n\nWhile the experiment is reasonably posed, in my view it lacks the cross-lingual breadth and an empirical account of similarity. What we do in cross-lingual processing is: port models from resource-rich to low-resource languages, and to port between very similar languages that already have resources is a purely academic exercise. This is not to say that evaluation by proxy should be banned, but rather that low-resource setups should be more extensively controlled for.\n\nThus, in summary, a rather straightforward contribution to computational modeling paired with sub-par experiment setup in my view amounts to a rejection.

The authors propose forming character-based embeddings of words to make use of sub-word similarities in closely-related languages. The authors do an extensive evaluation using various combinations of related languages and show improved performance. In particular,  the performance is shown to be competitive with word-based models, which are tied to a requirement of resources involving the original language (such as MT systems, bilingual lexicons, etc). The authors show that their results are boosted when some additional resources (such as bilingual dictionaries of minimal size) are used in a multi-task learning setup.\n\n\n- I would have liked to see some comparison where your model also uses all the resources available to CLWE based models (for example, larger dictionary, larger parallel corpus, etc)\n\n- It is mentioned that you used parallel projection only for Amharic as for other languages you had enough RCV2 training data. However, it would be interesting to see if you still use parallel projection on top of this.\n\n- I do not completely agree with the statement that CACO models are \"not far behind\" DAN models. IN Table 1, for most languages the difference is quite high. I understand that your model uses fewer resources but can it bridge the gap by using more resources? Is the model capable of doing so ?\n\n- How did you tune the lambdas in Eqn 11? Any interesting insights from the values of these lambdas? Do these lambda values vary significantly across languages ?\n\n- The argument about why the performance drops when you use language identifiers is not very convincing. Can you please elaborate on this ?\n\n- Why would the performance be better in one directions as compared to another (North Germanic to Romance v/s ROmance to North Germanic). Some explanation is needed here.\n\n- One recurring grievance that I have is that there are no insights/explanations for any results. Why are the gains better for some language pairs? Why is there asymmetry in the results w.r.t direction of transfer ? In what way do 2 languages help as compared to single source language? What is you use more that 2 source languages?\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1554/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Exploiting Cross-Lingual Subword Similarities in Low-Resource Document Classification", "abstract": "Text classification must sometimes be applied in situations with no training data in a target language.

CACO models trained under low-resource settings rival cross-lingual word embedding models trained under high-resource settings on related language pairs.\n", "keywords": ["cross-lingual transfer", "character-based method", "low-resource language"], "authorids": ["mozhi@cs.umd.edu", "yoshinari.fujinuma@colorado.edu", "jbg@umiacs.umd.edu"], "authors": ["Mozhi Zhang", "Yoshinari Fujinuma", "Jordan Boyd-Graber"], "TL;DR": "We propose a cross-lingual document classification framework for related language pairs.", "pdf": "/pdf/9621646541e1212e04bcde14a4a12a1d27f6f8bb.pdf", "paperhash": "zhang|exploiting_crosslingual_subword_similarities_in_lowresource_document_classification", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nzhang2019exploiting,\ntitle={Exploiting Cross-Lingual Subword Similarities in Low-Resource Document Classification},\nauthor={Mozhi Zhang and Yoshinari Fujinuma and Jordan Boyd-Graber},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1e_H3AqYQ},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1554/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234205055, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "S1e_H3AqYQ", "replyto": "S1e_H3AqYQ", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1554/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335971147, "tmdate": 1552335971147, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1554/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 9}
