This is well-motivated by the recent success of using quantized neural networks as a compression technique. This paper considers both linear quantization and non-linear quantization, both function independent network structures and function dependent network structures. The obtained results show that the number of weights need by a quantized network is no more than polylog factors times that of a unquantized network. This justifies the use of quantized neural networks as a compression technique. \n\nOverall, this paper is well-written and sheds light on a well-motivated problem, makes important progress in understanding the full power of quantized neural networks as a compression technique. I didn\u2019t check all details of the proof, but the structure of the proof and several key constructions seem correct to me. I would recommend acceptance. \n\nThe presentation can be improved by having a formal definition of linear quantized networks and non-linear quantized networks, function-independent structure and function-dependent structure in Section 3 to make the discussion mathematically rigorous. Also, some of the ideas/constructions seem to follow (Yarotsky, 2017). It seems to be a good idea to have a paragraph in the introduction to have a more detailed comparison with (Yarotsky, 2017), highlighting the difference of the constructions, the difficulties that the authors overcame when deriving the bounds, etc. \n\nMinor Comment: First paragraph of page 2: extra space after ``to prove the universal approximability\u2019\u2019.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1567/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "On the Universal Approximability and Complexity Bounds of Quantized ReLU Neural Networks", "abstract": "Compression is a key step to deploy large neural networks on resource-constrained platforms.

We have revised Figure 2 in the Appendix in connection with the proof of Proposition 1 and added some detailed descriptions as below. A few other revisions are also made in the Appendix to improve the overall presentation. Please check the new version for details.\n\u201c\nNote that a straightforward implementation will have to scale $g^{\\circ i}(x)$ separately (multiply by different numbers of $\\frac{1}{2}$) before subtracting them from $x$ because each $g^{\\circ i}(x)$ have a different coefficient. Then the width of the network will be $\\Theta(r)$. Here we use a ``pre-scale'' method to reduce the network width from $\\Theta(r)$ to a constant. The network constructed is shown in Figure 2. The one-layer sub-network that implements $g(x)$ and the one-layer sub-network that scales the input by $4$ are denoted as $B_g$ and $B_m$ respectively. Some units are copied to compensate the scaling caused by $\\frac{1}{2}$. The intermediate results $g^{\\circ i}(x)$ are computed by the concatenation of $B_g$ at the $(i+1)$-th layer. The first $B_m$ takes $x$ as input and multiply it by $4$. The output of $i$-th $B_m$ is subtracted by $g^{\\circ i}(x)$ and then fed to the next $B_m$ to be multiplied by $4$ again. There are $r$ layers of $B_m$ and all $g^{\\circ i}(x)$ are scaled by $2^{2(r-i)}$ respectively. As a result, we obtain $2^{2r}x-\\sum_{i=1}^{r}2^{2(r-i)}g^{\\circ i}(x)$ after the last $B_m$. Then it is scaled by $2^{-2r}$ in the later $2r$ layers to get $f^r_s(x)$. In this way, we make all $g^{\\circ i}(x)$ sharing the same scaling link and a constant width can be achieved.\n\""}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1567/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1567/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1567/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On the Universal Approximability and Complexity Bounds of Quantized ReLU Neural Networks", "abstract": "Compression is a key step to deploy large neural networks on resource-constrained platforms.

By allowing the networks to have different topologies, we are able to mathematically prove how we can use constructed quantized networks to approximate the same target function within any given error bound. With this flexibility, we are able to obtain the bound on the number of parameters and make a fair comparison between quantized networks and unquantized networks. Since there is no previous work on the theoretical expressive power of quantized neural networks, we consider our work as a good first attempt.

We have made the revision to further improve the presentation following your suggestions. Please check the new version for details.\n\nWe made the definition of two types of quantization, linear quantization and nonlinear quantization, and two types of structure, function-dependent structure and function-independent structure, more formal as below and moved them to Section 3 \u201cModels and Assumptions\u201d.  \n\nHere are the paragraphs related to the definition of linear vs nonlinear quantization:\n\u201c\nWe denote the finite number of distinct weight values as $\\lambda$ ($ \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ and $\\lambda \\geq 2$), for both linear and nonlinear quantization. For linear quantization, without loss of generality, we assume the finite number of distinct weight values are given as $ \\{-1, \\frac{1}{\\lambda},\\frac{2}{\\lambda},\\dots,\\frac{\\lambda-1}{\\lambda}\\}$, where $\\{\\frac{1}{\\lambda},\\frac{2}{\\lambda},\\dots,\\frac{\\lambda-1}{\\lambda}\\}$ are uniformly spaced (hence called ``linear\u2019\u2019)  in $(0,1)$ and $-1$ is used to obtain the negative weight values. For nonlinear quantization, we assume the finite number of distinct weight values are not constrained to any specific values, i.e., they can take any values as needed. \n\u201d\n\nHere are the paragraphs related to the definition of the function-dependent vs independent structures.\n\u201c\nWhen constructing the network to approximate any target function $f$, we consider two scenarios for deriving the bounds.  The first scenario is called function-dependent structure, where the constructed network topology and their associated weights are all affected by the choice of the target function. In contrast, the second scenario is called function-independent structure, where the constructed network topology is independent of the choice of the target function in $ f\\in\\mathcal{F}_{d,n}$ with a given $\\epsilon$. The principle behind these design choices (the network topology constructions and the choice of weights) is to achieve a tight upper bound as much as possible.\n\u201d \n\nWe added more discussion of the difference between our work and that of (Yarotsky, 2017), and moved that discussion from Section 2 \u201cRelated Works\u201d to Section 1 \u201cIntroduction\u201d. Details are quoted as follows:\n\u201c\nWe follow the idea from (Yarotsky, 2017) to prove the complexity bound by constructing a network, but with new and additional construction components essential for quantized networks. Specifically, given the number of distinct weight values $\\lambda$ and a target function $f$, we construct a network that can approximate $f$ with an arbitrarily small error bound $\\epsilon$ to prove the universal approximability. The memory size of this network then naturally serves as an upper bound for the minimal network size.   \nThe high-level idea of our approach is to replace basic units in an unquantized network with quantized sub-networks that approximate these basic units. For example, we can approximate a connection with any weight in an unquantized network by a quantized sub-network that only uses a finite number of given weight values. Even though the approximation of any single unit can be made arbitrarily accurate in principle with unlimited resources (such as increased network depth), in practice, there exists some inevitable residual error at every approximation, all of which could propagate throughout the entire network. The challenge becomes, however, how to mathematically prove that we can still achieve the end-to-end arbitrary small error bound even if these unavoidable residual errors caused by quantization can be propagated throughout the entire network. This paper finds a solution to solve the above challenge. In doing so, we have to propose a number of new ideas to solve related challenges, including judiciously choosing the proper finite weight values, constructing the approximation sub-networks as efficient as possible (to have a tight upper bound), and striking a good balance among the complexities of different approximation steps.\n\u201d\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1567/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1567/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1567/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On the Universal Approximability and Complexity Bounds of Quantized ReLU Neural Networks", "abstract": "Compression is a key step to deploy large neural networks on resource-constrained platforms.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on the complexity bounds of quantized neural networks.", "keywords": ["Quantized Neural Networks", "Universial Approximability", "Complexity Bounds", "Optimal Bit-width"], "authorids": ["yding5@nd.edu", "jliu16@nd.edu", "jinjun@us.ibm.com", "yshi4@nd.edu"], "authors": ["Yukun Ding", "Jinglan Liu", "Jinjun Xiong", "Yiyu Shi"], "TL;DR": "This paper proves the universal  approximability of quantized ReLU neural networks and puts forward the complexity bound given arbitrary error.", "pdf": "/pdf/b19c7c43db718baa927048e94b97f624fd0b35d1.pdf", "paperhash": "ding|on_the_universal_approximability_and_complexity_bounds_of_quantized_relu_neural_networks", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nding2018on,\ntitle={On the Universal Approximability and Complexity Bounds of Quantized Re{LU} Neural Networks},\nauthor={Yukun Ding and Jinglan Liu and Jinjun Xiong and Yiyu Shi},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJe9rh0cFX},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1567/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234202074, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "SJe9rh0cFX", "replyto": "SJe9rh0cFX", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1567/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335974317, "tmdate": 1552335974317, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1567/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 9}
