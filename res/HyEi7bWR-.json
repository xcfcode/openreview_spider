This scheme leads to good performance on sequential data tasks and requires fewer parameters than other techniques\n\nComments:\n-- It\u2019s not clear to me how D is determined for each test. Given the definition in Theorem 3.1 it seems like you would have to have some knowledge of how many eigenvalues in W you expect to be close to -1. \n-- For the copying and adding problem test cases, it might be useful to clarify or cite something clarifying that the failure mode RNNs run into with temporal ordering problems is an exploding gradient, rather than any other pathological training condition, just to make it clear why these experiments are relevant.\n-- The ylabel in Figure 1 is \u201cTest Loss\u201d which I didn\u2019t see defined. Is this test loss the cross entropy? If so, I think it would be more effective to label the plot with that.\n-- The plots in figure 1 and 2 have different colors to represent the same set of techniques. I would suggest keeping a  consistent color scheme\n-- It looks like in Figure 1 the scoRNN is outperformed by the uRNN in the long run in spite of the scoRNN convergence being smoother, which should be clarified.\n-- It looks like in Figure 2 the scoRNN is outperformed by the LSTM across the board, which should be clarified.\n-- How is test set accuracy defined in section 5.3? Classifying digits? Recreating digits? \n-- When discussing table 1, the manuscript mentions scoRNN and Restricted-capacity uRNN have similar performance for 16k parameters and then state that scoRNN has the best test accuracy at 96.2%. However, there is no example for restricted-capacity uRNN with 69k parameters to show that the performance of restricted-capacity uRNN doesn't also increase similarly with more parameters.\n-- Overall it\u2019s unclear to me how to completely determine the benefit of this technique over the others because, for each of the tests, different techniques may have superior performance. For instance, LSTM performs best in 5.2 and in 5.3 for the MNIST test accuracy. scoRNN and Restricted-capacity uRNN perform similarly for permuted MNIST Test Accuracy in 5.3. Finally, scoRNN seems to far outperform the other techniques in table 2 on the TIMIT speech dataset. I don\u2019t understand the significance of each test and why the relative performance of the techniques vary from one to the other.\n-- For example, the manuscript seems to be making the case that the scoRNN gradients are more stable than those of a uRNN, but all of the results are presented in terms of network accuracy and not gradient stability. You can sort of see that generally the convergence is more gradual for the scoRNN than the uRNN from the training graphs but it'd be nice if there was an actual comparison of the stability of the gradients during training (as in Figure 4 of the Arjovsky 2016 paper being compared to for instance) just to make it really clear.", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Orthogonal Recurrent Neural Networks with Scaled Cayley Transform", "abstract": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed to handle sequential data but suffer from vanishing or exploding gradients.

Please see below.\n1.)  \u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me how D is determined for each test.\u201d  \n- It is not known a priori the optimal number of negative ones that should be included in the scaling matrix. In this work, the percentage of negative ones in the diagonal matrix D is considered a hyperparameter and is tuned for each experiment.  See Response to Reviewer 1 for details.\n\n2.)  \u201cFor the copying and adding problem test cases,...make it clear why these experiments are relevant.\u201d\n-This is a good point.  We have clarified why these experiments are useful.\n\n3.)  \u201cThe ylabel in Figure 1 is \u201cTest Loss\u201d which I didn\u2019t see defined.\u201d\n -The loss function is indeed cross-entropy.

It has been clarified what is being tested in each experiment.\n\n8.)   \u201cWhen discussing table 1, the manuscript mentions scoRNN and Restricted-capacity uRNN have similar performance for 16k parameters and then state that scoRNN has the best test accuracy at 96.2%. However, there is no example for restricted-capacity uRNN with 69k parameters to show that the performance of restricted-capacity uRNN doesn't also increase similarly with more parameters.\u201d\n -In order to match the same number of parameters of approx. 69k, the restricted-capacity uRNN will require a hidden size of 2,170 units.  This is much larger than the hidden size of all the other models and we are not sure if we will be able to tune the machine in time but we are running a few experiments with this hidden size.\n \n\n9.)  \u201cOverall it\u2019s unclear to me how to completely determine the benefit of this technique over the others...\u201d\n-We agree that the results of each model on each task are not necessarily well-defined, and will add some description in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 to address this. Our intent was to show each model's performance in a variety of contexts where vanishing and exploding gradients occur. Although the scoRNN model does not always achieve the best results for each experiment, it is among the stronger performers and offers smoother convergence with smaller hidden states. Thus, the model is a competitive alternative to the LSTM model and the tested uRNNs.\n\n10.)  \u201c...stability of the gradients...\u201d\n -We have carried out experiments to compare gradient and hidden state stability of the LSTM and scoRNN models, similar to the figure in the 2016 Arjovsky paper. Our results show the norm of scoRNN hidden state gradients staying near constant at 10^-4 over 500 timesteps, while the LSTM gradient norm decays to 0 after 200-300 timesteps.

Please see below.\n\n1.)  \u201cTechnical novelty is somewhat limited.\u201d\n- We believe that although there are several orthogonal RNNs, the scoRNN architecture has a new and much simpler scheme and is numerically more stable by maintaining orthogonality in the recurrent matrix.  \n\n2.)  \u201cExperiments do not evaluate run time, memory use, computational complexity, or stability.\u201d\n-We have carried out additional experiments to examine run time and the following results will be included in the revision.  The Full-Capacity uRNN and Restricted-Capacity uRNNs codes tested are from the Wisdom et al. 2016 paper and the LSTM is based on the builtin model in Tensorflow.  The results indicate that scoRNN is faster than the Full-Capacity uRNN and Restricted-Capacity uRNNs but slightly slower than Tensorflow's builtin implementation of LSTM.  We believe that the LSTM is faster because it is a builtin model that has been optimized within Tensorflow; there is virtually no change in runtime from hidden sizes 128 to 512.

This computational cost is small compared to the cost of the forward and backward propagations through all time steps and for all examples in a training batch. Thus, scoRNN\u2019s complexity is almost identical to a standard RNN. The basic RNNs should compare favorably with other methods in complexity although we couldn\u2019t find a reference for this. \n\n As for stability, we assume the referee refers to the stability of the gradients with respect to hidden states during training (as in Figure 4 of the Arjovsky 2016) that referee 2 points out.  We have carried out experiments to compare gradient stability of the LSTM and scoRNN models with results indicating the scoRNN model has significantly more stable gradients than LSTM.  These results will be included in the revised submittal.  We are having some difficulties in obtaining hidden state gradients from the full-capacity and restricted-capacity uRNNs codes. \n\nThese additions will be in two new appendices; stability will be addressed in Appendix C, and complexity & speed will be addressed in Appendix D."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Orthogonal Recurrent Neural Networks with Scaled Cayley Transform", "abstract": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed to handle sequential data but suffer from vanishing or exploding gradients.
