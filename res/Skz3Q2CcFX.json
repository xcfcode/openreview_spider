This makes the plot difficult to interpret as it shows only how different, for each word represented by a dot in the scatter plot it is more biased in one or the other dataset / embedding method, but the reader has no idea of how much the word is biased to begin with. In contrast, in our comparison view, you can clearly se the position of the word in both datasets and a line is drawn between them so that the reader can understand both the absolute degree of bias of each word in each dataset and how much the dataset differ in terms of bias.\n\nRegarding the second one, it doesn't seem to be a published paper, but rather a report that a student put on their website, so it doesn't seem like something we would be able to cite. In any case, as much as that work is relevant, in all the figures the author provide a side by side view of the embeddings projection in the two datasets, which makes it really hard to compare the relative location, and how much delta there is between the two locations of the same embedding in the different embedding spaces. Thus we believe that our comparison view provides a better visualization.\n\nFinally, regarding Heimerl et al., we already describe the difference in the related section, but we can add that our approach has several advantages compared to that tool: first the user can define any algebraic formula as axes rather than just averages of embeddings, and fo instance the fine grained analysis plots and the polysemy plot we provide in the paper would not be obtainable; second: as you can define averages as axes, our approach subsume their, being more general; third we also provide the comparison view for cases where the user wants to compare different embedding spaces and the polar view where the goal requires more than two axes, both things are not provided by Heimerl et al.\n\nFinally, as a general remark, we are proposing to use this simple idea as a general methodology, while most of the plots you refer to (a part from Heimerl's tool) are spurious specific plots obtained in specific circumstances, so the fact that someone used a similar plot to what is obtainable with our methodology is just an additional example use case that strengthens even more the usefulness of the methodology."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1395/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1395/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1395/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Visualizing and Understanding the Semantics of Embedding Spaces via Algebraic Formulae", "abstract": "Embeddings are a fundamental component of many modern machine learning and natural language processing models.\nUnderstanding them and visualizing them is essential for gathering insights about the information they capture and the behavior of the models.\nState of the art in analyzing embeddings consists in projecting them in two-dimensional planes without any interpretable semantics associated to the axes of the projection, which makes detailed analyses and comparison among multiple sets of embeddings challenging.\nIn this work, we propose to use explicit axes defined as algebraic formulae over embeddings to project them into a lower dimensional, but semantically meaningful subspace, as a simple yet effective analysis and visualization methodology.\nThis methodology assigns an interpretable semantics to the measures of variability and the axes of visualizations, allowing for both comparisons among different sets of embeddings and fine-grained inspection of the embedding spaces.\nWe demonstrate the power of the proposed methodology through a series of case studies that make use of visualizations constructed around the underlying methodology and through a user study.

The attributes the user cares about are explicitly encoded in the algebraic formulae she decides to use, so using the reduced dimensions to predict the attributes is meaningless.\n\nWe made it mode clear in the first paragraph of the evaluation section that we are not trying to find an optimal dimensionality reduction technique, but comapring an approach to keep users in the loop:\n\u201cThe goal is to find out if and how visualizations using user-defined semantically meaningful algebraic formulae as their axes help users achieve their analysis goals.\nWhat we are not testing for is the quality of projection itself, as in PCA AND t-SNE the projection axes are obtained algorithmically, while in our case they are explicitly defined by the user.\u201d\n\n>>> Five-axis polar plots can pack in more information than a 2-dimensional plot in some ways, but quickly become cluttered. The authors might consider using heatmaps or bar plots, as are commonly used elsewhere in the literature (e.g. for visualizing activation maps or attention vectors).\n\nWe explicitly explained in the 3rd paragraph that the polar view is to be preferred in the case where the analysis goal needs more than 2 dimensions of variability, but where the number of items is limited for the reason that several items would make the visualization cluttered. The problem with bar plots and heatmaps is that themselves they don't scale either to a big number of axes of elements and they rely on hue (in the case of heatmaps) and difference in size (in the case of barplots) to provide the information, while the polar view relies on several visual variables at the same time (position, dimension, hue, shape) for the same task, making it a better choice.\n\n>>> User study is hard to evaluate. What were the specific formulae used in the comparison? Did subjects just see a list of nearest-neighbors, or did they see the 2D projection? If the latter, I'd imagine it would be easy to tell which was the t-SNE plot, since most researchers are familiar with how these look.\n\nThe tasks and the formulae we used were [banana & strawberry, google & microsoft, nerd & geek, book & magazine, 110392 & 95212, 387862 & 42956, 278209 & 230444, 162363 & 307542], the numbers are the same terms but obfuscated, as described in the manuscript. We added them in the description of the experiment.\n\nAs we are evaluating visualizations, the users are shown visualizations of the 2d projections as described in the second paragraph of the user study section.\nThey are told which visualizations are t-SNE and which use explicit axes as they are required to express a preference at the end (which is reported). Knowing which plot they were looking at was also needed in order to provide an interpretation to the axes (in the t-SNE they are meaningless, without labels, in the explicit case the axes report the formula used to obtain them in order to be interpretable).\nCan you elaborate on why do you believe this is a problem?"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1395/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1395/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1395/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Visualizing and Understanding the Semantics of Embedding Spaces via Algebraic Formulae", "abstract": "Embeddings are a fundamental component of many modern machine learning and natural language processing models.\nUnderstanding them and visualizing them is essential for gathering insights about the information they capture and the behavior of the models.\nState of the art in analyzing embeddings consists in projecting them in two-dimensional planes without any interpretable semantics associated to the axes of the projection, which makes detailed analyses and comparison among multiple sets of embeddings challenging.\nIn this work, we propose to use explicit axes defined as algebraic formulae over embeddings to project them into a lower dimensional, but semantically meaningful subspace, as a simple yet effective analysis and visualization methodology.\nThis methodology assigns an interpretable semantics to the measures of variability and the axes of visualizations, allowing for both comparisons among different sets of embeddings and fine-grained inspection of the embedding spaces.\nWe demonstrate the power of the proposed methodology through a series of case studies that make use of visualizations constructed around the underlying methodology and through a user study.

Rules/extention/axes are not very clear and mathematically consistent in section 3. Would projection idea be applied to arbitrary AFs?\n\nYes, we allow users to create AFs by compositing vector math operators (e.g., add, sub, mul) to be applied on vectors (referenced by their label in the data, i.e. the vector(apple) is obtained by using the keyword \u201capple\u201d in the formula). For instance, \u201c(he + him) /2\u201d, resolves he and him with their respective vectors, sums them and then divides the resulting vector by two. We added the following sentence to the manuscrip in the methodology sectiont:\nAlgebraic formulae are a composition vector math operators (e.g., add, sub, mul) to be applied on vectors (referenced by their label in the data, i.e. the vector of ``apple'' is obtained by using using the keyword ``apple'' in the formula)..\n\n>>> - while the idea being simple, I am not quite confident about the novelty. For example for the de-bias application, Bolukbasi et al. had already did the same plot along the he-she axis. Similar plots on the polysemous word embedding can be found in Arora et al., 2017, etc. \n\nWe acknowledge that those works are relevant, but argue that the information provided in their plots and the nature of their plots is different from our proposal. \n\nIn Bolukbasi et al., the x-axis is the difference between he and she, while the y-axis is a learned direction encoding neutrality (through SVD). As such, only one of the axes is explicitly defined by an algebraic formula. The example in Bolukbasi et al. indeed is a subset the methodology that we are proposing, which is more generic and can be applied widely.\n\nRegarding Arora et al. the task may be similar, but the plots are obtained through isometric mapping rather than explicitly-defined semantically-meaningful subspaces. That is, axes in their plots are not interpretable, which makes their approach more closer to PCA or t-SNE projections and has little in common with our proposal.\n\n>>> - The user study with n=10 are typically less reliable for any p-value evaluation.\n\nWhile we agree more test subjects usually lead to (perceptually) better statistical confidences, the ANOVA and t-test results in our study already suggested significant difference (p values being magnitudes smaller than 0.01, as described in the result analysis section). \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1395/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1395/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1395/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Visualizing and Understanding the Semantics of Embedding Spaces via Algebraic Formulae", "abstract": "Embeddings are a fundamental component of many modern machine learning and natural language processing models.\nUnderstanding them and visualizing them is essential for gathering insights about the information they capture and the behavior of the models.\nState of the art in analyzing embeddings consists in projecting them in two-dimensional planes without any interpretable semantics associated to the axes of the projection, which makes detailed analyses and comparison among multiple sets of embeddings challenging.\nIn this work, we propose to use explicit axes defined as algebraic formulae over embeddings to project them into a lower dimensional, but semantically meaningful subspace, as a simple yet effective analysis and visualization methodology.\nThis methodology assigns an interpretable semantics to the measures of variability and the axes of visualizations, allowing for both comparisons among different sets of embeddings and fine-grained inspection of the embedding spaces.\nWe demonstrate the power of the proposed methodology through a series of case studies that make use of visualizations constructed around the underlying methodology and through a user study.

However, the main technical contribution of this paper is otherwise not clear - the methodology section covers a very broad set of techniques but doesn't provide a clear picture of what is novel; furthermore, it makes a strong assumption about linear structure in the embedding space that may not hold. (It's worth noting that t-SNE does not make this assumption.)\n\nThe visualization strategies presented don't appear to be particularly novel. In particular, projection onto a linear subspace defined by particular attributes was done in the original word2vec and GloVe papers for the analogy task. There's also a lot of other literature on interpreting deeper models using locally-linear predictors, see for example LIME (Ribeiro et al. 2016) or TCAV (Kim at el. 2018).\n\nEvaluations are exclusively qualitative, which is disappointing because there are quantitative ways of evaluating a projection - for example, how well do the reduced dimensions predict a particular attribute relative to the entire vector. Five-axis polar plots can pack in more information than a 2-dimensional plot in some ways, but quickly become cluttered. The authors might consider using heatmaps or bar plots, as are commonly used elsewhere in the literature (e.g. for visualizing activation maps or attention vectors).\n\nUser study is hard to evaluate. What were the specific formulae used in the comparison? Did subjects just see a list of nearest-neighbors, or did they see the 2D projection? If the latter, I'd imagine it would be easy to tell which was the t-SNE plot, since most researchers are familiar with how these look.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1395/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Visualizing and Understanding the Semantics of Embedding Spaces via Algebraic Formulae", "abstract": "Embeddings are a fundamental component of many modern machine learning and natural language processing models.\nUnderstanding them and visualizing them is essential for gathering insights about the information they capture and the behavior of the models.\nState of the art in analyzing embeddings consists in projecting them in two-dimensional planes without any interpretable semantics associated to the axes of the projection, which makes detailed analyses and comparison among multiple sets of embeddings challenging.\nIn this work, we propose to use explicit axes defined as algebraic formulae over embeddings to project them into a lower dimensional, but semantically meaningful subspace, as a simple yet effective analysis and visualization methodology.\nThis methodology assigns an interpretable semantics to the measures of variability and the axes of visualizations, allowing for both comparisons among different sets of embeddings and fine-grained inspection of the embedding spaces.\nWe demonstrate the power of the proposed methodology through a series of case studies that make use of visualizations constructed around the underlying methodology and through a user study.
