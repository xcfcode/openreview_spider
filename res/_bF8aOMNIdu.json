This is shown in Table 5, where we can see that ECR significantly outperforms other variants such as those from MixMatch and ReMixMatch.**\n\nA general list of changes to the manuscript is as follows:\n\n- Introduction: added prior work on abstention-based methods, additional motivation and clarity around central contribution \n- Methods: expanded descriptions of loss components; better emphasis on differences between ECR and previous consistency regularization approaches; added insights for choices of loss terms and the synergy of their combination for learning with noise\n- Related Work: Moved to after Methods for better context; refactored to address reviewer feedback regarding motivation\n- Experiments: As suggested by reviewers, some experimental details were moved to the appendix; added parameter counts to Table 1 and Table 2; updated ImageNet results as those numbers were erroneously taken from a clean experiment; addition of  Figure 1: loss distributions of clean labels and corrupt labels based on feedback from R2; added additional ablation studies to strengthen motivation and better communicate ECR effectiveness over alternative methods and configurations\n- Appendix: As requested by reviewers, extended model performance analysis has been added.

From the results, it does not appear that way, i) please clarify, ii) if not setting those noise ratios might benefit the paper even more because the baselines might perform even worse.\n\nNo, they are not, and you are correct \u2013 some baselines would perform \"even worse\". This is highlighted in the caption of Table 1, which indicates that \"results in parentheses are upper bounds since they were computed using lower noise levels\".\n\n> The temporal ensembling part is little vague in the current form of the paper, probably hiding/missing from section 3.2.3. Can you be more specific with the details for this?\n\nThank you for pointing this out; we added a sentence in Section 2.2.2 to clarify this point. To summarize, a copy of parameters is made upon initialization, and from that point onward, this copy is updated using an exponential moving average of the model parameters as training iterations progress.\n\n> [Typos / incorrect grammar]\n\nThank you \u2013 fixed\n\n> Also, is it possible to stud the certainty of predictions, in terms of calibration error or some other metric? If they can be squeezed in the paper somehow, that will further strengthen the paper. Moreover, one can actually understand the effect of ensembles on the robustness of predictions in noisy environments.\n\nThank you for this suggestion. We have added loss distributions for clean vs. noisy labels to the main text, and we have added reliability diagrams (to gauge calibration error) to the appendix.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1207/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1207/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Robust Temporal Ensembling", "authorids": ["~Abel_Brown1", "~Benedikt_Schifferer2", "~Robert_DiPietro1"], "authors": ["Abel Brown", "Benedikt Schifferer", "Robert DiPietro"], "keywords": ["learning with noise", "robust task loss", "consistency regularization"], "abstract": "Successful training of deep neural networks with noisy labels is an essential capability as most real-world datasets contain some amount of mislabeled data.

However, this strategy has already been used by methods such as MixMatch (MixMatch: A Holistic Approach to Semi-Supervised Learning).\n\n**Although many consistency losses share common elements, ECR is significantly different. We added substantial clarification to highlight this point (in the Methods and Related Work sections).**\n\n**To highlight this further, we also included several additional ablation studies. These can be found in Table 5, and include approaches based on MixMatch and its follow up, ReMixMatch.** The best result using these approaches is 83.59%, in comparison to 93.09% achieved by RTE.\n\n> The comparison with some previous methods on CIFAR seem to be unfair. For example, DivideMix uses a 18-layer PreAct ResNet, whereas this paper uses a 28- layer Wide ResNet. It is important to make sure that all previous methods are compared under a fair setting.\n\n**Please note that among the 17 prior methods in Table 1, architectures include**\n- **PreAct ResNet-18, 11.2M params (e.g., DivideMix).**\n- **WRN 28x10, 36.4M params (e.g., Rand. Weights)**\n- **ResNet-34 with shake-shake regularization, 27.0M params (e.g., SELF)**\n- **ResNet-101, 44.5M params (e.g., MentorNet)**\n- **DenseNet, unspecified param count (e.g., RoG)**\n- **and others.**\n\n**Meanwhile, RTE uses WRN 28x6, with 13.1M params.**\n\n**Given the diversity in prior work, we feel that it is unfair to suggest that we should have chosen the DivideMix architecture for our experiments.**\n\nTo clarify this in the manuscript, we added parameters counts to Table 1 and Table 2.\n\nFinally, we would like to ask if you believe it is possible that this small difference in capacity (11.2M params vs. 13.1M params) is responsible for the stark difference between DivideMix and RTE at 80% label noise on CIFAR-10 (79.8% accuracy vs. 93.64% accuracy)?\n\n> How important is AugMix to the model's performance? What if a different augmentation is used?\n\nWe have experimented with AugMix and RandAug, and we have added the latter to the ablation study (Table 5). We found that RandAug leads to unstable training.\n\n> The results in Table 5 (robustness to data shift under label noise) is expected because AugMix does not consider label noise. Hence it is hard to justify the value of this experiment.\n\nOur best interpretation of this statement is *it's not worth demonstrating that your method maintains robustness to variations in the input distribution.*\n\nIf this is accurate, we respectfully disagree. If this is inaccurate, can you please elaborate?\n\n> The propose method is not validated on real-world noisy datasets, such as the widely used WebVision, Food-101, or Clothing1M. Experiments on synthetic noisy datasets alone cannot fully justify the effectiveness of the method, because real-world noise can be more complicated.\n\n**Including more experiments is always better, but we simply do not have enough time for these experiments, and we have already surpassed the experiments in most prior work:**\n- **We include ImageNet experiments, which was done by only 2 of the 17 prior works in Table 1 (as noted in the manuscript)**\n- **We further included asymmetric noise results using a confusion matrix built from real-world datasets using a shallow neural network**\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1207/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1207/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Robust Temporal Ensembling", "authorids": ["~Abel_Brown1", "~Benedikt_Schifferer2", "~Robert_DiPietro1"], "authors": ["Abel Brown", "Benedikt Schifferer", "Robert DiPietro"], "keywords": ["learning with noise", "robust task loss", "consistency regularization"], "abstract": "Successful training of deep neural networks with noisy labels is an essential capability as most real-world datasets contain some amount of mislabeled data.

To mitigate, the authors propose a supervised learning approach, Robust Temporal Ensembling (RTE). RTE combines 1) task loss correction, which is a generalized cross entropy loss, 2) different augmentations resulting from AugMix technique and the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD), 3) the ensemble consistency regularization and pseudo labeling.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nReasons for score: \n \nOverall, I vote for accepting. The idea of improving the robustness predictions in noisy labeled data is interesting. My major concerns are on the motivation and the clarity of the idea at some places.

The proposed method combines three techniques: GCE from robust loss literature, AugMix from data augmentation literature, and Mean Teacher from semi-supervised learning literature. This paper shows that the combination of these methods are effective for label noise learning.\n\nStrength: this paper studies an important problem; the combination of existing methods is intuitive, and each method plays an important role; the paper is mostly well-written and easy to follow.\n\nWeakness:\n1. The paper claims to \"introduce a new ensemble-based form of consistency regularization which leverages multiple augmentations of the same images\". However, this strategy has already been used by methods such as MixMatch (MixMatch: A Holistic Approach to Semi-Supervised Learning).\n2. The proposed method seems to be a rather ad-hoc combination of several existing methods (GCE, AugMix, Mean Teacher), hence the technical novelty is limited. It is fine as long as the experimental results are strong, which I am not fully convinced.\n3. The comparison with some previous methods on CIFAR seem to be unfair. For example, DivideMix uses a 18-layer PreAct ResNet, whereas this paper uses a 28- layer Wide ResNet. It is important to make sure that all previous methods are compared under a fair setting.\n4. How important is AugMix to the model's performance? What if a different augmentation is used?\n5. The results in Table 5 (robustness to data shift under label noise) is expected because AugMix does not consider label noise. Hence it is hard to justify the value of this experiment.\n6.

The label noise is modeled using a probabilistic (and conditionally independent) transition matrix that changes the label of one class to another one. In order to classify with noise, the network is trained with a mixture of three known losses including: 1) generalized cross entropy (GCE) rejects the outlier labels, 2) JSD divergence to assure the soft-max distribution matches the augmented data distributions, and 3) an ensemble consistency regularization (ECR) that penalizes the inconsistencies of the augmented data based on the mean teachers. Experiments with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet classification indicate substantial gains compared with state-of-the-art alternatives. \n\nStrong points:\n- The empirical study of combining three different metrics is extensive and useful; the gains are also significant; ablation study is also useful\n\nWeak points:\n- The contribution is rather incremental, combining three known loss metrics in outlier detection and semi-supervised learning\n- The motivation behind eq.5 is not very clear. Why is it needed to use augmented data in eq. 5? why not simply using mean-teachers (ensemble of previous network weights) to penalize the consistency between the predicted labels and the noisy ones, in the same spirit as mean teachers? \n\n\nSuggestions:\n- The paper would improve if Table 1 and the ablation study can include the results for ImageNet as a more realistic dataset as well .\n- What is index i running over in eq (5)?\n- A lot of details about experiments are provided in the main paper. For more clarify, those could be moved to appendix, and more intuition and explanation about the reason for adopting the three loss components would be more useful. perhaps toy examples with diagrams could be helpful.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1207/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1207/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Robust Temporal Ensembling", "authorids": ["~Abel_Brown1", "~Benedikt_Schifferer2", "~Robert_DiPietro1"], "authors": ["Abel Brown", "Benedikt Schifferer", "Robert DiPietro"], "keywords": ["learning with noise", "robust task loss", "consistency regularization"], "abstract": "Successful training of deep neural networks with noisy labels is an essential capability as most real-world datasets contain some amount of mislabeled data.

The remainder of the work demonstrates the advantage of this combined loss through a barrage of experiments. \n - They show that on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 (with 40% and 80% corruption) and ImageNet (with 40%) corruption, their approach outperforms all baselines, often by a considerable margin.\n - They also explore the impact of different types of noise (class-symmetric, asymmetric, and varying degrees of noise)\n - Ablation experiments show that the main novelty (ECR) plays the largest role in the performance of the model, but GCE is also needed to get state of the art performance on CIFAR-10 (80%)\n - Finally, they show that using multiple augmentations in ECR in a single batch can considerably improve performance.\n\n**Positives:**\n - This approach clearly outperforms all the compared baselines (to my knowledge, they aren\u2019t missing any comparisons)\n - The experiments are quite extensive.\n - The exposition clearly explains how this work relates to prior work and how it composes those ideas into the final model.\n**Negatives:**\n - This work leans heavily on prior work.  See summary above for how it relates to prior work.\n**Recommendation:**\nThe main contribution of this work is the ECR term, which uses an idea from semi-supervised learning to match the prediction to a \u201cmean teacher\u201d.  By extending it to use multiple augmentations, they improve results over using a single augmentation (without mean teacher Laine & Alia, 2017) or without augmentations (vs. a mean teacher, Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017).\nThe question is whether this combination of loss terms is a significant enough contribution.  I think it\u2019s borderline, but since the performance gain is so significant and since I can\u2019t think of any way to improve the work, I\u2019ll lean toward accepting.\n\n\n\n\n**Minor comments:**\nEq (5) is missing a  )\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1207/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1207/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Robust Temporal Ensembling", "authorids": ["~Abel_Brown1", "~Benedikt_Schifferer2", "~Robert_DiPietro1"], "authors": ["Abel Brown", "Benedikt Schifferer", "Robert DiPietro"], "keywords": ["learning with noise", "robust task loss", "consistency regularization"], "abstract": "Successful training of deep neural networks with noisy labels is an essential capability as most real-world datasets contain some amount of mislabeled data.  Left unmitigated, label noise can sharply degrade typical supervised learning approaches.  In this paper, we present robust temporal ensembling (RTE), a simple supervised learning approach which combines robust task loss, temporal pseudo-labeling, and a new ensemble consistency regularization term to achieve noise-robust learning.  We demonstrate that RTE achieves state-of-the-art performance across the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, while forgoing the recent trend of label filtering/fixing. In particular, RTE achieves 93.64% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 66.43% accuracy on CIFAR-100 under 80% label corruption, and achieves 74.79% accuracy on ImageNet under 40% corruption. These are substantial gains over previous state-of-the-art accuracies of 86.6%, 60.2%, and 71.31%, respectively, achieved using three distinct methods. Finally, we show that RTE retains competitive corruption robustness to unforeseen input noise using CIFAR-10-C, obtaining a mean corruption error (mCE) of 13.50% even in the presence of an 80% noise ratio, versus 26.9% mCE with standard methods on clean data.", "one-sentence_summary": "We present robust temporal ensembling (RTE), a state-of-the-art method for learning with noisy labels that combines robust task loss, temporal pseudo-labeling, and a new form of consistency regularization.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "brown|robust_temporal_ensembling", "pdf": "/pdf/3e60b4e9e00f5713e56b9fdfa43969e2201fd08a.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=51D_IRAyT0", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nbrown2021robust,\ntitle={Robust Temporal Ensembling},\nauthor={Abel Brown and Benedikt Schifferer and Robert DiPietro},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=_bF8aOMNIdu}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
