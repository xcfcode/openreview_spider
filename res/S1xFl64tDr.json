They proposed that if each layer of processing layer, sitting outside of the local unit, is phase preserving, then they can recover the phase back. They propose a modification to the most popular layers in DNN to satisfy that property.\n\nI think the general idea of the paper is interesting, but overall, the paper is very poorly written. It appears that it is written in a rush. \n\n*The abstract and introduction are poorly written. There are poorly written sentences in the text. Here are some examples:\n    + \"... We propose a generic method to revise a conventional neural network to boost the challenge of adversarially inferring about the input but still yields useful outputs. ....\"\n    + \"... given a transformed feature, an adversary can at best recover a number of features which contain at least another k \u2212 1 features which are different but cannot be distinguished from the real feature.  ...\" -- This is so central to the whole paper and it is not well-written. Personally, didn't understand this attack.\nPlease proofread your paper.\n\n*Why do you need both theta and b ?  It seems to me if \\| b \\| is comparable to \\| a \\|, it can destroy the information in original the a arbitrary bad, so it makes sense to keep the norm of b small. However, in the paper, it is suggested to use a random sample (I') and set b = g(I'). I don't see any ablation study in the paper. There is no free lunch, if you provide stronger identity preservation, there should be a compromise in the accuracy, and it seems to be the magnitude of the b is that compromise. \n\n* The whole idea of the GAN encoder is not well justified. What does it mean that the fake feature should contain information \"beyond\" a ? This very vague.\n\n* \"Inference attack 1 \" and \"Inference attack 4\" are the same; only the inference models used in each attack are different. I don't know why the author has separated them.   \n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I did not assess the derivations or theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper346/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper346/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Interpretable Complex-Valued Neural Networks for Privacy Protection", "authors": ["Liyao Xiang", "Hao Zhang", "Haotian Ma", "Yifan Zhang", "Jie Ren", "Quanshi Zhang"], "authorids": ["xiangliyao08@sjtu.edu.cn", "1603023-zh@sjtu.edu.cn", "11612807@mail.sustc.edu.cn", "zhangyf_sjtu@sjtu.edu.cn", "ariesrj@sjtu.edu.cn", "zqs1022@sjtu.edu.cn"], "keywords": ["Deep Learning", "Privacy Protection", "Complex-Valued Neural Networks"], "abstract": "Previous studies have found that an adversary attacker can often infer unintended input information from intermediate-layer features.

We would like to answer all the concerns one by one.\n\nQ1: \"It would be more interesting if the authors can consider NLP datasets or other tasks instead of classification.\"\n\nA1: We have followed your suggestions to conduct a new experiment on a neural network for an NLP task.\n\nSince this paper serves as a prototype to verify the effectiveness of complex-valued features in attribute obfuscation, we only use the classification task as an example. We have supplemented a sentiment classification task on Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)[1] using the LSTM model [2]. The complex-valued architecture is shown below. The inputs are sentences and outputs are 0/1 labels. The pointwise multiplication operation in LSTM is modified such that the biases are removed: $i_{t} = \\sigma(W_{ii}x_{t} + W_{hi}h_{t-1})$.\n\n                               -------------------  a   -----------------------------       -------  d\nX (sentences) -> | Embedding | -> | c=(a + bi)exp(i$\\theta$) | -> | LSTM | -> \n                               -------------------       ------------------------------      -------\n ----------------------      ----------\n| Re(d exp(-i$\\theta$))| -> |Classifier| -> Y(0:negative, 1:positive)\n ----------------------      ----------\nThree sets of experiments are done. First, we train a decoder $dec_1$ by using $a$ to reconstruct the input sentences, and then feed $a$ and $Re(c)$ respectively to $dec_1$ to test the reconstruction accuracy. The results are 87.69% and 68.07% respectively for $a$ and $Re(c)$, verifying that the complex-valued feature indeed preserves input privacy. Second, we train a discriminator $D$ by using $Re(c)$ to find $\\hat{\\theta} = \\arg \\max_{\\theta} D[Re(c exp(-i\\theta))]$. And then we feed $Re(c exp(-i\\hat{\\theta}))$ to $dec_1$ to reconstruct the input. The testing accuracy is 72.36%. Third, we construct a decoder $dec_2$ by training and testing over $Re(c)$. The testing accuracy is 60.81%. \n\n[1] Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. 2013.

With respect to the writing issues, we have proofread the paper and clarified some statements. We would like to answer all the concerns.\n\nQ1: About English writing. \"The abstract and introduction are poorly written ... it is not well-written.\"\n\nA1: We do understand that the reviewer is mainly bothered by some writing issues. We have revised the statement in the abstract, introduction, and Section 3.\n\nQ2: Concern about technical details of the parameters, theta and b. \"Why do you need both theta and b? It seems to me ... the magnitude of the b is that compromise.\"\n\nA2: In fact, the reviewer's concern may be raised by a misunderstanding about the fooling counterpart b. In the original version of the paper, we have pointed out that the feature decoded by a randomly chosen phase should have the same distribution as the original feature. We also have mentioned that in practice, we could obtain b as the feature of a randomly chosen sample $I' \\neq I$ so that the distribution of the synthetic feature $a'$ is close to that of $a$ by minimizing the GAN loss. The norm of $b$ cannot be too small; otherwise, the adversary can recover feature $a$ in spite of the rotation angle. The norm of $b$ should be comparable to the norm of $a$ to cause obfuscation. \n\nQ3: \"The whole idea of the GAN encoder is not well justified. What does it mean that the fake feature should contain information beyond a? This very vague.\"\n\nA3: As mentioned in the paragraph of \"GAN-based Encoder\" of the original version, the whole purpose of the GAN encoder is to generate synthetic features following the same distribution as that of the original feature, so that an adversary cannot distinguish the original one. To further facilitate understanding, we have revised the paragraph. In particular, we refer to $a'$ as the decoded feature, since it is decoded from x by an adversarially chosen angle.\n\nQ4: \"Inference attack 1 and Inference attack 4 are the same; only the inference models used in each attack are different. I don't know why the author has separated them.\"\n\nA4: This concern is raised due to misinterpretation. Inference attack 1 and 4 are different attacks: attack 1 predicts hidden properties by training a classifier, whereas attack 4 uses  $k$-nearest neighbor method. We would like to verify that despite the specific attack methods, our complex-valued approach prevails in all cases. Nevertheless, we have further clarified details about Inference attack 4 in Section 4.3.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper346/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper346/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Interpretable Complex-Valued Neural Networks for Privacy Protection", "authors": ["Liyao Xiang", "Hao Zhang", "Haotian Ma", "Yifan Zhang", "Jie Ren", "Quanshi Zhang"], "authorids": ["xiangliyao08@sjtu.edu.cn", "1603023-zh@sjtu.edu.cn", "11612807@mail.sustc.edu.cn", "zhangyf_sjtu@sjtu.edu.cn", "ariesrj@sjtu.edu.cn", "zqs1022@sjtu.edu.cn"], "keywords": ["Deep Learning", "Privacy Protection", "Complex-Valued Neural Networks"], "abstract": "Previous studies have found that an adversary attacker can often infer unintended input information from intermediate-layer features.

Despite our efforts, we found that this is due to the lack of a formal definition of privacy in the current literature describing the amount of information that features reveal about the input. Thus, we propose k-anonymity for each release of the features.\n\nWe regard each release of the intermediate-layer feature as a release of the corresponding input. According to the definition \"a release of data is said to have the k-anonymity property if the information for each entity contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k\u22121 entities of which information also appear in the release,\" our method guarantees that an adversary cannot distinguish the original input from others by the released feature. \n\nBesides, we have widely surveyed techniques of the feature inversion attack and the property inference attack.
