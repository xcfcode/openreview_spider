In particular, the contribution is measured by the distance between the local model and the global model in each iteration. The targeting problem is interesting, and the use of attention-based model divergence is also an interesting idea to measure the contribution. However, the paper lacks strict theoretical discussion to prove the proposed solution is a reasonable one rather than a heuristic method. Moreover, the experiment is too weak to support the claims.

Therefore, the paper should discuss the prevention of \u201cattacking by fake data\u201d. \n\nFor example, if the client randomly shuffles the index of neurons in the trained local model w_k, then the client\u2019s local model will get a bigger s_k^l calculated by equation 2. Thus, this client is likely to gain a big reward at every iteration.\n\nAccording to equation 5, the contribution at the early stage will be discounted. It is unfair for the clients to be selected at an early stage. Therefore, from a systematic perspective, some clients may refuse to contribute to the training process at an early stage. \n\n\n2) Contribution is not enough\n\nThe core method comes from the FedAtt algorithm \u2013 an attention-based federated aggregation method. The paper\u2019s primary contribution relies on section 3.3 to measure the contribution according to the gradients.  \n\n\n3) The experiments are too weak to support their claim. \n\nMore datasets and baseline methods are required, for example, the FEMNIST, FeCeleba.\n\nIt is unclear how to define an objective metric to measure the quality of the proposed method.

The basic idea is that the agent with a larger model update has a larger contribution. Specifically, based on FedAtt [1], the impact of a client is computed as the local updates plus the impact of the previous round times a decay rate. The experiments on a dataset show that the proposed approach can have a similar contribution measurement compared with Shapley Value.\n\n[1] Learning private neural language modeling with attentive aggregation.    IJCNN 2019\n \nStrengths: \n\n(1) The motivation of the paper is clear.\n\n(2) The studied area is important. Effective incentive mechanisms in federated learning are still an open challenge.\n\nWeakness:\n\n(1) The proposed idea lacks novelty and may not be applicable in general federated learning algorithms. The contribution of each client is simply evaluated by its local update in FedAtt. FedAtt is not a widely used federated learning algorithm currently. It is not clear whether the proposed approach is applicable to other standard federated learning algorithms such as FedAvg. Also, I do not understand why the paper focuses on FedAtt instead of FedAvg.\n\n(2) The paper lacks reasonable explanations for the proposed approach. A client may have arbitrary bad data and the local updated model may be far from the global optimal model. In such a case, since the distance between the local model and the global model is large, the contribution is also large according to the proposed approach, which is not reasonable. It is not clear how the proposed approach can handle such cases.\n\n(3) The experiments are weak and not clear. \n\n  a) It is not explained how the agent contribution rate is computed. \n\n  b) The experiments are conducted on a single dataset. More datasets are needed. \n\n  c) From Figure 2, it is hard to say that the proposed approach has a similar measurement with SV. \n\n  d) Since the motivation is to reduce the computation overhead, the authors should show compare the computation complexity or the computation time of the proposed approach and SV.\n\nMinor issues:\n\n(1) The writing can be improved, e.g., \u201cSuch\u201d -> \u201cFor example,\u201d\n\n(2) Figure 1 is not referred to in the text.\n\n(3) Figure2-5: orange and blue colors are not explained.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3781/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3781/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Real-time Contribution Measurement Method for Participants in Federated Learning", "authorids": ["~Bingjie_Yan1", "yizezhou20001203@163.com", "by.liu@ieee.org", "20180581310080@hainanu.edu.cn", "zhangyh01230@163.com", "hainan_lily2001@163.com", "niexiaolan25@163.com", "hnufzw@gmail.com", "~Zhixuan_Liang1"], "authors": ["Bingjie Yan", "Yize Zhou", "Boyi Liu", "Jun Wang", "Yuhan Zhang", "Li Liu", "Xiaolan Nie", "Zhiwei Fan", "Zhixuan Liang"], "keywords": ["Federated Learning", "Contribution Evaluation", "Multi-party Participation"], "abstract": "Federated learning is a framework for protecting distributed data privacy and has participated in commercial activities.

The designed measurement method is applied to attention aggregation algorithm of federated learning. Few experiments using Penn Treebank are conducted to support its claims.\n\nThis paper should be rejected because (1) the paper is unpolished and thus is hard to read, (2) the novelty appears quite weak, and (3) the experiments are difficult to understand and generally do not support its contributions\n\nConcerns:\n\nThe paper is difficult to read due to the poor use of English. Many sentences are incomprehensible. Thus, it was often impossible for me to determine exactly what the authors would like to say or describe. Please have your submission proof-read for English writing style and grammar issues. Moreover, please treat the equations as the parts of sentences and make sure that the caption formats of Figures obey the ICLR format.\n\nI also have a serious concern about the novelty of this paper. If my understanding is correct (due to the aforementioned reason), Subsection 3.3 is the only new material proposed by the authors. However, the proposed equation, i.e., equation (5), seems like a design choice without any theoretical justification or providing any intuitive reason, which significantly degrades the novelty of this paper.\n\nFinally, the experiments should be refined to support its main claims. As claimed in Section 1, the proposed measurement method is real-time and has low computational complexity. However, no experiment nor quantitative comparison addressing the running time and complexity between the proposed method and Shapley Value. Actually, the authors compared their method with the method of approximating Shapley Value instead of exact Shapley Value.

However, there is a lack of a sufficiently reasonable contribution measurement mechanism to distribute the reward for each agent. In the commercial union, if there is no mechanism like this, every agent will get the same reward. This is unfair to agents that provide better data, so such a mechanism is needed. To address this issue, this work proposes a real-time contribution measurement method. Firstly, the method defines the impact of each agent. Furthermore, we comprehensively consider the current round and the previous round to obtain the contribution rate of each agent. To verify effectiveness of the proposed method, the work conducts pseudo-distributed training and an experiment on the Penn Treebank dataset. Comparing the Shapley Value in game theory, the comparative experiment result shows that the proposed method is more sensitive to both data quantity and data quality under the premise of maintaining real-time.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "yan|a_realtime_contribution_measurement_method_for_participants_in_federated_learning", "pdf": "/pdf/0dd54c028297fcd3fcaf918ecc43a8740fb1227b.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=F3Hacy_1BB", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nyan2021a,\ntitle={A Real-time Contribution Measurement Method for Participants in Federated Learning},\nauthor={Bingjie Yan and Yize Zhou and Boyi Liu and Jun Wang and Yuhan Zhang and Li Liu and Xiaolan Nie and Zhiwei Fan and Zhixuan Liang},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=MhTgnultR1K}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
