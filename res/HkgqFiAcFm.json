The method is an instance of a \nRao-Blackwellization process and hence reduces variance.\n\n\nDetailed comments\n\nI enjoyed the concept and, while relatively niche, appreciated the work done here and do believe it has clear applications. I am not convinced that the measure theoretic perspective is always\nnecessary to convey the insights, although I appreciate the desire for technical correctness. Still,\nappealing to measure theory does reduces readership, and I encourage the authors to keep this in\nmind as they revise the text.\n\nGenerally speaking it seems like a lot of technicalities for a relatively simple result:\nmarginalizing a distribution onto a lower-dimensional surface.\n\nThe paper positions itself generally as dealing with arbitrary transformations T, but really is \nabout angular transformations (e.g. Definition 3.1). The generalization is relatively \nstraightforward and was not too surprising given the APG theory. The paper would gain in clarity\nif its scope was narrowed. \n\nIt's hard for me to judge of the experimental results of section 5.3, given that there are no other \nbenchmarks or provided reference paper.

I think this work deserves to be published, in particular because it presents a reasonably straightforward result that others will benefit from.

Below we repeat the questions/comments from the review and respond to each in turn.\n\n\u201cThe paper positions itself generally as dealing with arbitrary transformations T, but really is about angular transformations (e.g. Definition 3.1). The generalization is relatively straightforward and was not too surprising given the APG theory. The paper would gain in clarity if its scope was narrowed.\u201d\n\nOur MPG framework not only supports the angular transformation but also covers the recently proposed clipped transformation in CAPG [Fujita and Maeda, 2018]. The theoretical result is tighter than the one in [Fujita and Maeda, 2018], and it supports general transformations instead of only clipped actions.\n\n\"I am not convinced that the measure theoretic perspective is always necessary to convey the insights, although I appreciate the desire for technical correctness.\" / \"Generally speaking it seems like a lot of technicalities for a relatively simple result: marginalizing a distribution onto a lower-dimensional surface.\"\n\nWe agree that the measure theoretic approach is not always necessary (indeed for angular actions, it is not needed), but it is necessary for a very common scenario -- clipped actions. Researchers and practitioners both almost always clip actions when using policy gradient algorithms for robotics control environments (read: MuJoCo tasks). Recently, a reduced variance method was introduced by Fujita and Maeda (2018) for clipped action spaces. Their algorithm is also a member of the marginal policy gradients family and our theoretical results for MPG significantly tighten the existing analysis of that algorithm. \n\n\n\"It's hard for me to judge of the experimental results of section 5.3, given that there are no other benchmarks or provided reference paper. As a whole, I see APG as providing a minor benefit over PG.\"\n\nFor the results in Section 5.3, the issue is that currently, there are no benchmark environments for directional control. We anticipate that in the future this may change (e.g. console and PC games often have directional controls).\n\n\u201cWhat does E_{pi|s} refer to in Eqn 4.1?\u201d\n\nThe expectation is taken with respect to the policy \\pi conditioned on the current state s (s here is arbitrary, but fixed). Stated differently, we are taking the expectation with respect to the distribution $\\pi(\\cdot | s,\\theta)$.\n\n\u201cCan you clarify what it means for the map T to be a sufficient statistic for theta? (Theorem 4.6)\u201d\n\nWe have now removed this part of the statement because we are no longer absolutely certain of its correctness, and because it is not used anywhere else in the paper.\n\n\u201cExperiment 5.1: Why would we expect APG with a 2d Gaussian to perform better than a 1d Gaussian on the angle?\u201d\n\nBecause using a 1D Gaussian requires either (1) clipping the angle to [0,2\\pi) before execution in the environment and making updates using the clipped output or (2) using the sampled angle for updates and perform the clipping in the environment. In the first case, this approach is asymmetric in that does not place similar probability on $\\mu_{\\theta}(s) - \\epsilon$ and $\\mu_{\\theta}(s) + \\epsilon$ for $\\mu_{\\theta}(s)$ near to $0$ and $2\\pi$. In the second case, this requires approximating a periodic function. We include both these reasons at the start of Section 3.\n\n\nLastly, thank you for the concrete suggestions:\n\"Def 4.4: \"a notion of Fisher information\" -- maybe \"variant\" is better than \"notion\", which implies there are different kinds of Fisher information \nDef 3.1 mu is overloaded: parameter or measure?\n4.4, law of total variation -- define \"\n\nWe have addressed these and uploaded a new draft to reflect the changes. For the last suggestion, we currently define the law of total variance(variation) in the preliminaries so we did not repeat the definition in Section 4.4. We now write \"law of total variance\" instead of \"law of total variation\" to avoid any ambiguity."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper468/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper468/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper468/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Marginal Policy Gradients: A Unified Family of Estimators for Bounded Action Spaces with Applications", "abstract": "Many complex domains, such as robotics control and real-time strategy (RTS) games, require an agent to learn a continuous control.

We mostly agree with your characterization of our work, but we think there are two important points we perhaps did not sufficiently emphasize in our paper and that we would like to mention:\n\n(1) There are other existing tasks and algorithms that fall into the marginal policy gradients framework. For example, researchers and practitioners both almost always clip actions when using policy gradient algorithms for robotics control environments (read: MuJoCo tasks). Recently, a reduced variance method was introduced by Fujita and Maeda (2018) for clipped action spaces. Their algorithm is also a member of the marginal policy gradients family and our theoretical results for MPG significantly tighten the existing analysis of their algorithm.\n\n(2) To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to apply such variance reduction techniques to RL.\n\nTo summarize, our work consists of two components: (a) a new algorithm for directional control and (b) a variance reduction framework that can be applied to directional action space and clipped action spaces. While directional action spaces are not very common at this time, clipped action spaces are extremely common. We also anticipate that in the future, many additional environments will be available that feature directional actions (many console or PC games, for example). For these reasons, we feel that our work is not incremental at all, and is actually quite novel.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper468/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper468/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper468/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Marginal Policy Gradients: A Unified Family of Estimators for Bounded Action Spaces with Applications", "abstract": "Many complex domains, such as robotics control and real-time strategy (RTS) games, require an agent to learn a continuous control.
