We also offer insight in the paper why these techniques would be a good fit for it.\n\nThe method can still report bugs in the code even when it achieves 100% accuracy in the synthetic evaluation, because we can still rank code locations by the probability that they contain a bug type, thus obtaining a ranked list of the most suspicious locations in unseen code. Also, we know from other work that this particular bug type (Wrong Binary Operator) is actually fairly rare in practice (we keep this in the evaluation to compare to DeepBugs), so it is not that surprising that the classifier does not identify clear instances of the bugs.\n\n Furthermore, we cannot make the strong assumption that misclassifying more instances means that we\u2019ll find more real bugs as there is no guarantee that the misclassified locations are indeed bugs. Especially, since for industrial tools such as Google\u2019s Tricorder (Sadowski, 2015) a false positive rate of less than 10% is enforced.  As a consequence in an industrial setting it would be prefered to use bug detectors with high precision as this will result in more trustworthy tools for the developers due to less overhead.\n\nWe also think that showcasing the practical usefulness of the technique and exploring whether the idea of bug-introducing changes is effective in practice is a very good idea. We will look into this.\n\nWe will fix all minor issues."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2076/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2076/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SCELMo: Source Code Embeddings from Language Models", "authors": ["Rafael - Michael Karampatsis", "Charles Sutton"], "authorids": ["mpatsis13@gmail.com", "charlessutton@google.com"], "keywords": ["Transfer Learning", "Pretraining", "Program Repair"], "TL;DR": "A new set of deep contextualized word representations for computer programs based on language models.", "abstract": "Continuous embeddings of tokens in computer programs have been used to support a variety of software development tools, including readability, code search, and program repair. \nContextual embeddings are common in natural language processing but have not been previously applied in software engineering.\nWe introduce a new set of deep contextualized word representations for computer programs based on language models.\nWe train a set of embeddings using the ELMo (embeddings from language models) framework of Peters et al (2018).\nWe investigate whether these embeddings are effective when fine-tuned for the downstream task of bug detection.\nWe show that even a low-dimensional embedding trained on a relatively small corpus of programs can improve a state-of-the-art machine learning system for bug detection.", "pdf": "/pdf/b2abeae9a999f4f2f2f3b4426fd12ed3fd15e52f.pdf", "paperhash": "karampatsis|scelmo_source_code_embeddings_from_language_models", "original_pdf": "/attachment/844528d15effef944ec9a661a72ecea6fc073aaf.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkarampatsis2020scelmo,\ntitle={{\\{}SCELM{\\}}o: Source Code Embeddings from Language Models},\nauthor={Rafael - Michael Karampatsis and Charles Sutton},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryxnJlSKvr}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"required": true, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).

This first step is an artificial problem created by taking real programs (with and without bugs, but assuming almost all of them are correct) and introducing bugs of certain type into the programs. Then, a classifier needs to distinguish between the real and the artificial set. This classifier is then to be used as a checker for anomalies in code and the anomalies are reported as bugs, however the paper skips this second step and only reports results on the first classification problem.\n\nTechnically, the paper improve this first step of DeepBugs by using a standard variant of ELMO. The evaluation is detailed, but the results are unsurprising. The paper simply tech-transfers the idea from NLP to Code. If this work is accepted at the conference, I cannot imagine an interesting presentation or a poster that simply cites the changed numbers. Did we expect ELMO to be worse than more naive or random embeddings?\n\nThe work and its results heavily peg on the DeepBugs and increases the precision of its first step by a significant margin, but does not show getting any more useful results.  In fact, on one task (Wrong Binary Operator), SCELmo gets to 100% accuracy. This means it will never report any bugs, whereas DeepBugs seems to be performing best on exactly this kind of reports with its weaker model.\n\nI would recommend the authors to either work on showing practical usefulness of the technique, showing something for the full bugfinding task (not merely the first, artificial part), or to investigate if (or how) the idea to add bug-introducing changes to a code dataset is conceptually flawed for bugfinding (as this idea is widely used by several other works like Allamanis et al 2018b or by https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01720 which also don't get to practical tools ). There seems to be some indication of this by the reported 100% accuracy, but right now this remains completely uninvestigated. \n\nMinor issues:\nListing 3: Opernad -> Operand\nPage 5.
