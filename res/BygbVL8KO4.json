They train two separate generator networks, take the sum of their output, and then perform inference by finding the latent vectors for both GANs which minimize the distance in pixel space to the original (mixed) image, with a regularization penalty on the magnitude of the latent vector.\n\nWhile the approach is very simple, the experiments looked promising. When the two data distributions were very different, the demixing GAN was able to cleanly separate out the two classes. I would have appreciated more rigorous comparison against alternative methods, especially more on ICA and possibly NMF as baselines. More comparison on real world data would be interesting as well - for instance quite a lot of biomedical data contains mixed signals from different types of tissue and automatic demixing is very valuable there.", "rating": "3: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/DeepGenStruct/Paper14/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/DeepGenStruct/Paper14/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unsupervised Demixing of Structured Signals from Their Superposition Using GANs", "authors": ["Mohammadreza Soltani", "Swayambhoo Jain", "Abhinav Sambasivan"], "authorids": ["msoltani@iastate.edu", "swayambhoo.jain@gmail.com", "samba014@umn.edu"], "keywords": ["Demixing", "Generative Models", "GAN", "Unsupervised Learning", "Structured Recovery"], "TL;DR": "An unsupervised learning approach for separating two structured signals from their superposition", "abstract": "Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a popular alternative for modeling complex high dimensional distributions.
