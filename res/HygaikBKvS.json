We have addressed it in the updated version of the paper. In Figure 1 we now also present a single agent that uses the same hyper-parameter schedule that was published by Espeholt et al. (2018). This agent obtains a score of 431% human normalized median across the 57 atari games, achieving a new state of the art in the single agent regime. The fastest prior agent to reach 400% is presented by Kapturowski et al. (2019) requiring more than 3,000M steps. This constitutes a 15x improvement in data-efficiency like-for-like.\n\nComparing our single-agent and population (9 agents) results, we would like to point out that:\n1) population training achieves higher performance (448% vs 431%) but indeed observes 9x more frames;\n2) the single agent result used an optimised hyper-parameter schedule from Espeholt et al. (2018), while the population set up reflects the setting where a good hyper-parameter schedule is not known;\n3) Like-for-like comparing population training with and without shared replay, we observe that sharing the replay leads to more efficient training (370% vs 233% at 50M steps per-agent).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1932/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1932/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Off-Policy Actor-Critic with Shared Experience Replay", "authors": ["Simon Schmitt", "Matteo Hessel", "Karen Simonyan"], "authorids": ["suschmitt@google.com", "mtthss@google.com", "simonyan@google.com"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Off-Policy Learning", "Experience Replay"], "TL;DR": "We investigate and propose solutions for two challenges in reinforcement learning: (a) efficient actor-critic learning with experience replay (b) stability of very off-policy learning.", "abstract": "We investigate the combination of actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms with uniform large-scale experience replay and propose solutions for two challenges: (a) efficient actor-critic learning with experience replay (b) stability of very off-policy learning.

In particular the policy gradient implicitly optimizes the target policy for a wrong Q function. We can compute how wrong this Q-function is in expectation. We provide a formula for a state action dependent distortion factor w(s, a) <= 1 in propositions 2 and 3. The factor distorts the Q functions in multiplicative way. When w(s, a)=1 there is no distortion at all.\n\nThe question of how biased the resulting policy will be depends on whether the distortion changes the argmax of the Q function. Little distortions that don\u2019t change the argmax will result in the same local fixpoint of the policy improvement. The policy will continue to select the optimal action and it will not be biased at this state.\nThe policy will however be biased if the Q function is distorted too much. For example consider a w(s, a) that swaps the argmax for the 2nd largest value, the regret will then be the difference between the maximum and the 2nd largest value. Intuitively speaking the more distorted the Q, the larger will be the regret compared to the optimal policy.\n\nMore precisely, the regret of learning a policy that follows a distorted Q is:\nRegret = Q(s, a_best) - Q(s, a_actual)  = max_b Q(s, b) - Q(s, a_actual)\nwhere \n * a_best = argmax_a (Q, a) is the optimal action according to the real Q\n * a_actual = argmax_a(Q(s, a) * w(s, a)), is the optimal action according to the distorted Q\n\n\nIn proposition 3 we recall that mixing online data leads to a linear interpolation between real Q function and the implied Q function. In practice this moves each w(s, a) closer to 1.0. Given sufficient online data the argmax can be preserved. \n\nWe have expanded section 2.3 in the paper and added further derivations to the appendix after Proposition 3. \n\nIn particular consider the added equation 13 which provides interpretation on how to choose alpha such that the learnt policy will correctly choose the best action. One of the insights is that alpha may be small if there is a large action value gap between a_best and b.\n\nThe provided conditions can be computed and checked if an accurate Q function and state distribution is accessible. Using imperfect Q function estimates to adaptively choose such an alpha remains a question for future research. \n\nIn this paper we investigate different constant alpha values for their practical performance. We empirically show in Figure 2 that alpha as small as 1/8 results in stable learning performance. \n\n\nRe 2: We have clarified that V is the bootstrap value -- the previously estimated state value function.\n\nRe 3: Propositions 4 and 5 show that the trust-region value estimation operator is a sound operator that really obtains an improved estimate in expectation. We consider this as an essential condition and present it here for reference to show the correctness of our method.\n\nRe 4: We have added a derivation. In related matters we reference Degris (2012) around equation 1.\n\nRe 5: We present in Figure 2 that running a hyper-parameter sweep of 9 agents with shared experience replay is better than running a sweep with 9 separate agents.\n\nPage 8 states: \u201cOn Atari sweeps contain 9 agents with different learning rate and entropy cost combinations {3 \u00b7 10\u22124 , 6 \u00b7 10\u22124 , 1.2 \u00b7 10\u22123} \u00d7 {5 \u00b7 10\u22123 , 1 \u00b7 10\u22122 , 2 \u00b7 10\u22122} (distributed by factors {1/2, 1, 2} around the parameters reported in Espeholt et al. (2018)).\u201d\n\nThe \u201cb\u201d parameter in the trust region was investigated by considering the values {1, 2, 4} on DMLab-30.

Here pi_t is the target policy at training step t. In this case the distribution of z (equal to t) would be uniform as the experience replay is uniform.\n\nWe also consider the case where experience is sampled uniformly from both agents id (in a parameter sweep) and training time (episode id).\n\nRe 2: We have reworded this term in the updated version. By \u201cvery off-policy\u201d in the abstract we meant learning from replay generated by other agent instances. This stands in comparison to classic experience replay where agents learn from data that they have generated themselves and saved into a replay buffer.\n\nRe 3: We present an actor-critic algorithm that is robust to off-policy data. We have shown that off-policy data from other agents may have an adverse effect (left green curve in Figure 3) and deteriorate performance significantly. The proposed trust region is able to discard harmful data. This avoids negative interference. However the harmful data still occupies space in the replay and in the training batch (where the loss is zeroed out). This can be a slight disadvantage in certain circumstances if computational resources are limited. Note that the trust region agent trained with population based training (red curve in the right plot) obtains the best results of all considered experiments.\n\nRe 4: Thanks for the suggestion.

The authors first analyzed the cause of instability in the prior work, from the perspective of bias and variance. Two remedies were then presented: (i) mixing the experience replay with online learning; (ii) proposing a trust region scheme to select the behavior policies. The authors finally tested the proposed method on Atari games, and showed the better results, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\n\nIn my opinion, the empirical results are impressive, and the authors also provided some insights for the motivation. Given the results on Atari games, this paper could be a great contribution on the actor critic methods. The propositions are presented to support relevant claims, while their significance seems a bit limited, and some further clarification is necessary. The authors also need to address a few confusing statements and missing details.\n\n1. In Proposition 3, the authors claimed that mixing with on-policy data can reduce the bias. I checked the proof but did not find anything relevant. Also, what is the amount of bias reduced?\n2. In Equation (1), could you provide a formal definition for \"V\"? \n3. The authors claimed at the beginning of Section 4 that the trust region method was proposed to mitigate the bias and variance problem of V-trace. However, I did not see how this is reflected in Propositions 4 and 5. Is this statement only based on empirical results?\n4. It was mentioned right below Equation (4) that \"Observe how this inner expectation ... matches the on-policy return...\". Could you provide a formal proof?\n5. What are the hyperparameters for the 9 agents used in Figure 1? Also, how did you choose \"b\" in trust region?\n6.

It shows that V-trace policy gradient is not guaranteed to converge to a local optimal solution. To mitigate the bias and variance problem of V-trace and importance sampling, a trust region approach is proposed to adaptively selects only suitable behavior distributions when estimating the state-value of a policy. To this end, a behavior relevance function (KL divergence) is introduced to classify behavior as relevant. The proposed learning method LASER demonstrates the state-of-the-art data efficiency in Atari among agents trained up until 200M frames. In all, this paper is well motivated and technically sound. The draft can be improved by making it more self-contained by providing a sketch of the proof rather than refer everything to the appendix. Also it might be helpful to provide a pseudocode of LASER to help readers better understand the technical details. \n\nOther comments and questions:\n\n1) When talking about the selection process, z is treated as a random variable. What is its distribution?\n2) what does \u201cvery off-policy learning\u201d mean?\n3) In figure 3(left), why \u201cLASER: shared + trust region\u201d performs worse than \u201cLASER: not shared\u201d? \n4) In proposition 3. Q^w should be explained in the main text.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1932/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1932/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Off-Policy Actor-Critic with Shared Experience Replay", "authors": ["Simon Schmitt", "Matteo Hessel", "Karen Simonyan"], "authorids": ["suschmitt@google.com", "mtthss@google.com", "simonyan@google.com"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Off-Policy Learning", "Experience Replay"], "TL;DR": "We investigate and propose solutions for two challenges in reinforcement learning: (a) efficient actor-critic learning with experience replay (b) stability of very off-policy learning.", "abstract": "We investigate the combination of actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms with uniform large-scale experience replay and propose solutions for two challenges: (a) efficient actor-critic learning with experience replay (b) stability of very off-policy learning.
