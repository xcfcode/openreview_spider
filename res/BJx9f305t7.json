Please check the general comment in which we clarify our contributions. We will also make sure that the updated version of our paper states them clearly.\n\n\n* Most results are known from the OT community\n\nWe agree that all the theoretical results from OT theory employed in this paper are well known for OT community. We borrow these results to propose a new model and analyse its behaviour during training. \n\n\n* The differences with the work of Seguy, 2018 is also not obvious\n\nThe work of (Seguy et al., 2018) proposes a two-step approach for large-scale OT map. First, they solve the regularized Kantorovitch problem in its dual form to get an optimal *plan*, and then learn a parametric function (a neural network) to approximate the barycentric projection of this optimal plan. This is quite different from our approach where we use an adversarial approach where the discriminator locally approximates the optimal *map* toward the target distribution to provide signal for the generator. What should be compared when approaching the OT map is our generator at the end of training and their model after barycentric projection. \n\n\n* Most of the theoretical considerations of Section 3 is either based on unrealistic assumptions (case 1) or make vague assumptions 'if we ignore the possibly significant effect ...' that seem unjustified so far\n\nWe acknowledge that the current analysis is based on idealistic assumptions, but these assumptions are not exclusive to our work and, in fact, most GAN papers make similar assumptions. This is a result of the difficulty of making concrete statements about parametric functions. However, in the updated version, we try to bridge the gap between the practical case of parametric update of the generator, and the idealistic case of continuous optimization in the space of non-parametric generator distribution. For this, we use functional gradient analysis, which helps in interpreting the parameter update as an approximation of an ideal discrete update in the space of probability measures. \n\n\n* why the theoretical analysis on convergence following a geodesic path in a     Wasserstein space is valuable from a practical view\n\nFrom a practical view, the main advantage is that this allows us to predict that the generator will recover an OT map at the end of training. This is interesting because: \n1) In domain transfer applications (e.g. unsupervised image or language translation) it would be really valuable to characterize and possibly control the mapping obtained by a generative model\n2) Large-scale Monge maps have also many practical applications (e.g. domain adaptation). Hence, having a powerful generative model approximating a Monge map can be powerful tool in these applications.\nAnother possible practical application of following W2 geodesics between two distribution is that it allows us to observe intermediate probability measures, i.e. computing barycenters.\nThat being said, we believe that characterizing dynamics of generator distribution to be theoretically very interesting and could possibly lead to advances in understanding GANs in general.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1288/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1288/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1288/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "W2GAN: RECOVERING AN OPTIMAL TRANSPORT MAP WITH A GAN", "abstract": "Understanding and improving Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) using notions from Optimal Transport (OT) theory has been a successful area of study, originally established by the introduction of the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN).

While we cannot make theoretical statements about the training dynamics in W1 GANs (because there are infinite W1 geodesics), it seems like in practice -- at least in our 2D experiments --  WGAN-LP seems to recover an OT map.

(5): this is true that the expectation should be taken over the marginals from the mere definition of the entropic (L2) regularized Kantorovitch problem. We corrected that. \nIn the context of the unregularized Kantorovitch dual, the hard inequality constraint (eq (4)) should actually happen pointwise everywhere on the euclidean space. This is the objective we really want to approach in our context. In order to do that in a tractable manner, we remove the hard constraint and add a corresponding penalty in the objective of the discriminator. The perfect penalty should thus involve an expectation everywhere on the space. Thus one could try enforcing this penalty by sampling between the distributions, or around the distributions, etc. This applies in particular for the penalty term in eq (7).\n\n\n* Proposition 1 is mainly due to Brenier\n\nThat is true, and it was not our intention to claim this result as ours.

Below we try to answer the questions you addressed. \n\n* Regarding Theorem 1 and Corollary 1: Is it is possible to reason about an imperfect generator class and undertrained discriminator, and get sufficient conditions for convergence (not necessarily exponential) ?\n\nThis is a very interesting point. Indeed, assuming a first bound on the difference between the gradient of our discriminator and the one of the perfect Kantorovitch potential, and a second bound on the generator update, one can compose those bounds to obtain, locally at one update, a bound on the deviation from the OT trajectory. It might be interesting then to add those bouds together (with some stochasticity on the direction of the error term) to see at the end of training how far the generated distribution is from the Monge map. In addition, an interesting as well as a hard problem is to ensure that the gradient of the regularized Kantorovitch potential converges toward the gradient of the Kantorovitch potential when the regularization term goes to zero, and how fast it does so. \n\n\n* In Proposition 1, I suspect that p > 2 (see below), which makes the p=2 choice a limit case of the proposition\n* In proposition 1, (6), use the Holder conjugate of p: ||\\nabla||^{1(p-1)-1} =1/||\\nabla||^{2-q}. Also better to understand as $q\\leq 2$. \n* looking at the proof of proposition 1, I do not know how you derive the inverse gradient, but I suspect you need in fact $p>2$, which also implies $q<2$ above\n\nThose three remarks are linked. We can indeed use the Holder conjugate, but we do not need p>2. When p=2, the term in the denominator is equal to 1 and we actually recover the famous version of this proposition : T(x)=x-\\nabla \\phi(x). \nYour question about the way of inverting the gradient is legitimate, we omitted the fact that we use the L2 norm to define the cost function. Using L2 allows both computing and inverting the gradient easily. The case of p=2 is actually the easiest one, because the gradient and its inverse are (a scalar times) the identity. Please note that this proposition is a well known result by (Brenier, 1991) and not our own contribution. We will make sure this is made more explicit in the next version of the paper.\n\n\n* In the interpretation of the equation after (16), isn\u2019t is possible to interpret the Jacobian terms as a geometric tweak for the update of G ?\n\nIn fact, it is really hard to understand the effect of the Jacobian term. We are not sure what you mean by geometric tweak, but this term should be thought of as a projection of the ideal update in the space of probability measures onto the space of parametrized probability measures. According to the functional gradient analysis (which will be available in the next version of the paper), this update is actually meant to be the best update in the parameter space so that the updated generated distribution is closest as possible to the ideal updated distribution. \n\n\n* Cite and compare with https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05488.pdf\n\nThanks for pointing out this work. We will make sure to cite it in the updated version of our paper. That being said, we believe it is quite different from our work. Their approach devices a generative model which uses an encoder-decoder process to reduce data to a latent space, and then perform the OT with a discriminator-only method (similar to our discriminator) in this latent space. This relies on the fact that T(x)=x-\\nabla\\phi might provide a good approximation of OT map in low dimensional spaces. Crucially, their generative model does not recover an optimal map between the two distributions in the data space, which is what our approach aims to achieve.\n\n\n* W2-OT is not better than Barycentric-OT (e.g. spirals)\n\nAs stated in the general comment to all reviewers, the approximated OT by the discriminator is not meant to be a competitive approach on its own. We use it to provide the correct direction for the generator to be updated during training. The generator, on the other hand, is competitive to other large-scale OT approaches (such as Barycentric-OT).\n\n\n* W2GAN is not better than WGAN-LP\n\nWe agree that WGAN-LP seems to perform very well in practice. The main advantage of W2GAN is that it relies on the Wasserstein-2 distance, which allows for a concrete theoretical analysis of its behaviour. This is not possible with Wasserstein-1 distance -- as explained in the comment to all reviewers.\n \n\n* CIFAR-10 experiments \n\nThe main objective of our approach is to show that it is a competitive method for large-scale OT. The main point of this experiment is to show that our method can also be a reasonable GAN-based generative model, but it is not meant to show that we can achieve state-of-the-art results with it. We agree that this was not clear from our submission, and we will try to emphasize that in our updated one.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1288/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1288/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1288/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "W2GAN: RECOVERING AN OPTIMAL TRANSPORT MAP WITH A GAN", "abstract": "Understanding and improving Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) using notions from Optimal Transport (OT) theory has been a successful area of study, originally established by the introduction of the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN).

We acknowledge that the submitted version of the paper had many limitations in terms of clarity of the message and writing. We will fix this in the next version which will plan to submit by Monday.\n\nHowever, we take this opportunity to emphasize the main contributions of our paper:\n\n- We introduce W2GAN, a GAN-based model which can compute optimal transport map in large-scale settings.\n\n- We provide a theoretical analysis of training dynamics of the generator of W2GAN, which results in showing that the generator recovers the optimal transport map between the initial generator distribution and the real target distribution. Our analysis relies on two facts: the discriminator locally approximates the optimal transport map, and that it provides signal for the generator which allows it to follow the W2 geodesics during training.\n\n- We provide empirical evidence that the generator recovers the optimal transport map between two distributions in both low-dimensional settings and high dimensional settings (MV Gaussians to MNIST).\n\nWe also want to address general concerns raised by the reviewers:\n\n- The discriminator (or W2-OT) is not meant to be a competitive way to compute a Monge map. That was not clear in the first version of the paper. The discriminator is a real function and is not explicitly trained to reproduce a Monge map. What is important is that its gradient orients the generator toward the optimal map. Experiments in Table 1 should be seen as a confirmation of this theoretical fact. \n\n- We do not aim to introduce a state-of-the-art GAN model. We regard our model as a principled method for computing OT map, which can scale for high-dimensional data. This is why we do not focus on achieving state-of-the-art results on CIFAR10. The main objective of this result was to show that our model, as opposed to other large-scale OT approaches, can achieve performance comparable to GAN in high-dimensional datasets.\n\n- Why use W2 instead of W1?\nOur theoretical argument that the generator recovers an optimal map at the end of training relies on analysing the path that it is following during the training. In the W2 case, this path is the unique Wasserstein 2 geodesic between two distributions. Hence, at the end of training, the generator recovers a Monge map. In the W1 case, it might be --although not in an obvious way-- that the generator follows a Wasserstein 1 geodesic, but those geodesics can be infinite. So checking that they correspond to a certain Monge map is not guaranteed, neither is the uniqueness of such map."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1288/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1288/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1288/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "W2GAN: RECOVERING AN OPTIMAL TRANSPORT MAP WITH A GAN", "abstract": "Understanding and improving Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) using notions from Optimal Transport (OT) theory has been a successful area of study, originally established by the introduction of the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN).

Authors state that the discriminator approximate the W2 distance, and that the generator follows an OT map. \nWhile I did not see any flaws in the development, the paper is quite bushy and hard to follow. Some questions are still open, for instance in the end of the experiments, authors state that the model has \"a strong theoretical advantages\": can you provide more details about those advantages?\nThe experiments do not show any clear advantages of the method regarding competitors. Regarding Table 1, why are there some points with no arrows? W2-OT seems not to perform better: are there some other advantages (computational?) to use the method? In Figure 1, it is quite difficult to evaluate the results on a single image with no comparisons. Again, providing a strong evaluation of the method would help to strengthen the paper. \n\nThere are some weird statements and typos mistakes that should be corrected. For example in the first 2 pages: (abstract) \"other GANs also approximately following the Optimal Transport\", (Introduction) \"An optimal map has many important implications such as computing barycenters\", \"high-dimenisonal\", \"generator designed\", \"consideral\", \"although the theoretical arguments do not scale immediately\".\nThe layout of the bibliography should be deeply reviewed.\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1288/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "W2GAN: RECOVERING AN OPTIMAL TRANSPORT MAP WITH A GAN", "abstract": "Understanding and improving Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) using notions from Optimal Transport (OT) theory has been a successful area of study, originally established by the introduction of the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). An increasing number of GANs incorporate OT for improving their discriminators, but that is so far the sole way for the two domains to cross-fertilize. In this work we address the converse question: is it possible to recover an optimal map in a GAN fashion? To achieve this, we build a new model relying on the second Wasserstein distance. This choice enables the use of many results from OT community. In particular, we may completely describe the dynamics of the generator during training. In addition, experiments show that practical uses of our model abide by the rule of evolution we describe.
