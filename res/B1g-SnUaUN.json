This paper doesn't just attempt to reproduce one paper, it attempts to reproduce three different papers and also proposes to use classical statistics tests with a mixed linear regression model to fit accuracies.  This breadth makes the paper's impact potentially very high, but also can make it difficult to understand and fully appreciate.  \n\nSome of the statistical tests could be given more thorough background information, as they may be outside of the range of knowledge of some readers in the ML community.
