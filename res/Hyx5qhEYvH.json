Summarize what the paper claims to do/contribute. Be positive and generous.\n####\nThe paper translates the Leaky Integrate and Fire model of neural computation via spike trains into a discrete-time RNN core similar to LSTM. The architecture would be readily amenable to the modern deep learning toolkit if not for the non-differentiability of the hard decision to spike or not. The hard decision is made by thresholding. The paper adopts a simple approximation of backpropagating a \"gradient\" of 1.0 through the operation if the threshold is within a neighbourhood [thresh - a, thresh + a], and otherwise 0.0, so the system can be trained by backpropagation.\n\nThe architecture is tested on a few \"neuromorphic\" video classification datasets including MNIST-DVS and CIFAR-DVS. Experiments are also run on a text summarization task.\n\n####\nB. Clearly state your decision (accept or reject) with one or two key reasons for this choice.\n####\n\nThe reviewer thinks the paper should be rejected in its current state. \n\nThe proposed architecture is a straightforward change to a standard LSTM core. Thus it should be compared head-to-head to LSTM on standard datasets for these models (e.g. classic synthetic tasks, language modeling, speech recognition, machine translation, etc) with everything else held constant (hidden size, learning rate, sequence length, etc etc).\n\nIt also doesn't really carry over any of the benefits of Spiking Neural Nets even though it is inspired by Leaky Integrate and Fire because it operates in discrete time like a normal RNN, just with an extra binary output produced by spiking. It's unclear that a spiking inductive bias is actually useful, even though event-driven computation could in theory allow much less computation, the proposed method does not have that property. \n\nSo the paper doesn't really provide evidence to back up their claim that the proposed model combines the complimentary advantages of Deep Learning and Spiking Neural Nets. \n\n####\nC. Provide supporting arguments for the reasons for the decision.\n\nWhile the proposed method is in-spirit inspired by the leaky integrate and fire model, it is operated/trained in discrete time which does not allow it to achieve the benefits of continuous time integrate-and-fire models which allow for less computation and time-discretization-invariance. \n\nThe conversion of the spiking model to the deep learning framework is rather crude, as the differentiable approximation to the non-differentiable threshold operation is biased and not well-motivated either empirically, intuitively, or theoretically (i.e. there are no comparisons to alternative choices).\n\nThere are new techniques for marrying continuous-time models and deep learning which seem more promising to investigate to this end (e.g. Neural ODE).\n\nSo in summary, the method doesn't have the computational benefits of a biologically plausible spiking algorithms and is not well-tested against competing deep learning methods, making it hard to verify the motivation of pushing toward a performant yet biologically plausible algorithm.\n####\n\n####\nD. Provide additional feedback with the aim to improve the paper. Make it clear that these points are here to help, and not necessarily part of your decision assessment.\n####\nThere are many grammatical and word-choice mistakes which make the paper hard to read.\n\nMainly, from a practical perspective, the paper would be much-improved by showing what benefit the spiking inductive bias confers over a standard LSTM on standard tasks in the deep learning community.\n\nThe method/landscape should be developed and studied in further detail until claims can be made about combining the strengths of spiking and deep-learning models."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper126/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper126/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A SPIKING SEQUENTIAL MODEL: RECURRENT LEAKY INTEGRATE-AND-FIRE", "authors": ["Daiheng Gao", "Hongwei Wang", "Hehui Zhang", "Meng Wang", "Zhenzhi Wu"], "authorids": ["samuel.gao023@gmail.com", "hongwei.wang@lynxi.com", "zhh@bupt.edu.cn", "wangmeng_wm@bupt.edu.cn", "zhenzhi.wu@lynxi.com"], "keywords": ["spiking neural network", "RNN", "spiking mode", "brain-inspired", "text summarization", "DVS"], "abstract": "Stemming from neuroscience, Spiking neural networks (SNNs), a brain-inspired neural network that is a versatile solution to fault-tolerant and energy efficient information processing pertains to the \u201devent-driven\u201d characteristic as the analogy of the behavior of biological neurons.

Indeed, the most commonly used spiking neuron model, the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron (LIF), obeys a differential equation which can be approximated using discrete time steps, leading to a recurrent relation for the potential. The firing threshold causes a non-differentiability issue, but it can be overcome using a surrogate gradient. In practice, it means that SNNs can be trained on GPUs using standard deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.\n\nHere the authors extend this approach by proposing two variations of the LIF model, called RLIF and LIF-LSTM. However, the presentation of these models is not clear at all.\nFor example:\n* what is U^t in Equation 4?\n* what is M^t in Equation 7?\n* what is the difference (if any) between u^t and u_d^t?\nEquation 8 is even more obscure. Why bothering defining a new variable Y if it is equal to F? What is index j, and why is it used only on the left hand side of the equation?\n\nThe description of the LIF-LSTM is even more obscure, nothing is defined.\n\nFigure 2 has an error. On the left, with the heavyside activation function, the gradient is actually defined everywhere (with a value of 0) but on the red segment!!!\n\nIn addition, the experiments are not convincing. I am not an expert in NLP, so I will focus on the vision experiments.\nTable 1 is incomplete. Wu et al 2019 (which they cite elsewhere!!!), reached 60.5% on DVS-CIFAR10, which is much better than this paper (56.93%)\n\nFor all these reasons, I recommend rejection.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper126/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper126/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A SPIKING SEQUENTIAL MODEL: RECURRENT LEAKY INTEGRATE-AND-FIRE", "authors": ["Daiheng Gao", "Hongwei Wang", "Hehui Zhang", "Meng Wang", "Zhenzhi Wu"], "authorids": ["samuel.gao023@gmail.com", "hongwei.wang@lynxi.com", "zhh@bupt.edu.cn", "wangmeng_wm@bupt.edu.cn", "zhenzhi.wu@lynxi.com"], "keywords": ["spiking neural network", "RNN", "spiking mode", "brain-inspired", "text summarization", "DVS"], "abstract": "Stemming from neuroscience, Spiking neural networks (SNNs), a brain-inspired neural network that is a versatile solution to fault-tolerant and energy efficient information processing pertains to the \u201devent-driven\u201d characteristic as the analogy of the behavior of biological neurons. However, they are inferior to artificial neural networks (ANNs) in real complicated tasks and only had it been achieved good results in rather simple applications. When ANNs usually being questioned about it expensive processing costs and lack of essential biological plausibility, the temporal characteristic of RNN-based architecture makes it suitable to incorporate SNN inside as imitating the transition of membrane potential through time, and a brain-inspired Recurrent Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (RLIF) model has been put forward to overcome a series of challenges, such as discrete binary output and dynamical trait. The experiment results show that our recurrent architecture has an ultra anti-interference ability and strictly follows the guideline of SNN that spike output through it is discrete. Furthermore, this architecture achieves a good result on neuromorphic datasets and can be extended to tasks like text summarization and video understanding.", "pdf": "/pdf/02486a4cdbdec72831586b064e284a167f0a882d.pdf", "paperhash": "gao|a_spiking_sequential_model_recurrent_leaky_integrateandfire", "original_pdf": "/attachment/02486a4cdbdec72831586b064e284a167f0a882d.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\ngao2020a,\ntitle={A {\\{}SPIKING{\\}} {\\{}SEQUENTIAL{\\}} {\\{}MODEL{\\}}: {\\{}RECURRENT{\\}} {\\{}LEAKY{\\}} {\\{}INTEGRATE{\\}}-{\\{}AND{\\}}-{\\{}FIRE{\\}}},\nauthor={Daiheng Gao and Hongwei Wang and Hehui Zhang and Meng Wang and Zhenzhi Wu},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyx5qhEYvH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
