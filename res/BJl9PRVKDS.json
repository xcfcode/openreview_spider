In particular, this paper focuses on the case of deep fully connected univariate ReLU networks, and show that the parameters will result in a Continuous Piecewise Linear (CPWL) approximation to the target function. Moreover, the authors derive the induced distributions of the function space parameters and show that increasing width can reduce the roughness of the initial function.\n\nBesides, this paper analyzes the loss surface in the function space and reveals some relationship between the critical points in the function space and original NN parameter space. Furthermore, a type of gradient descent dynamic in the function space has also been derived.\n\nMany experiments have been conducted to reveal how the expressiveness and optimization performance varies with the neural network width and depth.\n\nOverall, the functional characterization is interesting can potentially help explain the generalization/expressiveness of deep neural networks. However, this paper is not well written and organized, and there are some \u201c??'s\u201d appearing on page 4. The authors should pay more attention to improving the writing and organization of this paper. \n\nHere are the detailed comments:\n\nThe statements of theorems are not clear. For example, Theorems 3 and 4 convey too much information, I believe the authors should simplify the statements to make them more concise.  Moreover, the purpose of these two lemmas is not clear. Do they imply something related to expressiveness?\nThere should be some discussion in the surrounding text of Theorem 5. Some notations are also missing. For example, what\u2019s $\\hat \\epsilon(t)$?, what\u2019s $a_i(t)$? Besides, what\u2019s the purpose of Theorem 5. It seems that this Theorem is used in the main part of this paper.\nOne major drawback of this paper is that it only provides the theoretical analysis for two-layer networks, but the title and claimed contributions are related to deep ReLU networks. I wonder whether the theory can be extended to deep cases?\nIn Theorem 2, I think He initialization will give you $\\sigma_w = \\sqrt{2/(H+1)}$ and $\\sigma_v = \\sqrt{2/k}$, if the output dimension is k. In this way, I am curious whether Theorem 2 can still hold. Besides, what\u2019s the meaning of the so-called \u201croughness\u201c?\nI don\u2019t get the point in Implications of Corollary 1. For example, what do you mean \u201c$f$ has significant curvature in the boundaries?\u201d, why an initialization that allocates more breakpoints to the area where the curvature of $f$ lies can be faster to train? The authors should elaborate more on this.\n\n\nAfter reading the authors' response.\n\nThanks for your response.  I still think the contribution of this paper is not enough as the theoretical analysis may not be able to be generalized to deep networks.

To our knowledge, this is the first parsimonious explanation that shows how implicit regularization emerges as a joint consequence of (i) very flat initialization + gradient descent dynamics, (ii) overparameterization and (iii) a function parameterization that exhibits nonlocal residual dependence (i.e. breakpoints care about residuals far away from them). We have revised the abstract, introduction, and main contributions to more clearly emphasize this result.\n\nSecond, we thank the reviewers for their helpful comments regarding organization and clarity. We have worked to address these issues by making the following changes:\n\nAdded a reference to our definition of breakpoints and delta-slopes when they are introduced before being defined. \nAdded high-level summaries to Sec. 2.2, describing key findings\nRewrote the section describing the implications of corollary 1\nAdded a small section better introducing smoothness and our roughness metric.\nReworked Theorem 2 to be clearer, fixed an incorrect assumption\nReworked the statement of Theorem 3 \nReworked the discussion following Theorem 3 \nRewrote Theorem 4 as a shorter theorem and a remark\nMoved Theorem 5 to the appendix - it wasn\u2019t directly relevant to nearby theoretical results. \nSignificantly reworked and cleaned up the appendix, particularly the theory section\nVarious changes to the experimental sections to make them clearer and more concise\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1186/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1186/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Functional Characterization of Randomly Initialized Gradient Descent in Deep ReLU Networks", "authors": ["Justin Sahs", "Aneel Damaraju", "Ryan Pyle", "Onur Tavaslioglu", "Josue Ortega Caro", "Hao Yang Lu", "Ankit Patel"], "authorids": ["justin.sahs@bcm.edu", "amd18@rice.edu", "ryan.pyle@bcm.edu", "onur.tavaslioglu@bcm.edu", "josue.ortegacaro@bcm.edu", "hl61@rice.edu", "ankitp@bcm.edu"], "keywords": ["Inductive Bias", "Generalization", "Interpretability", "Functional Characterization", "Loss Surface", "Initialization"], "TL;DR": "A functional approach reveals that flat initialization, preserved by gradient descent, leads to generalization ability.", "abstract": "Despite their popularity and successes, deep neural networks are poorly understood theoretically and treated as 'black box' systems.

We hope to extend our theory to deeper networks in the future, but that is outside the scope of this work.\n\nBreakpoints are needed to model underlying function curvature. Therefore, if the initial breakpoints are far from the regions of curvature, it may take significant time for GD to move them. Table 1 shows this quantitatively and the new experiment (see response to reviewer 1 for more details) supports this, showing experimentally that breakpoint densities are effectively attracted towards the underlying function curvature during training.

The author targets at Deep ReLU Network and uses Continuous Piecewise Linear (CWPL) to analyze the network\u2019s parameter distribution. The main contributions of this paper are as follows, (1) For common initializations, this paper proves a deeper model will lead to flatter approximations and better approximation over a broader range of inputs. (2) A deeper model performs better when one optimizes with (Gradient Descent) GD methods. (3) Flat Initialization in the overparameterized regime could explain generalization. They found that the value of depth in deep nets seems less about expressivity, but enable GD to find better solutions.\n\nMy decision is Weak Accept, considering the following aspects.\nPositive points: (1) The theory seems solid, authors prove breakpoint and delta-slope distribution will influence by the depth of the network. (2) The conclusions of the paper are inspiring, e.g., depth makes it easier for GD to the optimizer.\n\nNegative points: (1) For the experiment, the authors find breakpoints can\u2019t migrate very far from their initial location. I hope the author could explain this phenomenon since it is very crucial to proving the importance of the breakpoint\u2019s initial distribution. (2) Some formulas in the appendix parts are beyond the scope of the page. \n\nSuggestions: I think that a figure that shows breakpoint and input data distribution together will be very interesting.

A number of results are presented, and it would be helpful to have brief high-level summaries of the main findings of each section after diving through technical details.\n- A number of terms are used before they are defined. For example, \"roughness\" is used on pages 1 and 2 but not defined until page 3. I think adding a preliminaries section with central terms/definitions in the paper clearly laid out could help with the exposition.\n\nOther comments\n- Consider defining breakpoints and delta-slopes when they are introduced at the bottom of pg. 1.\n- typo on pg. 1: by doing *so* using small widths"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1186/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1186/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Functional Characterization of Randomly Initialized Gradient Descent in Deep ReLU Networks", "authors": ["Justin Sahs", "Aneel Damaraju", "Ryan Pyle", "Onur Tavaslioglu", "Josue Ortega Caro", "Hao Yang Lu", "Ankit Patel"], "authorids": ["justin.sahs@bcm.edu", "amd18@rice.edu", "ryan.pyle@bcm.edu", "onur.tavaslioglu@bcm.edu", "josue.ortegacaro@bcm.edu", "hl61@rice.edu", "ankitp@bcm.edu"], "keywords": ["Inductive Bias", "Generalization", "Interpretability", "Functional Characterization", "Loss Surface", "Initialization"], "TL;DR": "A functional approach reveals that flat initialization, preserved by gradient descent, leads to generalization ability.", "abstract": "Despite their popularity and successes, deep neural networks are poorly understood theoretically and treated as 'black box' systems.
