Here are some rebuttals.\n\n- Read-Again attention: \nThere are two different and orthogonal attention mechanism in our model. The first one models attention between the decoder and the encoder, as commonly used in sequence to sequence models, and might be what you referred to as vanilla attention. The second attention mechanism we use is our Read-Again attention, which is orthogonal and thus cannot be compared.  One could use multiple passes of reading, but that would be expensive. Instead, we expect the first pass to capture enough global information about the full sentence. \n\n- Two sentences: \nGigaword is actually a document to sentence summarization dataset. However, previous work was mostly concerned with compressing the first sentence in a document to a shorter summary, and thus they cut off the remaining part of document in their experiments. Following this convention, we first evaluate our models on the task of summarizing the first sentence. We also demonstrated that our model could utilize information from more than 1 sentence, achieving better results when feeding 2 sentences rather than one.\n\n- Copy mechanism:\nThe copy anchor (output-input copied word alignment) is constructed if a word in the output is Out of Vocabulary (OOV) for the decoder but it appears in the input. When OOV words appear multiple times, we use its first appearance in the input\n\nExperiments:\nPrevious state-of-the-art work is evaluated on an internal testing set. However, this set and the source code are not openly available at the time we submitting this paper, and thus it\u2019s hard to directly compare with previous work on Gigaword. Therefore, we first compare our Read-Again attention with GRU baseline, which is a fair comparison with our models, to testify the effectiveness of our attention mechanism. We then conduct the comparison of our model with state-of-the-art models on the standard DUC summarization task.\n\nTypos:\nThank you for pointing them out. We\u2019ll fix them.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Efficient Summarization with Read-Again and Copy Mechanism", "abstract": "Encoder-decoder models have been widely used to solve sequence to sequence prediction tasks.

However, this set and the source code are not openly available at the time we submitting this paper, and thus it\u2019s hard to directly compare with previous work on Gigaword. We have to compare our model with our self-implemented baselines on a randomly sampled testing set, and then finish the comparison with other state-of-the-art models on DUC2004.\n\n- Computation Cost:\nThe training time of vanilla GRU is around 2 days while our Read-Again GRU takes less than 3 days. More specifically, it takes 0.20s per minibatch for a GRU  and 0.27s for a Read-Again GRU. Both models achieve the best validation perplexity after running for 10 epochs over the whole training set.\n\n- Small vocabulary:\nWe argue that the copy mechanism is orthogonal to the read-again mechanism. We empirically observe in our experiments that our copy mechanism consistently improves the model performance with or without read-again mechanism.\n\n- Other work:\nThanks for pointing out to additional papers. The main idea of the self-attention is to expand the memory capacity in vanilla LSTM, while the output of the model during each step is still only dependent on the past history.

Here are some rebuttals.\n\n- How does the training speed when compared to the regular LSTM?\nWe compare the training time of our read-again model with our GRU baseline. A vanilla GRU encoder-decoder architecture takes 0.2s per minibatch, while our Read-Again GRU encoder-decoder takes 0.27s for the same minibatch.\n\n- Justification of Read-Again\nVanilla RNN calculates the representation of each word conditioned only on the past history (words). This might be sub-optimal especially when the input sequence is long and future words also bring important information. This is indeed the case of summarization where the input text is lengthy.  Our Read-Again mechanism tries to address this issue by building the representation of each world once the full input text has been read. For example, the gating alpha_i depends not only in the current world but also in future words. We plan to generalize our model to perform document-level summarization. We expect and even larger improvement as the inputs are much longer. \n\n- Copy Mechanism\nAlthough our copy mechanism is inspired by Pointer Network, the main difference is that our model selects  automatically whether to copy a word from the input sequence or to generate a new word from the pre-defined dictionary, while Pointer Network can only select words from the input sequences. Therefore, our copy mechanism is more natural for abstractive summarization task. Furthermore, our model can extract embeddings of rare-words in the input sequence. This help us decrease the dictionary size of the decoder as well as encoder. (See extra experiment response). \nAs for the reason of gain in the experiments, we refer the reader to Table.1. Our Read-Again models (Ours-GRU and Ours-LSTM) defeat vanilla RNNs. Besides, incorporating the Copy mechanism further improves performance.\n\n- Other comments\nThanks for your advice.

The model reads each sentence in the input document twice and creates a hierarchical representation of it instead of a bidirectional RNN. During the decoding, it uses the representation of the document obtained via the read-again mechanism and points the words that are OOV in the source document. The model does abstractive summarization. The authors show improvements on DUC 2004 dataset and provide an analysis of their model with different configurations.\n\nContributions:\nThe main contribution of this paper is the read-again attention mechanism where the model reads the same sentence twice and obtains a better representation of the document.\n\nWriting:\nThe text of this paper needs more work. There are several typos and the explanations of the model/architecture are not really clear, some parts of the paper feel somewhat bloated. \n\nPros:\n- The proposed model is a simple extension to the model to the model proposed in [2] for summarization.\n- The results are better than the baselines.\n\nCons:\n- The improvements are not that large.\n- Justifications are not strong enough.\n- The paper needs a better writeup. Several parts of the text are not using a clear/precise language and the paper needs a better reorganization. Some parts of the text is somewhat informal.\n- The paper is very application oriented.\n\nQuestion:\n- How does the training speed when compared to the regular LSTM?\n\nSome Criticisms:\n\nA similar approach to the read again mechanism which is proposed in this paper has already been explored in [1] in the context of algorithmic learning and I wouldn\u2019t consider the application of that on the summarization task a significant contribution.  The justification behind the read-again mechanism proposed in this paper is very weak. It is not really clear why additional gating alpha_i is needed for the read again stage.\nAs authors also suggest, pointer mechanism for the unknown/rare words [2] and it is adopted for the read-again attention mechanism. However, in the paper, it is not clear where the real is the gain coming from, whether from \u201cread-again\u201d mechanism or the use of \u201cpointing\u201d. \nThe paper is very application focused, the contributions of the paper in terms of ML point of view is very weak.\nIt is possible to try this read-again mechanism on more tasks other than summarization, such as NMT, in order to see whether if those improvements are \nThe writing of this paper needs more work.

This paper introduces 2-pass reading where the representations from the 1st-pass is used to  re-wight the contribution of each word to the sequential representation of the 2nd-pass. The authors described how such a so-called read-again process applies to both GRU and LSTM.\n \n2. On the decoder side, the authors also use the softmax to choose between generating from decoder vocabulary and copying a source position, with a new twist of representing the previous decoded word Y_{t-1} differently. This allows the author to explore a smaller decoder vocabulary hence led to faster inference time without losing summarization performance.\n \nThis paper claims the new state-of-the-art on DUC2004 but the comparison on Gigaword seems to be incomplete (missing more recent results after Rush 2015 etc). While the overall work is solid, there are also other things missing scientifically. For example, \n- how much computational costs does the 2nd pass reading add to the end-to-end system? \n- How does the decoder small vocabulary trick work without 2nd-pass reading on the encoder side for both summarization performance and runtime speed?\n- There are other ways to improve the embedding of a sentence. How does the 2nd-pass reading compare to recent work from multiple authors on self-attention and/or LSTMN?

How does it work better than a vanilla attention? What would happen if you read the same sentences multiple times? Have you compared it with staked LSTM (with same number of parameters)? There is no model ablation in the experiment section. \n\n-Why do you need reading two sentences? The Gigaword dataset is a source-to-compression dataset which does not need multiple input sentences. How do you compare your model with single sent input and two sent input?\n\n-Copy mechanism. What if there are multiple same words appeared in the source sentences to be copied? According to equation (5), you only copy one vector to the decoder. However, there is no this kind of issue for a hard copy mechanism. Besides, there is no comparison between the hard copy mechanism and this vector copy mechanism in the experiment section\n\n-Vocabulary size. This part is a bit off the main track of this paper.

(2015) use a pointer network to copy entities from the input, but they cannot predict an entity out of the input sequence. Gulcehre et al. (2016); Nallapati et al. (2016) use a gating mechanism to leverage two modes, either copy a word from the input or generate a word from a predefined dictionary. Towards this goal, they train different classifiers for each mode and another MLP gating network to combine them. Different from their gating mechanism, we directly apply a softmax layer over all possible candidate words to select the appropriate word.

We use \u2018hard-gating\u2019 here simply to point out that they use explicit gating mechanism to leverage two distinct modes, as compared to softmax in Gu et al. (2016) with no gating involved. However, the gating they use is still a continuous function. We\u2019ll clarify this in the next version.\n\n(2) Fig1 (a) shows an overview of our model. Both encoder1 and encoder2 take the same sentence as input. Further, encoder2 takes the hidden vectors from encoder1 as addional input.  The decoder generates a summary with both attention and our copy mechanism as shown in Fig1 (b). In this figure, c_t is a weighted average of hidden vectors from encoder2, i.e. h_1^2, h_2^2, \u2026, h_n^2 corresponding to all input words. As shown in Fig 1 (b), the word embedding we use for generating summaries could be either \u2018Copied Word Embedding\u2019 or \u2018Decoder Word Embedding\u2019. The 'Copied Word Embedding' are vectors p_1, p_2, ..., p_n defined in Eq (15), and \u2018Decoder Word Embedding\u2019 are learnable parameters for each word in a pre-defined dictionary. y_{t-1} in Fig 1 (b) is the word embedding of the previously generated word during decoding. Notice y_{t-1} = p_i if the previous word is copied from i^{th} input word, or equal to \u2018Decoder Word Embedding\u2019 as in normal sequence to sequence tasks if it\u2019s not copied.\n\n(3) We want to point out that our contribution is orthogonal to deep stacked LSTMs and bidirectional encoders, as we can use our approach with these two types of architectures. What we propose is a self-attention mechanism, where the first read is used to bias the second read. The key point here is to be able to filter out less important words and generate a more relevant encoding vector. We will add this to the next version. \n\n(4)  We use two forms of attention in our model. First, our novel self-attention mechanism is used in the encoder to enable the encoder to attentively select important words during encoding. This is visualized in Fig 4. The second attention, which is used in the decoder is the same as Bahdanau et al. (2014).\n\n(5) No, we haven't, but this is a very interesting experiment which we will add to a revised version.\n\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Efficient Summarization with Read-Again and Copy Mechanism", "abstract": "Encoder-decoder models have been widely used to solve sequence to sequence prediction tasks.
