Extensive experiments with different knowledge distillation loss functions are conducted on a number of representative language representation models including BERT, GPT-2 and MASS to show the benefit of the method. \n\nStrengths:\n\nThe numerical results show some promise of the proposed method to achieve competitive performance to the teacher network and outperform the considered baselines. The evaluated 9 downstream tasks cover a wide range of language understanding and generation problems and they do prove the effectiveness of knowledge distillation in boosting the accuracy.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nMy main concern is about the limited novelty of approach. The knowledge distillation method developed in the paper seems not particularly novel in principle. Although extensive numerical results are provided to show the effectiveness of knowledge distillation, the value-added beyond applying different distillation loss functions in different NLP tasks is still insufficient. Particularly, the loss function that combines maximal likelihood loss with KL divergence looks similar to those used in the paper [1]. The connection and difference to that related work need to be clarified. \n\n[1] Yu, Dong, et al. \"KL-divergence regularized deep neural network adaptation for improved large vocabulary speech recognition.\" 2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing. IEEE, 2013.\n\n=== update after author response ===\n\nThank you for the response. Although interesting and showing some promise in a bunch of applications, I am still not convinced that the proposed approach is novel enough in principle.  I thus stick to my assessment of this paper as borderline leaning to rejection.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper710/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper710/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["kt.song@njust.edu.cn", "sigmeta@pku.edu.cn", "xuta@microsoft.com", "taoqin@microsoft.com", "lujf@njust.edu.cn", "liuhz@pku.edu.cn", "tyliu@microsoft.com"], "title": "LightPAFF: A Two-Stage Distillation Framework for Pre-training and Fine-tuning", "authors": ["Kaitao Song", "Hao Sun", "Xu Tan", "Tao Qin", "Jianfeng Lu", "Hongzhi Liu", "Tie-Yan Liu"], "pdf": "/pdf/5d7238be8a10723ca003760ee05bcb02d9c86e93.pdf", "abstract": "While pre-training and fine-tuning, e.g., BERT~\\citep{devlin2018bert}, GPT-2~\\citep{radford2019language}, have achieved great success in language understanding and generation tasks, the pre-trained models are usually too big for online deployment in terms of both memory cost and inference speed, which hinders them from practical online usage.

It is the first time that knowledge distillation is introduced in the pre-training stage, while previous works mainly use knowledge distillation in the training of downstream tasks.\n\n2. Our proposed framework is very general. It can support a variety of pre-training methods (masked language modeling (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa), causal language modeling (e.g., GPT/GPT-2), masked sequence to sequence modeling (e.g., MASS)) as well as downstream tasks (language understanding (e.g., GLUE tasks), language modeling (e.g., PTB, WikiText-2), sequence to sequence generation(e.g., neural machine translation, text summarization)). In this paper, we conduct comprehensive studies on three representative pre-training models (BERT, GPT-2, and MASS) and their corresponding downstream tasks (language understanding, language modeling, and sequence to sequence generation), with 9 tasks in total, and verify the effectiveness of the framework. There are contemporary works mainly focusing on compressing BERT for language understanding tasks, while we cover diverse pre-trained models and downstream tasks. \nOur LightPAFF with two-stage knowledge distillation is very practical to solve real-world applications. LightPAFF has greatly reduced the online inference time (almost without loss of accuracy) compared with the original big pre-trained model. Actually it has already been served online in our internal production system. We will release our codes and models once accepted.\n\n3. We also conduct deep analyses on LightPAFF, including 1) the ablation study to show the effectiveness of the distillation in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages; 2) we study why distillation can help the model in the pre-training and fine-tuning stages by generation analysis; 3) more interestingly, we also analyze how different pre-training methods (BERT/GPT-2/MASS) influence the behavior of knowledge distillation (see Section 6.3), by analyzing the connections between the difficulty and prediction accuracy among different pre-training tasks, as well as the weight tradeoff between the knowledge distillation loss and ground-truth label loss.  \n\nAlthough the basic idea of knowledge distillation is not new, the simplicity, general applicability (supporting many pretraining models and downstream tasks), and practical effectiveness (e.g., shipped online in our commercial products) of our framework bring solid contributions to the community and make LightPAFF well suited for ICLR 2020.

I'm torn. On the one hand, these results show that this method (which is simple and straight-forward) reduces memory and computation time (latency) substantially while maintaining similar accuracy.

In this way the lightweight model can achieve similar accuracy as the big teacher model, but with much fewer parameters and thus faster online inference speed. LightPAFF can support different pre-training methods (such as BERT, GPT-2 and MASS~\\citep{song2019mass}) and be applied to many downstream tasks. Experiments on three language understanding tasks, three language modeling tasks and three sequence to sequence generation tasks demonstrate that while achieving similar accuracy with the big BERT, GPT-2 and MASS models, LightPAFF reduces the model size by nearly 5x and improves online inference speed by 5x-7x.", "keywords": ["Knowledge Distillation", "Pre-training", "Fine-tuning", "BERT", "GPT-2", "MASS"], "paperhash": "song|lightpaff_a_twostage_distillation_framework_for_pretraining_and_finetuning", "original_pdf": "/attachment/d4e355460af781f7ad26699b0a61f1d084ee0b10.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nsong2020lightpaff,\ntitle={Light{\\{}PAFF{\\}}: A Two-Stage Distillation Framework for Pre-training and Fine-tuning},\nauthor={Kaitao Song and Hao Sun and Xu Tan and Tao Qin and Jianfeng Lu and Hongzhi Liu and Tie-Yan Liu},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1xv9pEKDS}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
