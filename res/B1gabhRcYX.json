I think the paper is much more convincing now. I am happy to increase my rating to clear accept.\n\nI also agree with the introduction of the Chi vector, and with the use of the term of \"photometric BA\", since it was used before, even if it is unfortunate in my opinion. I thank the authors to replace reprojection by alignment, which is much clearer.\n\n---------------\n\n\nThis paper presents a method for dense Structure-from-Motion using Deep Learning:\nThe input is a set of images; the output is the camera poses and the depth maps for all the images.\nThe approach is inspired by Levenberg-Marquardt optimization (LM): A pipeline extracting image features computes the Jacobian of an error function. This Jacobian is used to update an estimate of the camera poses. As in LM optimization, this update is done based on a factor lambda, weighting a gradient descent step and a Gauss-Newton step. In LM optimization, this lambda evolves with the improvement of the estimate. Here lambda is also predicted using a network based on the feature difference.\n\nIf I understand correctly, what is learned is how to compute image features that provide good updates, how to predict the depth maps from the features, and how to predict lambda.\n\nThe method is compared against DeMoN and other baselines with good results.\n\nI like the fact that the method is based on LM optimization, which is the standard method in 'geometric bundle adjustment', while related works consider Gauss-Newton-like optimization steps. The key was to include a network to predict lambda as well.\n\nHowever, I have several concerns:\n\n* the ablation study designed to compare with a Gauss-Newton-like approach does not seem correct. The image features learned with the proposed method are re-used in an approach using a fixed lambda. If I understand correctly, there are 2 things wrong with that:\n- for GN optimization, lambda should be set to 0 - not a constant value. Several constant values should also have been tried.\n- the image features should be re-trained for the GN framework:  Since the features are learned for the LM iteration, they are adapted to the use of the predicted lambda, but they are not necessarily suitable to GN optimization.\nThus, the advantage of using a LM optimization scheme is not very convincing.\n\nSince the LM-like approach is the main contribution, and the reported experiments do not show an advantage over GN-like approaches (already taken by previous work), this is my main reason for proposing rejection.\n\n* CodeSLAM (best paper at CVPR'18) is referenced but there is no comparison with it, while a comparison on the EuRoC dataset should be possible.\n\nLess critical concerns that still should be taken into account if the paper is accepted:\n\n- the state vector Chi is not defined for the proposed method, only for the standard bundle adjustment approach. If I understand correctly is made of the camera poses.\n\n- the name 'Bundle Adjustment' is actually not adapted to the proposed method.  'Bundle Adjustment' in 'geometric computer vision' comes from the optimization of several rays to intersect at the same 3D point, which is done by minimizing the reprojection errors. Here the objective function is based on image feature differences. I thus find the name misleading. The end of Section 3 also encourages the reader to think that the proposed method is based on the reprojection error. The proposed method is more about dense alignment for multiple images.\n\n\nMore minor points:\n\n1st paragraph:  Marquet -> Marquardt\ntitle of Section 3: revisitED\n1st paragraph of Section 3: audience -> reader\ncaption of Fig 1: extractS\nEq (2) cannot have Delta Chi on the two sides.

The authors focus on the Bundle Adjustment process. \n\nGiven several successive frames of a video sequence (2 frames but can be extended up to 5), BA-Net jointly estimates the depth of the first frame and the relative camera motion (between the first frame and the next one).\nThe method is based on a convolutional neural network which extracts the features of the different pyramid levels of the two images and in parallel computes the depth map of the first frame. The proposed network is based on the DRN-54 (Yu et al., 2017) as a feature extractor. \n\nThis is complemented by the linear combination of depth bases obtained from the first image.\nThe features and the initial depth then passed to the optimization layer called BA-layer where the feature re-projection error is minimized by the modified LM algorithm. \n\nThe authors adapt the standard multi-view geometry constraints by a new concept of feature re-projection error in the BA framework (BA-layer) which they made differentiable. \nDifferentiable optimization of camera motion and image depth via LM algorithm is now possible and can be used in various other DL architectures (ex. MVS-Net can probably benefit from BA-layer).\n\nThe authors also propose a novel depth parametrization in the form of linear combination of depth bases which reduces the number of parameters for the learning task, \nenables integration into the same backbone net as used or feature pyramids and makes it possible to jointly train the depth generator and the BA-layer. \n\nOriginally the proposed approach depicts the network operating in the two-view settings. The extensibility to more views is also possible and, as shown by authors, proved to improve performance. It is, however, limited by the GPU capacity. \n\nOverall, the authors came up with an interesting approach to the standard BA problem. They have managed to inject the multi-view geometry priors and BA into the DL architecture. \n\nMajor comments regarding the paper:\n\nIt would be interesting to know the evaluation times for the BA-net and more importantly to have some implementation details to ensure reproducibility.\n\nMinor comments regarding the paper:\n\n-\tThe spacing between sections is not consistent. \n-\tFigures 1 is way too abstract given the complicated set-up of the proposed architecture. It would be nice to see more details on the subnet for depth estimator and output of the net. \nOverall it would be helpful for reproducibility if authors can visualize all the layers of all the different parts of the network as it is commonly done in the DL papers.\n-\tTalking about proposed formulation of BA use either of the following and be consistent across the paper:\nFeaturemetric BA / Feature-metric BA / Featuremetric BA / \u2018Feature-metric BA\u2019\n-\tTalking about depth parametrization use \u2018basis\u2019 or \u2018bases\u2019 not both and clearly defined the meaning of this important notion.\n-\tAttention should be given to the notation in formulas (3) and (4). The projection function there is no longer accepts a 3D point parametrized by 3 variables. Instead only depth is provided. \nIn addition, the subindex \u20181\u2019 of the point \u2018q\u2019 is not explained. \n-\tMore attention should be given to the evaluation section. Specifically to the tables (1 and 2) with quantitative results showing the comparison to other methods. \nIt is not clear how the depth error is measured and it would be nicer to have the other errors explained exactly as they referred in the tables (e.g. ATE?).\n-\tHow the first camera pose is initialized?\n-\tIn Figure 2.b I\u2019m surprised by the difference obtained in the feature maps for images which seems very similar (only the lighting seems to be different). Is it three consecutive frames?\n-\tAttention should be given to the grammar, formatting in particular the bibliography. \n\n\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1217/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "BA-Net: Dense Bundle Adjustment Networks", "abstract": "This paper introduces a network architecture to solve the structure-from-motion (SfM) problem via feature-metric bundle adjustment (BA), which explicitly enforces multi-view geometry constraints in the form of feature-metric error.

Whole sequence reconstruction results:\nOur current implementation only allows up to 5 images in a single 2015 TITANX GPU with 12GB memories. This is because we implemented the whole pipeline using tensorflow in python, which is memory inefficient, especially during training. Each image takes about 2.3GB memory on average, and most of the memory is consumed by the CNN features and matrix operation. But it is straightforward to concatenate multiple 5-frame segments to reconstruct a complete sequence, which is demonstrated in the comparison with CodeSLAM in Figure 7 of the revised version.  It is also straightforward to implement our BA-Layer in CUDA directly to reduce the memory consumption of matrix operation and push the number of frames.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1217/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1217/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1217/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "BA-Net: Dense Bundle Adjustment Networks", "abstract": "This paper introduces a network architecture to solve the structure-from-motion (SfM) problem via feature-metric bundle adjustment (BA), which explicitly enforces multi-view geometry constraints in the form of feature-metric error.

But our contribution is beyond adopting Levenberg-Marquardt instead of Gauss-Newton. We would like to clarify several things to address the reviewer's concerns:\n\nQ1. The advantages of Levenberg-Marquardt over Gauss-Newton is unclear (the main reason for rejection):\n\nFirstly, we want to clarify that our contribution is beyond improving the Gauss-Newton optimization to Levenberg-Marquardt. More importantly, our contribution is the combination of conventional multi-view geometry (i.e. joint optimization of depth and camera poses) and end-to-end deep learning (I.e. depth basis generator learning and feature learning). This contribution is achieved by our differentiable LM optimization that allows end-to-end training. \n\nSecondly, we agree with the reviewer that comparing with the Gauss-Newton algorithm will be interesting and have updated such a comparison in Appendix B in the revised version according to the reviewer\u2019s suggestions: \n\n    1. We retrained the whole pipeline with Gauss-Newton, to make sure the features are learned specifically for Gauss-Newton.\n\n    2. We compared with various constant lambda values to see how the performance varies along with lambda. Note that we also fine-tune the network to make sure the features fit different lambda.   \n\nIn Table 4 of the revised version (Appendix B), our method outperforms the Gauss-Newton algorithm in the last column. This is because the objective function to be optimized is non-convex, and the vanilla Gauss-Newton method might get stuck at saddle point or local minimum. This is why the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is the standard choice for conventional bundle adjustment.\n\nIn Figure 6 of the revised version (Appendix B), our method also consistently performs better than different constant lambda values. This is because the value of lambda should be adapted to different data and optimization iterations. There is no \u2018optimal\u2019 constant lambda for all data and iterations.\n\n\nQ2.  Comparison with CodeSLAM:\nWe have included that in Figure 7 of the revised version (Appendix E). Since there is no public code for CodeSLAM, we cite its results directly from the CodeSLAM paper.\n\nQ3. The state vector Chi is not defined for the proposed method.\nThe Chi is defined in Section 3 as the vector containing all camera poses and point depths. Since our method also solves for these unknowns as in classic methods, we did not redefine the Chi. But in the revised version we have recapped the definition of Chi when introducing our method at the beginning of Section 4.\n\nQ4. Should the paper be called Bundle Adjustment?:\nThe term \u2018Bundle Adjustment\u2019 is originally used to refer to the joint optimization of 3D scene points and camera poses by minimizing the reprojection error. The keyword Bundle comes from the fact that a bundle of camera view rays pass through each of the 3D scene points. Multiple recent works, e.g. [Engel et al., 2017,Delaunoy and Pollefeys, 2014], have generalized it to \u201cphotometric BA\u201d where scene points and camera poses are optimized together by minimizing the photometric error. Our method is along this line. But we further improve the photometric error to featuremetric error. Each 3D scene point is still constrained by a bundle of camera view rays, though the error function has been changed. So we believe it is justified to call this method feature-metric BA. \n\nBut we agree with the reviewer that the word \u2018reprojection\u2019 is misleading when we introduce our feature-metric BA and the photometric BA. So we use the word \u2018align\u2019 as the reviewer suggested and use \u2018reprojection\u2019 only for the geometric BA.\n\nQ5. Is B the same for all scenes?:\nIn the revised version, We added Figure 8 to visualize of the term B in Equation 7 (Page 6) for different scenes. We can clearly see that it is scene dependent. \n\nQ6.Typos:\nWe have fixed all the typos as suggested in the revised version.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1217/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1217/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1217/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "BA-Net: Dense Bundle Adjustment Networks", "abstract": "This paper introduces a network architecture to solve the structure-from-motion (SfM) problem via feature-metric bundle adjustment (BA), which explicitly enforces multi-view geometry constraints in the form of feature-metric error.

We clarified this at the end of Section 4.3 in the revised version.\n\nQ6. Evaluation metrics are not clear:\nTo facilitate comparisons with other methods, we use the evaluation metrics in previous works in Table 1 and 2, so that we can cite the results of previous methods. As we described in the paper, the depth metric are the same as Eigen and Fergus (2015). The translation metrics(ATE) are the same as [Wang et al. 2018, Zhou et al. 2017]. In the revised version, we briefly introduce the definition of these metrics at the beginning of each paragraph in Section 5.2.\n\nQ7. Attention should be given to the notation in formulas (3) and (4):\nWe changed the parameters from \u2018d\u2019 to \u2018d \\cdot p\u2019 which is a 3D point. We also removed the redundant subindex \u20181\u2019, because all points \u2018q\u2019 are on the first frame.\n      \nQ8. Terminology consistency through the paper:\nThanks for the suggestion.

clear technical contribution and convincing results", "review": "This paper presents a novel approach to bundle adjustment, where traditional geometric optimization is paired with deep learning.\nSpecifically, a CNN computes both a multi-scale feature pyramid and a depth prediction, expressed as a linear combination of \"depth bases\".\nThese values are used to define a dense re-projection error over the images, akin to that of dense or semi-dense methods.\nThen, this error is optimized with respect to the camera parameters and depth linear combination coefficients using Levenberg-Marquardt (LM).\nBy unrolling 5 iterations of LM and expressing the dampening parameter lambda as the output of a MLP, the optimization process is made differentiable, allowing back-propagation and thus learning of the networks' parameters.\n\nThe paper is clear, well organized, well written and easy to follow.\nEven if the idea of joining BA / SfM and deep learning is not new, the authors propose an interesting novel formulation.\nIn particular, being able to train the CNN with a supervision signal coming directly from the same geometric optimization process that will be used at test time allows it to produce features that  will make the optimization smoother and the convergence easier.\nThe experiments are quite convincing and seem to clearly support the efficacy of the proposed method.\n\nI don't really have any major criticism, but I would like to hear the authors' opinions on the following two points:\n\n1) In page 5, the authors write \"learns to predict a better damping factor lambda, which gaurantees that the optimziation will converged to a better solution within limited iterations\".\nI don't really understand how learning lambda would _guarantee_ that the optimization will converge to a better solution.\nThe word \"guarantee\" usually implies that the effect can be somehow mathematically proved, which is not done in the paper.\n\n2) As far as I can understand, once the networks are learned, possibly on pairs of images due to GPU memory limitations, the proposed approach can be easily applied to sets of images of any size, as the features and depth predictions can be pre-computed and stored in main system memory.\nGiven this, I wonder why all experiments are conducted on sets of two to five images, even for Kitti where standard evaluation protocols would demand predicting entire sequences.", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that
