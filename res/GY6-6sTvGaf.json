The authors propose to average both the Q function and its target over multiple image transformations. The experiments on DeepMind control suite and Atari 100k benchmark show that their method outperforms previous model-free, model-based and contrastive learning approaches.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nPros: \n \n1. This paper tackles a valuable problem of improving RL by data augmentation. It will have a broad impact on the area of both representation learning and reinforcement learning.  \n\n2. The idea of averaging both the Q function and its target over multiple image transformations is interesting and promising. This approach is easy to use and can be combined with any model-free RL algorithm.\n \n3. The paper is well written and the results section is well structured. They outperform baseline methods on two popular benchmarks and conduct ablation studies to verify the contribution of each component.\n \n##########################################################################\n\nCons: \n \n1. The proposed idea is very similar to RAD, a concurrent work by Laskin et al. The performance is also similar between these two approaches. More discussions and comparisons will help the readers better understand the difference.\n\n2. They claim data augmentation is all you need. To support this strong claim. I think the authors should conduct more experiments on more base algorithms. Can we get the same conclusion if we add the data augmentation techniques to other model-free RL algorithms (e.g., PPO or TD3) or a model-based RL algorithm (e.g., PlaNet or Dreamer)?\n\n##########################################################################\n\nTaken both pros and cons in to consideration, I vote for an acceptance because of the novelty of the proposed idea and large-scale comparisons to previous model-free, model-based and contrastive approaches. However, the experiments in the paper are not sufficient to support their claims \u201cdata augmentation is all you need\u201d and I do suggest the authors to include more experiments to make it clear.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1429/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1429/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Image Augmentation Is All You Need: Regularizing Deep Reinforcement Learning from Pixels", "authorids": ["~Denis_Yarats1", "~Ilya_Kostrikov1", "~Rob_Fergus1"], "authors": ["Denis Yarats", "Ilya Kostrikov", "Rob Fergus"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "We propose a simple data augmentation technique that can be applied to standard model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, enabling robust learning directly from pixels without the need for auxiliary losses or pre-training.

For example, DrQ[K=1,M=1] incurs only negligible computational cost that is proportional to image augmentation itself and minor compared to the cost of the entire training. DrQ[K=2,M=2] is twice as slow as DrQ[K=1,M=1], but it is still 5-10x faster than Dreamer or PlaNet (because they learn a multistep model), and about the same as CURL and SAC-AE (because they have an additional auxiliary loss).\n\n#2\nQ: How much augmentation is good? Etc.\n\nA: In RL one has to be careful with data augmentation, and only use those that don\u2019t change the underlying MDP of the task (e.g. reward function, observational function, or transition probability), there are no such limitations in CV. To this end, we formulate the notion of optimality invariant image transformations in Section 3.2, which allows us to qualify only a few data augmentations from the set of canonical augmentations in CV.\n\n#3\nQ: Overall, the paper is well written and explain various things but the algo-1 needs explanation of all parameters. For example, \\math{D} (reader has to think that it's a replay buffer), \\math{u(T)} is not at all clear. Many notation are not explained even in text and needs a clear explanation for reader from RL and non-RL domain.\n\nA: Thank you, we will add additional clarification.\n\n#4\nQ: The primary claim of the paper is that image augmentation improves the performance. Sec5.1 shows significant improvement when image augmentation is used with different methods but it is very strange to see the improvement is just by adding 4 pixels on image boundary. Is there implication when we do more augmentation by increasing the size of random shift? How does the augmented image compare visually to the original image? The figure-6 in appendix shows all the results but which one is the random shift?\n\nA: 4 pixels are added to the image boundary only to perform a valid random cut. Empirically, we found that 4 performs the best compared to larger shifts (those lead to parts of the anget disappearing from an observation) and smaller shifts (providing very little randomization). A randomly shifted by 4 pixels observation looks pretty much identical to the original observation, the only difference is that the agent is shifted a bit into a random direction. In Figure 6 the blue line (Random Shift) corresponds to performing the 4 pixels random shift augmentation, which serves as our primary image augmentation throughout the paper.\n\n#5\nQ: In figure4, the SAC state is significantly better than the DrQ and no explanation is provided. Why one should not used SAC compared to DrQ?\n\nA: DrQ is concerned with learning to control from *image pixels* as input. SAC State has access to privileged information, such as internal states of the system, which perfectly explains the underlying MDP. As such it represents an upper-bound on performance achievable when learning from pixels. In virtually all practical settings (e.g. robotics), internal state information is not available and a learning algorithm can only rely on high-dimensional image observations of the environment, which makes learning considerably harder. Note that vanilla SAC from pixels fails in many cases (see Figure 1). We will further clarify this in the camera ready.\n\n#6\nQ: Paper claims that the proposed method can work with any model-free RL algorithm. Any justification or experiments to support the claim? If not, the contribution needs a re-writing.\n\nA: After the first draft of our work was made available on arxiv and before the current version was submitted to ICLR, we noticed many researchers from various groups adopted our data augmentation techniques in their work. Specifically, inspired by our work our data augmentation technique was combined with PPO (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12862.pdf) and Dreamer (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14535.pdf). For these reasons, we decided to omit this experiment in our submission as follow up literature comprehensively studies this question. To summarize, we now have strong empirical evidence that data augmentation is beneficial in image-based RL across four of the most widely adopted RL algorithms (SAC, DQN, PPO, Dreamer). We will reference and discuss these methods in the next revision of our work. \n\n\nIn the light of these clarifications we would appreciate it if the reviewer confirmed that all their concerns had been addressed and, if so, reconsider their assessment.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1429/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1429/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Image Augmentation Is All You Need: Regularizing Deep Reinforcement Learning from Pixels", "authorids": ["~Denis_Yarats1", "~Ilya_Kostrikov1", "~Rob_Fergus1"], "authors": ["Denis Yarats", "Ilya Kostrikov", "Rob Fergus"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "We propose a simple data augmentation technique that can be applied to standard model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, enabling robust learning directly from pixels without the need for auxiliary losses or pre-training.

For example, \\math{D} (reader has to think that it's a replay buffer), \\math{u(T)} is not at all clear. Many notation are not explained even in text and needs a clear explanation for reader from RL and non-RL domain. \n\n- The primary claim of the paper is that image augmentation improves the performance. Sec5.1 shows significant improvement when image augmentation is used with different methods but it is very strange to see the improvement is just by adding 4 pixels on image boundary. Is there implication when we do more augmentation by increasing the size of random shift? How does the augmented image compare visually to the original image? The figure-6 in appendix shows all the results but which one is the random shift? \n\n- In figure4, the SAC state is significantly better than the DrQ and no explanation is provided. Why one should not used SAC compared to DrQ?\n\n- Paper claims that the proposed method can work with any model-free RL algorithm. Any justification or experiments to support the claim?

It defines a notion of optimality invariant state transformation which preserves the Q function. An example of such transformations can be random image translations. It uses these transformations to (i) transform the input images, (ii) average the target Q values, and (iii) average the Q function themselves. Using this simple technique, they are able to get SOTA on DM control tasks and Atari 100k benchmark. On DM control tasks, it\u2019s able to outperform SAC trained on state representations. Additionally, the paper provides ablation studies on different image transformations and robustness analysis with respect to hyperparameter settings.\n\nNovelty: While data augmentation techniques are common in computer vision, this was the first work (concurrently with RAD) to apply the technique in the context of reinforcement learning.\n\nReasons for score: Overall, I vote for accepting. The reasons are as follows. (i) It\u2019s a simple technique which can be used with any RL algorithm to improve the performance of the algorithm (ii) Good and detailed evaluation  (iii) additional ablation studies and robustness analysis present\n\nQuestions: Will using different random image transformations in sequence help?
