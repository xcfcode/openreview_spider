The ablation studies and improved evaluation of the IAN model help to the make clear the relative contributions of the proposed MDC and orthogonal regularization. Though the paper is much improved, in my opinion there is still too much emphasis on the photo-editing interface. In addition, the MDC blocks are used in the generator of the model but their efficacy is measured via discriminative experiments. All-in-all I am updating my score to a 5.\n\n==========\n\nThis paper proposes a hybridization of a VAE and a GAN whereby the generator both generates random samples and produces reconstructions of the real data, and the discriminator attempts to classify each true data point, sample, and reconstruction as being real, fake, or reconstructed. It also proposes a user-facing interface with an interactive image editing algorithm along with various modifications to standard generative modeling architectures.\n\nPros:\n+ The IAN model itself is interesting as standard GAN-based approaches do not simultaneously train an autoencoder.\n\nCons:\n- The writing is unclear at times and the mathematical formulation of the IAN is not very precise.\n- Many different ideas are proposed in the paper without sufficient empirical validation to characterize their individual contributions.\n- The photo editing interface, though interesting, is probably better suited for a conference with more of an HCI focus.\n\n* Section 2: The gradient descent step procedure seems to be quite similar to the approach proposed by [2]. More elaboration on the differences would be helpful.\n* Section 3: It is unclear whether the discriminator has three binary outputs or if there is a softmax over the three possible labels. The paper does not mention whether L_G and L_D are minimized or maximized. Presumably they are both minimized, but in that case it is counter-intuitive that the generator attempts to decrease the probability that the discriminator assigns the \"real\" label to the generated samples and reconstructions. In addition, in the minimization scenario L_D maximizes the probability of the correct labels being assigned to X_gen and \\hat{X} but minimizes the probability of the \"real\" label being assigned to X.\n* Section 3.2: It is odd that not training MADE leads to better performance, as training MADE should lead to a better variational approximation to the true posterior. More exploration seems warranted here.\n* Section 3.3.2: One drawback of autoregressive approaches is that sampling is slow. How do you reconcile this with its use in an interactive application, where speed is important?\n* Figure 7: The Inception score is typically expressed as an exponentiated KL-divergence. It is odd that the scores are being presented here as percents.\n* Section 4.1: The Inception score's direct application to non-natural images is indeed problematic. One potential workaround is to compute exponentiated KL for a discriminative net trained specifically for the dataset, e.g. to predict binary attributes on CelebA. \n\nOverall, the paper attempts to simultaneously do too many things. It could be made much stronger by focusing on the primary contribution, the IAN, and performing a comparison against similar approaches such as [1]. The other techniques, such as IAF with randomized MADE, MDC blocks, and orthogonal regularization are potentially interesting in their own right but the current results are not conclusive as to their specific benefits.\n\n[1] Larsen, Anders Boesen Lindbo, S\u00f8ren Kaae S\u00f8nderby, and Ole Winther. \"Autoencoding beyond pixels using a learned similarity metric.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.09300 (2015).\n[2] J.-Y.

Therefore I raise my rating. Still, the paper could use polishing. If written in a better way, it would be a definite accept in my opinion.\n\n---------\nInitial review:\n\nThe paper presents a tool for exploring latent spaces of generative models, and \"introspective adversarial network\" model - a new hybrid of a generative adversarial network (GAN) and a variational autoencoder (VAE). On the plus side, the presented tool is interesting and may be useful for analysis of generative models, and the proposed architecture seems to perform well. On the downside, experimental evaluation does not allow for confident conclusions, and a recent closely related work by Zhu et al. [1] is not discussed in enough detail. Overall, I am in the borderline mode, and may change my opinion depending on how the discussion phase goes. \n\nDetailed comments:\n\n1) The presented model combines elements of a large number of existing techniques: GAN, VAE, VAE/GAN (Lamb et al. 2016), inverse autoregressive flow (IAF), PixelRNN, ResNet, dilated convolutions. In addition, the authors propose new modifications: orthogonal regularization (inspired by Saxe et al.), ternary discriminator in a GAN. This makes the overall architecture complicated. An extensive ablation study could allow to judge about the effect of different components, but the ablation study presented in the paper is somewhat restricted. What do we learn from the proposed architecture? Can other researchers gain any new insights? What is important, what is not? Answering these question would significantly raise the potential impact of this paper.\n\n2) Related to the previous point, proper analysis requires adequate measures of performance. Qualitative results are nice, but with the current surge of interest in generative models it gets very difficult to rely on qualitative evaluations: many methods produce visually similar results, and unless there is an obvious large jump in the quality of the produced images, it is unclear how to compare these. I do appreciate the effort authors have already put into evaluating the model: especially the keypoint error is interesting. Unfortunately, none of the presented measures evaluates visual quality of the images. A user study would be useful - I realize it is additional effort, but what is so restrictively difficult about it? Perhaps not with AMT, but with some fellow researchers/students.\n\n3) Work [1] looks very related to the proposed visualization tool and deserves a more thorough discussion than a single sentence in the related work section. The paper by Zhu et al. appeared on arxiv more than 1,5 months before the ICLR deadline, and, more importantly, it has been published at ECCV before the ICLR deadline. This is unfortunate for the authors, but I think this makes the paper count as prior work, not concurrent. In the end this is up to ACs and PCs to decide. Anyway, I strongly suggest the authors to add a detailed discussion of differences of the two approaches, their capabilities, strengths and weaknesses. The authors could also try to directly compare to the approach of Zhu et al. or explain why it is impossible.\n\n4) May be a good idea to extend Appendix A with more approaches (VAE and DCGAN are not state of the art, are they? why not show at least VAE/GAN?) and more datasets. If this is not possible, please explain why. Samples of faces from IAN do look very impressive, but a fair comparison with SOTA would strengthen your point. By the way, I assume the samples are random, not cherry-picked? Please mention it in the paper. \n\n5) The analysis capabilities of the proposed tool are not fully explored. What does it teach us about generative models? Does it work on non-face datasets? Overall, it seems that since the paper includes two largely disjoint contributions (a tool and a generative model), none of the two gets analyzed in depth, which makes the paper look somewhat incomplete.  \n\nSmall remarks:\n\n1) Why not include 8% result of IAN on SVHN into the table? It is easy to miss otherwise. From the table it is absolutely unclear that some of the results are not comparable. The table should be more self-explanatory.\n\n[1] Zhu et al., \"Generative Visual Manipulation on the Natural Image Manifold\", ECCV 2016, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03552v2.pdf\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Photo Editing with Introspective Adversarial Networks", "abstract": "The increasingly photorealistic sample quality of generative image models suggests their feasibility in applications beyond image generation.

The Inception score has been found to correlate well with human perception (and we find that to be the case here as well, with a significant difference between our baseline VAE/GAN model and our most performant IAN model).

Zhu et al is a contemporaneous and independently developed work (released within a few days of ours) with several key differences:\n\n-They train an inference network separately (rather than jointly) and use its predicted latent values as initial values which they then iterate to optimize the L2 reconstruction loss, while we take a one-shot reconstruction using the inferred latents.\n\n-User inputs are taken as constraints which are used to solve for latent changes via multiple optimization steps after the user provides input, while we update our images in real time as the user paints. \n\n-Changes to output images are transferred to original images via a color and flow estimation, as opposed to the pixel-wise masking which we use to directly transfer edits between images. (They specifically cite the difficulty of directly transferring pixel-wise edits, which we also found to be true, hence the introduction of the masked interpolation).\n\n-The domain focus of their work also differs, in that they focus more on editing clothing articles and landscape images, while we focus on faces. \n\nWe\u2019ve updated the paper to include a reference to this work, as well as to the Neural Doodle (interactive style transfer) work of Champanard.\n\n\n2. We acknowledge that a lack of more quantitative evaluations is frustrating; as to the mentioned methods:\n\n-We lack the resources to engage human annotators for this particular task.\n\n-The Inception score proposed in Improved-GAN requires a pre-trained model from the same domain, which in our opinion only really provides insight into our ImageNet samples, a minor focus of our work. We tested our four CelebA models compared in Figure 7 using the Inception score evaluator provided in the Improved-GAN source code and noticed relatively little difference between them (as compared to the difference in Inception scores reported by Salimans et al for CIFAR samples in Improved-GAN). \n\nWe suspect that this is because the model used for evaluation is trained on Imagenet, rather than on a faces dataset, but we have included this score (along with L2 and L1 reconstruction scores on the CelebA validation set) in Figure 7. Evaluating the inception score using an appropriately trained classifier might provide more insight, but the only public CelebA classifier we\u2019re aware of is that of Lamb et al (https://github.com/vdumoulin/discgen), which is only provided as an architecture (no weights).\n\n-The Inception Accuracy proposed in Auxiliary Classifier GANs is not applicable as it assumes class-conditional generation, whereas our models are trained in a wholly unsupervised setting (i.e. without attribute or class labels).\n\n3. We initially omitted such comparisons for brevity, but the consensus appears to be that this would be a worthwhile addition, so we\u2019ve updated the paper to include an appendix with a comparison of samples between a VAE, DCGAN, and IAN with identical architectures trained on celebA. If the reviewers believe additional comparisons would be pertinent (i.e. to ALI/BiGAN or DiscGen) we can include those as well. \n\nWe considered adding reconstruction comparisons to ALI in particular, but opted not to as (a) the images provided in the ALI paper are compressed and (b) we felt that a fair comparison would involve comparing reconstructions to the same set of original images, but again lacked access to publicly available weights for their model, and were unable to determine exactly which indices from the validation or test set were selected for reconstruction.\n\nThanks,\n\nAndy\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Photo Editing with Introspective Adversarial Networks", "abstract": "The increasingly photorealistic sample quality of generative image models suggests their feasibility in applications beyond image generation.
