We appreciate that you mention many deep metric learning methods can benefit from our proposed SVMax regularizer.\n\n**Regarding experimental results.**  For fair comparisons, we did not tune our hyperparameters to a particular ranking loss. Thus, the 2.3% lag (50-47.7) is expected. SOTA results are generally achieved by tuning hyperparameters (lr, # iterations) for a particular ranking loss on a particular architecture. The best hyperparameters for angular loss achieve inferior performance on contrastive loss. The embedding dimension is another important hyperparameter. We opted to implement our baselines, choose learning rates uniformly [0.01, 0.001, 0.0001], and use default settings (e.g., margin) whenever possible.\n\n**Instance retrieval dataset.** The datasets present in our paper (CUB, Cars196, and Stanford Online Products) are the standard datasets in the community of metric learning and learning embeddings (please refer to [MLRC]). The Image Retrieval dataset recommended by you is an **instance retrieval** dataset, suited more for evaluating image descriptors, local geometric features, and geometric matching. To the best of our knowledge, no recent works on learning better embeddings evaluate on **instance retrieval** benchmarks.\n\n[MLRC] Musgrave, Belongie, Lim.

We are glad that you found our approach systematic and that it shows promising results.\n\n**Setting $\\lambda$.**  We did attempt to address this in the paper on page 6. Specifically, we found that a larger $\\lambda = 2$ was needed to cope with the larger angular loss range. Additionally, when triplet loss is zero $\\lambda = 1$ dominates training and we found that reducing $\\lambda$ to $0.1$ solves this issue.\n\n**Comparing results between learning rates.**  Our experiments show that your claim is not consistently true. For instance, we significantly outperform spread-out on Contrastive and N-Pair losses in Table 2. As we stated in the paper, larger learning rates tend to induce model collapse. While SVMax appears to mitigate that effect, we suspect that this is the reason for the slight drop in accuracy as we increase learning rate. However, our results seem to show that we are much more robust to this drop than existing methods.\n\n**Baseline principal components.**  t-SNE visualizations did not provide clear insights, but we\u2019ll explore the reason behind lower baseline performance further.\n\n**Singular value computation.**  This information is not in the main paper, but we did include it in section B2 of our appendix (pages 6 and 7). Specifically, we use the TensorFlow built-in function `tf.linalg.svd` to compute the mean singular value. We calculate this for each mini-batch. We did not notice a significant overhead.

We took particular care to analyze the mean singular value bounds and appreciate that you recognize this as our strength.\n\n**Mathematical analysis / SVMax analysis.**  Can you be more specific about what mathematical analysis and proofs are missing and will add to the exposition?  We believe that we\u2019ve made a strong case for our regularizer and have provided adequate theory, intuition, and empirical results. But we will happily oblige if there are glaring omissions.\n\n**Other methods to spread embeddings.**  Certainly, developing other methods to spread out the embedding space is a fruitful research avenue. In this work, we argue that maximizing the mean singular value is a simple and effective way to accomplish this. We believe that by bringing attention to this problem and by proposing a simple and effective solution provides a benefit to the community. To your particular suggestion of maximizing the maximum singular value: this would, in fact, condense the embedding space and not spread it out.\n\n**Loss bounds.**  Coupling the bounds on the ranking losses with Equation 4 allows us to interpret the balancing hyperparameter, $\\lambda$, as the proportional trade off between the ranking loss and the regularizer. Additionally, these loss bounds show that the loss will never get \u2018too big\u2019 and dominate the regularizer.\n\n**Other tasks.**  We agree that additional tasks would further support SVMax.

At that time, reviewers and AC have some good points but are not yet addressed (I have compared the two submissions carefully). \n\nThis paper proposes a Feature Embedding Regularizer (named SVMax) to regularize feature embedding during the CNN learning process. The idea is to push the distribution of high-dim feature embeddings to be a uniform distribution across the embedding space.

For example:\n\nRevisiting Oxford and Paris: Large-Scale Image Retrieval Benchmarking\n\nThe reason is that for this broader image retrieval task, the original feature embeddings may have been well-distributed across the embedding space, rather than shrunk to a limit embedding space for the fine-grain datasets.\n\nI think the above experiment needs to be done if we want to draw the conclusion that SVMax regularizer really works for deep metric learning methods.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper196/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper196/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SVMax: A Feature Embedding Regularizer", "authorids": ["~Ahmed_Taha1", "~Alex_Hanson1", "~Abhinav_Shrivastava2", "~Larry_S._Davis1"], "authors": ["Ahmed Taha", "Alex Hanson", "Abhinav Shrivastava", "Larry S.

The proposed regularizer, maximizes the mean singular value of the feature matrix per batch, leading to a uniform spread of features. This enables learning with larger learning rates without the risk of model collapse. Authors derive lower and upper bounds for the proposed singular values loss, as well as popular ranking losses used in recent studies, eg. triplet loss and pairwise loss. These bounds help to tune the mixing parameter of network\u2019s loss and the singular value loss.\n\nPros:\n\n1- The paper considers a crucial problem of learning with neural networks, ie. model collapse. The approach is systematic and shows promising results for learning with large learning rates, while a model without regularization fails to perform well.\n\n2- Authors derive lower and upper bounds for the proposed singular value loss, as well as well-known ranking losses in the literature. \n\n\nCons or comments:\n\n1- Even though there is a guide to choose parameter $\\lambda$ using the bounds on losses, authors use a fixed value in the experimental setup. In case that this value is according to the bounds for the particular setting, it would be nice that authors mention it.\n\n2- The proposed regularizer is particularly useful with a larger learning rate. Then, one expects that less number of epochs would be enough to converge to a good state of network. It seems that the number of epochs in the retrieval experiments is the same across methods. If SVMax with lr=0.01 and spread-out with lr=0.0001 use the same number of epochs, there will be not much gain using SVMax.\n\n3- Model collapse may appear in different modes, eg. unrolled GAN paper discusses these modes for GANs. It would be nice if authors investigate how the model collapse happens. For example in Table 1, lr=0.01, contrastive loss, vanilla and spread-out show very poor performance. One can investigate the principal components of the batch embeddings.\n\n4- Authors did not mention how they exactly incorporate the mean singular value into the loss. Is the exact value computed for each mini-batch? Or an estimation would be considered? How much computation overhead does the mean singular value loss add?\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper196/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper196/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SVMax: A Feature Embedding Regularizer", "authorids": ["~Ahmed_Taha1", "~Alex_Hanson1", "~Abhinav_Shrivastava2", "~Larry_S._Davis1"], "authors": ["Ahmed Taha", "Alex Hanson", "Abhinav Shrivastava", "Larry S.

The singular value decomposition of network activation is used to regularize the embedding space with unit circle embedding assumptions. In addition, a mathematical analysis of the mean singular value boundary is provided to reduce hyperparameter tuning. The authors evaluate the proposed method for the retrieval tasks and generative adversarial networks.\n\nThe idea looks promising in that it is simple and easy to use. However, the paper is a bit confusing and lacks clarity. I hope that the motivation for the introduction of the algorithm, analysis, and comparison experiments will be revealed well with care. A major revision of the work is needed.\n\nPros:\n+ By introducing a simple method, it leads to good performance within the experimental work.\n+ The flow of converting the former regularizer expression by mathematically analyzing the lower and upper bounds of the mean singular value is clear and well.\n+ It is impressive that the corner cases of the proposed algorithm are written in the supplementary material. I agree that the corner case will not really happen.\n\nCons:\n- Insufficient motivation. It seems not enough to simply apply singular value decomposition to the regularizer. In addition to the good results of the experiment, it is necessary to add more mathematical analysis, proof, etc. to see what this regularizer makes good.\n- Is it best for model collapse mitigation or large learning rate activation to be seen only as experimental results? Hopefully, there is something in this part that can analyze why SVMax is possible.\n- Why maximize mean singular value? Is maximizing the mean singular value the only way to spread out deep network embeddings? Can't maximize the min or max of singular values? It would be great if any comparison or analysis of this was supplemented.\n- I'm confused about how the lower and upper bounds of loss functions are used and why they are in the paper.\n- I would like to have various experimental results. In addition to the retrieval task, it would be nice if there was an experiment result from a classification task. Or, for example, it is better to experiment with local patch descriptors evaluated in your baseline algorithm paper.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper196/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper196/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SVMax: A Feature Embedding Regularizer", "authorids": ["~Ahmed_Taha1", "~Alex_Hanson1", "~Abhinav_Shrivastava2", "~Larry_S._Davis1"], "authors": ["Ahmed Taha", "Alex Hanson", "Abhinav Shrivastava", "Larry S.

In this paper, we penalize inferior network activations -- feature embeddings -- which in turn regularize the network's weights implicitly. We propose singular value maximization (SVMax) to learn a uniform feature embedding. The SVMax regularizer integrates seamlessly with both supervised and unsupervised learning. During training, our formulation mitigates model collapse and enables larger learning rates. Thus, our formulation converges in fewer epochs, which reduces the training computational cost. We evaluate the SVMax regularizer using both retrieval and generative adversarial networks. We leverage a synthetic mixture of Gaussians dataset to evaluate SVMax in an unsupervised setting. For retrieval networks, SVMax achieves significant improvement margins across various ranking losses.", "one-sentence_summary": "We propose singular value maximization (SVMax) as a feature embedding regularizer.
