It is important to stress that, for many layers (especially for later \u201cthicker\u201d layers), the cost is often dominated by the latter component rather than the former. Thus, storing sparse matrices reduces memory requirement during inference time. Furthermore, it can also significantly reduce memory needed to store trained models.\nSecond, while memory write access can be expensive, in matrix multiplication, vast majority of the time is spent accumulating the result rather than saving it to memory. That\u2019s why in general matrix multiplication is much slower than addition. In this case, each output value requires kernel_size * num_input_channels computations plus memory/input access for all the weights, and sparse convolutions require a comparable number of memory access to their corresponding reduced-depth dense convolutions (which could be much smaller than what the full dense convolutional operator would require).\n\nRegarding the gains, we wholeheartedly agree that gains on modern GPUs still need to be realized. However, given the amount of engineering effort invested in implementation of highly efficient CUDA convolution operators, matching it will require a similar effort. Nevertheless, we believe that results like ours help guide the future hardware and software decisions about neural networks. We also note that the story is different in embedded applications where CUDA does not exist yet, but this is beyond the scope of the paper.\n\nWhile incremental training gives no better accuracy than training the full network from the beginning, it is very likely that incremental training will be more efficient.

Responses inline:\n\n1) In general in our experiments we found that dropping connections or channels, as part of gradient descent performed slightly _worse_ than naive multiplier method (where each layer is just trimmed down by a constant fraction), even though the result at first glance looked great. We did not pursue this approach further. We find that breaking symmetry argument (see discussion in the paper, and also LeCun's paper linked in the comments) for densification over time, to be compelling justification why densification over time leads to better results. \n\nAnother point is that densification over time leads to speed-up of training (start with smaller model first and arrive at your target), where as sparsification would lead to slowing it down. (you start with bigger model than you need and then trim it down)\n\n2) The connections are activated once and for all, there is no \"zero sparsity during test time\". Test time is just as sparse (and fixed the same way) as  train time, this is a key difference with a Dropconnect method, where drop connect is used for improving training properties.\n\n3) This is a good question, as described in the paper our current schedule is uniform with a fixed coefficient. E.g. for coefficient alpha, we keep alpha \\times input connections per each output. Alpha is the same throughout the graph. It is an open question what is the \"optimal schedule\"\n\n4) In our implementation, computation graph always contains the full weight matrix, which is monotonously trimmed up-to the  density  alpha, alpha is just a scalar tensor that 1) either slowly increases during training for incremental training of full models or 2) stays constant for sparse model. Memory requirement for weight matrix@training time is typically not a constraint. Dynamic size tensors, might be an option when software stack starts supporting them.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Power of Sparsity in Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "Deep convolutional networks are well-known for their high computational and memory demands.

You are absolutely right that any architecture from last 10 years makes it prohibitively expensive to do random memory access. However we don't use sparse matrices, we only introduce sparsity from channel to channel. Thus, we can use all the benefits of caching becuase the basic operation (convolve image plane with k \\times k filter) is unchanged. \n\nIn other words, if naive implementation of dense convolution looks like this:\n\nfor i in input_channel\n  for o in output_channel\n    # this oepration is the expensive one since it has to go over entire image\n    result[o] += convolve(input[i]  w[i, o, ...])\n\nsimilar sparse convolution will look like this: \n\nfor i in input_channel\n  for index, o, in enumerate(output_channels_connected_to_i)\n    # this oepration is expensive  since it has to go over entire image\n    result[o] += convolve(input[i]  w[i, index, ...])\n\nin this implementation setup, the speed up will be mostly in terms of madds, since the basic operation (convoving *entire* image plane) is unchanged. We will include this in the updated version of the paper\n\nTo answer your question we do not have optimized version of sparse convolutions yet, and Cudnn implementation of dense convolutions is very fast (yet not publicly available) (e.g. X00% faster than reference GPU implementation)  so we can not report any speed up compared to that.
