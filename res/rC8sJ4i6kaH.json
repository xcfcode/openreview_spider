Responses to specific questions below:\n\n--- \u201coptimization objective of (4.1)? How may one implement this in practice? Or, how is this analogous to what is being done in practice?\u201d\n\nBoth the two sums in the objective (4.1) are weighted combinations of two quantities: the input consistency regularizer, $R_B(G)$, and how well the classifier fits the pseudolabels, $L_{0-1}(G, G_{pl})$. (Note that the other quantity, $Err(G_{pl})$, doesn\u2019t depend on the learned classifier, so it can be regarded as constant.) A practical implementation could be just linearly combining the input consistency regularizer and the pseudolabel loss with a tuning coefficient. This is closely related to recently successful self-training objectives which rely heavily on input consistency regularization [1, 2, 3]. For example, the FixMatch algorithm [2] uses strong data augmentation for the input consistency regularizer and also optimizes cross-entropy loss on the pseudolabels. \n\n--- \u201cCan you comment on the realism of Assumption 4.1? Is it possible to verify this on toy examples as you have done with the assumptions in Section 3?\u201d\n\nThanks for the suggestion. Assumption 4.1 requires an expansion coefficient c > 5. For the toy distributions in Section 3, this can be achieved by increasing the $\\ell_2$ radius in the definition of neighborhood; a constant factor increase would suffice. For example, in Example 3.4 for the Gaussian setting, we define the transformation set $B(x) = ${ $x\u2019 : \\|x\u2019 - x\\| \\le \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{d}}$}. If we increase this radius to $\\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{d}}$, under this new definition of neighborhood the distribution would satisfy (0.16, 6)-expansion. The same reasoning applies for Example 3.5 --- using radius of $\\frac{3\\kappa}{2\\sqrt{d}}$ would also give (0.16, 6)-expansion. \n\nWe also note that Definition A.3 provides a relaxation of Assumption 4.1 which has a looser requirement on c (which is roughly similar to c > 2) and only requires expansion for subsets of mis-pseudolabeled examples.\n\n--- \u201cCan you comment on obtaining a finite sample version of Theorem 4.3?\u201d\n\nOur finite sample version of Theorem 4.3 is provided in Theorem C.2 in Section C. To obtain Theorem C.2, we note that there are two population expectations which require generalization in the objective (4.1): the input consistency regularizer and the 0-1 loss on the pseudolabels. Theorems 3.7 and C.3 provide generalization bounds for these quantities which are polynomial in the weight norms and inverse margin on the training set.

In Examples 3.4 and 3.5, we provide more quantitative guarantees by studying expansion for Gaussian distributions and Lipschitz transformations of Gaussians. For these distributions, the distance between typical points is on the order of 1, and as long as the $\\ell_2$ neighborhood radius is $\\Omega(1/\\sqrt{d})$, it\u2019s sufficient to achieve c = 3, so that the factor c/(c - 1)=1.5 in the unsupervised learning setting (Theorem 3.6) is small. We also note that we can increase the radius in the definition of neighborhood to achieve larger values of c, which may explain why stronger data augmentation (corresponding to larger neighborhoods) leads to better performance.\n\nRegarding finding c on real datasets: as also noted by Reviewer 2, rigorously computing c for real datasets is challenging if not impossible. The main difficulty stems from the fact that expansion is a property about the population data which the empirical distribution does not possess. It\u2019s infeasible to check the exact expansion property of the population distribution (which we don\u2019t have access to) for all subsets (which we cannot enumerate exhaustively). \n\nThough we can\u2019t find c for *all* subsets, we can verify that c is large for particular subsets. In Section D, we compare the probability of the set of incorrectly pseudolabeled BigGAN images to the probability of the neighborhood of this set. We do so because our proof for semi-supervised learning only requires expansion of subsets of incorrectly pseudolabeled examples, with roughly a coefficient of c > 2. (See the condition of Theorem A.4 of Section A, which is a weaker condition than what is stated in the main body of the paper. In the main body we state the stronger assumption for simplicity of exposition.) When using an $\\ell_2$ ball with radius 19.8 as the neighborhood (which corresponds to modifying each pixel by 0.024 on average out of the range [0,1]), we found an expansion coefficient c > 3, which suggests good expansion. (Concretely, the set of incorrectly pseudolabeled examples has 6% of the mass, whereas its neighbor has 20% probability mass.)

Answers to specific points are below:\n\n--- \u201cthe population-based loss in Eq. (3.4) is not used in practice, since the loss is on expectation and is relatively complex.\u201d\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that the loss analyzed is not the exact one used in practice. However, the objective in (3.4) is quite similar to BYOL, one of the state-of-the-art unsupervised representation learning algorithms, in the sense that both (3.4) and BYOL encourage input consistency as the central component of the objective. Input consistency is also a key concept in SimCLR and MoCoV2, another two SOTA unsupervised learning methods. It is an interesting direction for future work to develop more practical algorithms inspired by objective (3.4). We would also like to mention that the objective (4.1) is essentially a linear combination of the pseudolabel loss and the input consistency loss (because the third term $Err(G_{pl})$ is a constant), and it captures the essence of the objective functions used in practice in semi-supervised learning [1, 2]. \n\n--- \u201cthe loss is on expectation\u201d, \u201cwhen the network is large, then sampling data to estimate E_p[1(G(x)=y)] and R_B(G) is of the high cost\u201d\n\nIn Section 3.3, we provide generalization bounds between the empirical distribution and population distribution to show that the population loss can be made small by optimizing on the finite samples (see Theorems C.1 and C.2, which provide the finite sample versions of our results). The unlabeled sample cost is polynomial in the inverse margin and weights of the model. This is one of the main advantages of our work over prior approaches --- because we analyze parametric losses, it\u2019s straightforward to obtain finite sample guarantees by using off-the-shelf generalization bounds. \n\nWe\u2019d also like to respectfully point out that the concern regarding sample cost of estimating a population objective using a finite training set arises any time we desire generalization between training and test, and is therefore not unique to self-training or the objective we analyze. Thus, this concern is to some extent orthogonal to the central focus of our work. Also, the sample complexity requirements are only for *unlabeled* data, which are typically more abundant and cheaper to obtain than labeled data. \n\n--- \u201cassumption that neighborhoods of samples from different classes have a small overlap, it also may be restrictive. For example, in imagenet, there are many images that contain several objects actually. This means that the overlap between samples from different classes may be not small.\u201d \n\nThanks for the insightful comments. The authors agree that this is a valid concern, and it is an interesting direction of future work to address it. One possibility is to directly apply our theoretical results to the distribution P_single, i.e., the image distribution conditioned on only a single unambiguous class being present in the image. Prior studies of ImageNet (see Figure 4 of [3]) demonstrate that model accuracy degrades when more than one class is present in the image, so perhaps it is unrealistic to obtain strong theoretical results for such images, or it requires additional techniques to handle them better."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2250/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2250/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Theoretical Analysis of Self-Training with Deep Networks on Unlabeled Data", "authorids": ["~Colin_Wei1", "kshen6@stanford.edu", "~Yining_Chen1", "~Tengyu_Ma1"], "authors": ["Colin Wei", "Kendrick Shen", "Yining Chen", "Tengyu Ma"], "keywords": ["deep learning theory", "domain adaptation theory", "unsupervised learning theory", "semi-supervised learning theory"], "abstract": "Self-training algorithms, which train a model to fit pseudolabels predicted by another previously-learned model, have been very successful for learning with unlabeled data using neural networks.

Our response to the reviewer\u2019s question about experiments is below:\n\n--- \u201cI personally think that conducting an experimental study in the scope of this quite challenging however it will be nice see expansion property on a real dataset\u201d\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the suggestions. As the reviewer noted, \u201cexperimental study [of the expansion property is] quite challenging\u201d. The main difficulty stems from the fact that expansion is a property about the population data which the empirical distribution does not possess. It\u2019s infeasible to check the exact expansion property of the population distribution (which we don\u2019t have access to) for all subsets (which we cannot enumerate exhaustively). Instead, we made efforts in verifying weaker versions and direct consequences of the expansion property by assuming that the population data distribution generated by BigGAN is sufficiently close to the real distribution. \n\nFirst, we sanity-checked the distinction between the assumed expansion in the population distribution  and expansion in the empirical distribution (which cannot hold in high-dimension). This is demonstrated in Figure 1, where we search for neighbors w.r.t. $\\ell_2$ distance of an image over the entire GAN manifold as well as the nearest neighbor on a finite sample of 100K images. The nearest neighbor from these 100K images looks nothing like the original image, whereas the neighbor in the GAN manifold is very close to the original image. This suggests the expansion is much better on population distribution than the empirical distribution (see the more detailed description in caption of Figure 1 and Section D.) \n\nSecond, in Section D, we compared the probability of the set of incorrectly pseudolabeled BigGAN images to the probability of the neighborhood of this set. We do so because our proof for semi-supervised learning only requires expansion of subsets of incorrectly pseudolabeled examples. (See the condition of Theorem A.4 of Section A, which is a weaker condition than what is stated in the main body of the paper. In the main body we state the stronger assumption for simplicity of exposition.) When using an $\\ell_2$ ball with radius 19.8 as the neighborhood (which corresponds to modifying each pixel by 0.024 on average out of the range [0,1]), we found an expansion coefficient c > 3, which suggests good expansion. (Concretely, the set of incorrectly pseudolabeled examples has 6% of the mass, whereas its neighbor has 20% probability mass.) Further inspection of the neighboring pairs reveals that they look quite similar, as demonstrated in Figure 1. This provides empirical support for the expansion assumption, but a full rigorous verification is computationally infeasible because it would require computing the neighborhood size of *all subsets* of incorrectly pseudolabeled examples. More details and additional experiments are in Section D. \n\nThird, another consequence of the expansion property (from classical study of expansion and isoperimetric inequalities) is that it ensures that a local random walk can traverse the manifold with a good mixing time. Qualitatively, videos publicly available on latent-space random walks for the BigGAN-generated images seem to corroborate that the manifold of each class is sufficiently connected (e.g., please see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY6LrQSxIbc). (Actually, the generative model for BigGAN is quite close to the Example 3.5.) \n\nFurther inspection and exploitation of variants of the expansion property is a very interesting future direction.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2250/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2250/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Theoretical Analysis of Self-Training with Deep Networks on Unlabeled Data", "authorids": ["~Colin_Wei1", "kshen6@stanford.edu", "~Yining_Chen1", "~Tengyu_Ma1"], "authors": ["Colin Wei", "Kendrick Shen", "Yining Chen", "Tengyu Ma"], "keywords": ["deep learning theory", "domain adaptation theory", "unsupervised learning theory", "semi-supervised learning theory"], "abstract": "Self-training algorithms, which train a model to fit pseudolabels predicted by another previously-learned model, have been very successful for learning with unlabeled data using neural networks.

Responses to the questions are below:\n\n--- \u201ca bit strange that semi-supervised learning requires a stronger assumption on expansion than unsupervised learning. Is it possible to use the unsupervised method and then somehow align it with the semi-supervised labels?\u201d\n\nThis is a great observation. Indeed, the pseudolabel setting requires a larger expansion coefficient (c > 5) than unsupervised learning (c > 1), and a reasonable alternative algorithm for semi-supervised learning is to first use unsupervised learning and align the result with labeled data. However, our assumption (Assumption 4.1) for semi-supervised learning is more relaxed in another aspect --- it only requires expansion for sets with probability mass smaller than $\\bar{a}$ (= the error of the pseudolabels), instead of for all sets with probability less than 0.5, which is needed in Assumption 3.2 for unsupervised learning. This difference demonstrates an advantage of using pseudolabels over unsupervised learning. In fact, in the proof in Section A (see the condition of Theorem A.4), we work with an even more relaxed assumption which only requires expansion for *all subsets of incorrectly pseudolabeled examples* and has a looser condition on c (which roughly speaking is similar to c>2). We decided to use Assumption 4.1, the version which sacrifices a bit in c, because (a) as discussed, the assumption on expansion is still weaker in another aspect, (b) we consider the exact requirement for the expansion coefficient less essential (up to constant factors), and (c) the rich literature on expansion suggests that smaller sets are more likely to have higher expansion coefficients [1]. (We discussed this after Assumption 4.1 in the paper but will clarify more in the next revision.) \n\n--- \u201cHow will the results change if B is of other forms (e.g., coming from a model)?\u201d\n\nOur theory is quite flexible with the choice of B, though the paper focuses on the case where the transformation set B(x) is the set of points within some $\\ell_2$ radius r of some augmentation of x (as described in the first paragraph of Section 3.1). As noted by the reviewer, the only requirements on B are that expansion (Assumption 3.2) and separation (Assumption 3.3) hold. The question suggested by the reviewer of defining B based on some model is a very interesting direction for future analysis, and we hope that the theory in this work may help guide us to find a better neighborhood B according to its expansion property.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Raghavendra, Prasad, and David Steurer. \"Graph expansion and the unique games conjecture.\" Proceedings of the forty-second ACM symposium on Theory of computing. 2010."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2250/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2250/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Theoretical Analysis of Self-Training with Deep Networks on Unlabeled Data", "authorids": ["~Colin_Wei1", "kshen6@stanford.edu", "~Yining_Chen1", "~Tengyu_Ma1"], "authors": ["Colin Wei", "Kendrick Shen", "Yining Chen", "Tengyu Ma"], "keywords": ["deep learning theory", "domain adaptation theory", "unsupervised learning theory", "semi-supervised learning theory"], "abstract": "Self-training algorithms, which train a model to fit pseudolabels predicted by another previously-learned model, have been very successful for learning with unlabeled data using neural networks.

In the literature there are important and elegant works exists that analyses the impact of usage of unlabelled data during training, however, (if I am not mistaken) all these analyses have been done for linear models. Authors analyse and shed some light to several aspects of using unlabelled data during training. They formalize their analyses based on expansion assumption. I think it can be restated as the similarity between members of the same classes is bounded by below. Intuitively such an assumption is quite reasonable. The authors use the term input consistency for defining a broad set of methods e.g. transformations of the image should be similar to each other, and they also couple their analysis using the expansion assumption with input consistency. In their view input consistency brings a local stability/generalization and expansion property brings global stability/generalization. This is again quite reasonable way of thinking because intuitively just forcing an input point to be close to transformed version of itself sounds a weak property for a good generalization performance.

The authors propose a novel assumption that they dub _expansion_ to effect this analysis. The expansion assumption requires that the neighborhood of small sets have a class conditional distribution that is large. Under this assumption, the authors show population results for an algorithm that performs self-training under the objective that enforces input consistency. \nThey also provide finite sample guarantees based on off-the-shelf generalization bounds for unsupervised learning. \n\n**+ves**\n+ The expansion property seems neat, and seems like a natural quantity for making progress in understanding self-training theoretically \n+ The authors also provide support for this empirically in Section D. \n+ The paper is very well written. In particular, the summary of the theoretical results in the main paper is very well done. I also appreciated the proof intuition for Theorem 4.3's proof\n\n**Concerns/Comments:**\n- I think it would be helpful for the reader to have a brief proof sketch of the theorems immediately after the statement. The results are already summarized (well!) informally in the introduction. \n- It is unclear to me how realistic Assumption 4.1 is. \n\n**Questions for the Authors:**\n- Can you expand on the optimization objective of (4.1)? How may one implement this in practice? Or, how is this analogous to what is being done in practice? \n- Can you comment on the realism of Assumption 4.1? Is it possible to verify this on toy examples as you have done with the assumptions in Section 3? \n- Can you comment on obtaining a finite sample version of Theorem 4.3? \n", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2250/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2250/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Theoretical Analysis of Self-Training with Deep Networks on Unlabeled Data", "authorids": ["~Colin_Wei1", "kshen6@stanford.edu", "~Yining_Chen1", "~Tengyu_Ma1"], "authors": ["Colin Wei", "Kendrick Shen", "Yining Chen", "Tengyu Ma"], "keywords": ["deep learning theory", "domain adaptation theory", "unsupervised learning theory", "semi-supervised learning theory"], "abstract": "Self-training algorithms, which train a model to fit pseudolabels predicted by another previously-learned model, have been very successful for learning with unlabeled data using neural networks.
