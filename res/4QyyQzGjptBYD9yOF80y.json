The features useful for object classification are learned by feed-forward deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) automatically, and they are shown to be able to predict and decode neural representations in the ventral visual pathway of humans and monkeys. However, despite the huge amount of work on optimizing CNNs, there has not been much research focused on linking CNNs with guiding principles from the human visual cortex. In this work, we propose a network optimization strategy inspired by both of the developmental trajectory of children\u2019s visual object recognition capabilities, and Bar (2003), who hypothesized that basic level information is carried in the fast magnocellular pathway through the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and then projected back to inferior temporal cortex (IT), where subordinate level categorization is achieved. We instantiate this idea by training a deep CNN\nto perform basic level object categorization first, and then train it on subordinate level categorization. We apply this idea to training AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) on the ILSVRC 2012 dataset and show that the top-5 accuracy increases from 80.13% to 82.14%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method. We also show that subsequent transfer learning on smaller datasets gives superior results.\n", "pdf": "/pdf/4QyyQzGjptBYD9yOF80y.pdf", "paperhash": "wang|basic_level_categorization_facilitates_visual_object_recognition", "conflicts": ["ucsd.edu"], "authors": ["Panqu Wang", "Garrison Cottrell"], "authorids": ["pawang@ucsd.edu", "gary@ucsd.edu"]}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "tmdate": null, "cdate": 1454464564200, "ddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "duedate": 1455833700000, "tcdate": 1454464564200, "id": "ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/-/submission", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"pdf": null, "forum": null, "replyto": null, "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*", "description": "Your displayed identity associated with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"pdf": {"order": 4, "description": "Either upload a PDF file or provide a direct link to your PDF on ArXiv.", "value-regex": "upload|http://arxiv.org/pdf/.+"}, "title": {"order": 3, "description": "Title of paper.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "abstract": {"order": 4, "description": "Abstract of paper.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}, "authors": {"order": 1, "description": "Comma separated list of author names, as they appear in the paper.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "author_emails": {"order": 2, "description": "Comma separated list of author email addresses, in the same order as above.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "conflicts": {"order": 100, "description": "Semi-colon separated list of email domains of people who would have a conflict of interest in reviewing this paper, (e.g., cs.umass.edu;google.com, etc.).", "value-regex": "^([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))+(;[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))*$"}, "CMT_id": {"order": 5, "value-regex": ".*", "description": "If the paper is a resubmission from the ICLR 2016 Conference Track, enter its CMT ID; otherwise, leave blank."}}}, "invitees": [], "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "expdate": 1463609700000}}}], "count": 1}
