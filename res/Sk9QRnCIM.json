Let us clarify each of them.\n\n=================\n> But the node classification task is a bit unclear.\n\nThe node classification task is to assign a class to each node in a graph. For example, in the Cora dataset, each node, a paper, is associated with one of the seven scientific fields. For other datasets please refer the last sentence of Section 2.3.\n\n\n> There are multiple centrality measures but only one classification task.\n\nCentrality measures were independent of the classification task; they were only used in the analysis stage to characterize node embedding algorithms after classification had completed. We note that node centrality measures in the analysis stage were true values, not predicted values. Moreover, Figure 1 shows only the degree centralities because, compared to other centralities, they exhibited most salient differences of embedding algorithms.\n\n\n> It is also unclear which metric was used in the classification task.\n\nWe used micro F1 score averaged over the five validation folds as a node classification metric. This is written only in the caption of Table 2 due to space limitation.\n\n\n> And, why is it not a regression task? Say, predict the actual betweeness centrality metric rather than a class.\n\nWe used centrality measures to understand embedding algorithms and to discuss possible enhancements; e.g. improving embeddings for low-degree nodes may be more fruitful than working for other nodes (Figure 1b). Regression, i.e. predicting centrality measures from node embeddings, is an interesting topic and in fact Rizi and Granitzer (2017) have worked on it.  Our work, however, did not involve the prediction of centrality measures; we only used centrality measures at the analysis stage to study the distributions of them on incorrectly classified nodes. Note that we used true centrality measures (not their predictions).\n\nFatemeh Salehi Rizi and Michael Granitzer. Properties of Vector Embeddings in Social Networks. _Algorithms_, 10(4),  2017. URL http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/10/4/109.\n\n\n> Moreover, there are a number of other node embedding methods HolE, RESCAL, Molecular fingerprints (Duvenaud et al.), GraphSAGE, GraphNN, etc.. It is unclear why we should settle for only LINE and node2vec, and what it tells us about the other methods.\n\nWe selected four algorithms, Laplacian eigenmaps, LINE-1st, LINE-2nd, and node2vec (DeepWalk), because these cover wide classes of embedding algorithms and can represent other algorithms. \n- HolE and RESCAL are similar to LINE in the sense that they minimize the distance between connected nodes; the major difference is that HolE and RESCAL are designed for knowledge graphs, which have many types of edges, whereas LINE (and we) only consider a single type of edges.\n- GraphSAGE is an extension of node2vec to calculate embeddings for new nodes that are not in training data, and we believe results obtained for node2vec should generalize fairly to GraphSAGE.\n- Molecular fingerprints are not considered a variant of the four compared algorithms but they are designed for molecules and not capable of processing wide-depth graphs such as citation or social networks used in our paper; see Section 5 in Duvenaud et al.

It is unclear why we should settle for only LINE and node2vec, and what it tells us about the other methods.\n\nPlease clarify.\n\n \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Node Centralities and Classification Performance for Characterizing Node Embedding Algorithms", "abstract": "Embedding graph nodes into a vector space can allow the use of machine learning to e.g. predict node classes, but the study of node embedding algorithms is immature compared to the natural language processing field because of a diverse nature of graphs. We examine the performance of node embedding algorithms with respect to graph centrality measures that characterize diverse graphs, through systematic experiments with four node embedding algorithms, four or five graph centralities, and six datasets. Experimental results give insights into the properties of node embedding algorithms, which can be a basis for further research on this topic.", "paperhash": "nozawa|node_centralities_and_classification_performance_for_characterizing_node_embedding_algorithms", "_bibtex": "@misc{\n  nozawa2018node,\n  title={Node Centralities and Classification Performance for Characterizing Node Embedding Algorithms},\n  author={Kento Nozawa and Masanari Kimura and Atsunori Kanemura},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk9QRnCIM}\n}", "authorids": ["k_nzw@klis.tsukuba.ac.jp", "mkimura@klis.tsukuba.ac.jp", "atsu-kan@aist.go.jp"], "authors": ["Kento Nozawa", "Masanari Kimura", "Atsunori Kanemura"], "keywords": [], "pdf": "/pdf/79e40c36d2d544ab4f228c6a50088c72d74eb411.pdf"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "duedate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "tmdate": 1519222449339, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/-/Paper96/Official_Comment", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"replyto": null, "forum": "Sk9QRnCIM", "writers": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper96/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper96/Authors|ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper96/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper96/Authors|ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "value-dropdown": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 0, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper96/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper96/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs"], "cdate": 1519222449339}}}], "count": 6}
