The authors proposed two methods, one largely relying on the distillation loss idea then followed by a quantization step, and another one that also learns the location of the quantization points. Somewhat surprisingly, nobody has combined the two approaches before, which makes this paper interesting. Experiments show that both methods work well in compressing large deep neural network models for applications where resources are limited, like on mobile devices. \n\nOverall I am mostly OK with this paper but not impressed by it.  Detailed comments below.\n\n1. Quantizing with respect to the distillation loss seems to do better than with the normal loss - this needs more discussion. \n2. The idea of using the gradient with respect to the quantization points to learn them is interesting but not entirely new (see, e.g., \"Matrix Recovery from Quantized and Corrupted Measurements\", ICASSP 2014 and \"OrdRec: An Ordinal Model for Predicting Personalized Item Rating Distributions\", RecSys 2011, although in a different context). I also wonder if it would work better if you can also allow the weights to move a little bit (it seems to me from Algorithm 2 that you only update the quantization points). How about learning them altogether? Also this differentiable quantization method does not really depend on distillation, which is kind of confusing given the title.\n3. I am a little bit confused by how the bits are redistributed in the second method, as in the end it seems to use more than the proposed number of bits shown in the table (as recognized in section 4.2). This makes the comparison a little bit unfair (especially for the CIFAR 100 case, where the \"2 bits\" differentiable quantization is actually using 3.23 bits). This needs more clarification.\n4. The writing can be improved. For example, the concepts of \"teacher\" and \"student\" is not clear at all in the abstract - consider putting the first sentence of Section 3 in there instead. Also, the first sentence of the paper reads as \"... have showed tremendous performance\", which is not proper English. At the top of page 3 I found \"we will restrict our attention to uniform and non-uniform quantization\". What are you not restricting to, then?\n\nSlightly increased my rating after reading the rebuttal and the revision.

It proposed both the quantized distillation and also the differentiable quantization. The quantized distillation method just simply adapt the distillation work for the task of model compression, and give good results to the baseline method. While the differentiable quantization optimise the quantization function in a unified back-propagation framework. It is interesting to see the performance improvements by using the one-step optimisation method. \n\nI like this paper very much as it is in good motivation to utilize the distillation framework for the task of model compression. The starting point is quite interesting and reasonable. The information from the teacher network is useful for constructing a better compressed model. I believe this idea is quite similar to the idea of Learning using Privileged Information, in which the information on teacher model is only used during training, but is not utilised during testing. \n\nSome minor comments:\nIn table 3, it seems that the results for 2 bits are not stable, and are there any explanations?\nWhat will be the results if the student model performs the same with the teacher model (e.g., use the teacher model as the student model to do the compression) or even better (reverse the settings)?\nWhat will be the prediction speed for each of models? We can also get the time of speedup for the compressed model.\n\nIt will be better if the authors could discuss the connections between distillation and the recent work for the Learning using Privileged Information setting:\nVladimir Vapnik, Rauf Izmailov:\nLearning using privileged information: similarity control and knowledge transfer.

We detail the main changes below:\n\n- Larger-scale experiments:\n\nTo address the comments by Reviewers 1 and 3, we have added experiments on the ImageNet-1K and WMT13 datasets, as well as extended the CIFAR experiments.\n\nOn ImageNet, we trained ResNet-18 at 4bits of precision, distilling from a ResNet-34 teacher. \nDirect quantized disillation produces a 4-bit ResNet18 model which loses around 4% in terms of top-1 accuracy w.r.t. the 32-bit ResNet-18 baseline, which is in line with the performance of existing techniques. To improve upon this, we investigated widening the convolutional layers of the student (a technique known to increase capacity during distillation). This leads the student to match and surpass the accuracy of the baseline. \nIn the revised paper, we detail a new experiment where we obtain a 4-bit quantized ResNet-18 student matching the accuracy of the ResNet-34 teacher, and improving upon the accuracy of the 32-bit ResNet-18 of the same depth by >3%. The resulting model is < 1/4th the size of ResNet-34, has virtually the same accuracy, and, thanks to decreased depth, it is >50% faster in terms of inference speed. \nSimilarly, on WMT13, we present a 4bit model which matches the accuracy of the 32-bit teacher in terms of both BLEU score and perplexity.\nIn addition, on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we derive quantized variants of state-of-the-art models (wide ResNets) which show almost no loss in accuracy. See section 6 for details. \n\nIn sum, we believe that these results validate our techniques in settings that are close to the state-of-the-art, and hope that they address the reviewers\u2019 questions. \n\n\n- Related work:\n\nWe have significantly expanded the related work section, to clarify the relation to the papers which the reviewers suggested, and to the \u201cBinarized Neural Networks on the ImageNet Classification Task\u201d paper. In particular, we have clarified the fact that distillation for size reduction has been suggested before (even since the paper by Hinton et al.). Our contribution is in significantly refining these techniques to (almost) eliminate all accuracy loss in the context of image classification and machine translation using DNNs. Please see the related work section in the introduction for details. \n\n- Clarifications in the presentation:\n\nWe have performed an in-depth revision to clarify the reviewers\u2019 various questions, along the lines of our initial rebuttal. The reviewers can view individual changes via the PDF diff. We have also added a few smaller experiments to clarify various reviewer questions, such as training a student model deeper than the teacher (see Section 6). We also tried alternating QD with DQ, but experiments suggested this method to produce inferior results, so we did not investigate it further. \n\nFinally, we would like to apologize for the delayed revision. This was due to technical issues in the default training setup for ResNet on the training framework we employed, as well as to the fact that ImageNet experiments took longer than expected.

We chose to run on CIFAR-10 and OpenNMT since they have reasonable iteration times. This allows us to carefully study the limits of the methods, and the trade-offs between bit width, network depth, and network layer width, given a fixed model by performing several experiments at each data point in reasonable time. To address the reviewer\u2019s point, we are extending our experiments to training \n1) quantized ResNet students, e.g. ResNet18, from larger ResNet teachers, e.g. ResNet50, on ImageNet, comparing against the full-precision and existing quantized state-of-the-art baselines. \n2) quantized state-of-the-art students for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 tasks from the full-precision baselines, and comparing them against best performing published quantized versions. \n\nIt would be very helpful if the reviewer could be more precise with respect to what they consider as a good baseline. \n\nRegarding the performance of differentiable quantization (DQ) with respect to quantized distillation (QD), we point out that \n1) in constrained settings (e.g. 2bit quantization) DQ can be significantly more accurate than QD. See for example the CIFAR-100 2-bit experiment. We will add more examples here. \n2) DQ usually converges earlier than QD to similar accuracy, which can be useful in settings where reducing number of iterations is important.

The importance of distillation loss:\nAcross all our experiments, using distillation loss in quantizing was superior to using \u2018normal\u2019 loss. This is one of our main findings, and is extremely consistent across experiments. We have given two sets of experiments to illustrate this, but we will add more examples. \n2. Differentiation w.r.t. quantization points:\nWe will discuss the connection with the RecSys 2011 and ICASSP papers in the next revision. \nAlternating optimization w.r.t. weights and locations of quantization points is a neat idea, which we are experimenting with; we will present results on it in the next revision. \nDistillation is actually present in Differentiable Quantization (DQ), since we are starting from a distilled full-precision model. It is true however that DQ can be applied independently from distillation. We will clarify this point. \n3. Re-distribution of bits: \nFractional numbers appear since there are a couple of different techniques being concurrently: 1) we preferentially re-distribute bits proportionally to the gradient norm; 2) we perform Huffman encoding to compute the \u201coptimal\u201d resulting compression score per layer; 3) we do bucketing, which slightly increases the bit cost due to storing the scaling factor. \nWe will add a detailed procedure on how these costs were obtained, and explain why they can exceed the baseline bit width. \n4. Writing inconsistencies:\nWe thank the reviewer for the detailed comments, which we will fully address in the next version.

Divergence of 2bit variants: \nIndeed, the 2bit version can diverge for some parameter settings. Our interpretation is that through trimming and quantization we reduce the capacity of the student, which might no longer have enough capacity to mimic the teacher model, and diverges. \n2. Swapping student and teacher model: \nThat is an interesting question. We focused on larger teachers and smaller students for compressing a fixed model. However, it is highly probable that quantizing a larger CNN via distillation from a smaller one will work as well. We will add experiments for this case. \n3. Inference speed is linear in network depth and bit width. In our experiments, the speedup we get on inference is proportional to the reduction in depth. This is mentioned in passing in the Conclusions section, but we will add some exact numbers. \n4.

The first method we propose is called quantized distillation and leverages distillation during the training process, by incorporating distillation loss, expressed with respect to the teacher, into the training of a student network whose weights are quantized to a limited set of levels. The second method,  differentiable quantization, optimizes the location of quantization points through stochastic gradient descent, to better fit the behavior of the teacher model.  We validate both methods through experiments on convolutional and recurrent architectures. We show that quantized shallow students can reach similar accuracy levels to full-precision teacher models, while providing order of magnitude compression, and inference speedup that is linear in the depth reduction. In sum, our results enable DNNs for resource-constrained environments to leverage architecture and accuracy advances developed on more powerful devices.\n", "pdf": "/pdf/16d83892a02967fcd588378586a2f113b4d58122.pdf", "TL;DR": "Obtains state-of-the-art accuracy for quantized, shallow nets by leveraging distillation.
