A good baseline would be to have two identical attention mechanisms to figure out if improvements come from more capacity or better model structure. Flat attention seems to add a self-attention model and is somewhat comparable to two mechanisms. The results show hardly any improvement over the flat attention baseline (at most 0.2 BLEU which is well within the variation of different random initializations).

The idea of learning soft dependency arcs in tandem with an NMT objective is very similar to recent notions of self-attention (Vaswani et al., 2017, cited) or previous work on latent graph parsing for NMT (Hashimoto and Tsuruoka, 2017, cited). This paper introduces three innovations: (1) they pass the self-attention scores through a matrix-tree theorem transformation to produce marginals over tree-constrained head probabilities; (2) they explicitly specify how the dependencies are to be used, meaning that rather than simply attending over dependency representations with a separate attention, they select a soft word to attend to through the traditional method, and then attend to that word\u2019s soft head (called Shared Attention in the paper); and (3) they gate when attention is used. I feel that the first two ideas are particularly interesting. Unfortunately, the results of the NMT experiments are not particularly compelling, with overall gains over baseline NMT being between 0.6 and 0.8 BLEU. However, they include a useful ablation study that shows fairly clearly that both ideas (1) and (2) contribute equally to their modest gains, and that without them (FA-NMT Shared=No in Table 2), there would be almost no gains at all. Interesting side-experiments investigate their accuracy as a dependency parser, with and without a hard constraint on the system\u2019s latent dependency decisions.\n\nThis paper has some very good ideas, and asks questions that are very much worth asking. In particular, the question of whether a tree constraint is useful in self-attention is very worthwhile. Unfortunately, this is mostly a negative result, with gains over \u201cflat attention\u201d being relatively small. I also like the \u201cShared Attention\u201d - it makes a lot of sense to say that if the \u201csemantic\u201d attention mechanism has picked a particular word, one should also attend to that word\u2019s head; it is not something I would have thought of on my own. The paper is also marred by somewhat weak writing, with a number of disfluencies and awkward phrasings making it somewhat difficult to follow.\n\nIn terms of specific criticisms:\n\nI found the motivation section to be somewhat weak. We need a better reason than morphology to want to do source-side dependency parsing. All published error analyses of strong NMT systems (Bentivogli et al, EMNLP 2016; Toral and Sanchez-Cartagena, EACL 2017; Isabelle et al, EMNLP 2017) have shown that morphology is a strength, not a weakness of these systems, and the sorts of head selection problems shown in Figure 1 are, in my experience, handled capably by existing LSTM-based systems.\n\nThe paper mentions \u201csignificant improvements\u201d in only two places: the introduction and the conclusion. With BLEU score differences being so low, the authors should specify how statistical significance is measured; ideally using a technique that accounts for the variance of random restarts (i.e.: Clark et al, ACL 2011).\nEquation (3): I couldn\u2019t find the definition for H anywhere.\n\nSentence before Equation (5): I believe there is a typo here, \u201cf takes z_i\u201d should be \u201cf takes u_t\u201d.\n\nFirst section of Section 3: please cite the previous work you are talking about in this sentence.\n\nMy understanding was that the dependency marginals in p(z_{i,j}=1|x,\\phi) in Equation (11) are directly used as \\beta_{i,j}. If I\u2019m correct, that\u2019s probably worth spelling out explicitly in Equation (11): \\beta_{i,j} = p(z_{i,j}=1|x,\\phi) = \u2026\n\nI don\u2019t don\u2019t feel like the clause between equations (17) and (18), \u201cwhen sharing attention weights from the decoder with the encoder\u201d is a good description of your clever \u201cshared attention\u201d idea. In general, I found this region of the paper, including these two equations and the text between them, very difficult to follow.\n\nSection 4.4: It\u2019s very very good that you compared to \u201cflat attention\u201d, but it\u2019s too bad for everyone cheering for linguistically-informed syntax that the results weren\u2019t better.\n\nTable 5: I had a hard time understanding Table 5 and the corresponding discussion. What are \u201cproduction percentages\u201d?\n\nFinally, it would have been interesting to include the FA system in the dependency accuracy experiment (Table 4), to see if it made a big difference there.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Inducing Grammars with and for Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "Previous work has demonstrated the benefits of incorporating additional linguistic annotations such as syntactic trees into neural machine translation.

SA takes the global structure of a sentence into account as it needs to compute the partition function. For completeness, we also compare SA against self-attention (Flat attention) which only consider local dependencies between a word and its head. We evaluate the quality of induced tree on Universal Dependencies dataset. We observe that overall, SA models obtain better DA/UA scores, and SA are highly sensitive with the choice of architectures (sharing attention). Our original motivation for sharing attention is to help biasing SA to capture syntactic dependencies on the source side. This is reflected in both BLEU scores and DA/UA scores. Without sharing attention, DA/UA scores are considerably worse while the models still on par or outperform the NMT baselines. We find this result is exciting. It suggests that there should a better way to exploit SA for improving NMT as well as grammar induction.  Further, the fact that the choice of the target slide language changes these values hints at the different agreement syntax of languages so combining models may lead to further gains and syntactic learning in the future.\nFinally, we also note that, for grammar induction, we are particularly interested in DE as long distance dependencies are more common in DE. The results show that structured attention are indeed superior to FA.  We leave these insights to future work to explore.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Inducing Grammars with and for Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "Previous work has demonstrated the benefits of incorporating additional linguistic annotations such as syntactic trees into neural machine translation.

Our assumption is based on the insights from (Koehn and Knowles, 2017) in which they computed match score between the most attended source word and the aligned word (produced by fast-align) and reported the match scores are higher than 70% for English->German, English<->Russian. \n\nBy syntactic attention, we meant that when the model decided to translate a word f in the source side, we want to model also look at syntactic relations of the word f in an explicit way, such as the head word of f.

We will absolutely prioritize clarity as we rework the writing in the final version of the paper.\n\nWe agree with (Bentivogli et al, EMNLP 2016; Toral and Sanchez-Cartagena, EACL 2017) that NMT handles morphology better than phrase-based MT.  Isabelle et al does show that NMT can capture more morphology for French and English.  In our work, we choose German as a target language where long distance dependencies commonly occur.  We see that branching baselines perform measurably worse on the basic dependents of nouns and verbs in Table 4. We agree that it is reasonable to believe that existing NMT can handle the syntactic dependencies in an implicit manner, in our experiment (Figure 5), we show that if that information is available, the decoder prefers to use them, especially when predicting German verb. Additionally, when we designed our architectures, with the explicit goal of extracting interpretable structures, in part to compare the representations to prior linguistic knowledge of language. Both structured attention and gating norm to certain extent allow us to perform analysis on the task instead of training an additional classifier to probe the ability of the models in capturing linguistic phenomena.\n\nWe have now included statistical significance tests in the 1st revision and we will make sure they are more clearly explained and pronounced in the final version. We have now also included significant tests when comparing against the flat (no-shared)-attention models. We truly appreciate that the reviewer noticed the shared attention mechanism we proposed even though we didn\u2019t explain it well, something we are remedying by getting more eyes on our paper and isolating sources of confusion. We will try our best to make it more accessible in the next revision.\n\nYou are correct in your understanding of the dependency marginals in Equation (11).  We have elaborated on this in the revision but are open to further suggestions.\n\nRegarding \u201cproduction percentages\u201d \u2013 While aggregate attachment numbers give a score to how well syntax is induced generally, they don\u2019t give us insight into the grammar.  As a proxy for which grammatical rules the system has learned, we choose to analyze the frequency with which specific \u201chead \u2192 child rules\u201d were used by our model vs how often that rule exists in the grammar of the language.  For example, the three most common verb constructions are verb chains (VERB\u2192 VERB), verb subj/obj (VERB\u2192 NOUN) and verb\u2019s being modified by an adverb (VERB\u2192 ADV).  The gold column indicates how common these constructions are in the true data and the remaining columns show how often our systems believe these constructions exist.

The field of NLP has long prioritized structured model representations under the assumption that there are a fundamental property of language and therefore often a prerequisite for language tasks.  A naive reading of recent research in NMT seems to direct contradict this age old belief. Our goal here was to investigate if the success and seeming necessity of attention mechanisms is related to their ability to capture these structural/hierarchical properties of language.  The gating mechanisms and gains in BLEU score exist in service of this exploration, so so we agree are in and of themselves perhaps more minor contributions.  For example, you're absolutely correct that some of the basic components of our model are shared with previous work (Kim, 17 and Liu 17), but the shared attention and gating syntax are crucial in our models and their resulting analysis.  We will try to make this clearer in the final version.\n\nWe originally ran our evaluation on Spacy\u2019s outputs due to discrepancies between the MT tokens and tokenization and treebanks, but we have remedied this difference and updated all of our numbers to be evaluated against the Universal Dependencies treebanks.  The new results are in Table 3.  \n\nThere are two main results from Table 3: 1. Sharing attention appears to almost exclusively increase the model\u2019s ability to capture syntax and 2. That structure attention generally outperforms flat attention if viewed through the same lense.  Almost secondary to these results is the fact that shared structured attention also benefits translation BLEU scores (updated with statistical significance).  This result does however hint that better modeling or inducing linguistic structure might further benefit translation performance.\n\nFinally, you are correct to question the inclusion of hard-attention.   While it is harmful for translation it appears to help grammar induction.  We hope that understanding this discrepancy and the possible (de-)coupling of the two metrics may lead to new results in future-work.  Maybe multiple syntactic analyses should be used as references instead of a single formalism?  In our experiments, hard-attention is deterministically computing by taking the max instead of sampling.\n\nWe will rework our example and fix typos like z_t which you are correct should be u_t.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Inducing Grammars with and for Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "Previous work has demonstrated the benefits of incorporating additional linguistic annotations such as syntactic trees into neural machine translation.
