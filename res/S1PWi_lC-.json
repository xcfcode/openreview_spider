The data-sets used included three MNIST-like data-sets: MNIST, Not-MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST.\n\nThe multi-task learning paradigm involved pre-training the network with different combinations of the three data-sets. These combinations included three single-tasks, three bi-tasks, and one tri-tasks. The single-tasks refer to simply using each of the three data-sets individually. The three bi-tasks include the three possible combinations of two data-sets: MNIST+Not-MNIST, MNIST+Fashion-MNIST, and Not-MNIST+Fashion-MNIST. The tri-task referred to using all three data-sets for pre-training.\n\nThe weights from the pre-trained networks are then used to initialize a training network for each data-set individually. Note that for the bi-task learning, the image recognition task is not performed on the data-set that was not involved in the pre-training process. For example, if the pre-training was done on a pooled Not-MNIST and Fashion-MNIST data-set, then the image recognition is not performed on the MNIST data-set as the MNIST was not involved in the pre-training process. In addition, for the single-task learning, there was no pre-training procedure.\n\nThe architecture of the neural network was the all convolutional neural network. The whole architecture was constructed using Tensorflow in the replication.\n\nFor the multi-task learning models, the neural network is first pre-trained for 50 epochs in the multi-task context (bi-task or tri-task). With the parameters transferred over, the neural network is then re-trained for another 50 epochs in the single-task context before conducting the final image-recognition, for a total on 100 epochs on the multi-task learning models. For the single-task learning, the neural network is solely trained for 50 epochs on the individual data-set before performing the image-recognition task.\n\nFor each instance of the 50 epochs, a two-stage learning rate decay scheme is employed. For the first stage of 25 epochs in the instance, the learning rate was initialized to 10^{-3} and in the second stage of 25 epochs, the learning rate initialization was reduced to 10^{-5}. \n\nREPLICATION RESULTS\n\nThe results of the replication are as follows: On the MNIST data-set, the single-task achieved 99.59%, MNIST+Fashion-MNIST achieved 99.61%, MNIST+Not-MNIST achieved 99.58%, and MNIST+Fashion-MNIST+Not-MNIST achieved 99.64%. On Not-MNIST, single-task achieved 97.02%, Fashion-MNIST+Not-MNIST achieved 96.95%, MNIST+Not-MNIST achieved 97.08%, and MNIST+Fashion-MNIST+Not-MNIST achieved 96.91%. On Fashion-MNIST, single-task achieved 93.92%, Fashion-MNIST+Not-MNIST achieved 93.81%, MNIST+Fashion-MNIST achieved 93.56%, and MNIST+Fashion-MNIST+Not-MNIST achieved 93.57%.\n\nThe original study indicated a consistent increase in accuracy from single-task to tri-task learning, with a general pattern of increase in accuracy going from single-task to multi-task models. The results we obtained did not match this pattern in general. 6 of the 9 multi-task models had a lower accuracy than the corresponding single-task models. In addition, the single-task model achieved the highest accuracy for the Fashion-MNIST data-set.\n\nThe discrepancy in the results is based on very small absolute differences. Since each model was trained only once, the difference in results may have been simply due to chance. Keeping this in mind, further analysis using more training experiments and subsequent statistical significance analysis would be helpful for ascertaining the accuracy of multi-task learning versus single-task learning for MNIST and MNIST-like data-sets."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-task Learning on MNIST Image Datasets", "abstract": "We apply multi-task learning to image classification tasks on MNIST-like datasets.

The experiment applies multi-task learning to recognizing digits, fashion items, and letters from the MNIST, FashionMNIST, and NotMNIST datasets respectively. It uses the entire FashionMNIST and MNIST datasets (60,000 training set and 10,000 test set images each) and a subset of 70,000 NotMNIST images  to train their learners. First a multi-task classifier is trained on different combinations of datasets (MNIST + FashionMNIST, FashionMNIST + Not MNIST, etc.)  for 25 epochs with a learning rate initialized to 1e-3, then another 25 epochs with an initial learning rate of 1e-5. The weights of the trained multi task learners are then used as the initial weights for single task learners that are then trained for a specific task in the same procedure with a different dataset (i.e. an MNIST single task learner trains further on the MNIST dataset). \n\nAll hyperparameters are clearly outlined, including learning rate, optimization function used, and number of epochs ran for training. The authors mention a decay rate for the learning rate but did not specify it. Furthermore they released the code used to run their experiments, and in their code they make extensive use of batch normalization and dropout in their A-CNNs, though the paper makes no mention of it. This made it more difficult to obtain their exact results, because without the code it would have been impossible to recreate their exact training procedure. We did not include batch normalization and dropout in our architecture even after this discovery, to better gauge how well the paper's results can be reproduced based strictly on what is written in it.\n\nThis team was able to closely reproduce the author\u2019s work with a combination of C++, Python, and bash scripts, thanks to the detailed architecture and hyper parameters outlined in the paper. A C++ code preprocessed the datasets, obtained from their official websites, and saved them in a custom format as .ocv files. Python scripts built the learners using Keras Tensorflow and fit the models to the appropriate datasets using the same hyperparameters specified by the original paper. A bash script called the Pythons scripts and passed in different arguments for which datasets to train on and what to set the initial learning rate to. \n\nThe results reported by the paper seem to favor the author\u2019s conclusion that multi-task learners are more powerful than their single  task counterparts; on the task of classifying digits from the MNIST dataset, for example, a single task learner whose weights were initialized randomly got an accuracy of 99.56\\%, whereas a single task learner initialized from multi task learner trained on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets got an accuracy of 99.71\\%. This team obtained some results that agreed with the author's conclusion, but others that contradicted it. For the same set of comparative results, for example, this team obtained accuracies of 99.36\\% and 99.21\\% respectively, where the single task learner out performed its multi task counterpart. \n\nOverall the results obtained by the authors were easy to reproduce as the authors provided ample detail of their method and architectures used. This team obtained some results that correlated with the author's conclusions, and some that did not. These discrepancies could be attributed to methods used by the others that went unmentioned in the paper, though with results between classifiers differentiating by less than half a percentile in some cases (both ours and the authors) it is difficult to discern a significant trend from regular fluctuation."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-task Learning on MNIST Image Datasets", "abstract": "We apply multi-task learning to image classification tasks on MNIST-like datasets.

Multi-task learning was achieved by first training\na network in a pre-defined way to get the weights between layers and then using this weights to initialize the\nnetworks for single-task learning.\n1) Implementation: We tried to reproduce the accuracy results in the paper for single-task learning and multi-task\nlearning on MNIST, NotMNIST and FashionMNIST datasets. A same CNN structure was used throughout. The\nauthors provided the code which was simple, elegantly written and well formatted. Thus we were able to reproduce\nthe results very easily. For single-task learning, 50 epochs were used to train the model with a single dataset using\n4:1 training and validation data split.\nFew key differences were observed between the actual implemented model and the model presented in the\npaper. Moreover, some important details regarding the model architecture were missing. For example, there was\nno mention of batch normalization in the manuscript, although it was used in the code. Batch normalization was\nused after each convolution layer. It was difficult to reproduce the results without such details. But as soon as the\ncode was given the entire structure was very clear. However, hyperparameters and structure of the model could\nhave been explained in more detail. Inclusion of some statistics comparing accuracy of single and multi-tasking\nmodels would have been more useful.\n2) Reproduced Results: Denoting MNIST, NotMNIST and FashionMNIST by M, N and F respectively, the\naccuracies that we obtained on MNIST using M, M+N, M+F and M+N+F are 99.71%, 99.67%, 99.67% and\n99.63% respectively; the results on NotMNIST for N, M+N, N+F and M+N+F are 97.55%, 97.53%, 97.43%,\n97.54% and the results on FashionMNIST for F, F+N, M+F and M+N+F are 94.81%, 94.92%, 94.90% and 95.07\nrespectively.We obtained slightly different results as compared to manuscript. The reason behind this could be\ndifferent version of tensorflow (we used 1.4.0). It was very helpful of the authors to mention the exact version of\nthe libraries used which supported our ease of reproducing it.\nWhen reproducing the results for single-task learning, we tried to tune the hyper-parameters and achieved a better\naccuracy of 99.88% for single-task learning than in the paper. Hence, we believe that some more hyper-parameter\noptimization and then implementing a multi-task learning would be helpful. Overall, this paper brings out a very\ninteresting insight which can be of great use if the same thing could be extended to other different domains"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-task Learning on MNIST Image Datasets", "abstract": "We apply multi-task learning to image classification tasks on MNIST-like datasets.
