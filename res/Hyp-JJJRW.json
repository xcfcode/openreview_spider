This is done by first using unsupervised pretraining and then fine-tuning using a weighted combination of the regular multinomial NLL loss and a reconstruction loss at the last hidden layer. Experiments on MNIST are provided to analyse what this approach learns.\n\nUnfortunately, I fail to see a significantly valuable contribution from this work. First, the paper could do a better job at motivating the problem being addressed. Why is it important to separate class from style? Should it allow better classification performance? If so, it's never measured in this work. If that's not the motivation, then what is it?\n\nSecond, all experiments were conducted on the MNIST dataset. In 2017, most would expect experiments on at least one other, more complex dataset, to trust any claims on a method.\n\nFinally, the results are not particularly impressive. I don't find the reconstructions demonstrated particularly compelling (they are generally pretty different from the original input). Also, that the \"style\" representation contain less (and I'd say slightly less, in Figure 7 b and d, we still see a lot of same class nearest neighbors) is not exactly a surprising result. And the results of figure 9, showing poor reconstructions when changing the class representation essentially demonstrates that the method isn't able to factorize class and style successfully. The interpolation results of Figure 11 are also underwhelming, though possibly mostly because the reconstructions are in general not great. But most importantly, none of these results are measured in a quantitative way: they are all qualitative, and thus subjective.\n\nFor all these reasons, I'm afraid I must recommend this paper be rejected.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Style Memory: Making a Classifier Network Generative", "abstract": "Deep networks have shown great performance in classification tasks.

The idea of learning representations that decompose into class-specific and class-agnostic parts, and more generally \"style\" and \"content\", is an interesting and long-standing problem. The results in the paper are mostly qualitative and only on MNIST. They do not show convincingly that the network managed to learn interesting class-specific and class-agnostic representations. It's not clear whether the examples shown in figures 7 to 11 are representative of the network's general behavior. The tSNE visualization in figure 6 seems to indicate that the style memory representation does not capture class information as well as the raw pixels, but doesn't indicate whether that representation is sensible.\n\nThe use of fully connected networks on images may affect the quality of the learned representations, and it may be necessary to use convolutional networks to get interesting results. It may also be interesting to consider class-specific representations that are more general than just the class label.

We apologize for not clearly stating the motivation behind this work. Our main motivation was to design a classifier network that also has the capacity to be generative. We believe that a generative network would be less susceptible to being fooled by adversarial inputs since it would not be able to reconstruct nonsensical input. But before showing that the network is less vulnerable to adversarial examples, we want to investigate the properties of such a network. We have added text to our paper to clarify that this is our ultimate goal.\n\nHowever, in creating a classifier/generative network, we wanted to investigate the relationship between the classification part of the encoding, and the \u201cstyle memory\u201d part of the encoding. Much of this paper is devoted to understanding this relationship.\n\nWe have added experiments that we conducted on the Extended MNIST letter dataset which contains 145,600 samples, and where uppercase and lowercase letters are included in the same class (i.e. \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019 are in the same class). This makes the dataset more challenging than MNIST. We also expanded our discussion of figure 7 (and figure 8, which was added). The discussion argues, in quantitative terms, that style memory contains a representation that augments, but is substantially different from, the character class. The figures also illustrate that the representation in style memory is very different from the original, image-space representation.\n\nWe have modified our paper to address your comments, and feel that the paper is much improved from its original form."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Style Memory: Making a Classifier Network Generative", "abstract": "Deep networks have shown great performance in classification tasks.

We have added text to our paper to clarify that this is our ultimate goal.\n\nAlthough we have done preliminary experiments to show that the network is less vulnerable to adversarial examples, these results are not reported in this paper; we feel that further investigations and experimentations are warranted.\n\nThank you for also pointing out the paper \u201cLearning a Nonlinear Embedding by Preserving Class Neighbourhood Structure\u201d by Salakhutdinov and Hinton (2007). We agree that the work is relevant, and have added a discussion of the paper to our \u201cRelated Work\u201d section.\n\nWe also changed our network to include convolutional layers, as you suggested.
