The approach is to learn a policy for task 1, then for each task k+1: copy distilled policy that can perform tasks 1-k, finetune to task k+1, and distill again with the additional task. The results show that this PLAID algorithm outperforms a network trained on all tasks simultaneously. \n\nQuestions:\n- When distilling the policies, do you start from a randomly initialized policy, or do you start from the expert policy network?\n- What data do you use for the distillation? Section 4.1 states\"We use a method similar to the DAGGER algorithm\", but what is your method. If you generate trajectories form the student network, and label them with the expert actions, does that mean all previous expert policies need to be kept in memory?\n- I do not understand the purpose of \"input injection\" nor where it is used in the paper. \n\nStrengths:\n- The method is simple but novel. The results support the method's utility.\n- The testbed is nice; the tasks seem significantly different from each other. It seems that no reward shaping is used.\n- Figure 3 is helpful for understanding the advantage of PLAID vs MultiTasker.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Figure 2: the plots are too small.\n- Distilling may hurt performance ( Figure 2.d)\n- The method lacks details (see Questions above)\n- No comparisons with prior work are provided. The paper cites many previous approaches to this but does not compare against any of them. \n- A second testbed (such as navigation or manipulation) would bring the paper up a notch. \n\nIn conclusion, the paper's approach to multitask learning is a clever combination of prior work. The method is clear but not precisely described. The results are promising. I think that this is a good approach to the problem that could be used in real-world scenarios. With some filling out, this could be a great paper.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [],

"content": {"title": "Nice continual learning study", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "review": "This paper describes PLAID, a method for sequential learning and consolidation of behaviours via policy distillation; the proposed method is evaluated in the context of bipedal motor control across several terrain types, which follow a natural curriculum.\n\nPros:\n- PLAID masters several distinct tasks in sequence, building up \u201cskills\u201d by learning \u201crelated\u201d tasks of increasing difficulty.\n- Although the main focus of this paper is on continual learning of \u201crelated\u201d tasks, the authors acknowledge this limitation and convincingly argue for the chosen task domain.\n\nCons:\n- PLAID seems designed to work with task curricula, or sequences of deeply related tasks; for this regime, classical transfer learning approaches are known to work well (e.g finetunning), and it is not clear whether the method is applicable beyond this well understood case.\n- Are the experiments single runs? Due to the high amount of variance in single RL experiments it is recommended to perform several re-runs and argue about mean behaviour.\n\nClarifications:\n- What is the zero-shot performance of policies learned on the first few tasks, when tested directly on subsequent tasks?\n- How were the network architecture and network size chosen, especially for the multitasker?

I think overall it is a good idea. But I find the paper lacking a lot of details and to some extend confusing. \nHere are a few comments that I have:\n\nFigure 2 is very confusing for me. Please first of all make the figures much larger. ICLR does not have a strict page limit, and the figures you have are hard to impossible to read. So you train in (a) on the steps task until 350k steps? Is (b), (d),(c) in a sequence or is testing moving from plain to different things? The plot does not explicitly account for the distillation phase. Or at least not in an intuitive way. But if the goal is transfer, then actually PLAID is slower than the MultiTasker because it has an additional cost to pay (in frames and times) for the distillation phase right? Or is this counted. \n\nGoing then to Figure 3, I almost fill that the MultiTasker might be used to simulate two separate baselines. Indeed, because the retention of tasks is done by distilling all of them jointly, one baseline is to keep finetuning a model through the 5 stages, and then at the end after collecting the 5 policies you can do a single consolidation step that compresses all. So it will be quite important to know if the frequent integration steps of PLAID are helpful (do knowing 1,2 and 3 helps you learn 4 better? Or knowing 3 is enough). \n\nWhere exactly is input injection used? Is it experiments from figure 3. What input is injecting? What do you do when you go back to the task that doesn't have the input, feed 0? What happens if 0 has semantics ? \n\nPlease say in the main text that details in terms of architecture and so on are given in the appendix. And do try to copy a bit more of them in the main text where reasonable. \n\nWhat is the role of PLAID? Is it to learn a continual learning solution? So if I have 100 tasks, do I need to do 100-way distillation at the end to consolidate all skills? Will this be feasible? Wouldn't the fact of having data from all the 100 tasks at the end contradict the traditional formulation of continual learning? \n \nOr is it to obtain a multitask solution while maximizing transfer (where you always have access to all tasks, but you chose to sequentilize them to improve transfer)?  And even then maximize transfer with respect to what? Frames required from the environment? If that are you reusing the frames you used during training to distill? Can we afford to keep all of those frames around? If not we have to count the distillation frames as well. Also more baselines are needed. A simple baseline is just finetunning as going from one task to another, and just at the end distill all the policies found through out the way.  Or at least have a good argument of why this is suboptimal compared to PLAID. \n\nI think the idea of the paper is interesting and I'm willing to increase (and indeed decrease) my score. But I want to make sure the authors put a bit more effort into cleaning up the paper, making it more clear and easy to read. Providing at least one more baseline (if not more considering the other things cited by them). \n\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Progressive Reinforcement Learning with Distillation for Multi-Skilled Motion Control", "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has demonstrated increasing capabilities for continuous control problems,\nincluding agents that can move with skill and agility through their environment. \nAn open problem in this setting is that of developing good strategies for integrating or merging policies\nfor multiple skills, where each individual skill is a specialist in a specific skill and its associated state distribution. \nWe extend policy distillation methods to the continuous action setting and leverage this technique to combine \\expert policies,\nas evaluated in the domain of simulated bipedal locomotion across different classes of terrain.\nWe also introduce an input injection method for augmenting an existing policy network to exploit new input features.\nLastly, our method uses transfer learning to assist in the efficient acquisition of new skills.\nThe combination of these methods allows a policy to be incrementally augmented with new skills.\nWe compare our progressive learning and integration via distillation (PLAID) method\nagainst three alternative baselines.", "pdf": "/pdf/71ba098440582330f4a76c53a49ac5abb153f23f.pdf", "TL;DR": "A continual learning method that uses distillation to combine expert policies and transfer learning to accelerate learning new skills.", "paperhash": "berseth|progressive_reinforcement_learning_with_distillation_for_multiskilled_motion_control", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nberseth2018progressive,\ntitle={Progressive Reinforcement Learning with Distillation for Multi-Skilled Motion Control},\nauthor={Glen Berseth and Cheng Xie and Paul Cernek and Michiel Van de Panne},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=B13njo1R-},\n}", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Distillation", "Transfer Learning", "Continual Learning"], "authors": ["Glen Berseth", "Cheng Xie", "Paul Cernek", "Michiel Van de Panne"], "authorids": ["gberseth@gmail.com", "cheng.k.xie@gmail.com", "pcernek@cs.ubc.ca", "van@cs.ubc.ca"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "duedate": 1511845199000, "tmdate": 1515642401029, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper162/Official_Review", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper162/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper162/AnonReviewer3", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper162/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper162/AnonReviewer4"], "reply": {"forum": "B13njo1R-", "replyto": "B13njo1R-", "writers": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper162/AnonReviewer[0-9]+", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "review": {"required": true, "order": 2, "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}"}, "rating": {"required": true, "order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough -

 do all previous expert policies need to be kept in memory?\nWe have added the following paragraph to the paper Appendix to address this.\n   For each of the distillation steps we initialize the policy from the most recently trained policy. This policy has seen all of the tasks thus far but may have overfit the most recent tasks. We us a version of the DAGGER algorithm for the distillation process (Ross et al., 2010). We anneal from select- ing actions from the expert policies to selecting actions from the student policy The probability of selecting an action from the expert is annealed to near zero after 10, 000 training updates. We still add exploration noise to the policies when generating actions to take in the simulation. This is also annealed along with the probability of selecting from the expert policy. The actions used for training always come from the expert policy. Although some actions are applied in the simulation from the student, during a training update those actions will be replaced with ones from the proper expert. The expert used to generate actions for tasks 0 \u2212 i is \u03c0i and the expert used to generate action for task i + 1 is \u03c0i+1. We keep around at most 2 policies at any time.\n\nRe: purpose of input injection\nWe have added further details and explanations to the paper. Specifically, the \u201cflat\u201d walking is not provided with information about the upcoming terrain, while other policies (e.g., incline, steps, slopes, gaps) are provided with extra inputs (a linear height map) of the upcoming terrain.  Input injection allows for the \u201cflat\u201d walking policy to be used as the starting point for policies that have these additional inputs.\n\n\n\nRe: comparisons with prior work\nWe compare the PLAID method to three other baselines, two of which are in the paper (MultiTasker, Parallel-Learn-then-Distill), and an additional baseline that we will soon have completed in response to the feedback (Successive Transfers then Distill).  \nIn what follows below, we comment further on other specific previous work.\nProgressive nets: While this is only tested on discrete actions, the idea itself is orthogonal to this issue. However, the existing baselines using DeepRL are not very applicable for different reasons. For the progressive net, you will get a set of experts in one net but the net itself does not know which expert to choose when it is given a task, i.e., which head of the network to choose.\nAttend Adapt and Transfer:  This method explains how to combine K experts in learning task T_i but it is not obvious how it would extend to learning T_i+1.\nLifelong Learning in Minecraft: This relies on options with clear end definitions in sequential tasks. It is not directly obvious how this could be applied to our domain with continuously varying terrain and continuous actions.\nDistral:  This trains multiple policies in parallel, rather than one policy continually, and so it is largely captured by one of our baselines.

For example if we give the MultiTasker 300k iterations, for PLAID we may use 250k for transfer and 50k for distillation. We show this in Figure 2 by colouring the TL phase in green and the distillation phase in red.\n\nRe: Frequent distillation vs fine-tuning a model through all stages plus a final distillation step\n\nThis is an excellent idea for an additional baseline, and we are currently running this \u201cSuccessive Transfers then Distill\u201d baseline. We will notify the reviewers of the results, as well as update the paper. The results for this new baseline thus far look very similar to that of the MultiTasker; it has a more difficult time learning the additional tasks. We also note that we seek a method that would work when the agent is given new tasks it does not know are coming. For example, after learning to walk on \u201cincline\u201d terrain, the agent does not know about the next three (steps, slopes and gaps), but we want the agent to best prepared to learn it\u2019s next skill, whatever it may be.\n\nRe: details on input injection\nWe have added further details and explanations to the paper. Specifically, the \u201cflat\u201d walking is not provided with information about the upcoming terrain, while other policies (e.g., incline, steps, slopes, gaps) are provided with extra inputs (a linear height map) of the upcoming terrain.  Input injection allows for the \u201cflat\u201d walking policy to be used as the starting point for policies that have these additional inputs.\n\nRe:  role of PLAID: continual learning  vs  multitask-solution with maximum transfer\nWe view PLAID as a continual learning method, in that we consider the problem of not knowing all tasks beforehand and want to learn any new task as easily/quickly as possible.\nHowever, it is also proves surprisingly effective as a multitask solution, given the three specific benchmarks that we compare against.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Progressive Reinforcement Learning with Distillation for Multi-Skilled Motion Control", "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has demonstrated increasing capabilities for continuous control problems,\nincluding agents that can move with skill and agility through their environment. \nAn open problem in this setting is that of developing good strategies for integrating or merging policies\nfor multiple skills, where each individual skill is a specialist in a specific skill and its associated state distribution. \nWe extend policy distillation methods to the continuous action setting and leverage this technique to combine \\expert policies,\nas evaluated in the domain of simulated bipedal locomotion across different classes of terrain.\nWe also introduce an input injection method for augmenting an existing policy network to exploit new input features.\nLastly, our method uses transfer learning to assist in the efficient acquisition of new skills.\nThe combination of these methods allows a policy to be incrementally augmented with new skills.\nWe compare our progressive learning and integration via distillation (PLAID) method\nagainst three alternative baselines.", "pdf": "/pdf/71ba098440582330f4a76c53a49ac5abb153f23f.pdf", "TL;DR": "A continual learning method that uses distillation to combine expert policies and transfer learning to accelerate learning new skills.", "paperhash": "berseth|progressive_reinforcement_learning_with_distillation_for_multiskilled_motion_control", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nberseth2018progressive,\ntitle={Progressive Reinforcement Learning with Distillation for Multi-Skilled Motion Control},\nauthor={Glen Berseth and Cheng Xie and Paul Cernek and Michiel Van de Panne},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=B13njo1R-},\n}", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Distillation", "Transfer Learning", "Continual Learning"], "authors": ["Glen Berseth", "Cheng Xie", "Paul Cernek", "Michiel Van de Panne"], "authorids": ["gberseth@gmail.com", "cheng.k.xie@gmail.com", "pcernek@cs.ubc.ca", "van@cs.ubc.ca"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "duedate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "tmdate": 1512791691998, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper162/Public_Comment", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["~"], "reply": {"replyto": null, "forum": "B13njo1R-", "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*|\\(anonymous\\)"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*|\\(anonymous\\)", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "value-dropdown": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Authors_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Reviewers_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Area_Chairs_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 0, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper162/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper162/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper162/Area_Chair"], "cdate": 1512791691998}}}], "count": 11}
