I scored the paper in standard way. \n\nThe paper evaluates LSTM vs kalman filter on particle tracking problem in high-energy physics, using simulated data. The paper presents a well-motivated problem, but provides no significant results/novel insights.\n\nPros: \n-Well-motivated problem\n-Part of interesting open project: https://heptrkx.github.io/\n\nCons:\n-Experimental results are not surprising nor conclusive. Imperfect training, insufficient network capacity or expressivity, overfitting, limited data, etc. can easily cause LSTM to underperform best kalman filter with expert knowledge. Experimental descriptions do not show sufficient depths in evaluation.\n-The motivated problem/solution is not novel. There are a number of prior work that can be cited for nonlinear state estimation with neural network or combining prior with neural net. Structured VAE (Johnson et. al., 2016), deep KF (Krishnan et. al., 2015), for example, explored incorporating structured prior with rich neural network parametrized observation model. Backprop KF (Haarnoja et. al., 2016) combined discriminative training into state estimation and avoided some problems of these generative model papers.  \n-Run-time of different implementations should be detailed with scalability analysis, as that is one of the main motivations.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Exploring the role of deep learning for particle tracking in high energy physics", "abstract": "Tracking particles in a collider is a challenging problem due to collisions, imperfections in sensors and the nonlinear trajectories of particles in a magnetic field.
