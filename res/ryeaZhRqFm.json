Our main contribution is a unified framework for both the settings and our proposed solution is conceptually simple, yet effective. We believe the problem settings are important and interesting (as noted by the other reviewers too), and that this paper will inspire further research in this direction.\n\n\n\nOn comparison with PinSage [Ying et al. KDD 2018]:\nPinSage has been designed to work on the bipartite graph of Pinterest. The Pinterest graph can be seen as the star expansion of a hypergraph with pins (hypernodes) on one side of the partition and boards (hyperlinks) on the other side. Following the reviewer\u2019s suggestion, we have compared NHP against star expansion below.\n\n\n\nOn comparison with node2vec:\nFollowing the reviewer\u2019s suggestion, we have compared NHP against node2vec. Node2vec has been shown to be superior to DeepWalk and LINE in [Grover et al. KDD 2016] and hence we have compared only against it. We have also compared NHP against CMM+MLP as suggested by reviewer #2. We report only the number of reactions recovered in the undirected hypergraph experiments.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndataset\t\t\t\t  \t       iAF692\t           iHN637\t               iAF1260b\t              iJO1366\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nnode2vec \t\t\t\t     299 +/- 10\t          303 +/- 4\t     1100 +/- 13\t          1221 +/- 21\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGCN on star expansion\t            174 +/- 5\t         219 +/- 12\t      649 +/- 10\t           568 +/- 18\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNHP-U (ours)\t\t\t            313 +/- 6\t          360 +/- 5\t     1258 +/- 9\t           1381 +/- 9\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe request the reviewer to see the updated paper for AUC numbers. We have updated the results for all the other datasets and experiments and we request the reviewer to see the paper.\n\nFrom the table above, we can see that the star expansion of a hypergraph is less effective because there are no direct connections between chemical reactions (because the graph is bipartite). Clique expansion, on the other hand, connects two chemical reactions if they share a chemical substance and hence can exploit the relationships much better.\n\n\n\nOn the size of the datasets used:\nOur work was motivated by the task of predicting reactions, for which we used datasets already available in the literature (given by Zhang et. al, AAAI 2018). Regarding the co-authorship datasets used, we had to filter the large datasets already available to ensure that meaningful hyperlinks were obtained which led to some reduction in size. We request the reviewer to take a look at the appendix for the exact details.\n\n\n\nOn simultaneous learning of node and edge embeddings:\nNHP, our proposed method, learns node embeddings in the dual hypergraph which is the same as learning hyperlink embeddings in the primal.  While PinSage works on the Pinterest bipartite graph (star expansion) and hence involves simultaneous learning of node/edge embeddings, NHP works on the clique expansion and learns node embeddings of the dual."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1218/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1218/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1218/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Link Prediction in Hypergraphs using Graph Convolutional Networks", "abstract": "Link prediction in simple graphs is a fundamental problem in which new links between nodes are predicted based on the observed structure of the graph.

The approach first applies an existing dual transformation to the hypergraph such that the link prediction problem (in the primal) becomes a node classification problem in the dual. They then use GCNs to classify the (dual) nodes. Experimentally, the proposed approach marginally outperforms existing approaches.\n\n=== Major comments\n\nI found the novelty of the proposed approach rather limited. The proposed approach essentially just concatenates three existing strategies (dual reformulation from Scheinerman and Ullman, GCNs from Kipf and Welling, and negative sampling which is common in many communities, e.g., Han and Chen, but many others, as well). I believe the contribution for link prediction in directed hypergraphs is a more novel contribution, however, I had difficulty following that discussion.\n\nIt is difficult to interpret the experimental results. Tables 3 and 6 do not include a measure of variance. Thus, it is not clear if any of the results are statistically significant. It is also not clear whether the \u201c10 trials\u201d mentioned in the figure captions correspond to a 10-fold cross-validation scheme or something else. It is unclear to me what the random feature matrix for the metabolic network is supposed to me or do. It is also unclear to me why \u201cfake papers\u201d are needed for the citation networks; it is clear that \u201cfake author lists\u201d are needed for negative sampling, but it seems they could be attached to existing papers. Similarly, it is unclear how the set of candidate edges (\\mathcal{E}) was chosen.\n\nI appreciate that the authors made the code available. I did not run it, but I did have a look, and I believe it could be adapted by others without an unreasonable amount of work.\n\n=== Minor comments\n\nThis work is very similar to the arXiv submission 1809.09401. To the best of my knowledge, though, that work has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed venue, so I do not consider it a problem that it is not cited here.\n\nAccording to Tables 1 and 2, iAF692 and iHN637 datasets are smaller than the other datasets except DBLP; those two are also less dense than DBLP. According to Table 3, NHP-U seems noticeably better than SHC and CMM on the, while does not appear very significant in the other cases. Is there some relationship between NHP\u2019s performance and the size/density of the graph? or is there some other explanation for this behavior?\n\nRelated to the above point, Table 3 shows that the performance on the undirected versions for those two datasets is better than on the other two metabolic networks, while Table 6 shows the opposite for the directed versions. Is there some explanation for this? For example, are there qualitative differences in the size of the hypernodes?\n\nThe described strategy for negative sampling seems as though it selects \u201ceasy\u201d negative samples, in the sense that they are far away from observed positives; thus, they are also likely far away from any sort of decision boundary. How does the performance change if more \u201cdifficult\u201d (or just uniformly random) negative samples are chosen?\n\nI believe Recall@100 (or Precision@100, or @$\\Delta E$, etc.) is a more meaningful value to report in Tables 4 and 7, rather than the raw number of edges. That is, it would be more helpful to report something so that numbers across datasets are at least somewhat comparable.\n\n=== Typos, etc.\n\nIn Equation (4), the \u201ck\u201d index in d_{ijk} is in {1,2}, but in the text, it is in {0,1}.\n\n\u201ctable 2\u201d -> \u201cTable 2\u201d, and many other similar examples throughout the paper.\n\n\u201chigher-order etc.\u201d -> \u201chigher-order, etc.\u201d\n\u201cGCN based\u201d -> \u201cGCN-based\u201d, and similar in several places in the paper\n\u201ca incomplete\u201d -> \u201can incomplete\u201d\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1218/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Link Prediction in Hypergraphs using Graph Convolutional Networks", "abstract": "Link prediction in simple graphs is a fundamental problem in which new links between nodes are predicted based on the observed structure of the graph.

Following prior work, the hyperlink prediction is perform in the dual hypergraph, where each node represents a hyperlink in the primal hypergraph. The original problem is then equivalent to a simple node classification problem. To deal with directed hyperlink, a separate term is added to distinguish heads from tails.\n\nThe problem of link prediction in hypergraph is important and interesting, especially in the chemistry domain. However from the technical point of view, this work is somewhat incremental since prior work has done link prediction using GCN (Zhang and Chen, 2018). The idea of performing hyperlink prediction in the dual hypergraph is not new, either (Lugo-Martinez and Radivojac, 2017). As for the directed hypergraph setting, it seems to be a straightforward extension once one knows how to do in the undirected setting (adding an extra term to classify head/tail).\n\nIn terms of experiments, given the similarity between Lugo-Martinez and Radivojac, 2017 and NHP (both operates in the dual hypergraph), it would be better if the former could also be used as a baseline, as least in the undirected setting.\n\nIt is reasonable to have a subset of links as candidate reactions in the metoboli network datasets. For CORA and DBLP, it is not clear where the \u2018actual papers\u2019 and \u2018candidate papers\u2019 come from. For example in CORA there are 1072 authors; yet there are only 5416 candidate papers.\n\nIt seems the joint learning of NHP-D does not improve the accuracy in the directed setting as claimed in Sec. 5.2. Besides, there is no baseline in the directed setting. It is difficult to appreciate the performance in Sec. 6. One thing one can do is to use previous methods in the undirected setting, e.g., CMM, with the extra term L_d in Eq. (4).\n\nMinor comments:\nTypo: \nP5: atleast -> at least\nP5: What is GCN 2?\nSec. 5: \u2018p = 32 in 1\u2019 and \u2018shown in 2\u2019\n\nMissing references on link prediction and/or deep learning:\nDiscriminative relational topic models.
