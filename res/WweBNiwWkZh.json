However it looks to me that this paper is more suited to the graphics conference like SIGGRAPH.\n\nThe paper present a new method for cloth deformation based on tetrahedral KDSM mesh, to make the deformation more natural the neural network is used to predict the offsets  that match the ground truth deformation. Differently from Jin et al. (2020), in this paper volumetric region of air surrounding the underlying body  is used.\n\nThe are several questions about the experimental part of the paper.\n\n1. The paper only compares on a single dataset of the Tshirts. So it is not clear how well the model will perform on other types of  clothes: regular shirts, dresses and so on.  The paper however claims that the method could be potentially to more broad categories such as hair and fluids. Is it possible to add more comparisons on the other clothes or object types?\n\n2. How the dataset of Tshirt meshes been obtained, is it synthetically generated? If it is synthetically generated what is the benefit of using data-driven learning method? Could the method be applied on the real world scanned meshes?\n\nMinor issues:\n- Figure 1(d) looks not intuitive, does not look like (d) is modification of (c) and (d) does not look as shirt at all. It is better to use some small modification to make it more intuitive.\n- Supplementary material should go along with the paper as a set of Appendixes. Only videos and source code should go as zip archive.\n- Paper contain weird green artifacts in the end of first and second pages which should be removed.\n- It is hard to switch attention from Figure 3 to Figure 4, these figures should be joined.\n\n\u2014-------\u2014---------------\n\nThe rebuttal did not change neither my confidence, nor my impression about the paper. So I did not change my rating, however I acknowledged that other reviews may be more proficient to judge this paper properly.

It is not clear how it performs on real world data like BUFF [6].\u201d**\n\nThe dataset we used was generated by scanning a real T-shirt and body. The BUFF dataset was generated by scanning people in clothing, which does not produce separate garment and body meshes. Thus, BUFF cannot be used as ground truth data for the problem we address: inferring cloth shape from pose.**\n\n**\u201cAt the end of Sec. 6, the authors claim that \u201cthe hybrid method is able to achieve greater temporal consistency\u201d. It is not clearly which component of the method enforces temporal consistency.\u201d**\n\nThe hybrid method robustly resolves embedding ambiguities caused by inverted and overlapping tetrahedra. This reduces variance in d(theta) and subsequently results in more accurate network predictions. Since the hybrid method inference results are closer to the ground truth, this naturally leads to greater temporal consistency.\n\n**\u201cIn Sec. 5, the authors elaborate on how to robustly handle tetrahedra inversion and overlapping when generating training examples. Being depicted in natural language, the entire process is too complicated for readers to follow. For example, the sentence \u201cWe prune this list of tetrahedra, keeping only the most robust tetrahedron near each element boundary \u2026\u201d makes readers wonder how the robust tetrahedron and element boundary are defined. It would be better if the authors can provide a piece of pseudocode to explain the entire process in a compact and precise manner. A graphic illustration of the key operations would also be helpful for readers to understand the process.\u201d**\n\nThanks for this suggestion - we have updated the sentence mentioned as follows and hope that this clears any confusion: *\u201cWe prune this list to remove tetrahedra that may be subject to numerical precision errors that could cause a vertex to erroneously be identified as inside multiple or no tetrahedra.\u201d*\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper693/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper693/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Skinning a Parameterization of Three-Dimensional Space for Neural Network Cloth", "authorids": ["~Jane_Wu2", "zhenglin@stanford.edu", "hui.zhou@jd.com", "~Ronald_Fedkiw1"], "authors": ["Jane Wu", "Zhenglin Geng", "Hui Zhou", "Ronald Fedkiw"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "We present a novel learning framework for cloth deformation by embedding virtual cloth into a tetrahedral mesh that parametrizes the volumetric region of air surrounding the underlying body.

The paper only compares on a single dataset of the Tshirts. So it is not clear how well the model will perform on other types of clothes: regular shirts, dresses and so on. The paper however claims that the method could be potentially to more broad categories such as hair and fluids. Is it possible to add more comparisons on the other clothes or object types?\u201d**\n\nIn our supplemental material, we demonstrate that our method can be applied to different body shapes and cloth sizes. The dataset available to us is specific to T-shirts, and we leave long shirts, dresses, etc. to future work. However, our work can directly be applied to these other clothing types as any item of clothing can be embedded in the KDSM.\n\n**\u201c2. How the dataset of Tshirt meshes been obtained, is it synthetically generated? If it is synthetically generated what is the benefit of using data-driven learning method? Could the method be applied on the real world scanned meshes?\u201d**\n\nThe T-shirt meshes we used in our paper were generated by scanning a real T-shirt and simulating the cloth for each pose via physical simulation. We have updated Section 6 to add further details on the dataset we used. Our method can directly be applied to any real world scanned T-shirt mesh.\n\n**\u201cFigure 1(d) looks not intuitive, does not look like (d) is modification of (c) and (d) does not look as shirt at all. It is better to use some small modification to make it more intuitive.\u201d**\n\nWe would like to clarify that Figure 1(d) is the result of skinning 1(c) to a new pose from the T-pose (no shirt involved).\n\n**\u201cSupplementary material should go along with the paper as a set of Appendixes.

[...]\u201d**\n\nPlease see our submission update comment above for details on why we believe our submission is best suited for a machine learning conference.\n\n**\u201c2. After reading the paper, I eventually feel I understand this method. Important details are left out effecting replicability (see below). The paper does not clearly state what the input and output is. The paper does not describe how groundtruth data is generated.\u201d**\n\nPlease refer to Section 6, \u201cNetwork Training\u201d where we describe the input and output of the network, as well as the respective dimensions. In particular, we state:\n\n*\u201cGiven joint transformation matrices of shape 1x1x90 for pose \\theta, the network applies transpose convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation layers. The output of the network is 128x128x6, where the first three dimensions represent the predicted displacements for the front side of the T-shirt, and the last three dimensions represent those for the back side.\u201d*\n\nWe have updated Section 6 to add further details on how the dataset we used was generated.\n\n**\u201c\"This is done by first sorting the tetrahedra on the list based on their largest minimum barycentric weight, i.e. preferring tetrahedra the vertex is deeper inside\" I don't understand this. [...]\u201d**\n\nFirst, we are using the largest minimum barycentric weight rather than just barycentric weights in general. It is true that barycentric weights are largest when near a vertex, but we are looking for the tetrahedron such that the largest weight among the four vertices is the smallest (similar to concept of depth but notably different). Thus, we are not finding the tetrahedron with the largest Euclidean depth, but rather the tetrahedron that the vertex is most centered inside.\n\n**\u201cI didn't understand \"method 2\". In that method is the tet mesh entirely ignored?\u201d**\n\nNo, the tet mesh is not ignored in Method 2. In Method 2, we apply UVN offsets to the cloth in the T-pose (material space), and subsequently deform the KDSM to generate the cloth in the specific pose (theta). \n\n**\u201cIs Figure 4 showing training data or withheld testing poses?\u201d**\n\nFigures 3-7 show training data examples.\n\n**\u201c3. The paper immediately jumps into the idea of embedding the cloth of a t-shirt in a bulbous tetrahedral mesh around the upper body. This isn't questioned until later when all sorts of issues appear due to overlapping and inverted elements. [...]\u201d**\n\nInverted and overlapping tetrahedra arise due to skinning the mesh, but we handle such cases robustly via the hybrid method. We also note that addressing inversion and robustness is only done once when generating the training data - it is not a step during network inference.\n\n**\u201cWhy not, for example, instead learn the skinning weights and displacements directly? [...]\u201d**\n\nThe skinning weights for the tetrahedral mesh do not need to be learned. They are procedurally generated via linear blend skinning.\n\n**\u201c4. This paper is far from replicable. How is the groundtruth data computed? Some cloth simulation? Which method? Are collisions handled in that method?\u201d**\n\nOur paper is completely replicable - the ground truth data is from Jin et al. 2020, and we detail our network architecture and training/evaluation methods in Section 6. We also present both qualitative and quantitative results for all three methods discussed with regards to inversion and robustness.\n\n**\u201cWhy does the surface boundary in Figure 1 (c) look so spiky yet the input level set is smooth? [...]\u201d**\n\nWe do use a red green strategy for meshing. Because we are building a skinned volume around the body, there is no reason to compress it to conform to the exact shape of the thickened level set.\n\n**\u201cHow are the weights wkj determined? Manually? Automatically? Optimized during training? This appears to be crucial to the method but left out.\u201d**\n\nPlease see the second paragraph of Section 3 for details on how skinning weights are assigned to the KDSM. In particular, we use linear blend skinning.\n\n**\u201c5. [...] Even if I accepted this paper as successful in its results (I do not), then this paper could at best claim to have skinned a parameterization of t-shirt deformations for upper-body motions. [...]\u201d**\n\nThe title of our paper summarizes our primary contribution in this paper. We demonstrate that our KDSM framework outperforms current state-of-the-art cloth shape prediction, e.g. predicting vertex offsets from the body surface, and provide both qualitative and quantitative examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can be directly extended to different body models/shapes and T-shirt sizes.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper693/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper693/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Skinning a Parameterization of Three-Dimensional Space for Neural Network Cloth", "authorids": ["~Jane_Wu2", "zhenglin@stanford.edu", "hui.zhou@jd.com", "~Ronald_Fedkiw1"], "authors": ["Jane Wu", "Zhenglin Geng", "Hui Zhou", "Ronald Fedkiw"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "We present a novel learning framework for cloth deformation by embedding virtual cloth into a tetrahedral mesh that parametrizes the volumetric region of air surrounding the underlying body.

In this paper, our primary contribution is a novel machine learning method whereby high frequency 3D detail is predicted by embedding data in a low frequency parameterization, e.g. a skinned tetrahedral mesh. Predicting high frequency detail is particularly challenging for the specific application of cloth inference where regularization often leads to overly smooth cloth predictions. With this challenge in mind, we demonstrate that training a neural network using our KDSM framework shows significant improvement over current state-of-the-art, e.g. predicting offsets from the body surface.

The idea is mainly based on KDSM[1]. Lack of experiment makes it not very convincing.", "review": "This paper proposes to model 3D cloth by embedding it into kinematically deforming skinned mesh (KDSM)[1], a tetrahedral mesh that parametrizes the volumetric region around the underlying body. A KDSM can be created and deformed using a variety of skinning and simulation techniques introduced in [1]. This paper extends KDSM by enabling plastic deformation in material space (T-pose), and accurately models the cloth deformation as per-vertex offsets. Inspired by [2], this paper trains a neural network to learn the per-vertex offset as a function of body pose. Once trained, the network is able to infer the 3D cloth on a particular body. Experiments show that the proposed 3D cloth parameterization method is better than the 2D UV parameterization method used in [2].\n\nStrengths\n- This paper proposes a new approach to modeling 3D cloth deformation. Experiments demonstrate that it outperforms the UV parameterization method on modeling the per-vertex offset as a function of body pose. It has the potential to be applied to other cloth-related tasks.\n- This paper successfully adapts KDSM, which is originally used for hair modeling, to clothes. The inversion and robustness issues are addressed. It would be inspiring for other researchers to apply the similar idea on other types of objects.\n- This paper is clearly organized and well-written. There are sufficient technical details presented in the paper.\n\nWeaknesses\n- Some existing works parameterize cloth deformation based on SMPL, e.g., SMPL+D [3], TailorNet [4], Tex2Shape [5].  This paper lacks the comparison with these closely related methods. Therefore, it is not clear whether the proposed KDSM-based cloth parameterization method is better than existing SMPL-based methods.\n- There is only experimentation on synthetic data. It is not clear how it performs on real world data like BUFF [6].\n- At the end of Sec. 6, the authors claim that \u201cthe hybrid method is able to achieve greater temporal consistency\u201d. It is not clearly which component of the method enforces temporal consistency.\n\nSuggestion\n- In Sec. 5, the authors elaborate on how to robustly handle tetrahedra inversion and overlapping when generating training examples. Being depicted in natural language, the entire process is too complicated for readers to follow. For example, the sentence \u201cWe prune this list of tetrahedra, keeping only the most robust tetrahedron near each element boundary \u2026\u201d makes readers wonder how the robust tetrahedron and element boundary are defined. It would be better if the authors can provide a piece of pseudocode to explain the entire process in a compact and precise manner.

The method is trained (as far as I can tell) on some\ngroundtruth cloth simulation method (this is not revealed).\n\nI recommend rejecting this paper from ICLR 2021 on several grounds: 1) the\nresults are poor, 2) the description is hard to follow, 3) the methodological\nchoices are not well motivated, 4) the method as written is not reproducible,\nand 5) the claims are too general.\n\n1) In terms of topic and methodology this paper would be an appropriate\nsubmission to SIGGRAPH or SCA. Callibrating for the expected result quality at\neither venue, I would recommend acceptance. Since the machine learning component\nof this paper is not a contribution besides being an application of\n\"off-the-shelf\" tools, I do not see reason to lower these standards for ICLR.\n\n2) After reading the paper, I eventually feel I understand this method. \nImportant details are left out effecting replicability (see below). The paper\ndoes not clearly state what the input and output is. The paper does not describe\nhow groundtruth data is generated. \n\n\"This is done by first sorting the tetrahedra on the list based on their largest\nminimum barycentric weight, i.e. preferring tetrahedra the vertex is deeper\ninside\" I don't understand this. Barycentric weights are largest when near a\nvertex. Meanwhile tetrahedra can be very pancake/sliver-shaped, so that\nregardless of the barycentric coordinates, a point is never deep inside. Using\nbarycentric coordinates to measure depth of penetration is misguided.\n\nI didn't understand \"method 2\". In that method is the tet mesh entirely ignored?\n\nIs Figure 4 showing training data or withheld testing poses?\n\n3) The paper immediately jumps into the idea of embedding the cloth of a t-shirt\nin a bulbous tetrahedral mesh around the upper body. This isn't questioned until\nlater when all sorts of issues appear due to overlapping and inverted elements.\nThere was no reason to think that skinning such a thick tet mesh was a good idea\nin the first place. So the \"INVERSION AND ROBUSTNESS\" section is describing ad\nhoc heuristics to a problem that could have been avoided by starting with a more\nsound premise.\n\nThe working premise is that pose space deformations can be used for efficient\ncloth simulation. This is reasonable and traces its heritage to \"A powell\noptimization approach for example-based skinning in a production animation\nenvironment,\" which should probably be cited. From there, the choice of using a\nthick tet mesh comes without solid motivation. Why not, for example, instead\nlearn the skinning weights and displacements directly? So, that for a point p on\nthe cloth the final deformation is:\n\n\u2211 wi(p,\u03b8) Ti(\u03b8) (p + d(\u03b8,p))\n\n?\n\nTo generalize across body types etc., rather than the heavy handed proposed\napproach of sharing this mysteriously skinned tet mesh, the learned w and d\nfunction could be predicted based on some relative position to the rest pose and\nt-shirt size etc.\n\n4) This paper is far from replicable. How is the groundtruth data computed? Some\ncloth simulation? Which method? Are collisions handled in that method? \n\nWhy does the surface boundary in Figure 1 (c) look so spiky yet the input level\nset is smooth? This does not appear in the results of the red/green\ntetrahedralization results. This looks more like a simply clipped regular grid\ntetrahedralization.\n\nHow are the weights wkj determined? Manually? Automatically? Optimized during\ntraining? This appears to be crucial to the method but left out.\n\n5) Finally, this paper claims to provide a \"Skinning a parameterization of\nthree-dimensional space for neural network cloth\". Even if I accepted this paper\nas successful in its results (I do not), then this paper could at best claim to\nhave skinned a parameterization of t-shirt deformations for upper-body motions.\nThe fragility of the method as discussed above makes this overclaiming\nespecially dubious.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper693/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper693/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Skinning a Parameterization of Three-Dimensional Space for Neural Network Cloth", "authorids": ["~Jane_Wu2", "zhenglin@stanford.edu", "hui.zhou@jd.com", "~Ronald_Fedkiw1"], "authors": ["Jane Wu", "Zhenglin Geng", "Hui Zhou", "Ronald Fedkiw"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "We present a novel learning framework for cloth deformation by embedding virtual cloth into a tetrahedral mesh that parametrizes the volumetric region of air surrounding the underlying body.

We embed the cloth mesh vertices into this parameterization of three-dimensional space in order to automatically capture much of the nonlinear deformation due to both joint rotations and collisions. We then train a convolutional neural network to recover ground truth deformation by learning cloth embedding offsets for each skeletal pose. Our experiments show significant improvement over learning cloth offsets from body surface parameterizations, both quantitatively and visually, with prior state of the art having a mean error five standard deviations higher than ours. Without retraining, our neural network generalizes to other body shapes and T-shirt sizes, giving the user some indication of how well clothing might fit.
