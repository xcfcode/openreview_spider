Also found their extension of previous single read metagenomic classification models with DeepSets and attentional pooling layers to be well explained. However, there are two significant flaws that unfortunately make this paper incomplete as written:\n\n1) The abstract states that this paper will \"attempt to solve the task of directly predicting the distribution over the taxa of whole metagenomic read sets\". However, \"whole metagenomic read sets\" typically contain many millions of reads, whereas the maximum bag size explored in this paper is 2048.  The authors never explain how their MIL metagenomic model should be applied to a full metagenomic sequencing dataset. Should the MIL model be applied to random 2048 read subsets of the many-million read real world datasets? Should these bags of reads be sampled with or without replacement? And, when applied to a whole metagenomic read set, are the improvements in classification accuracy observed for 2048 read bags recapitulated?\n\n2) There is no comparison to standard metagenomic classification tools such as Kraken and Centrifuge. While previous work such as GeNet have compared to these tools the read generation and testing assumptions in this paper are not identical. Also, GeNet was found to be inferior to Kraken and Centrifuge in many scenarios, it would be good to know where in the spectrum of accuracy these new models fall. \n\nUpdate: Having read the rebuttal, my review stands. This paper will be much better once the authors add in estimation from full read sets and evaluate against standard tools. Presumably that will have to be for a future conference submission.

In the simpler case of DeepSets, the sum can be decomposed to a sum of sums. In other words, we can process 2048 reads at a time up to and including the MIL pooling phase and 'pause' processing there in order to get a representation for each subset of reads. We can then sum all the representations together to get a vector representation for the whole readset and continue with the execution of the rest of the network. Since we can accumulate the representations into a single vector instead of storing each individual subset representation, we can avoid any potential GPU memory issues we would have with a much larger readset.\nA similar, albeit less efficient, decomposition can be done for the attention-based pooling. For example, one could first calculate the numerator \\exp(w^T \\tanh(V x_k^T)) (Eq. 7 in the paper) for each read (processing 2048 reads a time). All the numerators need to be stored since these values need to be normalized to be between 0 and 1. Storing the numerators can be done in a secondary GPU or RAM where no other parameters of the model are stored. Normalization is then done in the secondary GPU and a single vector representing the weighted average can be transferred back to the main GPU for further processing by the remaining layers of the network. Following this approach, no additional randomness or noise is introduced to the model through sampling with/without replacement.\nWe do agree however, that this idea could be more thoroughly tested with additional experiments.\n\n\u201cThere is no comparison to standard metagenomic classification tools such as Kraken and Centrifuge\u201d\nWe agree that the inclusion of traditional alignment-based baselines such as Kraken and Centrifuge is very important. Given the limited space, we made the decision to not include traditional baselines in the manuscript and considered including state-of-the-art ML methods more important. However, we do plan to include a comparison with traditional methods in a future version of our manuscript.\n\nWe will take your feedback into account for future revisions of our paper.

We would like to address some of the issues raised.\n\n\"I also think the inclusion of the multiple instance learning framework is incremental and does not provide sufficient benefit.\"\nWe believe the novelty on the machine learning part is using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to predict a distribution over a bag of instances. Most papers on MIL in both classification and regression settings focus on bags where only some instances (called the primary instances) contribute to the label/value of the bag and there is a clear distinction between positive and negative instances [1]. To our knowledge, no paper has used MIL combined with Jensen-Shannon divergence as a loss function, for predicting distributions where all instances are likely to contribute to the final result. The increase in performance demonstrates that there is global information in the structure of a bag, that can be exploited to increase the predictive power of models, which is lost when instances are processed individually instead.\n\n\u201cI do not think there was any systematic analysis of the parameterization of their generative framework\u201d\nThe parameters used are the default values from [2]. The parameters can be modified depending on the type of microbial community being simulated. The idea was to just insert some co-occurence patterns into our simulated dataset to test our idea of exploiting the global structure in the bag in order to increase the model performance.\n\n\u201cA comparison to existing alignment-based methods is absolutely required for this work\u201d\nWe agree that the inclusion of traditional-alignment based baselines such as Kraken and Centrifuge is very important. Given the limited space, we made the decision to not include traditional baselines in the manuscript and considered including state-of-the-art ML methods more important. However, we do plan to include a comparison with traditional methods in a future version of our manuscript.\n\nMinor Points:\nGenerally, CNNs have been used for text classification before, for example in [3, 4]. As explained in the manuscript, by 'ResNet-like neural network', we refer to the neural net as described by Rojas-Carulla et al. and it is described in more detail in [5]. In addition, anonymized code has been provided which shows our implementation of the particular ResNet-like network. Indeed, a 1D kernel is used as part of the network.\n\nAgain, thank you for your feedback and if you have any further suggestions, please let us know.\n\n\n[1] Carbonneau, M.A., Cheplygina, V., Granger, E. and Gagnon, G., 2018.
