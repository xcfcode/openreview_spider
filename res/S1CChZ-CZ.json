Evaluation on the SearchQA dataset shows significant improvement over the state-of-the-art model that uses the original questions. \n\nIn general, the paper is well-written (although there are a lot of typos and grammatical errors that need to be corrected), and the main ideas are clear. It would have been useful to provide some more details and carry out additional experiments to strengthen the merit of the proposed model. \n\nEspecially, in Section 4.2, more details about the quality of paraphrasing after training with the multilingual, monolingual, and refined models would be helpful. Which evaluation metrics were used to evaluate the quality? Also, more monolingual experiments could have been conducted with state-of-the-art neural paraphrasing models on WikiQA and Quora datasets (e.g. see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.03098.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.05074.pdf). \n\nMore details with examples should be provided about the variants of AQA along with the oracle model. Especially, step-by-step examples (for all alternative models) from input (original question) to question reformulations to output (answer/candidate answers) would be useful to understand how each module/variation is having an impact towards the best possible answer/ground truth.\n\nAlthough experiments on SearchQA demonstrate good results, I think it would be also interesting to see the results on additional datasets e.g. MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016), which is very similar to the SearchQA dataset, in order to confirm the generalizability of the proposed approach. \n\n---------------------------------------------\nThanks for revising the paper, I am happy to update my scores.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Ask the Right Questions: Active Question Reformulation with Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "We frame Question Answering (QA) as a Reinforcement Learning task, an approach that we call Active Question Answering. \n\nWe propose an agent that sits between the user and a black box QA system and learns to reformulate questions to elicit the best possible answers.

In particular, a user will try a sequence of alternative queries based on the original question in order to find the answer.  The RL formulation essentially tries to mimic this process.  Although this is an interesting formulation, as promoted by some recent work, this paper does not provide compelling reasons why it's a good formulation.  The lack of serious comparisons to baseline methods makes it hard to judge the value of this work.\n\nDetailed comments/questions:\n\t1. I am actually quite confused on why it's a good RL setting. For a human user, having a series of queries to search for the right answer is a natural process, but it's not natural for a computer program.  For instance, each query can be viewed as different formulation of the same question and can be issued concurrently. Although formulated as an RL problem,  it is not clear to me whether the search result after each episode has been used as the immediate environment feedback. As a result, the dependency between actions seems rather weak.\n\t2. I also feel that the comparisons to other baselines (not just the variation of the proposed system) are not entirely fair. For instance, the baseline BiDAF model has only one shot, namely using the original question as query.  In this case, AQA should be allowed to use the same budget -- only one query.  Another more realistic baseline is to follow the existing work on query formulation in the IR community.  For example, 20 shorter queries generated by methods like [1] can be used to compare the queries created by AQA.\n\n[1] Kumaran & Carvalho. \"Reducing Long Queries Using Query Quality Predictors\". SIGIR-09\n\t\nPros:\n\t1. An interesting RL formulation for query reformulation\n\nCons:\n\t1. The use of RL is not properly justified\n\t2. The empirical result is not convincing that the proposed method is indeed advantageous \n\n---------------------------------------\n\nAfter reading the author response and checking the revised paper, I'm both delighted and surprised that the authors improved the submission substantially and presented stronger results.  I believe the updated version has reached the bar and recommend accepting this paper.

We address each point below:\n\nOther datasets\nWe agree that it will be important to extend the empirical evaluation on new datasets. Our current experimental setup cannot be straightforwardly applied to MsMarco, unfortunately. Our environment (the BiDAF QA system) is an extractive QA system. However, MsMarco contains many answers (55%) that are not substrings of the context; even after text normalization, 36% are missing. We plan to investigate the use of generative answer models for the environment with which we could extend AQA to this data. \n\nParaphrasing quality\nRegarding stand-alone evaluation of the paraphrasing quality of our models, we ran several additional experiments inspired by the suggested work.\nWe focused on the relation between paraphrasing quality and QA quality. To tease apart the relationship between paraphrasing and reformulation for QA we evaluated 3 variants of the reformulator:\n\nBase-NMT: this is the model used to initialize RL training of the agent. Trained first on the multilingual U.N. corpus, then on the Paralex corpus.\nBase-NMT-NoParalex: is the model above trained solely on the multilingual U.N. corpus, without the Paralex monolingual corpus.\nBase-NMT+Quora: is the same as Base-NMT, additionally trained on the Quora duplicate question dataset.\n\nFollowing Prakash et al. (2016) we evaluated all models on MSCOCO, selecting one out of five captions at random from Val2014 and using the other 4 as references. We use beam search, as in the paper, to compute the top hypothesis and report uncased, moses-tokenized BLEU using John Clark's multeval. [github.com/jhclark/multeval]\nThe Base-NMT model performs at 11.4 BLEU (see Table 1 for the QA eval numbers). Base-NMT-NoParalex performs poorly at 5.0 BLEU. Limiting training to the multilingual data alone also degrades QA performance: the scores of the Top Hypothesis are at least 5 points lower in all metrics, CNN scores are 2-3 points lower for all metrics.\nBy training on additional monolingual data, the Base-NMT+Quora model BLEU score improves marginally to 11.6. End-to-end QA performance also improves marginally, the maximum delta with respect to Base-NMT under all conditions is +0.5 points, but the difference is not statistically significant. Thus, adding the Quora training does not have a significant effect. This might be due to the fact that most of the improvement is captured by training on the larger Paralex data set.\n\nImproving raw paraphrasing quality as well as reformulation fluency help AQA up to a point. However, they are only partially aligned with the main task, which is QA performance. The AQA-QR reformulator has a BLEU score of 8.6, well below both Base-NMT models trained on monolingual data. AQA-QR significantly outperforms all others in the QA task. Training the agent starting from the Base-NMT+Quora model yielded identical results as starting from Base-NMT.\n\nExamples\nWe have updated Appendix A in the paper with the answers corresponding to all queries, together with their F1 scores. We also added a few examples (Appendix B) where the agent is not able to identify the correct candidate reformulation, even if present in the candidate set. We also added an appendix (C) with example paraphrases from MSCOCO from the different models.\n\nPresentation\nWe spelled and grammar checked the manuscript.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Ask the Right Questions: Active Question Reformulation with Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "We frame Question Answering (QA) as a Reinforcement Learning task, an approach that we call Active Question Answering. \n\nWe propose an agent that sits between the user and a black box QA system and learns to reformulate questions to elicit the best possible answers.

We note this when we introduce the agent in the first paragraph of Section 2; we say \u201cThe agent then generates a *set* of reformulations {q_i}\u201d rather than a sequence. \n\nIn the last line of the conclusion, we comment that we plan to extend AQA to sequential reformulations which would then depend on the previous questions/answers also. \n\n2- Baseline comparisons\nWe computed an IR baseline following [Kumaran & Carvalho, 2009] as suggested. We implemented the candidate generation method (Section 4.3) of their system to generate subquery reformulations of the original query. We choose the reformulations from the term-level subsequences of length 3 to 6. We associate each reformulation with a graph, where the vertices are the terms and the edges are the mutual information between terms. We rank the reformulations by the average edge weights of the Maximum Spanning Trees of the corresponding graphs. We keep the top 20 reformulations, the same number as we keep for the AQA agent. Then, we train a CNN to score these reformulations to identify those with above-average F1, in exactly the same way we do for the AQA agent. As suggested, we then compare this method both in terms of choosing the single top hypothesis (1 shot), and ensemble prediction (choose from 20 queries).\nWe additionally compare AQA to the Base-NMT system in the same way. This is the pre-trained monolingual seq2seq model used to initialize the RL training. We evaluate the Base-NMT model's top hypothesis (1 shot) and in ensemble mode.\n\nWe find that the AQA agent outperforms all other methods both in 1-shot prediction (top hypothesis) and using CNNs to pick a hypothesis from 20. To verify that the difference in performance is statistically significant we ran a statistical test. The null hypothesis is always rejected (p<0.00001).\nAll results are summarized and discussed in the paper.\n\nPS - After reviewing the suggested paper, and related IR literature we took the opportunity to add an IR query quality metric, QueryClarity, to our qualitative analysis at the end of the paper, in the box plot. QueryClarity contributes to our conclusion. showing that the AQA agent learns to transform the initial reformulations (Base-NMT) into ones that have higher QueryClarity, in addition to having better tf-idf and worse fluency."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Ask the Right Questions: Active Question Reformulation with Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "We frame Question Answering (QA) as a Reinforcement Learning task, an approach that we call Active Question Answering. \n\nWe propose an agent that sits between the user and a black box QA system and learns to reformulate questions to elicit the best possible answers.

The agent probes the system with, potentially many, natural language reformulations of an initial question and aggregates the returned evidence to yield the best answer. \n\nThe reformulation system is trained end-to-end to maximize answer quality using policy gradient. We evaluate on SearchQA, a dataset of complex questions extracted from Jeopardy!.
