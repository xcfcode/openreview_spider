The authors started with open fonts dataset and then applied image augmentation techniques to add distortions. Finally, the authors collected real handwritten digit data, and trained with BGAN to generate more handwritten like images with labels. The authors showed that direct training on the synthetic dataset gets 60-76% accuracy, and adding a small amount of real-world data gets a substantial improvement.\n\nPros:\n1. It's clearly written and easy to follow.\n2. The authors showcase a working example of synthetic-to-real transfer learning, which could be interesting to the broader ML community.\n\nCons:\n1. Ablation study missing. What would the results be if we just use the GAN generated part, and what if we only use the rest?\n\nOverall I think this paper is intersting, but I don't consider it to be very relevant for this Deep Generative Models for Highly Structured Data workshop, since it's a direct application of GAN and might be more relevant for OCR venues.", "rating": "2: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/DeepGenStruct/Paper46/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/DeepGenStruct/Paper46/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Seed-Augment-Train Framework for Universal Digit Classification ", "authors": ["Vinay Uday Prabhu", "Sanghyun Han", "Dian Ang Yap", "Mihail Douhaniaris", "Preethi Seshadri"], "authorids": ["vinay@unify.id", "sang@unify.id", "dyap@unify.id", "mdouhaniaris@unify.id", "preethi@unify.id"], "keywords": ["Transfer learning", "Generative models", "digit classification", "domain transfer"], "TL;DR": "Is seeding and augmentation all you need for classifying digits in any language?", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a Seed-Augment-Train/Transfer (SAT) framework that contains a synthetic seed image dataset generation procedure for languages with different numeral systems using freely available open font file datasets.
