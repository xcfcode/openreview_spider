In the related work section, although the authors put an effort to review the existing studies of subspace learning and feature selection, their relationship (similarity and/or difference) to the proposed method is not discussed. Since the idea of using subspace learning and feature selection in clustering is standard, the novelty of this work should be introduction of the integration step into neural networks, which is not significant enough in its current state.

However, a very recent work [2] has claimed that the improvements brought by those methods in these years are marginal, and related research is stuck at a bottleneck. In our ablation studies, we also tried two very classical metric learning methods (see Table 2 in the revised paper), which do not work well. \nBy contrast, our method has a very different insight, since it uses  subspace learning and feature selection to filter the noise or the redundant information of the learned features, making the learned features more compact and discriminative. \n\nAlthough there are a few previous works using subspace learning and feature selection to learn discriminative representations (see the second paragraph of ''Related Work''), none of them are integrated into neural networks, since they cannot be optimized via gradient-based algorithms. Our work is a first try to combine subspace learning and feature selection with neural networks and to train the whole framework in an end-to-end manner.\n\nIn addition, more generally speaking, our method also has verified the feasibility of using subspace learning and feature selection to help neural networks learn more discriminative features, which can be another future research direction. Researches can also focus on this direction rather than just increasing the inter-class distance or decreasing the intra-class distance.  \n\n**New Experimental Results:**\n\nWe conducted some new experiments, and the new results have been added to the revised paper.

Learning disciminative representations can usually be of benefit to  different tasks \nsuch as face clustering, recognition, object classification, since the discriminative representations can better differentiate images from different categories. Therefore, we have added additional experiments in terms of object classification on CIFAR-10 and FashionMNIST to study the generality of the module, and in this way, the proposed method becomes a multiple orthogonal subspaces learning process. The new experiments can be seen in the general comments to all reviewers above and  Table 7 in the revised paper. \nWhen the neural networks were equipped with OSD, the performance of them was improved. The improvement brought by OSD is even slightly higher than the most common margin-based method (i.e., AM-Softmax), demonstrating the generality of OSD and its potential in terms of learning superior representations. \nThus, the idea of subspace learning with feature selection is a new and valuable direction to be further explored for learning discriminative representations and improving the performance of deep models. \nAs for contrastive learning, it also would be meaningful to further explore the proposed method or the idea, but this goes  far beyond the current submission. \n\n2: We first fixed $k_1=40$ and explored $k_2$ and $u$ in Table 1. After the best $k_2$ and $u$ were found, we explored $k_1$ (see Figure 2). Therefore, the best result in Table 2 is consistent with that in Figure 2 at $k_1=70$. It can also be found out that the result at $k_1=40$ in Figure 2 is consistent with the best result in Table 1 (please see the second paragraph of ''Ablation studies'' on page 7 for more details).\n\n3: Thanks for your suggestion, but we still think that it is necessary to do the first ablation study. \nThe first ablation study is to explore hyperparameters ($k_1$, $k_2$, and $u$), which are related to how input IPSs are constructed. The performance of GCNs can be affected by the input subgraphs, so Wang *et al.* [1] searched the hyper-parameters in order to find the best ones. Concerning that the most suitable hyperparameters for OSD-LP(GCN-M) might be different from the ones for LP(GCN-M); for a fair comparison, we should follow their search procedure to find the best hyperparameters as well. After the search procedure, we found out that our best IPS hyperparameters (i.e., $k_1=70$, $k_2=5$, and $u=5$) are very close to the best hyperparameters used for LP(GCN-M) [1] (i.e., $k_1=80$, $k_2=5$, and $u=5$), and therefore, we directly pick their results on the test set to compare and report. \n \n[1] Z.

The novelty of this paper has been further summarized in the general comments to all reviewers above. Although graph-based clustering methods have been explored, there is still room for further improvement.  More importantly, although subspace learning has been explored, only a very small number of previous works combined it with feature selection for learning discriminative features (see the second paragraph of ''Related Work''), and among those works, none of them were combined with neural networks. Therefore, this is the first work to incorporate subspace learning and feature selection into neural networks for learning more discriminative representations, which is quite different from previous metric learning methods. \n\n1,3: The term ''neural networks'' refers to neural networks in general, which can be convolutional neural networks (CNN) or graph convolutional networks (GCN). In the paper, we pick GCNs and the face clustering task to verify the proposed OSD. We are sorry for the misleading representations, and please read the modified descriptions in the second and the third paragraph of ''Introduction'' in the revised paper. Note that we have also added new experiments that are conducted on CIFAR-10 and FashionMNIST for the classification task with convolutional neural networks (please see the results in the general comments to all reviewers or  Table 7 in the revised paper). The results show that the proposed OSD is effective when combined with different neural networks and can consistently improve the performance. \n\n3:  Please see Table 2 in our revised paper for new ablation studies on different combinations of the proposed terms.  \n\n2,4: We have introduced the GCN-M in the paper, please carefully read the ''LP Module'' at the bottom of page 4 and ''Implementation Details'' in the appendix. To summarize, we followed [1] by using the same number of layers and parameters in order to directly verify the effectiveness of OSD. \n\n5. Note that our contribution is just OSD, and therefore, we should compare the training time of the whole framework with and without using OSD, rather than comparing the whole framework with other SOTA frameworks. Please refer to the additional results about the training time in the first part. \n\n[1] Z. Wang, L. Zheng, Y. Li, and S. Wang.  Linkage-based face clustering via graph convolution net-work.

Please refer to the additional results (Table 1) in the general comments to all reviewers above. We show the average time of a forward-backward propagation for a given mini-batch with and without OSD, which is calculated over ten batches on averages.\n\n2. When building OSD, we directly followed the theorem and simply added those loss terms together. Since the performance has been improved, we did not further explore different combinations of the terms' weights. We are sorry that we cannot do a comprehensive grid search of those weights, since there are five terms in total and it is very hard to find the best combination. But we still use the variable-controlling approach and do a simple ablation study on the weight of these terms. Please refer to  Figure 4 and the last paragraph of ''Ablation Studies'' in the revised paper.\n \n3. The number of clusters is automatically learned rather than preset. We define the test set as $S$, and the BCubed F-measure ($F$) can be written as:\n\\begin{equation}\nF = \\frac{2PR}{P+R},\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\nP = \\frac{1}{|S|} \\sum_{i \\in S}\\frac{\\sum_{j\\in S:C(j)=C(i)}Correct(i,j)}{\\sum_{j\\in S:C(j)=C(i)} 1}, \\quad\nR =\\frac{1}{|S|} \\sum_{i \\in S}\\frac{\\sum_{j\\in S:L(j)=L(i)}Correct(i,j)}{\\sum_{j\\in S:L(j)=L(i)} 1}, \\\\\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $P$ and $R$ denote BCubed Precision and BCubed Recall.  $L(i)$ and $C(i)$ denote the ground-truth cluster label and the predicted cluster label of an instance $i$. $|S|$ is the number of instances in the test set. $Correct(i,j)$ is 1 if $L(i)=L(j)\\ \\text{and} \\ C(i)=C(j)$, otherwise $Correct(i,j)$ is 0. \nAccording to the above equations, to calculate $F$, for each instance $i$,  one should just loop all other instances (indexed by $j$) to check whether the instance $i$ and other ones belong to the same cluster. The calculation of $F$ does not need to involve the number of clusters, since we only need to check the labels between each pair of samples. \nBut $F$ can reflect the possible error of the cluster number. If the number of the predicted clusters and the ground-truth clusters are quite different, the numerator of $P$ and $R$ will not be large, and then $F$ will be low, since many instances are wrongly grouped.\n\nAs for the NMI, it can be defined as:\n\\begin{align}\nNMI(\\Omega, C) = \\frac{2(H(\\Omega) - H(\\Omega|C))}{ H(\\Omega) + H(C)},\n\\end{align}\nwhere $\\Omega$ and $C$ are the ground-truth cluster set and the predicted cluster set, respectively. $H(\\cdot)$ represents the entropy.\nTo calculate $H(\\Omega)$ or $H(C)$, one can just count the number of samples in each cluster, which is then divided by the total number of samples in the test set to get the probability $p$. The entropy can be calculated by summing $-p\\,log\\,p$ over all clusters in $\\Omega$ or $C$. \nTo calculate $H(\\Omega|C)$, for each cluster $m$ from the set $C$, one counts the number of samples belonging to each ground-truth cluster, which are then divided by the total number of samples in the cluster $m$ to get the probability $p_n^m$, where $n$ is the index of the ground-truth cluster labels in $\\Omega$. \nThen, $H(\\Omega|C)$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{|C|}\\sum_m\\sum_n-p_n^mlogp_n^m$, where $|C|$ is the number of clusters in the set $C$. \nTherefore, the calculation of NMI only needs the ground-truth cluster labels and the predicted cluster labels and does not involve the number of clusters. \nBut, NMI can reflect whether the two cluster sets have the same number of clusters. For example, if the number of clusters in $C$ is 1, which is much smaller than the number of clusters in $\\Omega$, then NMI will be very small.

Extensive experiments show that OSD outperforms state-of-the-art results with a healthy margin.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "wang|orthogonal_subspace_decomposition_a_new_perspective_of_learning_discriminative_features_for_face_clustering", "pdf": "/pdf/ed326fb015ba73dc147b35d99d1d9e63eb6bad96.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=oMjW2FavYd", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nwang2021orthogonal,\ntitle={Orthogonal Subspace Decomposition: A New Perspective of Learning Discriminative Features for Face Clustering},\nauthor={Jianfeng Wang and Thomas Lukasiewicz and zhongchao shi},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=sr68jSUakP}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
