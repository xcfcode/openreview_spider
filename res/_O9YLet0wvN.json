The studies are carried out by using siamese Faster R-CNN framework on four benchmark datasets. The most notable observation was that it was more important to increase the number of object category than to increase the number of instances per each category in order to reduce the generalization gap. This observation is very useful to anyone planning to build a dataset for this task or implement the appropriate method. Figure 5 is very important and well presented to support the main claim.\n\nHowever, there are some factors that need further studies to fully trust this observation in terms of generalization capabilities:\n1. Is it possible to get the same observations from other one-shot object detection methods other than the siamease Faster R-CNN?\n2. Can this observation be presented from using a variety of backbone methods which can be either a shallow method or a deeper CNN model?\n3. Can this claim be applied to any kind of category? (e.g., detection of person category having a more diverse appearances can be more affected by the number of instances used in training.)\n\nIn addition, why did increasing the number of categories reduce the detection accuracy of known objects? (Figure 5A) Did the method suffer from training as the number of categories increased? In other words, do we need to improve the accuracy of novel object classes at the expense of reduced detection accuracy of known classes?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1524/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1524/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Closing the Generalization Gap in One-Shot Object Detection", "authorids": ["~Claudio_Michaelis1", "~Matthias_Bethge1", "~Alexander_S_Ecker1"], "authors": ["Claudio Michaelis", "Matthias Bethge", "Alexander S Ecker"], "keywords": ["One-Shot Learning", "Few-Shot Learning", "Object Detection", "One-Shot Object Detection", "Generalization"], "abstract": "Despite substantial progress in object detection and few-shot learning, detecting objects based on a single example - one-shot object detection - remains a challenge.

Your remarks helped to make the paper better and we updated it accordingly. Below we address the two main concerns: 1. is demonstrating the effect of more categories publication worthy (R2) and 2. are the experiments sufficient to verify the effect (R3,R4). \n\n\n1. Contribution:\n\nWe would like to stress that we increase SotA on few-shot detection on COCO by 5.4% points (from 22 to 27.5) and improve generalization from seen to unseen classes from 45% to 89%. These gains are substantial and represent the largest improvements by a single paper in this field we are aware of. We updated the manuscript to make this point clearer.\n\nR2 argues that the intuition that more classes will improve performance is widely shared within the few-shot learning community, and therefore our paper does not present an important enough contribution. If this was indeed the case, why do most papers in few-shot detection still work with Pascal and COCO? Why does a dataset like Objects365 contain so many instances per class with comparably few classes instead of allocating the annotation efforts more efficiently? We agree that intuition is important in guiding the scientific process, but science also requires thorough testing of hypotheses, which is precisely what our paper does \u2013 and the results speak for themselves.\n\n\n\\\n2. Are the experiments sufficient?:\n\nR3 and R4 both note that we tested only one (comparably simple) model. They ask whether different models may already close the gap (R4) and if not if they at least showed the same behaviour. \n\nThese are good questions, and we have performed additional analyses that confirm our  original claims. Here are the short answers:\n- Our Siamese Faster R-CNN actually outperforms [1] (suggested by R4, 22.8 vs. 22.0% mAP) on COCO already without pre-training on LVIS and therefore is SotA on this task\n- Other models do not close the gap either (e.g. [1]: 22.0/40.9% mAP, i.e.55% relative performance on COCO)\n- As suggested by the reviewers and AC, we tested additional an additional model (Siamese RetinaNet), an additional Dataset (GroZi-3.2k) and 5-shot evaluation, showing that our results hold across the following conditions:\n  - 5 Datasets - COCO, LVIS, Objects365, Pascal VOC, GroZi-3.2k\n  - 2 Models - Siamese Faster R-CNN, Siamese RetinaNet\n  - 2 Backbones - ResNet-50 and ResNeXt-101_32x4d\n   - 2 Training schedules - 12 epochs (1x) adn 36 epochs (3x)\n   - One-Shot & Few-Shot evaluation\n   - Transfer evaluation COCO -> LVIS\n- Across all these dimensions, training on more categories consistently improves generalization, reduces overfitting and is more important than simply having more data.\n\n\n\\\nList of changes:\n\n- For 1. Contribution: We updated the Abstract, the conclusions in the Introduction (Section 1, bullet points), Related Work (Section 2) and the Discussion (Sections 5 & 6)\n- For 2. Are the experiments sufficient?: We added the described experiments to Sections 3, 4 and the Appendix. See especially Tables 3 & 4, Section 4.6, Appendix A.2 as well as the point-by-point comments below.\n- [R2] Add tiered vs. miniImageNet and [2]: We added a section \u201cNumber of categories in few-shot learning\u201d to related work (Section 2)\n- [R3, AC] Evaluate additional models: We added results for a single-stage detector, Siamese RetinaNet (Sections 3 & 4.6, Tables 3 & 4). The results confirm our findings with Siamese Faster R-CNN. Despite our best efforts we were not able to add the model suggested by the AC as we ran into severe problems with their implementation.\n- [R3] Does the finding hold for different backbones?: Yes, we tested ResNet-50 and ResNeXt-101_32x4d (Section 4.5)\n- [R4] Do other methods also close the gap?: No, see discussion above and updated Section 4.1\n- [R4] Make clearer that we control for dataset size: We added this to the conclusions in the Introduction (Section 1, bullet point 3) and updated Section 4.4.\n- [R4] Evaluate 5-shot: We added 5-shot results to all experiments (Tables 3 & 4, Figure 8)\n- [R1, AC] Test on a more fine-grained dataset: We trained and tested Siamese Faster R-CNN on GroZi-3.2k [3] (suggested by the AC).

There are three main differences between the two datasets: The number of classes (60 vs. 608), the number of images (60k vs 779k) and the different class structure. So while we share your intuition, we would like to stress that it is only a hypothesis. To establish that the number of classes is indeed the cause of better performance on tieredImageNet, one would have to do precisely the experiment we perform in Fig. 5 of our paper: test performance on a subset of tieredImageNet that contains only 60k images but from 600 classes. However, we are unaware of any paper having done this experiment.\n \nThus, one of our key contributions is taking exactly these points apart finding that more classes help predominantly on novel categories (Figure 5, A), that given a fixed budget of instances it is better to have more categories than more samples per category (Figure 5, B) and that these effects are robust across different class structures (curves for LVIS and Objects365 are overall very similar).\n\nWe think that this detailed analysis is an important addition that will help to better understand the key challenges in few-shot learning aiding the design of future datasets, tasks and methods. We will update our contribution and discussion sections to make clearer why this is new and why we consider it to be important.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1524/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1524/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Closing the Generalization Gap in One-Shot Object Detection", "authorids": ["~Claudio_Michaelis1", "~Matthias_Bethge1", "~Alexander_S_Ecker1"], "authors": ["Claudio Michaelis", "Matthias Bethge", "Alexander S Ecker"], "keywords": ["One-Shot Learning", "Few-Shot Learning", "Object Detection", "One-Shot Object Detection", "Generalization"], "abstract": "Despite substantial progress in object detection and few-shot learning, detecting objects based on a single example - one-shot object detection - remains a challenge.

The tiered-ImageNet is planned as a much harder dataset than for e.g. mini-ImageNet, as in tiered the train / val / test split is done using coarse categories (according to ImageNet WordNet hierarchy), so the fine classes comprising these splits are very different (in mini these are just random).\nAnd yet, in all performance tables, you would see tiered has significantly higher numbers then mini, why is that?\nWell because of the number of categories ofc!\nMini has only 60 categories in its train set, while tiered has 351!\nHaving more train categories induces a more diverse set of attributes retained by the model (it has to do it as it needs to support a diverse set of categories) and this leads to more attributes that 'fire' on the test classes (different as they are) and can be used to separate them.\n\nNow this intuition I have for quite a long time, and even put it in some papers (in general discussion style),\nso I was a bit surprised you decided to make a paper out of it :-)\nBut again, if other reviewers and the AC feel there should be one more paper stating this more explicitly and with specific experiments, then by all means - enjoy! :-)"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1524/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1524/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Closing the Generalization Gap in One-Shot Object Detection", "authorids": ["~Claudio_Michaelis1", "~Matthias_Bethge1", "~Alexander_S_Ecker1"], "authors": ["Claudio Michaelis", "Matthias Bethge", "Alexander S Ecker"], "keywords": ["One-Shot Learning", "Few-Shot Learning", "Object Detection", "One-Shot Object Detection", "Generalization"], "abstract": "Despite substantial progress in object detection and few-shot learning, detecting objects based on a single example - one-shot object detection - remains a challenge.

We want to quickly address your two central concerns.\n\nThe first concern is that increasing the number of classes also increases the number of training samples which could explain the effect. We tested exactly this scenario in Figure 5B comparing subsets with the same number of instances but from a fixed number of classes (blue) and all classes (green). We should have made this clearer in the text and will update the manuscript accordingly.\n\nThe second concern is that newer methods than Siamese Faster R-CNN may already have solved the generalization issue. We think this is a very important point and addressing it will make the paper stronger. Of the suggested models only CoAE from Hiseh et. al. evaluate on COCO improving the relative performance of Siamese Faster R-CNN from 45% to 55%. However Siamese Faster R-CNN trained on LVIS achieves 65% relative performance on COCO and 89% on LVIS. We nevertheless think it is a good idea to repeat our experiments with more models but cannot promise to adapt, train and test all three suggested methods within the two week discussion period. A somewhat realistic option would be to add a Siamese version of RetinaNet to also cover single stage detectors as well as Hsieh et al. 2019 which uses the same task setup as we do. Would adding the above discussion to the manuscript as well as the results for these two models be sufficient to address your concern?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1524/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1524/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Closing the Generalization Gap in One-Shot Object Detection", "authorids": ["~Claudio_Michaelis1", "~Matthias_Bethge1", "~Alexander_S_Ecker1"], "authors": ["Claudio Michaelis", "Matthias Bethge", "Alexander S Ecker"], "keywords": ["One-Shot Learning", "Few-Shot Learning", "Object Detection", "One-Shot Object Detection", "Generalization"], "abstract": "Despite substantial progress in object detection and few-shot learning, detecting objects based on a single example - one-shot object detection - remains a challenge.

We want to quickly address your central concern, the novelty of our findings: We agree that it is not entirely unexpected that larger datasets and more categories improve few-shot generalization. However, we are not aware of any studies that systematically investigated which dimension of the dataset size is more important: the number of categories or the number of instances? We find that the number of categories is way more important than the number of instances. For example, performance on Objects365 is unaffected when using only 10% of the instances of each class (Fig. 5B). We believe that if this result was common sense, the creators of Objects365 would probably have prioritized annotating more classes over annotating that many instances.

However, increasing the number of classes also increasing the number of training samples in your experiments, and using more training data could have higher performance. Therefore, if the total number of training images is fixed, what are the results when more classes are included?\n\n2. About the usage of Siamese Faster R-CNN\n\nThe siamese faster R-CNN is a suitable network to validate the hypothesis, but it is somewhat old even with a more powerful backbone network. If more powerful methods are used, what is the performance gap? If more powerful methods could reduce the performance gap more, I think the performance issue is not related to the number of classes.

This effect is measured by the authors by trying out the existing Siamese few-shot detector on 4 datasets: PASCAL, COCO, Objects365, and LVIS showing that the gap in performance on the seen training and the unseen (novel) testing categories is reduced when the base dataset has more classes (e.g. on LVIS where there are more than 1K classes, this \"generalization\" gap is shown to be minimal). The authors also quantify empirically the effect of increasing the model size and of prolonging the training schedule on this gap. As well as testing on COCO classes while training on LVIS.\n\nPros:\n- number of base classes is indeed an important factor in few-shot methods performance (not just in detection)\n- the paper is easy to follow and generally well written, the message conveyed is clear and the experiments are useful\n\nCons:\n- the positive effect of increasing the number of base classes on few-shot performance is long since known, and numerous works even in the few-shot classification literature have noted this fact, so nothing seems to be new here\n- the effect of increasing backbone size and prolonging the train schedule does not seem to indicate a strong correlation to the number of train classes, the original gap is maintained, while the gains of the tested modifications seem to be relatively similar up to some noise\n- I might be wrong, but it seems the authors mostly target few-shot localization, assuming the target object (given by the reference image example) is always present in the image. This is opposed to what I understand by few-shot detection, wherein a test episode there are several target objects, each accompanied by its support example and query images can have an arbitrary mix of these target objects or none at all.\n\nTo summarize: I like the paper, yet I fear it does not meet the plank of what I would consider a paper fitting ICLR standards in terms of novelty. There is nothing wrong in not proposing a new algorithm and instead - uncovering an important fact that was so far overlooked, but as I noted above this is not the case, the paper highlights a well known fact....

We hope that our findings will help to better understand the challenges of few-shot learning and encourage future data annotation efforts to focus on wider datasets with a broader set of categories rather than gathering more samples per category.", "one-sentence_summary": "The generalization gap in one-shot object detection can be closed using datasets with sufficient categories.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "michaelis|closing_the_generalization_gap_in_oneshot_object_detection", "pdf": "/pdf/61e090e70fb052b86e7d25afd2126a4042cb94a1.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=wfpa48Obz1", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nmichaelis2021closing,\ntitle={Closing the Generalization Gap in One-Shot Object Detection},\nauthor={Claudio Michaelis and Matthias Bethge and Alexander S Ecker},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=_O9YLet0wvN}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
