They claim that this approach will improve the method's data efficiency relative to standard Q-learning. They demonstrate its performance relative to Q-learning in a tabular domain, as well as in deep RL domains which use the compositional idea as an off-policy critic.\n\nOverall, the paper has interesting algorithmic ideas, but there are critical issues in the evaluation and resulting claims being made. Based on this, I am recommending rejection of the paper. I do think there is value in the compositional idea, but for different reasons outlined in the suggestions.\n\nIssues:\n\n1) The truncation of the horizon is not a novel TD formulation, as claimed in the paper. This algorithm is described in the original TD paper (Sutton, 1988) as \"prediction by a fixed interval.\" Sutton's group further has a recent paper following up on the fixed-horizon TD (FHTD) idea (De Asis et al., 2019), introducing an off-policy control variant of it.\n\n2) Based on Theorem 1 of the TD(\\Delta) paper (Romoff et al., 2019), as well as the sample-complexity arguments from the FHTD paper, this compositional algorithm is *exactly* equivalent to standard TD in the tabular setting (and function approximation if value functions don't share parameters), update for update, assuming that: (1) each value function is initialized identically, and (2) the same step size is used for each value function. An intuition for why is because the accuracy of the shifted action-values depends on the accuracy of the standard TD estimate, and the TD errors can be shown to exactly decompose that of standard TD. Under this, there is no ready improvement in data efficiency due to the fixed-horizon value functions converging quicker.\n\n3) The results in the tabular setting seem to contradict what I described in Issue 2, because compositional Q-learning as presented did converge quicker than standard Q-learning. However, this is misleading in that the other methods used a step size of 1e-3, but the step size of the shifted value functions used, without explanation, a larger step size of 1e-2. The reason for the improved performance is that these values had a step size an order of magnitude larger than the remaining ones, and if one were to use the same step size across all value functions, it would have matched Q-learning exactly. This exact decomposition is supported by how the fixed-horizon value estimates follow Q-learning's curves exactly for the first h - 1 updates (and will converge to Q-learning's curve if h approaches infinity), and can further be verified by running the provided code with a step size of 1e-3 for the shifted value functions. Without acknowledging the equivalence when using a consistent step size across value functions, as well as sweeping over step sizes for each method, the results don't present a fair comparison and significantly misrepresent compositional TD methods.\n\n4) On this observation that it is an exact decomposition of TD, it is particularly an exact decomposition of *one-step* TD, as one-step TD errors are used in the fixed-horizon and shifted value function estimates. This makes it equally biased to a one-step method, and is inconsistent with the use of \"multi-step\" learning in the literature where information across several time steps is included in the estimate of the return. Truncating and shifting things in time can be contextualized as a form of time-dependent discounting, and adjusting the discount rate isn't generally viewed as performing multi-step TD.\n\n5) Based on the above, the benefit in the deep RL setting is not convincingly due to what is claimed (as parameters are shared, and a consistent step size is used in the optimizer). Some possible reasons might include the architectural choices in how the network represented the decomposition, as well as the representation learning benefits of predicting many relevant outputs to a task.\n\nSuggestions:\n\n1) The precise novelty of the work can be clarified, as the fixed-horizon TD formulation dates back to Sutton (1988), and has been extensively studied in De Asis et al. (2019). As far as I'm aware, there's novelty in the idea of shifting value functions, reconstructing the full return from decomposed value functions, and introducing a penalty to the loss based on inconsistencies in the value estimates.\n\n2) The motivation and claims of the paper should be revised, as the claimed data efficiency from fixed-horizon values converging quicker isn't readily true. The resulting deep RL results may need more careful experiments to tease apart why the composition might be helping. For example, it might be useful to compare a different neural network architecture, like having all of the compositional components as outputs from the same, final hidden layer (in comparison with outputting them from intermediate hidden layers).\n\n3) The tabular example needs to be re-worked to ensure a fair comparison between each algorithm. For example, the curves can be presented under the best step size (in terms of some metric, like area under the curve) for each algorithm. While there is an exact equivalence to standard one-step TD methods, a real benefit of the approach is that strictly more information is present to the agent, and the flexibility of being able to use separate step sizes for each value function can be favorable if it can be shown to be better after fairly tuning each algorithm. Shifting the focus toward showing that certain types of value functions are less sensitive to step sizes or work better operating at different time-scales from other components (because this seems to be what's actually happening in the results) would be a huge plus for this.\n\n4) Because it is using one-step TD errors to estimate each of these components, and is equally biased to one-step TD, it isn't really a multi-step method. I think it would be better to emphasize the compositional aspect and its increased flexibility, than frame it as a multi-step off-policy method.\n\n----------\n\nPost-rebuttal:\n\nI think the additional results post-discussion are good, and are on the right track of the claimed goal of analyzing the algorithm. However, the new results might be contradictory to some of the claims made earlier in the paper, and so a more involved revision seems to be needed. I do believe the algorithm has promise for the reasons teased apart in our discussion, and encourage the authors to improve their paper with these results.\n\nTo detail a few things:\n\n1) The new results, which now empirically demonstrate the exact equivalence with one-step Q-learning, contradicts some claims about improved data efficiency due to truncated value-functions converging quicker. While meta-parameter selection isn't the focus, if the choice of meta-parameter is what can make it differ from vanilla Q-learning, and is the key explanation for the improvements, then the analysis should focus on this.\n\n2) Mention of the equivalence only comes up in the experimental results, when it's a key property of the algorithm. If analysis of the composition is the paper's focus, acknowledging this property is foundational to any analysis of the method. It could have been shown analytically following the algorithm's derivation, and would have better justified some of the choices made in the experiments.\n\n3) Being equivalent to running *one-step* Q-learning still makes the \"multi-step\" learning emphasis appear incorrect, especially when the algorithm can trivially be extended to use actual multi-step TD methods. The title seems to come from interpreting what the composite values represent, but the horizon isn't what makes a method multi-step, and the compositional components add up to exactly one-step Q-learning's update.\n\nMinor:\n\n1) Arguably one of the most prevalent explanations in the deep RL literature for why one might expect improvements is the multi-task/auxiliary task hypothesis (Jaderberg et al., 2016).", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1590/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1590/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Off-policy Multi-step Q-learning", "authors": ["Gabriel Kalweit", "Maria Huegle", "Joschka Boedecker"], "authorids": ["kalweitg@cs.uni-freiburg.de", "hueglem@informatik.uni-freiburg.de", "jboedeck@informatik.uni-freiburg.de"], "keywords": ["Multi-step Learning", "Off-policy Learning", "Q-learning"], "TL;DR": "The paper is about estimating the full return in off-policy Reinforcement Learning via a combination of short- and long-term predictions.", "abstract": "In the past few years, off-policy reinforcement learning methods have shown promising results in their application for robot control.

This is accomplished by composing multiple n-step returns, showing that a recursive definition of n-step returns allows each return to be learned using only a single step of bootstrapping instead of at most n steps of bootstrapping. The paper solves the problem of the n-step fixed horizon by additionally composing a gamma discounted Q function that is shifted by n. In the end, the Q function used for behavior still predicts the same values as vanilla Q-learning, but with significantly less bias without a large increase in variance.\n\nReview\n\nI find this paper to be novel and insightful, the proposed algorithm is well supported theoretically and reasonably well supported empirically. I appreciated the careful demonstration on the smaller MDP with tabular features, showing the effects of multi-step Q-learning and clearly demonstrating the bias due to not truly using an off-policy formulation. I find that the demonstrations on the larger environments appear promising and suggest that composite multi-step Q-learning is a promising direction.\n\nThe error bars in the larger demonstrations, Figure 4, make it difficult to distinguish any meaningful differences between the algorithms. I appreciate that results are averaged over 11 runs, fortunately far more than seems to be standard at the moment, but still the amount of variance makes it difficult to say anything statistically. Table 2, then shows a reduction of the results but without mention of variance. It would be useful to include error measurements (perhaps the standard error over runs) to Table 2 to see the statistical significance of those results. Based on Figure 4, my guess is that there is negligible difference statistically.\n\nThe parameter sensitivity curves for the Walker2d domain also demonstrate that it is difficult to say anything meaningful about each parameter choice. Running a larger number of parameter settings would help to establish a clear pattern, or running each parameter setting for more independent runs could have allowed more significant results. The variance exhibited by one value in the regularization sensitivity curve is alone extremely interesting; perhaps using a different visualization that allowed more clear comparisons of the variance over independent runs would further motivate the utility of the regularization parameter. I think these results are interesting, but as presented do not sufficiently highlight the differences between the proposed algorithm and its competitors.\n\nFor the experiment in Figure 2, why not include multi-step Q-learning with importance sampling corrections on the later steps? I believe this would have fixed the bias issue, though clearly would be a tradeoff for high variance. I think this would make for a more convincing argument. Additionally, the caption does not well explain what the four green lines at the top of the plot represent. It was difficult to interpret the plot on the first pass of the paper because of this omission. Regardless, I find the results in Figure 2 to be otherwise intriguing.\n\nFinally, the choice of meta-parameters in this paper could negatively impact results in favor of the competitor algorithms. By choosing to fix meta-parameters based on the defaults of a competitor, this could be harmfully biasing the proposed algorithm by preventing it from choosing a better stepsize. In fact, I would suspect that the proposed algorithm would exhibit lower variance updates than TD3, meaning it could potentially take advantage of higher stepsizes. This omission makes the claims of this paper weaker than they could possibly be, leaving a slight hole in the research.\n\n---------\nEdit after discussion and rebuttal phase:\n\nI read the in-depth discussion between the authors and R3 and looked at the edits to the draft. I agree with the other reviewers on the basis of understanding the importance of meta-parameter selection. During the initial review, I found the ideas of the paper interesting enough to largely out-weigh the importance of a careful meta-parameter study. After R3's demonstration that there were indeed flaws with the results under the current meta-parameter selections, I think the best course of action would be to reject the paper in its current form.\n\nI still strongly believe there is a place in the literature for this paper, so I hope to see this paper again at the next conference.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1590/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1590/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Off-policy Multi-step Q-learning", "authors": ["Gabriel Kalweit", "Maria Huegle", "Joschka Boedecker"], "authorids": ["kalweitg@cs.uni-freiburg.de", "hueglem@informatik.uni-freiburg.de", "jboedeck@informatik.uni-freiburg.de"], "keywords": ["Multi-step Learning", "Off-policy Learning", "Q-learning"], "TL;DR": "The paper is about estimating the full return in off-policy Reinforcement Learning via a combination of short- and long-term predictions.", "abstract": "In the past few years, off-policy reinforcement learning methods have shown promising results in their application for robot control.

They provide temporal difference formulations for a truncated value function and shifted value function, enabling efficient learning of the two components. They also provide derivations of other similar approaches to the off-policy case. Finally, they compare their algorithm to several approaches on a subset of the MuJoCo tasks, and a novel tabular domain.\n\n  Main Contributions:\n  - An algorithm, Composite Q-learning, which decomposes the value function into a short-term truncated portion and a long-term shifted portion.\n  - Derivation of prior art for off-policy.\n\n  *Review*\n  The paper is generally well written (some suggestions for improved readability can be found below), and provides some nice algorithms for the community. I especially appreciate the author's willingness to derive off-policy variants of related algorithms to compared, as opposed to relegating this to future work which is the typical case. The theory for the truncated and shifted value functions also seems correct at a light check. Overall, I am recommending this paper for a weak accept as I have some concerns over the experimental results that I would like clarified. (specifically C1, Q4, and Q6).\n\n\n  [Q]uestions/[C]larifications/[S]uggestions:\n\n  C1: For the tabular domain, are the reported results over multiple runs? If not, I think it would be worthwhile to do some more runs and provide a significance test.\n\n  C2: It would be beneficial to add some indication what the true value for state s_0 is in the plot (either with a horizontal dotted) for each of the methods (i.e. I would expect Tr0 to converge to a different value compared with composite Q-learning). Also, I'm unsure if you appropriately specified what Tr_0, Tr_1, ... are in the text. I might be missing this, but I think it should be more clear.\n\n  S3: It might be interesting to look at the value of the shifted Q-function for this domain. Also, in the appendix I think it would be worthwhile to include the results for all of the states in the MDP (or a representative subset).\n\n  Q4: What are the default settings for TD3 and how were they set? This is an important detail to include, even if you believe they are well accepted in the field. This will make it easier to reproduce your experiments for future work. I think it seriously harms the paper by not tuning the algorithms appropriately.\n\n  S5: It seems as if you are using an open source implementation of TD3, if this is the case you should state this and give a link to the implementation (if you implemented yourself disregard this)\n\n  Q6: How significant are the results in figure 4, say for Walker2d? From what I understand about IQR, significance is measured based on overlap of the medians with the competing IQRs. For example, if we look at Walker2d much of the Composite TD3 median learning curve is within the IQR of TD3(\\Delta) and there are many points where TD3(\\Delta) is also in the IQR of the Composite TD3. I think portions are significant, but it is hard to appreciate from this plot. What might be useful to get a better sense of the data is to include error bars for the results presented in table 2 and table 3. I think table 3 could also benefit with box plots for each of the domains, just to make the comparison easier. \n\n  C7: I think the claim \"We also showed that composite TD3 is able to achieve state-of-the-art data-efficiency compared...\" is a bit strong, especially given the needed clarifications on the significance of the results and how you set hyperparameters. I would urge the authors to soften this claim, and instead say you provide evidence of composite q-learning's data efficiency as compared to other methods.\n\n\n  *Other comments not taken into consideration in the review*\n\n  - It was quite difficult to read sections 2 and 3 given how dense they are. I would recommend splitting these sections into multiple paragraphs to make the sections more readable.\n\n-----------\nPost discussion/rebuttal:\n\nAfter reviewing the comments from other reviewers and the discussion with R3, I'm inclined to think this paper could use a bit more work. I think the idea is still interesting and worth pursuing, but given some of the new observations and experiments run the paper needs to make more changes than I would find reasonable for acceptance. \n\nThanks again for your hard work, and I look forward to seeing this in a future conference.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1590/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1590/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Off-policy Multi-step Q-learning", "authors": ["Gabriel Kalweit", "Maria Huegle", "Joschka Boedecker"], "authorids": ["kalweitg@cs.uni-freiburg.de", "hueglem@informatik.uni-freiburg.de", "jboedeck@informatik.uni-freiburg.de"], "keywords": ["Multi-step Learning", "Off-policy Learning", "Q-learning"], "TL;DR": "The paper is about estimating the full return in off-policy Reinforcement Learning via a combination of short- and long-term predictions.", "abstract": "In the past few years, off-policy reinforcement learning methods have shown promising results in their application for robot control.

I think it might still be worthwhile to justify the choice of fixing the step size of 1e-3 for the values representing the full return, as with many TD methods, step size sensitivity can considerably vary. Acknowledging the exact decomposition of one-step Q-learning though, a quick argument for this choice would be that composite Q-learning could never do worse than one-step Q-learning if it can be set to match it exactly. :)\n\nWhile most of this has been about the tabular domain, this is where things are conceptually clear and can be quickly, and reasonably confidently, teased apart to (1) justify the choice of the larger step size used in Figure 2, and (2) make a case for what might be happening in the deep RL setting (or what to try next!). For example, drawing intuition from the tabular results, it may be possible that the architectural choice of outputting the value function components components at earlier hidden layers are interpretable as implicitly running things at different time scales- changes to earlier hidden layers might take longer for something further down the network to adapt.

This is what is meant by the composition alone not being responsible for speeding things up, and not readily taking advantage of truncated action-values converging quicker. The bias isn't readily being decreased because the truncated values have less-biased targets, but because an internal component is using a larger step size, which decreases bias quicker than a smaller step size, depending on the variability in the target. The result using 1e-3 for all components contradicts that the benefit is \"only due to the combination of short- and long-term predictions,\" but is in support that it is due to a combination of slow and fast timescale predictions within the composition. Put another way, an intuition might be that faster shifting is what lets one compose it with the truncated action-values earlier than usual, and from then on accelerates via closed-loop feedback. \n\nEnabling and using this larger \"internal\" step size for the shifting component (within the interplay) appears to be the key benefit of the composition, a positive result supported by your own results and figures.

We acknowledge the work of De Asis et al. in the current revision. We would like to point out, however, that we presented initial results in a workshop paper of ours at the RSS 2019 Workshop of Combining Learning and Reasoning \u2013 Towards Human-Level Robot Intelligence (https://sites.google.com/view/rss19-learning-and-reasoning) in June 2019, prior to the upload of De Asis et al. The workshop paper is uploaded on their website and also not mentioned in the paper of De Asis et al. The anonymous workshop paper can be found at: https://gofile.io/?c=2Omxmi\n\nFurthermore, in our definition of Truncated Q-functions, the action-values are w.r.t. to the full return, which is only possible due to the completion by the Shifted Q-function and a major difference to prior work. The main contribution of the paper is the analysis of the interplay between short- and long-term predictions.\n\n\"There are also lingering concerns over the claims and experiments run in this paper. Specifically, I had made the assumption you had optimized the parameters for the motivating markov chain and given reviewer one's observations using the code provided this result is much less meaningful than I had originally thought. I had in fact missed that the shifted values were using a separate learning rate, which I agree with reviewer one should be of import in the main paper.\"\n\nWe added an analysis of different learning rates for the Shifted Q-functions in Composite Q-learning and Shifted Q-learning in Section 5. \"Shifted Q-learning\" denotes a definition of the Q-target, where the long-term value is shifted by one time step (i.e. no approximate n-step return). Shifting the value in time alone is slowing down convergence and can be at most as fast as vanilla Q-learning (with a learning rate of 1.0). We hope that this experiment convincingly shows that the speed up is only due to the combination of short- and long-term predictions.\n\nFurthermore, we added initial results of a shallow architecture of the Q-network (no multi-layered structure) for the Walker2d-v2 environment to the appendix."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1590/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1590/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Off-policy Multi-step Q-learning", "authors": ["Gabriel Kalweit", "Maria Huegle", "Joschka Boedecker"], "authorids": ["kalweitg@cs.uni-freiburg.de", "hueglem@informatik.uni-freiburg.de", "jboedeck@informatik.uni-freiburg.de"], "keywords": ["Multi-step Learning", "Off-policy Learning", "Q-learning"], "TL;DR": "The paper is about estimating the full return in off-policy Reinforcement Learning via a combination of short- and long-term predictions.", "abstract": "In the past few years, off-policy reinforcement learning methods have shown promising results in their application for robot control.

Despite that, Sutton's original TD paper still describes the overall procedure of the consecutive bootstrapping for estimating these quantities. Of note, De Asis et al. (2019) still provide analysis motivating the use of truncating the horizon with function approximation. The completion of the return is indeed a major difference, but what makes it possibly lose the theoretical benefits of the truncated values.\"\n\nIt does in a very general manner, which is now acknowledged in related work. The benefits of bootstrapping from different greedy policies for different horizons, as in De Asis et al., come at the cost of not necessarily being optimal w.r.t. the complete task. De Asis et al. dismiss this drawback by stating that approximations always suffer from impreciseness: \"For a final horizon H << infinity, there may be concerns about suboptimal control. We explore this empirically in Section 5. For now, we note that optimality is never guaranteed when values are approximated.\" [1]\n\n\"As to why this is not readily a fair comparison, because composite Q-learning exactly decomposes one-step Q-learning, it's left to justify that the extra information available to the agent can be used to learn quicker. One can use the code that's provided and find a larger step size for vanilla Q-learning which makes it outperform *every method* presented in the figure, that it's not definitively shown that the composition is helping- I do believe that it can be shown, but the results as presented do not show this.\"\n\nThe main difficulty of the given MDP is simply the horizon and it is designed to be that way on purpose -- to rule out any other source of difference except for the horizon. Even though we do understand the point being made, the full Q-values are still updated with the same learning rate for all approaches, regardless of their given targets. Shifting alone would not lead to a speed up. This comes only due to the combination with the Truncated Q-function. The step size could be set to almost 1 for the given MDP and all approaches, which is due to the simplicity of the problem. There still is a significant difference in convergence for the given fixed learning rate which can only be explained by the combination of Truncated and Shifted Q-values. The approach, however, does have the limitation, that one can only expect a benefit, if there is generalization among states (as in the TD3-experiments with the given multi-layered architecture) or if the learning rate for the Shifted Q-function can be set to a higher value. This is indeed acknowledged in the current revision.\n\n\"The lower TD errors for the truncated horizons are not indicative of the bias of the action-values corresponding to the complete return, which is what's being used for decision making.

The maximizing action in FHTD is according to the truncated value-function of the former step, not w.r.t. the full return as in our work. Taking the full return is only possible due to the completion based on the Shifted Q-function and is a major difference to prior work. As suggested by the reviewer, however, we added a more precise formulation of the contributions in the abstract, in the introduction and in related work.\"\n\nThank you for the clarification, and the timeline. Despite that, Sutton's original TD paper still describes the overall procedure of the consecutive bootstrapping for estimating these quantities. Of note, De Asis et al. (2019) still provide analysis motivating the use of truncating the horizon with function approximation. The completion of the return is indeed a major difference, but what makes it possibly lose the theoretical benefits of the truncated values.\n\n\"Issue 3) Shifting the value function to overcome the necessity of a model indeed imposes a bottleneck which has to be tackled by either generalization (as in the TD3 case) or by adjusting the learning rate. We would like to point out that the full value function is still updated with the same step size to its given target in all approaches. The Shifted Q-function will always be updated slower than the true value function which is why we still believe this to be a fair comparison. We added an explanation in Sections 4 and 5.\"\n\nAs to why this is not readily a fair comparison, because composite Q-learning exactly decomposes one-step Q-learning, it's left to justify that the extra information available to the agent can be used to learn quicker. One can use the code that's provided and find a larger step size for vanilla Q-learning which makes it outperform *every method* presented in the figure, that it's not definitively shown that the composition is helping- I do believe that it can be shown, but the results as presented do not show this.\n\n\"Issue 4) We would like to refer to the lower row of Fig. 4, where we compare the different TD-errors over time. Please note, that the TD-errors for the truncated Q-functions are lower across the whole of training and decrease with shorter horizons (being the least for Tr_0). Therefore, the targets for some horizon h, bootstrapping from horizon h-1, are less biased -- grounded by the target of Tr_0, which has zero bias. While we can expect the Shifted Q-approximation to be similarly biased as the full Q-approximation, the first part of the target for the full Q-estimation, which has an even higher weight due to discounting, is less biased. We can therefore consider Composite Q-learning a bias reduction technique. The price is an increase in variance which is the reason for our novel regularization technique.\"\n\nThe lower TD errors for the truncated horizons are not indicative of the bias of the action-values corresponding to the complete return, which is what's being used for decision making. They have a different target they are estimating, and while those action-values themselves have lower-biased estimators, they *exactly* decompose the bias of the estimate for the complete return. As such, the bias of the complete return has not been decreased. If one were to run the provided code under the same random seeds, with the same step size across all value functions, it can be seen that the curves are *exactly* equivalent (apart from perhaps floating point errors).\n\n\"Suggestion 3) We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and consider the hyperparameter optimization of learning rates as an extension for the camera-ready version. However, our main focus was not on maximum performance, but on the analysis of the structure of Q-functions.\"\n\nWhen one is claiming that an algorithm is better than another, then hyperparameter optimization can't really be avoided. However, it's less about optimization and more so that such analysis of the structure requires analyzing how hyperparameters interplay. Part of this suggestion is that the analysis of the structure seems to be missing, as it failed to acknowledge (1) the exact decomposition of one-step TD, and (2) justifying the use of a larger step size for the shifted action-values.\n\n\"Suggestion 4) We agree that the single term \"Multi-step\" alone usually refers to an unbiased sum of real consecutive rewards in the literature. Since our approach includes off-policy approximations of n-step returns within target calculation for Q-learning (greedy target policy), we argue that Composite Q-learning belongs to this area of research -- also with respect to the reasons outlined in detail above.\"\n\nIt does approximate an n-step return, in a sense that *one-step* Q-learning approximates an *infinite-step* return. This is misleading as one can still use actual multi-step TD methods to estimate the truncated and shifted values."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1590/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1590/AnonReviewer3", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Off-policy Multi-step Q-learning", "authors": ["Gabriel Kalweit", "Maria Huegle", "Joschka Boedecker"], "authorids": ["kalweitg@cs.uni-freiburg.de", "hueglem@informatik.uni-freiburg.de", "jboedeck@informatik.uni-freiburg.de"], "keywords": ["Multi-step Learning", "Off-policy Learning", "Q-learning"], "TL;DR": "The paper is about estimating the full return in off-policy Reinforcement Learning via a combination of short- and long-term predictions.", "abstract": "In the past few years, off-policy reinforcement learning methods have shown promising results in their application for robot control.

We included most of them in the new revision.\n\n1) \"It would be useful to include error measurements (perhaps the standard error over runs) to Table 2 to see the statistical significance of those results.\"\n\nWe included variance measures in Table 2 and 3.\n\n2) \"Running a larger number of parameter settings would help to establish a clear pattern, or running each parameter setting for more independent runs could have allowed more significant results.\"\n\nWe included boxplots w.r.t. the area under the learning curve to give a better visualization of the variances. We further added two more settings of the regularization weight.\n\n3) \"For the experiment in Figure 2, why not include multi-step Q-learning with importance sampling corrections on the later steps?\"\n\nWithin an off-policy learning regime based on deterministic policies, it is unclear how to include importance sampling in a multi-step setting. In the most naive way, the importance sampling weight can either become 0 or 1 and should be mostly 0 in the later course of learning as the target policy progresses. We therefore did not add importance sampling as a baseline here.\n\n4) \"Additionally, the caption does not well explain what the four green lines at the top of the plot represent. It was difficult to interpret the plot on the first pass of the paper because of this omission. Regardless, I find the results in Figure 2 to be otherwise intriguing.\"\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the positive feedback and updated the submission accordingly.\n\n5) \"Finally, the choice of meta-parameters in this paper could negatively impact results in favor of the competitor algorithms.\"\n\nWe would like to thank the reviewer for the suggestion and agree that hyperparameter optimization could be of great use here. Within the scope of the paper, however, we were not aiming at maximum performance. We wanted to analyze the influence of the structure of Q-functions within target calculation. We therefore kept crucial parameters, such as the target update and the learning rate, the same, since it would be even harder to distinguish the influence of the different methodological choices."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1590/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1590/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Off-policy Multi-step Q-learning", "authors": ["Gabriel Kalweit", "Maria Huegle", "Joschka Boedecker"], "authorids": ["kalweitg@cs.uni-freiburg.de", "hueglem@informatik.uni-freiburg.de", "jboedeck@informatik.uni-freiburg.de"], "keywords": ["Multi-step Learning", "Off-policy Learning", "Q-learning"], "TL;DR": "The paper is about estimating the full return in off-policy Reinforcement Learning via a combination of short- and long-term predictions.", "abstract": "In the past few years, off-policy reinforcement learning methods have shown promising results in their application for robot control. Deep Q-learning, however, still suffers from poor data-efficiency which is limiting with regard to real-world applications. We follow the idea of multi-step TD-learning to enhance data-efficiency while remaining off-policy by proposing two novel Temporal-Difference formulations: (1) Truncated Q-functions which represent the return for the first n steps of a policy rollout and (2) Shifted Q-functions, acting as the farsighted return after this truncated rollout. We prove that the combination of these short- and long-term predictions is a representation of the full return, leading to the Composite Q-learning algorithm. We show the efficacy of Composite Q-learning in the tabular case and compare our approach in the function-approximation setting with TD3, Model-based Value Expansion and TD3(Delta), which we introduce as an off-policy variant of TD(Delta). We show on three simulated robot tasks that Composite TD3 outperforms TD3 as well as state-of-the-art off-policy multi-step approaches in terms of data-efficiency.", "pdf": "/pdf/1c70e75a412a5bc83a54d0c3cd35fa90c0b5be78.pdf", "code": "https://gofile.io/?c=lmcyx5", "paperhash": "kalweit|offpolicy_multistep_qlearning", "original_pdf": "/attachment/a667dd947cf722e4ac8d03a3eae77c83257d363c.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkalweit2020offpolicy,\ntitle={Off-policy Multi-step Q-learning},\nauthor={Gabriel Kalweit and Maria Huegle and Joschka Boedecker},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1lczkHKPr}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"required": true, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).
