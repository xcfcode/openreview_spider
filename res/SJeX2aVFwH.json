We agree that the main strength of our paper lies in the experimental results that we have obtained. However, that is not to say that the theoretical results are unimportant. \n\nThe Bregman method has existed for a long time, and lots of research work has been done on the method. However, until now, all Bregman algorithms were constrained at cyclically (or almost cyclically) looking at the constraints. In fact, the need to cyclically look at the constraints to show that the algorithm converges to the optimal solution is an aspect that is highlighted in previous work. See [1,2,3] for examples. \n\nMany applications that used these methods found other ways around needing to see all the constraints. This was done either by restricting the number of constraints and solving a heuristic problem, by solving smaller sized problems, or by trying to parallelize the projections. See [4,5,6] for examples of each. Thus, to prove the convergence result while incorporating the ability to add new constraints and to forget old constraints is vital. Without having the convergence, the increased speed obtained from doing these steps could be useless.  \n\n[1] Yair Censor and Simeon Reich. The Dykstra Algorithm with Bregman Projections.

As far as this author understands it, the cutting plane method in Gurobi is for mixed integer programming (MIP) and uses Gromov cuts. \n\nThe difficulty of MIPs comes from the integrality constraints and not because they have a large number of constraints. Hence using Gromov cuts lets us reduce the choices for the integral constraints until we can add the constraint $x=c$. Thus, reducing it to a linear program. \n\nHowever, in general, the cutting plane method highly depends on the choice of cuts.  See [2,3] for in-depth discussions. For other problems that are not MIPs, we have some success cases such as [1], but we have not had success in all problems. \n\nOne of the key differences between the standard cutting plane method and Project and Forget is that in the standard cutting plane method, every time we introduce new constraints, we solve the whole optimization problem again. In the case of Project and Forget, we do a round of projections.  \n\nRe-solving the LP again has potential issues. In the case of metric constrained problems, we have a large number of constraints. Thus, if we added a large portion of these constraints, we still cannot solve the LP using standard techniques.  We could add in the constraints slowly so that this is not an issue. However, then the intermediate solutions do not necessarily tell us anything about the final solution, and it is unclear whether progress is being made, and we may need too many rounds. \n\nThe Project and Forget method addresses this issue. If we added into many inactive constraints, then we only need to do one round of projections. This is less computationally expensive than solving a whole LP. Thus, we get to the forget step much faster. Thus in practice, we add a large number of constraints initially, as seen in Figure 1. However, we forget the inactive constraints quickly, and the projections done onto the active constraints constitute some progress towards finding the final solution. (We may have projected onto inactive constraints, but experimentally, we tend to undo this relatively quickly.)\n\nFinally, we also have the generic version of our algorithm presented in the appendix. For the general version of the algorithm, we have a subroutine that we dub the oracle. Here the oracle is just the cutting plane selection method. Here we show that under some weak assumptions (property 1) that our algorithm has a linear rate of convergence. Additionally, we show that if we randomly sample constraints, then with probability 1, we have a linear rate of convergence. \n\n[1]Karthekeyan Chandrasekaran, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 A.

As both reviewers 2 and 3  highlight, our experimental results point to the practical usefulness of our algorithm. \n\nNext, we would like to address the specific concerns that were brought up. \n\n1) \"The Project subroutine itself is a projection onto a convex set according to a Bregman divergence, which is not trivial.\"\n\nIn terms of computing Bregman projections, we don't need to project onto general convex sets. We only need to project onto hyperplanes. This makes the problem of computing the projection much easier. Note in the project subroutine we don't project onto the intersection of all of the halfspaces. We project onto each hyperplane separately iteratively.\n\nAdditionally, for standard objective functions such as a quadratic, we have an analytic formula for the projection. Thus can be done in constant time. Additionally, in the case of metric constraints, the constraints tend to be sparse (small cycles). Thus, even the numerical approximation algorithm presented in [2] is extremely fast. \n\n2) \"The algorithm stacks multiple subroutines which are not necessarily very light. I am skeptical about the numerical efficiency of such algorithms.\"\n\nWe only have two subroutines that could be nontrivial: the metric violations and the project routine, the forget routine is relatively simple. We have already addressed the project routine, so we will now look at the routine the metric violations routine. \n\nAny algorithm to solve such problems would have to deal with the fact that we have $n^3$ constraints. From previous work [1], we know that standard methods run out of memory due to the large number of constraints. Thus, we need to use cyclic iterative methods that need to cycle through all $n^3$ constraints. In terms of $n^3$ running time, the Floyd Warshall algorithm is one of the simplest and fastest $n^3$ algorithms. In particular, it is faster than having to do all $n^3$ projections. We can see this due to the metric nearness experiment. \nAlso, the Floyd Warshall algorithm is one of the \"stupidly parallelizable\" algorithms. Hence we can parallelize this computation. \n\nIn the case when the graph is sparse, the metric violations can be solved faster than $n^3$. Hence allowing us to solve correlation clustering on instances 10x bigger than previously done. \n\n3)  \"The algorithm starts at a stationary point of f. This itself can be nontrivial. Can authors discuss this?\"\n\nIn many cases, we can theoretically calculate what the stationary point is. If f(x) is a quadratic = $x^TQx + c^Tx + a$ where Q is positive definite then the stationary point is given by $-Q^{-1}c$. If f(x) is entropy $-\\sum_i x_i log(x_i)$, then the stationary point is given by x is the vector where every coordinate is $1/e$. \n\nIn general, we are assuming that our function is a Bregman function, which means that f(x) is strictly convex. Thus, if we cannot theoretically compute this, we can numerically approximate this via gradient descent or Newton's method. Such a computation only needs to be done once. \n\n[1] Nate Veldt, David Gleich, Anthony Wirth, and James Saunderson. Metric-constrained optimization for graph clustering algorithms.

Its main contribution comes from the \"forgetting\" part, where unnecessary constraints (that are inactive) are removed in order to keep the number of constraints manageable. \n\nPros: \n\nThe methods seem practically useful as verified in the experiments. \n\nCons: \n\nMost importantly, the paper is out of format and there exist some critical typos that need to be fixed. \n- The margin of the paper is wider than the official ICLR format. It needs to be reformatted and verified to be under 10 pages limit. \n- There seem to be multiple Latex bugs on referring the section numbers, e.g., \"see appendix refsec:genealProblem\" at bottom of page 5. \n\nThere is no theoretical guarantee on its improvement over existing methods, i.e., the forgotten constraints can reappear during optimization for multiple numbers of times. However, I think this point is not crucial given the empirical usefulness of the algorithm.\n\nMinor questions: \n- To my knowledge, cutting plane methods for the integer programming method (including Gurobi) already use an instance \"project and forget\" method, i.e., iteratively solving linear programs and then adding & removing cutting planes. See [1] for an example. Could the authors discuss the relationship between the two methods and highlight the relative difference & contribution?\n\n[1] The cutting plane method is polynomial for perfect matchings, Chandrasekaran et al., 2012\n\n========= \n\nI have checked that the authors have re-formatted the paper into a correct form.

The main challenge is that expressing all metric constraints on n points requiries O(n^3) constraints. The paper proposes a \u201cproject and forget\u201d approach which is essentially is based on cyclic Bregman projections but with a twist that some of the constraints are forgotten. The proof of convergence of this method is given, but no explicit bound on the number of iterations. While the general method doesn\u2019t appear to be particularly novel, I found it quite impressive that the authors were able to solve 10x larger instances of weighted correlation clustering than the previous work. While from a theoretical perspective this work is hardly very exciting, the practical results are rather interesting. Other applications to the metric nearness and metric learning problems are also given. \n\n\nComments:\n-- The paper is full of typos and needs to be proofread by a native English speaker.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper775/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper775/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Project and Forget: Solving Large Scale Metric Constrained Problems", "authors": ["Anna C.

In this paper, we focus on metric constrained problems, a class of optimization problems with metric constraints. In particular, we identify three types of metric constrained problems: metric nearness Brickell et al. (2008), weighted correlation clustering on general graphs Bansal et al. (2004), and metric learning Bellet et al. (2013); Davis et al. (2007). Because of the large number of constraints in these problems, however, researchers have been forced to restrict either the kinds of metrics learned or the size of the problem that can be solved.\nWe provide an algorithm, PROJECT AND FORGET, that uses Bregman projections with cutting planes, to solve metric constrained problems with many (possibly exponentially) inequality constraints. We also prove that our algorithm converges to the global optimal solution. Additionally, we show that the optimality error (L2 distance of the current iterate to the optimal) asymptotically decays at an exponential rate.
