We provide the answer to the questions and potential concerns. \n\n**Q1**: The disentangled attention in DeBERTa is motivated but not closely related to disentangled representations or features.  Unlike the conventional absolute position bias encoding which adds the position embedding into content embedding directly, we borrow the idea of disentangled representations to decompose the attention score into different parts to avoid the interference between content and position, as well as fully capture the interaction between content and relative positions, and add the absolute position embedding back into the EMD layer in DeBERTa. We will add a footnote in new version to clarify this. \n\n**Q2**: About the difference between EMD and masked language model (MLM), we add absolute position encoding at the last layer in EMD to address the limitation of relative position encoding on MLM, which is demonstrated by the example in section 3.2 with an ablation study in Table.5.\n\n**Q3**: Following previous works such as BERT and RoBERTa, in our experiments, we simply use the conventional way to initialize our model (parameter matrices) using normal distribution N(0, 0.02).  How the initialization affects the model performance is an open research topic beyond the scope of this paper. We agree that it could be an important research topic for the future work.    \n\n**About the variance with multiple runs**. Following BERT and RoBERTa, our reported numbers are based the average on 5 runs with different random initialization seed.

Below we try to respond to the feedbacks mentioned in the review:\n\n**About additional parameters**. We will clarify this in the main paper. The additional parameters in our original model are due to the projection matrix of relative position embedding. We also perform a new model design via sharing the parameters of the two projection matrices, which makes the number of model parameters close to BERT or RoBERTa, without sacrificing the accuracy.  We report the experimental results in Table 11 in the Appendix.\n\n**About the experiment result description**. These are great feedbacks and we will describe the comparison more precisely in the new version, especially in the comparison with ALBERT. First, we will add the ALBERT result into Table.2.  Table 1 will focus on comparing models similar to BERT-large structure, i.e., 24 layers with 1024 dimensions and compare more SOTA models in Table.2, including ALBERT-XXLarge. Second, we will clarify the excellent design of the parameter sharing introduced by ALBERT, which can significantly reduce the model size although the computation cost is still determined by the model structure, i.e. number of hidden dimensions and transformer layers. As is reported in the ALBERT paper, the data-throughput of BERT-Large is about 3.17x higher compared to ALBERT-XXLarge.  We agree ALBERT-XXLargeand DeBERTa-large are comparable in terms of accuracy, with ALBERT-XXLarge having less model parameters  and DeBERTa being trained more efficiently as shown in Figure 1. \n\nMeanwhile, we will make the change to 4B training samples and fix the references with their latest updates.  \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3690/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3690/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DEBERTA: DECODING-ENHANCED BERT WITH DISENTANGLED ATTENTION", "authorids": ["~Pengcheng_He2", "~Xiaodong_Liu1", "~Jianfeng_Gao1", "~Weizhu_Chen1"], "authors": ["Pengcheng He", "Xiaodong Liu", "Jianfeng Gao", "Weizhu Chen"], "keywords": ["Transformer", "Attention", "Natural Language Processing", "Language Model Pre-training", "Position Encoding"], "abstract": "Recent progress in pre-trained neural language models has significantly improved the performance of many natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

Below we address the concerns mentioned in the review: \n\n**Difference with Transformer-XL**. We will clarify the commonness and difference in the next version. The relative position in DeBERTa is an extension of that in Transformer-XL and XLNet, with a different motivation and implementation. First, in Transformer-XL/XLNet,  the relative position is introduced to solve the position dependencies between tokens among different segments.  In DeBERTa,  the motivation is to decompose position information from content information thoroughly. Second, DeBERTa separates the content and position in a more comprehensive way.  For example, DeBERTa contains a new position-to-content component that captures the relative interaction between position and content at the attention layer. This is an important introduction in DeBERTa. As we showed in Table.5, this new component is critical in the new disentangled attention and can substantially boost the model performance in the Ablation study. Meanwhile, we did compare with XLNet in Table.5 and briefly mentioned the DeBERTa minus P2C will be reduced to XLNet plus EMD.  We will make this clearer in the revision. \n\n**The word Disentangled**. Thanks for the suggestion.  We will add a footnote in the paper to distinguish these two concepts.  Our disentangled attention is motivated but not closely related to disentangled representations or features.  Unlike the conventional absolute position bias encoding which adds the position embedding into content embedding directly, we borrow the idea of disentangled representations to decompose the attention score into different parts to avoid the interference between content and position, while fully capturing the interaction between content and relative positions. We will make this clear in our new version.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3690/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3690/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DEBERTA: DECODING-ENHANCED BERT WITH DISENTANGLED ATTENTION", "authorids": ["~Pengcheng_He2", "~Xiaodong_Liu1", "~Jianfeng_Gao1", "~Weizhu_Chen1"], "authors": ["Pengcheng He", "Xiaodong Liu", "Jianfeng Gao", "Weizhu Chen"], "keywords": ["Transformer", "Attention", "Natural Language Processing", "Language Model Pre-training", "Position Encoding"], "abstract": "Recent progress in pre-trained neural language models has significantly improved the performance of many natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

I\u2019m listing below the most important issues in this section:\n\n\u201cRoBERTa and XLNet are trained for 500K steps with 8K samples in a step, which amounts to four billion passes over training samples\u201d. This is confusing; what you mean to say is that the models see about four billion training examples. The term \u201cpasses\u201d is used usually as an equivalent to \u201cepochs\u201d, ie how many times the model goes over the entire training set.\n\n\u201c[...] Table 1, which compares DeBERTa with previous models with around 350M parameters: BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, ALBERT and ELECTRA.\u201d Note that ALBERT is actually around 235M parameters, significantly less than all the others. You cannot simply bundle all together and claim they are equivalent parameter-size--wise.\n\n\u201cDeBERTa still outperforms them [ALBERT_xxlarge] in term  of the average \u201cGLUE\u201d score.\u201d Note that the difference here wrt ALBERT_xxlarge is from 89.96 to 90.00, ie 0.04 for the average, with a tie 3-3 in terms of wins for specific tasks. Unless you can show that the 0.04 difference is statistically significant, you need to tone down the claim about \u201coutperforming\u201d.\n\n\n\u201cWe summarize the results in Table 2. Compared to the previous SOTA models with similar sizes, including BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet and Megatron336M, DeBERTa consistently outperforms them in all the 7 tasks. Taking RACE as an example, DeBERTa is significantly better than previous SOTA XLNet with an improvement of 1.4% (86.8% vs. 85.4%).\u201d\nFor whatever reason, the authors omit ALBERT from the comparison done for Table 2, in spite of its even smaller size compared to the included ones, and the fact that the ALBERT numbers for these tasks are readily available in the paper. Taking RACE as an example: ALBERT (single model) has 86.5% accuracy, therefore nullifying the claim of 1.4% improvement.\n\n\nRe: References\n\nA lot of the references use the Arxiv version for papers that have been peer-reviewed and published.

It demonstrates superior performance across benchmarks.\n\nPros:\n1. Good empirical results are demonstrated across an extensive suite of benchmarks. Ablation studies are well done. Hence I am willing to give a score of 6 despite of the following concerns.\n\nCons:\n1. My major concern is about the novelty of this paper. \nIn transformer-XL[1], the idea of relative positional information in the form of Eq (2) was already introduced. The paper somehow intentionally omit the discussion following (2), only mentioning two earlier works of (Shaw et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2018). I think the author should be honest and compare with relative positional information introduced in transformer-XL in the forefront. \nThat being said, there is obviously still differences between transformer-XL and the proposed methods. And also the introduction of novel objectives in addition to the attention mechanism. \n\n2. However, the previous concern brought up the second concern I have about the evaluations. Since the modification relative positional information of transformer-XL to the proposed method is not too large, I wonder if there is a reason to explain the better performances of the proposed methods. Hence I am worried if the baseline such as XLNet was well-tuned. We can see that for example in [2], the performance of XLNet was much better than originally reported. I think the author should try to carefully evaluate the relative positional mechanisms of prior works with authors' own infrastructure, while having everything else fixed.\n\n3. I find the word \"disentangled\" a bit misleading in this context. Disentanglement in ML [3] often refers to the ability to disentangle factors of variations of the data. The work does not make use of any disentangled techniques, or have disentanglement representation/architectures. It simply use a relative position mechanism that's the sum of four matrix products. \n\n[1] Dai et. al. Transformer-XL: Attentive Language Models Beyond a Fixed-Length Context\n\n[2] Dai et. al.

In this paper we propose a new model architecture DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention) that improves the BERT and RoBERTa models using two novel techniques. The first is the disentangled attention mechanism, where each word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and position, respectively, and the attention weights among words are computed using disentangled matrices on their contents and relative positions, respectively. Second, an enhanced mask decoder is used to incorporate absolute positions in the decoding layer to predict the masked tokens in model pre-training. In addition, a new virtual adversarial training method is used for fine-tuning to improve models\u2019 \n generalization. We show that these techniques significantly improve the efficiency of model pre-training and the performance of both natural language understand(NLU) and natural langauge generation (NLG) downstream tasks. Compared to RoBERTa-Large, a DeBERTa model trained on half of the training data performs consistently better on a wide range of NLP tasks, achieving improvements on MNLI by +0.9% (90.2% vs. 91.1%), on SQuAD v2.0 by +2.3% (88.4% vs. 90.7%) and RACE by +3.6% (83.2% vs. 86.8%). Notably, we scale up DeBERTa by training a larger version that consists of 48 Transform layers with 1.5 billion parameters. The significant performance boost makes the single DeBERTa model surpass the human performance on the SuperGLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019a) for the first time in terms of macro-average score (89.9 versus 89.8), and the ensemble DeBERTa model sits atop the SuperGLUE leaderboard as of January 6, 2021, outperforming the human baseline by a decent margin (90.3 versus\n89.8).
