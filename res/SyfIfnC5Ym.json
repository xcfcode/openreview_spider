Towards your suggestions on further experimental analysis and the writing quality of experimental section, we have performed plenty of revisions and improvements on the experimental section.  \n\nFor the large dataset of ImageNet, due to the time limit and the resource limit, we are sorry that we could not provide experiments on it, instead, we add three more subsections and provide more quantitative analysis on the current four datasets. We also extend the ATDA method to the PGD-Adversarial Training (PAT) to show how our method can be transferred to iterative attacks.\n \n1. In subsection 4.3, we performed additional experiments to measure defense efficiency of ATDA in terms of the local loss sensitivity (defined in [1]) to perturbations and the shift of adversarial data distribution with respect to the clean data distribution. Especially on the quantitative analysis on the embeddings, besides plotting the t-SNE embeddings, we report the detailed MMD distances across domains. The results are shown in Table 3. We observe that: SAT and EAT actually increase the MMD distance across domains of the clean data and the adversarial data as compared with NT. In contrast, PRT and ATDA can learn domain invariance between the clean domain and the adversarial domain. Furthermore, our learned logits representation achieves the best performance on distribution discrepancy. \n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05394 (ICML 2017). \n\n2. Following your valuable suggestion, in subsection 4.4, we provide a more thorough analysis to tease out the benefit of each of the various terms added to the loss functions. The results are shown in Figure 3. Thank you.\n\n3. Although our work is mainly focused on the adversarial training yet efficient FGSM adversary, we show the scalability and flexibility of ATDA on subsection 4.5. We consider to extend the ATDA method to PGD-Adversarial Training (PAT) : adversarial training on the noisy PGD (iterative attack). Meanwhile, we implement an extension of ATDA (called PATDA) by combining adversarial training on the noisy PGD with domain adaptation. As the evaluation shown in Table 4, PATDA exhibits stronger robustness against various bounded adversaries as compared to PAT.\n\n\nWe thank you again for the valuable feedback and comments, which have improved the manuscript apparently.

Thank you for the helpful review.", "comment": "We deeply appreciate the reviewer for the positive remarks and constructive suggestions. Your suggestion of further experiments is a great idea and towards this, we have performed the following revisions. \n\n1. We have reorganized the content of the Experimental Section, clarify the writing  and reduce the duplication of expression, so as to leave more space to describe further quantitative analysis on ATDA.\n\n2. We add subsection 4.3 and performed additional experiments to measure the defense efficiency of ATDA in terms of the local loss sensitivity (defined in [1]) to perturbations and the shift of adversarial data distribution with respect to the clean data distribution.\n    The results in Table 2 on local loss sensitivity suggest that the adversarial training methods do increase the smoothness of the learned model as compared with the normal training, and ATDA performs the best in terms of the sensitivity of the loss function.\n    We also quantify the distribution discrepancy of the clean data and the adversarial data. Besides the illustration of the t-SNE embeddings (Figure 2), we report the detailed MMD distances across domains in Table 3 for quantitative analysis (the lower the better). The results suggest that SAT and EAT actually increase the MMD distance across domains of the clean data and the adversarial data. In contrast, PRT and ATDA can learn domain invariance between the clean domain and the adversarial domain, and ATDA achieves the best performance in terms of the distribution discrepancy.\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05394 (ICML 2017). \n\n3. To tease out the benefit of each of the various terms added to the loss functions, as Reviewer 2 suggested, we study the benefit of the different components in ATDA:\n\t1) Standard Adversarial Training (SAT)\n\t2) Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)\n\t3) Supervised Domain Adaptation (SDA)\n    We add subsection 4.4 and conduct a series of ablation experiments. The results are shown in Figure 3. We observe that by aligning the covariance matrix and mean vector of the clean and adversarial examples, UDA plays a key role in improving the generalization of SAT on various attacks.\n\tIn general, the aware of margin loss on SDA can also improve the defense quality on standard adversarial training, but the effectiveness is not very stable over all datasets. By combining UDA and SDA together with SAT, our final algorithm ATDA can exhibits stable improvements on the standard adversarial training. In general, the performance is slightly better than SAT+UDA. \n\n4. Although our work is mainly focused on the adversarial training yet efficient FGSM adversary, we add subsection 4.5 to extend our domain adaptation method to PGD-Adversarial Training (PAT) and get an extension of ATDA (called PATDA).\n   We performed experiments to evaluate the robustness of PAT and PATDA. The results suggest that PATDA has stronger robustness on various attacks with respect to PAT. This indicates domain adaptation can be applied to adversarial training on other adversaries to improve the robustness of the model.\n\nWe thank you again for the valuable feedback and comments, which have improved the manuscript apparently. We have addressed all the concerns and changed the abstract, introduction and conclusion accordingly in the revision of the paper. We hope the additional quantitative results can convince you the quality of our work.
