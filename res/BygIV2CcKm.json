There seems to be a gap between what was intended to be conveyed by the manuscript and what was understood by the reviewer. Hopefully, the revised manuscript will allow the reviewer to have a better understanding of what was intended. \n\n[R] For me, the argument of the paper is ambitious. Data augmentation for DNN includes different perspective, including nonlinearity, adversarial etc. Generalization of spatial and appearance models is not enough. The model formulate from a simple classification setting but does not involve too many for DNN models. I put more references below. \n[A] The proposed transformation model generalizes non-rigid (nonlinear data augmentation is a rather ambiguous term-the reviewers are probably referring to non-rigid warping) warping. The adversarial method is limited in their flexibility of transformation as described in Section 2.1. This is because the adversarial update on flexible and complex transformation model yields an adversarial example. The paper only considered the classification setting, but extending it to other tasks is straightforward given the differentiable objectives (Eqs 14 and 19 are not restricted to classification setting).\n\n[R] The experimental results are not strong. Not all strong baselines are included (I put some in the references). The improvements are marginal. Besides, I need more experimental setting information. \n[A] Thank you for the baselines of (semi-)supervised learning algorithms; however, the paper is not about the semi-supervised learning but is about the data augmentation. The proposed augmentation method can be used in conjunction with methods proposed in [a,b,c]. For example, [c] reported the results with or without augmentation in Tables 1 and 2. The benefit of the proposed method can be investigated by measuring the performance gain of the proposed augmentation method in comparison with the conventional augmentation method or without augmentation given the algorithm in [c].\n\n[R] The writing is not clear. For the related work part, it included many paragraph which are not related to the work, (e.g. GANs). In the introduction part, it did not mention the generalization of both spatial and appearance models, which is the main contribution. \n[A] The manuscript has been revised by many people including a native English speaker to improve readability.\nAs we stated in Section 2.2, we included GAN in related work to exploit its potential to augment data by generating class-conditional images. \nAs AnonReviewer1 summarized, our main contribution is not the generalization of both spatial and appearance models, but our contribution is to propose an extension of the influence function for data augmentation. Influence of augmentation on validation loss is approximated and the augmentation model is learned under this approximation. Differentiable transformation models, the generalization of both spatial and appearance models, are proposed to carry out gradients of influence function to the transformation model. Also, we briefly mentioned the generalization of both spatial and appearance models by \u201cWe also propose a differentiable augmentation model that generalizes the conventional augmentation method by the composition of predefined transformations\u201d.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1452/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1452/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1452/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Augment Influential Data", "abstract": "Data augmentation is a technique to reduce overfitting and to improve generalization by increasing the number of labeled data samples by performing label preserving transformations; however, it is currently conducted in a trial and error manner.

We would like to share our responses to the concerns raised by the reviewer.\n\n[R] Experimental results can be stronger. Especially when compared to Ratner et al., this proposed method results in marginal performance gain. Given that Ratner et al.\u2019s method trained the data augmentation module without supervision, the supervised learning in this paper does not show strong results. In addition, the paper did not report results on a more practical dataset (such ImageNet and Places). Even for Cifar-10, the reported numbers are away from the state-of-the-art. It is important to show the practical significance of the proposed method. \n[A] We would like to point out that significance of supervision during learning an augmentation module is different from that of during learning a classification module. Supervision of the classification module (classical supervised learning) is expected to show dramatic performance gain over that of without supervision (classical unsupervised learning); however, supervision of the augmentation module may not show significant performance gain because the performance is measured by the end classifier which already includes label supervision.\nThe experimental results focused on comparisons between the proposed method, heuristic and Ratner et al. under the exact same setting (hyperparameters and an architecture of the end classifier); however, we agree with the comment and were working on the experiments on ImageNet. But single run of the end classification model take roughly one week on ImageNet. Alternatively, we are currently working on the experiments on Cifar-10 for various state-of-the-art architectures and will report the results as soon as possible.\n\n[R] Data augmentation is naturally expected to be random, but the proposed method seems to learn a deterministic parameter for the augmenting transformation, which looks unnatural and limited. (Please clarify if I missed anything.) \n[A] As described in the manuscript, the experiments were conducted in the same setting as Ratner et al.: training images are randomly transformed (crop and flip) before they fed into the transformation model. This injects randomness to augmented images. We revised the manuscript to include this process for clarity.\n\n[R] The proposed method requires a parametric model (e.g, STN, GAN). However, differentiable parametric models are not always easy to design. This probably can be the biggest obstacle to apply the proposed method widely. \n[A] In deep learning, to find stable setups of hyperparameters and an architecture is not easy, especially for GAN, as you pointed out. But we found that using the known stable setup (from the original WGAN-GP paper) is enough to learn transformation models. For detail, we used the same setup as the original WGAN-GP paper (see the revised paper Appendix A and B):\n    Optimizer: ADAM, lr=0.0001, beta_1=0.5, beta_2=0.9, \n    Generator: Stacked transposed convolutional neural networks with ReLU,\n    Discriminator: Stacked convolutional neural networks with LeakyReLU (0.2)\nOther GAN variants with their known stable setups also worked, e. g. DCGAN setup used in the original DCGAN paper (ADAM optimizer with lr=0.0002, beta_1=-.5, beta_2=0.999). Furthermore, learning of the proposed transformation model is not much sensitive to hyperparameters and architecture design. We believe that this is because of the difference in objectives between the GAN variants and the transformation model. The GAN variants generate images from noise; however, the transformation model generates transformation parameters to be applied to the given image, which has more simple patterns than the image itself.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1452/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1452/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1452/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Augment Influential Data", "abstract": "Data augmentation is a technique to reduce overfitting and to improve generalization by increasing the number of labeled data samples by performing label preserving transformations; however, it is currently conducted in a trial and error manner.

In particular, it uses spatial transformer and GANs as parametric data augmenters, and it formulates the validation set loss with respect to the data augmenter in a differentiable manner. \n\n[Pros]\n\n1.\tThe proposed method does not require many trials of model training under different training data, and it learns the data augmentation directly using the final classification objective.\n2.\tIt is inspiring to extend the differentiable form of influence function across the training and validation set and then across the original and augmented data. This paper also makes use of the most recent related advance to enable stochastic learning. The theory of the paper is nice.\n3.\tThe experimental results on MNIST (with less labeled data) and Cifar-10 are encouraging.\n\n[Cons]\n\n1.\tExperimental results can be stronger. Especially when compared to Ratner et al., this proposed method results in marginal performance gain. Given that Ratner et al.\u2019s method trained the data augmentation module without supervision, the supervised learning in this paper does not show strong results. In addition, the paper did not report results on a more practical dataset (such ImageNet and Places). Even for Cifar-10, the reported numbers are away from the state-of-the-art. It is important to show the practical significance of the proposed method.\n2.\tData augmentation is naturally expected to be random, but the proposed method seems to learn a deterministic parameter for the augmenting transformation, which looks unnatural and limited. (Please clarify if I missed anything.) \n3.\tThe proposed method requires a parametric model (e.g, STN, GAN). However, differentiable parametric models are not always easy to design. This probably can be the biggest obstacle to apply the proposed method widely.\n\nOverall, the proposed method is very interesting. However, the experimental results are limited, and more discussions are needed. \n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1452/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Augment Influential Data", "abstract": "Data augmentation is a technique to reduce overfitting and to improve generalization by increasing the number of labeled data samples by performing label preserving transformations; however, it is currently conducted in a trial and error manner.
