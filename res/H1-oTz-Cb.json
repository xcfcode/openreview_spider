This paper proposes a method to uncover this structure from the filters of a trained ConvNet. The method uses an InfoGAN to learn the distribution of filters. By varying the latent variables of the GAN, one can traverse the manifold of filters. The effect of moving over the manifold can be visualized by optimizing an input image to produce the same activation profile when using a perturbed synthesized filter as when using an unperturbed synthesized filter.\n\nThe idea of empirically studying the manifold / topological / group structure in the space of filters is interesting. A priori, using a GAN to model a relatively small number of filters seems problematic due to overfitting, but the authors show that their InfoGAN approach seems to work well.\n\nMy main concerns are:\n\nControls\nTo generate the visualizations, two coordinates in the latent space are varied, and for each variation, a figure is produced. To figure out if the GAN is adding anything, it would be nice to see what would happen if you varied individual coordinates in the filter space (\"x-space\" of the GAN), or varied the magnitude of filters or filter planes. Since the visualizations are as much a function of the previous layers as they are a function of the filters in layer l which are modelled by the GAN, I would expect to see similar plots for these baselines.\n\nLack of new Insights\nThe visualizations produced in this paper are interesting to look at, but it is not clear what they tell us, other than \"something non-trivial is going on in these networks\". In fact, it is not even clear that the transformations being visualized are indeed non-linear in pixel space (note that even a 2D diffeomorphism, which is a non-linear map on R^2, is a linear operator on the space of *functions* on R^2, i.e. on the space of images). In any case, no attempt is made to analyze the results, or provide new insights into the computations performed by a trained ConvNet.\n\nInterpretation\nThis is a minor point, but I would not say (as the paper does) that the method captures the invariances learned by the model, but rather that it aims to show the variability captured by the model. A ReLU net is only invariant to changes that are mapped to zero by the ReLU, or that end up in the kernel of one of the linear layers. The presented method does not consider this and hence does not analyze invariances.\n\nMinor issues:\n- In the last equation on page 2, the right-hand side is missing a \"min max\".", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Parametrizing filters of a CNN with a GAN", "abstract": "It is commonly agreed that the use of relevant invariances as a good statistical bias is important in machine-learning.

This is attempted by selecting a particular layer, and modelling the space of filters that result in activations that are indistinguishable from activations generated by the real filters (using a GAN). For a GAN noise vector a plausible filter set is created, and for a data sample a set of plausible activations are computed. If the noise vector is perturbed and a new plausible filter set is created, the input data can be optimised to find the input that produces the same set of activations. The claim is that the found input represents the non-linear transformations that the layer is invariant to.\n\nThis is a really interesting perspective on probing invariances and should be explored more. I am not convinced that this particular method is showing much information or highlighting anything particularly interesting, but could be refined in the future to do so.\n\nIt seems that the generated images are not actually plausible images at all and so not many conclusions can be drawn from this method. Instead of performing the optimisation to find x' have you tried visualising the real data sample that gives the closest activations?\n\nI think you may want to consider minimising ||a(x'|z) - a(x|z_k)|| instead to show that moving from x -> x' is the same as is invariant under the transformation z -> z_k  (and thus the corresponding movement in filter space). This (the space between x and x') I think is more interpretable as the invariance corresponding to the space between z and z_k. Have you tried that?\n\nThere is no notion of class invariance, so the GAN can find the space of filters that transform layer inputs into other classes, which may not be desirable. Have you tried conditioning the GAN on class?\n\nOverall I think this method is inventive and shows promise for probing invariances. I'm not convinced the current incarnation is showing anything insightful or useful.

Hence, there is a need for methods to model and extract richer transformations that capture much higher-level invariances. To that end, we introduce a tool allowing to parametrize the set of filters of a trained convolutional neural network with the latent space of a generative adversarial network. We then show that the method can capture highly non-linear invariances of the data by visualizing their effect in the data space.", "pdf": "/pdf/1417b939577e252c1f8c08b510a5c3268c28f4d1.pdf", "paperhash": "kilcher|parametrizing_filters_of_a_cnn_with_a_gan", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkilcher2018parametrizing,\ntitle={Parametrizing filters of a {CNN} with a {GAN}},\nauthor={Yannic Kilcher and Gary Becigneul and Thomas Hofmann},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1-oTz-Cb},\n}", "authors": ["Yannic Kilcher", "Gary Becigneul", "Thomas Hofmann"], "authorids": ["yannic.kilcher@inf.ethz.ch", "gary.becigneul@inf.ethz.ch", "thomas.hofmann@inf.ethz.ch"], "keywords": ["invariance", "cnn", "gan", "infogan", "transformation"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "duedate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "tmdate": 1516825724728, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper1022/Official_Comment", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"replyto": null, "forum": "H1-oTz-Cb", "writers": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1022/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1022/Authors|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1022/Area_Chair|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1022/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1022/Authors|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1022/Area_Chair|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "value-dropdown": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1022/Authors_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1022/Reviewers_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1022/Area_Chairs_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 0, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1022/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1022/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper1022/Area_Chair", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "cdate": 1516825724728}}}], "count": 6}
