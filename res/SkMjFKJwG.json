At the time of submission to the workshop, the choice of data and metric used by Shaban et al. 2017 were not perfectly clear, but since then the public release of a reference implementation and correspondence with the authors allowed us to reproduce their method exactly. With this reproduction we were able to evaluate their method in the same experimental framework as the rest of our comparisons:\n\n- the data is the \"valid\" split of PASCAL VOC 2012, which is the set of val images that do not intersect with SBDD train, as detailed at https://github.com/shelhamer/fcn.berkeleyvision.org/tree/master/data/pascal\n- the metric is the intersection-over-union (IU) averaged over the positive and negative classes, analogous to the mean IU for semantic segmentation, which is averaged over all classes including background\n- we select every input in the \"valid\" split as a query and randomly select a support for it from the pool of inputs in the \"valid\" split containing the same class and fix this assignment of query-support pairs across all methods\n\nThe results in Table 1 are updated accordingly: in the dense regime our method is competitive to the prior method and in the sparse regime our method is state-of-the-art."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Conditional Networks for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation", "abstract": "Few-shot learning methods aim for good performance in the low-data regime.

The network conditions on an annotated support set of images via feature fusion to do inference on an unannotated query image. Once learned, our conditioning approach requires no further optimization for new data. Annotations are instead conditioned on in a single forward pass, making our method suitable for interactive use. We evaluate our co-FCN with dense and sparse annotations, and it achieves competitive accuracy even when given only one positive pixel and one negative pixel, reducing the annotation burden for segmenting new concepts.", "paperhash": "rakelly|conditional_networks_for_fewshot_semantic_segmentation", "keywords": ["semantic segmentation", "few-shot learning"], "_bibtex": "@misc{\n  rakelly2018conditional,\n  title={Conditional Networks for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation},\n  author={Kate Rakelly and Evan Shelhamer and Trevor Darrell and Alyosha Efros and Sergey Levine},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkMjFKJwG}\n}", "authorids": ["rakelly@eecs.berkeley.edu", "shelhamer@cs.berkeley.edu", "trevor@eecs.berkeley.edu", "efros@eecs.berkeley.edu", "svlevine@eecs.berkeley.edu"], "authors": ["Kate Rakelly", "Evan Shelhamer", "Trevor Darrell", "Alyosha Efros", "Sergey Levine"], "TL;DR": "We propose a conditional network learned end-to-end to perform few-shot semantic segmentation", "pdf": "/pdf/7a66e3795be6a9cc1b3f1a432b56fe959ad3fc8d.pdf"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "duedate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "tmdate": 1518629844880, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/-/Acceptance_Decision", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs"], "reply": {"forum": null, "replyto": null, "invitation": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/-/Submission", "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs"]}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs"]}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "value-dropdown": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs", "everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 1, "value": "ICLR 2018 Workshop Acceptance Decision"}, "comment": {"required": false, "order": 3, "description": "(optional) Comment on this decision.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{0,5000}"}, "decision": {"required": true, "order": 2, "value-dropdown": ["Accept", "Reject"]}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "cdate": 1518629844880}}}], "count": 6}
