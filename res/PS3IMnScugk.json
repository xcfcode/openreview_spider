The methods have been tested on two benchmarks focusing on the issue, SCAN and morphological analysis. The system performs on par with recently proposed GECA for SCAN and favorably to GECA on morphological analysis. \n\nThe two datasets have some \u201ctoy flavor\u201d, while SCAN great favors example combination (with recomb-2 performs much better than recomb-1), recomb-1 seem to perform better for morphological analysis dataset, leaving questions about how to choose the exact models in general. \n\n####Pros: \nThe paper proposes the first RNN based neural generator to perform data augmentation for \u201cextreme\u201d compositionality inference. The paper has explained and empirically showed that this learned generator needs a resampler. With these two elements, the approach performs on par with recently proposed GECA (where the data is not augmented via a neural generator) on two datasets.\n\n####Question: \n1. Comparison with GECA: I can read from the paper that the performance is on par with GECA. However, I am unable to grasp nuances, leaving important questions untouched such as: In what scenarios do we expect the model to perform better than GECA? In experimental details, the slightly better performance in Table 2, can it be attributed to finer generation powered by the RNN generator? Why does Recomb-2 perform less well than GECA in SCAN? \n\n2. A uniform framework for resampling\nDifferent recombinations perform more or less favorably across different datasets. While the exact choice depends on the dataset characteristics, a framework will be more attractive if it can perform well on different scenarios. Could the authors list some possible approaches to automatically choose this hyper-parameter please?\n\n####Minor Comments: \nThe paper mentions in several places symbolic scaffolding without citations, literature is certainly rich here, e.g. [1,2] are papers integrating symbolic constraints for semantic parsing. There are also neural architectures that particularly target to ensure some symbolic famous properties such as [3]. \n\nThe authors say in the introduction that the approach (Andreas, 2020) is task specific which seems not correct. In fact, it can be applied to a large range of NLP problems (e.g. all the experiments in this paper compares to the approach GECA))\n\nIn section 3, it says that \u201cthe use of a continuous latent variable appears to make no difference\u201d, I would suggest to precise \u201cmake no difference\u201d as \u201cmake no difference in prediction performance\u201c as the latent variable can facilitate some generation control shown in (Guu et al. 2018). \n\nIn this paper, GECA is first introduced in section 5. I would recommend to put the citation around it (Andreas, 2000) although previously cited.\n\n[1] Sequence-based structured prediction for semantic parsing, Xiao et al. 2016\n[2] A syntactic neural model for general-purpose code generation, Yin and Neubig 2017\n[3] Making Neural Programming Architectures Generalize via Recursion, Cai et al. 2017\n\n####Authors have engaged in the discussion, clarified questions about the paper and addressed comments in its newest revision.

", "comment": "Answers to your questions:\n\n**1) How to choose the models in general? In what scenarios do we expect the model to perform better than GECA?  Can we attribute slightly better performance in Table 2 to finer generation powered by the RNN generator?**\n\nThe improvements due to GECA and learned augmentation are at least somewhat orthogonal (see response to R3), so it\u2019s not the case that one approach strictly dominates the other, and we don\u2019t have to choose just one! \n\nSlightly more formally, GECA can be viewed as computing the closure of a training set under the assumption that the training set is *substitutable* (Clark and Eyraud, JMLR 2007). When this assumption is violated, GECA will introduce systematic errors into the augmented training set. As a concrete example, the formal language a^nb^n is not substitutable (see p1738 of C&E), and applying GECA to a dataset of strings a^nb^n will also produce strings a^nb^m for n != m. However, RNNs like our \"learned aug (basic)\" model are capable of correctly modeling a^n b^n and generalizing to new n (see Weiss et al. ACL 2018 or Gers & Schmidhuber 2001). So we have a concrete example of a language where learned augmentation is more expressive than GECA. \n\n**2) Why does recomb-2 perform less well than GECA in SCAN?**\n\nRecomb-2 performs less well only in the around right split of SCAN. The substitution rule that GECA infers is able to precisely change every \"X left\" with \"X right\"  and corresponding \"I_LEFT\" with \"I_RIGHT\" in the output, so is particularly well-suited for this split. There is somewhat more noise in the learned model\u2019s flexible generation procedure; this is necessary to accommodate more natural data like Sigmorphon.\n\n**3) Task specificness of GECA?**\n\nThanks for the suggestion. We\u2019ll adjust this language in the final version of the paper; our main point here is that GECA makes specific generative assumptions about sequence data that may be violated by real-world datasets. Another advantage of learned augmentation (though not considered in this paper) is the possibility of applying learned recombination to non-sequential data (e.g image and caption pairs).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1966/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1966/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Recombine and Resample Data For Compositional Generalization", "authorids": ["~Ekin_Aky\u00fcrek1", "~Afra_Feyza_Aky\u00fcrek1", "~Jacob_Andreas1"], "authors": ["Ekin Aky\u00fcrek", "Afra Feyza Aky\u00fcrek", "Jacob Andreas"], "keywords": ["compositional generalization", "data augmentation", "language processing", "sequence models", "generative modeling"], "abstract": "Flexible neural sequence models outperform grammar- and automaton-based counterparts on a variety of tasks.

The best Turkish result is changed from 77% to 78%, the best Spanish results is changed from 72% to 74%, Swahili is unchanged. These results suggest that gains from GECA and learned augmentation are at least partly orthogonal. We will include these results and discuss them in the final version.\n\n**2) Why does resampling hurt GECA on SCAN?**\n\nWe believe this is due to resampling a larger fraction of examples that are malformed as well as the greater correlation between x and the noise applied to y. Also note that the std values for these experiments are high.\n\n**3) Larger Dataset?**\n\nWe agree that this is an important direction for future work!

We respectfully disagree with the claim that our approach obtains \"comparable accuracy to simple rule-based approach\": recomb+resampling significantly outperforms GECA+resampling in multiple experiments (All/Swahili, Novel/Swahili and Novel/Turkish) while matching it in the rest: recombination is measurably better even compared to the improved version of GECA presented in this paper.\n\n**2) Why restrict to n=2?**\n\nThe n > 2 case would certainly be a natural extension of this approach; one of the main research questions here is how to construct a natural neighborhood function of the kind described for the n = 2 case in this paper. Allowing these neighborhood functions to be fully learned is an important challenge for future work.\n\n**3) Why does n=1 outperform  n=2 in some instances on Sigmorphon? (The review asks the opposite question, but we assume it\u2019s a typo.)**\n\nOur intuition is that learning to recombine is a more complex task than learning to edit. When the model has enough data to robustly learn this skill, it can generate complex novel samples as seen in SCAN. The morphology datasets provide fewer samples for learning complex recombination strategies, and modifying individual examples turns out to be quite helpful on its own.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1966/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1966/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Recombine and Resample Data For Compositional Generalization", "authorids": ["~Ekin_Aky\u00fcrek1", "~Afra_Feyza_Aky\u00fcrek1", "~Jacob_Andreas1"], "authors": ["Ekin Aky\u00fcrek", "Afra Feyza Aky\u00fcrek", "Jacob Andreas"], "keywords": ["compositional generalization", "data augmentation", "language processing", "sequence models", "generative modeling"], "abstract": "Flexible neural sequence models outperform grammar- and automaton-based counterparts on a variety of tasks.

This paper demonstrates that a learned data augmentation strategy can be as effective at encouraging generalization as a rule-based one.\n\nContributions:\n* Extends the prototype+edit model (Guu et al 2018) to a recombinator model with multi-source copy attention.\n* Proposes a resampling scheme for upweighting rare examples.\n* Obtains results comparable to strong rule-based data augmentation baseline GECA on two datasets, demonstrating that the combination of both resampling and recombination is effective.\n\nStrengths:\n* Clearly written. The method is simple and is broken down cleanly into recombination and resampling.\n* Ablation studies support the need for both recombination and resampling.\n* Sufficient performance to support the claim. The approach manages to match the performance of GECA with a learned method, while remaining more flexible.\n\nWeaknesses:\n* Neighbourhood heuristics are one of the last remaining applications of manual rules in the method, but seem necessary for computationally feasible training.\n\nDecision: Accept\n* Problem is important: Whether unstructured models can generalize on structured data has implications for whether or not to move towards more structured models. This paper provides experimental evidence that unstructured models can generalize on structured data with a data augmentation procedure that uses fewer manually specified rules than previously shown. This provides a path forward by continuing to iterate on the augmentation procedure.\n\nQuestions:\n* Given that GECA is feasible on both datasets, would there be benefit to combining the examples from the learned augmentation strategy with those from GECA? In other words, do the different augmentation strategies result in orthogonal improvements?\n* Why does resampling hurt GECA on SCAN?\n\nSuggestions:\n* Both datasets are quite small. The story could be strengthened by demonstrating the method scales better than GECA by applying it to a larger dataset as well, such as a translation dataset.\n\nNit:\n* w is overloaded to both be a value of d (eqns 12, 13, 17) as well as the weighting function (eqns 1, 18)\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1966/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1966/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Recombine and Resample Data For Compositional Generalization", "authorids": ["~Ekin_Aky\u00fcrek1", "~Afra_Feyza_Aky\u00fcrek1", "~Jacob_Andreas1"], "authors": ["Ekin Aky\u00fcrek", "Afra Feyza Aky\u00fcrek", "Jacob Andreas"], "keywords": ["compositional generalization", "data augmentation", "language processing", "sequence models", "generative modeling"], "abstract": "Flexible neural sequence models outperform grammar- and automaton-based counterparts on a variety of tasks.

Would be valuable to know the applicability to real-world data", "review": "\nSummary:\n\n \nThe paper proposes an interesting approach to systematically generate new examples and augment the training data with these examples. The goal is to target rare and unseen sequences of text or instructions with this augmentation. \nIn particular, it proposes learning to copy parts of the reference examples. The approach is based on prototype-based models where every training example can be explained by at least one other example and a parametric rewriting operation. They show that these models do not perform well when facing complex (and rare) composition events and propose a recombination addition to address this issue.\n \nI like the idea of systematically augmenting training data targeting rare and unseen subsequences. I give an \"accept\" to this work because of its novelty and contribution (see pros below). \nMy minor concern is about the impact and/or usefulness of this work when dealing with real-world datasets and more complicated tasks as well as some clarity issues (see cons below). Hopefully, the authors can address my concern in the rebuttal period. \n\n ##########################################################################\n\nPros:\n\n1. The paper addresses one of the interesting and important shortcomings of current neural models: the ability to generalize to rare and unseen sequences. I find this problem important to investigate and applicable to many areas of research.\n\n2. The proposed approach is flexible and practical to use. The design of the prototype-based data augmentation method is reasonable and interesting. \n\n3. This paper provides comprehensive experiments, including both qualitative analysis and quantitative results, to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework. \n\n \n##########################################################################\n\nCons: \n\n \n1. In Table 2, we see F1 score for morphological analysis. It is not entirely clear to me why the results in the NOVEL section of the table is very close to ALL section. NOVEL shows model accuracy on examples whose exact tag set never appeared in the training data and I expected a bigger gap in the performance.\n\n2. There is a big gap between the performance of 1- and 2-prototype models. Do the authors know what explains this gap? Have the authors explored the higher order of prototype recombinations? \n\n3. What are the challenges of applying this approach to real-world data sets for instance in machine translation? I will suggest the authors discuss the implications and possible shortcomings of such an approach when dealing with natural (and potentially long) sequences of text. The definition of unseen subsequences and compositional learning will be more complex there. \n\n4. It is not clear to me what the authors mean by \"hints\". Is the complete sequence counts as a hint? Or only the subsequence that was identified as rare?\n\n \n#########################################################################\n\nSome typos: \n\n\n(1) Relevant literature that was not mentioned in this paper:\n         https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00440\n         https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02929\n\n(2) Equation (31): tex formatting issue.\n\n(3) Typo in page 15 section G1: Fig. Table 2 shows -> Table 2 shows\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1966/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1966/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Recombine and Resample Data For Compositional Generalization", "authorids": ["~Ekin_Aky\u00fcrek1", "~Afra_Feyza_Aky\u00fcrek1", "~Jacob_Andreas1"], "authors": ["Ekin Aky\u00fcrek", "Afra Feyza Aky\u00fcrek", "Jacob Andreas"], "keywords": ["compositional generalization", "data augmentation", "language processing", "sequence models", "generative modeling"], "abstract": "Flexible neural sequence models outperform grammar- and automaton-based counterparts on a variety of tasks.
