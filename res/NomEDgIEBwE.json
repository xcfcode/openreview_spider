We are very glad that you think this work provides a novel approach to an important problem. We very much agree that the connection between robustness and invariance is an intuitive one. We have added several new experiments, including an investigation into the sensitivity with respect to the hyperparameter lambda. We hope the following more detailed responses addresses all your questions.\n\n> *There seems to be missing plots depicting this difference as a function of lambda. Is the method highly sensitive to lambda? or does a large range provide similar effects? If it's the latter case, why so?*\n\nThanks for this great suggestion. We have duly added an additional ablation study [Figure 6] that shows how the conditional variance and the downstream task performance change as lambda is varied. As expected, the conditional variance decreases as lambda increases. The downstream task performance improves, before starting to get worse as lambda is made too large. We found a broad range of lambda values gave good performance: everything between 1e-4 and 1e-2 worked well. This corresponds to a fairly wide spectrum of suitable values.  We believe that the reason for this is that being effective requires a regularizer that can be brought close to 0 during the course of training but does not dominate over the contrastive term, a relatively weak requirement.\n\n> *What is preventing a large decrease in conditional variation given this loss augmentation?*\n\nThe contrastive term in the loss (cf. equation 13) may prevent a large decrease in conditional variance for very small lambda values. In particular, the contrastive loss cannot be small for \u201ctrivial\u201d solutions to minimizing the conditional variance, e.g. mapping every input to the same representation. Thus, our algorithm performs well when the two terms of equation 13 are well-balanced. In practice, the conditional variance does decrease to a small value when regularization is used, but the contrastive loss is allowed to simultaneously decrease so this is not problematic.\n\n>*How would these ideas apply to more complicated nuisance transformations such as object pose?*\n\nThis is an interesting question.  As a continuous transformation parameter, our approach would naturally apply to object pose. The pose transformation variable (e.g. angles describing pose) would be a part of the transformation parameter alpha. We could then apply our gradient regularization to ensure that representations change slowly as pose is changed. At test time, information from multiple poses could be combined using feature averaging. A more complex relationship between pose and representation (e.g. equivariance) would be an exciting topic for future work.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3273/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3273/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving Transformation Invariance in Contrastive Representation Learning", "authorids": ["~Adam_Foster1", "~Rattana_Pukdee1", "~Tom_Rainforth1"], "authors": ["Adam Foster", "Rattana Pukdee", "Tom Rainforth"], "keywords": ["contrastive learning", "representation learning", "transformation invariance"], "abstract": "We propose methods to strengthen the invariance properties of representations obtained by contrastive learning.

We are very pleased that you think our work constitutes a clear contribution and that our results demonstrate effectiveness. We agree that our method can be plugged into many recent methods, and feel that this is a further strength of our ideas. Following the suggestions made by yourself and other reviewers, we have added a significant number of new experiments to the paper, including an experiment with MoCo v2 as the base method in place of SimCLR. We believe the new experiments substantially strengthen the work.  We hope that you agree and ask you to consider increasing your score if you do. \n\nWe now present detailed answers to your questions.\n\n> *It seems the proposed methods can be plugged into many recent studies. Thus more comprehensive experiments are needed to validate its generalization, e.g., combining with other baselines and conducting on ImageNet.*\n\nWe agree that a great benefit of our method is that it can be used with a wide variety of base methods and thank you for the sensible suggestion of adding such experiments. We have duly carried this out by conducting a new experiment using MoCo v2 as the base method on the CIFAR-100 dataset [Table 3]. We see that our approach again leads to significant improvements in performance over the baseline approach: for ResNet50 we achieved more than a 6% improvement.\n\nTraining with ImageNet is also a great idea, but we are unfortunately limited in our computational resources such that this will take us some time.  As a first step, we have performed an experiment using pre-trained MoCo v2 encoders and showed that feature averaging with M=20 improved top-1 accuracy on ImageNet from 71.1% to 71.9%, confirming that our approaches can also offer improvements on large scale datasets. We have started training MoCo v2 from scratch with our full approach for ImageNet, this will take us a few weeks to run so will not be ready before the end of the rebuttal period, but we will add the new results when it is done.\n\n> *Correct me if I were wrong.  It seems more than half of the improvements come from the testing strategies\u2026 I also think that the claim of SOTA is not rigorous if it has benefited from testing strategies.*\n\nWe feel there may have been a misunderstanding here: our approach does not perform any model updates or fine tuning at test time; we use linear evaluation on frozen representations, in line with standard practice in the literature.  Thus, though we agree that feature averaging leads to improved performance, we disagree that this means our results are not rigorous in any way, or that they form inappropriate comparisons to previous SOTA.\n\nTo be more precise, our methodology at test time creates a single representation for each training and testing image without changing the encoder. Using these frozen representations, a linear classifier is trained on the representation training set, which is then evaluated on the representation test set. This aligns with standard practices in the literature e.g. SimCLR, MoCo, etc.\n\nTo further contrast our approach with other established methodologies: unlike test time augmentation, our linear classifiers are not trained on a longer dataset (for CIFAR, our linear classifier is always trained on a dataset of length 50000 of averaged representations); unlike augmentation ensembling, predictions from the linear classifier only require one pass through the classifier; unlike fine tuning, gradients do not flow to the encoder network at test time.\n\nWe strongly believe our results are rigorous and comparable to other approaches that fit a linear classifier to frozen features.  In fact, by following careful statistical good practices, such as using repeat runs to test statistical significance, we feel that our paper is unusually rigorous for the subfield (as noted by another reviewer).\n\n> *The claimed contribution of \"feature averaging\" during testing looks more like a testing time augmentation for me*\n\nAs noted by reviewer 1, feature averaging and test time augmentation are related but distinct ideas. \n\nWe have introduced a new experiment that compares feature averaging with test time augmentation and augmentation ensembling. See Figure 7 for the results from this experiment and Appendix F.2.5 for full details of the distinction between feature averaging and augmentation. \n\nTo explain the distinction in more detail: if using augmentation to train the linear classifier, one would use an expanded dataset with the representations of multiple differently augmented versions of the same input considered separately. In our feature averaging approach, the dataset to train the linear classifier is of a fixed size, but the representations are formed as an average of multiple features. At testing time, with augmentation ensembling, the prediction probabilities would be averaged as in Equation 51, whilst we instead perform a single forward pass through the linear model with a feature averaged representation."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3273/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3273/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving Transformation Invariance in Contrastive Representation Learning", "authorids": ["~Adam_Foster1", "~Rattana_Pukdee1", "~Tom_Rainforth1"], "authors": ["Adam Foster", "Rattana Pukdee", "Tom Rainforth"], "keywords": ["contrastive learning", "representation learning", "transformation invariance"], "abstract": "We propose methods to strengthen the invariance properties of representations obtained by contrastive learning.

To this end, we have added a new experiment that compares feature averaging with augmentations ensembling (Sec 6.7 and Figure 7). We found that, whilst ensembling does nearly as well as feature averaging in terms of accuracy, the test loss is far worse. This result makes sense in light of Theorem 1.\n\nWe have also added additional comparisons by considering the effect of applying our approaches in the context of the MoCo v2 model, finding that they offer substantial improvements here as well (see Table 3).\n\n> *The model could directly predict augmentation parameters and have the gradients of that loss penalized/ reversed*\n\nAn adversarial training baseline would also be interesting although we did not have time to implement it during the rebuttal phase. We will aim to add this into the final version of the paper nonetheless. \n\n> *It is also unclear how much train/test time compute model adds*\n\nWe have added a discussion of computational cost in Section F.2.7. In summary, the addition of gradient regularization typically increased training times by a factor of at most 2. Computing feature averaged representations scales as O(M), whilst training and testing the linear classifiers themselves is O(1). Training time remained by far the larger in all experiments by orders of magnitude.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3273/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3273/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving Transformation Invariance in Contrastive Representation Learning", "authorids": ["~Adam_Foster1", "~Rattana_Pukdee1", "~Tom_Rainforth1"], "authors": ["Adam Foster", "Rattana Pukdee", "Tom Rainforth"], "keywords": ["contrastive learning", "representation learning", "transformation invariance"], "abstract": "We propose methods to strengthen the invariance properties of representations obtained by contrastive learning.

Similarly instead of gradient regularization, the model could directly predict augmentation parameters and have the gradients of that loss penalized/ reversed. Adding such additional baselines, would solidify the improvements as best in class.\n- It is also unclear how much train/test time compute model adds.\n\nOverall, this is a very nicely written paper and very solid contribution. If the authors address my concerns, would be happy to increase my score.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3273/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3273/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving Transformation Invariance in Contrastive Representation Learning", "authorids": ["~Adam_Foster1", "~Rattana_Pukdee1", "~Tom_Rainforth1"], "authors": ["Adam Foster", "Rattana Pukdee", "Tom Rainforth"], "keywords": ["contrastive learning", "representation learning", "transformation invariance"], "abstract": "We propose methods to strengthen the invariance properties of representations obtained by contrastive learning. While existing approaches implicitly induce a degree of invariance as representations are learned, we look to more directly enforce invariance in the encoding process. To this end, we first introduce a training objective for contrastive learning that uses a novel regularizer to control how the representation changes under transformation. We show that representations trained with this objective perform better on downstream tasks and are more robust to the introduction of nuisance transformations at test time. Second, we propose a change to how test time representations are generated by introducing a feature averaging approach that combines encodings from multiple transformations of the original input, finding that this leads to across the board performance gains. Finally, we introduce the novel Spirograph dataset to explore our ideas in the context of a differentiable generative process with multiple downstream tasks, showing that our techniques for learning invariance are highly beneficial.", "one-sentence_summary": "We propose methods to strengthen the invariance properties of representations obtained by contrastive learning using novel gradient regularization during training and feature averaging at test time.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "foster|improving_transformation_invariance_in_contrastive_representation_learning", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/7719fa440718a00944a83b0887d6e5d339e9cab5.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/e3baf7e0977e406cd670f02bcbd6f7f970789d01.pdf", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Poster", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nfoster2021improving,\ntitle={Improving Transformation Invariance in Contrastive Representation Learning},\nauthor={Adam Foster and Rattana Pukdee and Tom Rainforth},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=NomEDgIEBwE}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
