This topic is relevant and the paper would have more impact if its structure, presentation  and formalism could be improved. Overall it lacks clarity in the presentation of the results, the assumptions made are not always clearly stated and the split between previous work and original derivations should be improved. \n\nIn particular in section 2.1, the author should state what exactly the mean-field approximation is and at which step it is required (e.g. independence is assumed to apply the CLT but this is not clearly stated). Section 3 should also clearly state the assumptions made. That section just follows the \u201cbackground\u201d section where different works treating different cases are mentioned and it is important to restate here which cases this paper specifically considers. Aside from making assumptions clearer, it would be helpful to highlight the specific contributions of the paper so we can easily see the distinctions between straightforward adaptations of previous work and new contributions.\n\nSpecific questions:\n\nIt might be worth double checking the equation between eq. (2) and eq. (3) , the boundary case (l=0) does not make sense to me, in particular what is S^0 ?.\n\nWhat does the term hat{p}(x^l) mean in the left hand side of eq.(3)? \n\nIn eq. (7) (8) why use the definition symbol := ?\n\nAt the beginning of section 3.1, please indicate what \u201cmatcal(M)\u201d precisely refers to. Using the term P(mathcal(M) = M_ij) does not make much sense if the intent is to use a continuous distribution for the means. \n\nJust after eq. (9), please explain what Xi_{c*} means. \n\nSmall typo: Eq. (10) is introduced as \u201ccan be read from the vector equation 31\u201d, what is eq. (31)?\n\nIn section 5.2, why reducing the training set size to 25% of MNIST?\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2503/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2503/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["george.stamatescu@gmail.com", "federicagerace91@gmail.com", "carlo.lucibello@gmail.com", "ian.fuss@adelaide.edu.au", "lang.white@adelaide.edu.au"], "title": "Critical initialisation in continuous approximations of binary neural networks", "authors": ["George Stamatescu", "Federica Gerace", "Carlo Lucibello", "Ian Fuss", "Langford White"], "pdf": "/pdf/71a41b43a6dc91d6e4322cb83f251fd555711e7e.pdf", "TL;DR": "signal propagation theory applied to continuous surrogates of binary nets;  counter intuitive initialisation; reparameterisation trick not helpful", "abstract": "The training of stochastic neural network models with binary ($\\pm1$) weights and activations via continuous surrogate networks is investigated.

Being able to give such advice to ML practitioners is of great value, but since this advice feels counter intuitive (naively, the mean of a binary +/-1 activation is typically the output of a tanh, and initialising this close to +/-1 means that gradient are going to be roughly 0, and can easily be exactly 0 in low precision computes).\"\n\n- You are correct that the advice is to initialise the *means* of the stochastic *weights* close to +/-1. Your intuition on activations, such as tanh, saturating and thus producing zero gradients is also right.\n However, we do *not* initialise activations!\nThe theory developed by Poole et al. and Schoenholz et al. actually addresses the saturation of activations, in a more general framework - either looking at forward propagation (we stay (at initialisation) on the linear parts of the activation), or the equivalet of controlling the Jacobian's average (squared) singular values  - if their average =1 (= chi_1), this means there can be no saturation or zero gradient.\nCritical initialisations means precisely this setting (chi_1 =1) .\n\n\"Right now, the justification of this initialisation is hard to find in the paper. This point would deserve a dedicated section, giving a summary of the argument, with references to more technical parts of the paper\"\n\n-Thank you for raising this, it is an important point, and a good suggestion. \n- In the opening of section 3 we have described this idea, pointing to Claims 1 and 3, which establish the +/-1 initialisation of the weights' means. \n- We also emphasise this advice in the introduction and discussion. The paper also has an outline in the introduction which points to these sections.\n- More intuitive explanations (as discussed in our response to your question) are provided in Poole and Schoenholz, and we expect readers would follow this up. Unfortunately we find we are limited for space, otherwise we would include it. We rate these explanations quite highly, and agree with your concern.\n\n\n***Response to specific issues:***\n\n''Missing letters, repeated words or even missing figures (Fig 5 and 7 in the appendix).\"\n- we agree, and have tidied up the paper in this regard.\n\n''Authors need to explain what is Edge of Chaos and give some reference\"\n- We have removed the phrase ''edge of chaos\", since it is equivalent to the set of (sigma_m, sigma_b) which critically initialise the network. This is clear from Definition 1, and claims 1,2,3, in section 3 of the paper. \nFor further information, the term 'edge of chaos' refers to the marginal stability of the c*=1 fixed point of the correlation map c(c^{l-1}) -figure 1.c). If chi=1 at c*=1, the fixed point is marginally stable. This perspective is discussed in Poole et al, Schoenholz et al. and more recently in Hayou et al. We include this discussion in the appendix.\n\n\n''Please, better explain figures, for example Figure 1: need to explain better what this plot is. Why are there both dotted and solid lines? What are the shaded regions: is that some confidence interval? But which one, and how many experiments were used for those plots?\"\n\n- The main text now describes the dotted lines (empirical means) and solid line (theory), and the shaded region corresponding to the simulations falling under one standard deviation.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2503/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2503/Reviewers/Submitted", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2503/Area_Chairs"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2503/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["george.stamatescu@gmail.com", "federicagerace91@gmail.com", "carlo.lucibello@gmail.com", "ian.fuss@adelaide.edu.au", "lang.white@adelaide.edu.au"], "title": "Critical initialisation in continuous approximations of binary neural networks", "authors": ["George Stamatescu", "Federica Gerace", "Carlo Lucibello", "Ian Fuss", "Langford White"], "pdf": "/pdf/71a41b43a6dc91d6e4322cb83f251fd555711e7e.pdf", "TL;DR": "signal propagation theory applied to continuous surrogates of binary nets;  counter intuitive initialisation; reparameterisation trick not helpful", "abstract": "The training of stochastic neural network models with binary ($\\pm1$) weights and activations via continuous surrogate networks is investigated.

We derive new surrogates using a novel derivation based on writing the stochastic neural network as a Markov chain. This derivation also encompasses existing variants of the surrogates presented in the literature. Following this, we theoretically study the surrogates at initialisation. We derive, using mean field theory, a set of scalar equations describing how input signals propagate through the randomly initialised networks. The equations reveal whether so-called critical initialisations exist for each surrogate network, where the network can be trained to arbitrary depth. Moreover, we predict theoretically and confirm numerically, that common weight initialisation schemes used in standard continuous networks, when applied to the mean values of the stochastic binary weights, yield poor training performance. This study shows that, contrary to common intuition, the means of the stochastic binary weights should be initialised close to $\\pm 1$, for deeper networks to be trainable.", "keywords": [], "paperhash": "stamatescu|critical_initialisation_in_continuous_approximations_of_binary_neural_networks", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nStamatescu2020Critical,\ntitle={Critical initialisation in continuous approximations of binary neural networks},\nauthor={George Stamatescu and Federica Gerace and Carlo Lucibello and Ian Fuss and Langford White},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rylmoxrFDH}\n}", "full_presentation_video": "", "original_pdf": "/attachment/b649da9286f2afd69b331f5bcd514ad70753595d.pdf", "appendix": "", "poster": "", "spotlight_video": "", "slides": ""}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
