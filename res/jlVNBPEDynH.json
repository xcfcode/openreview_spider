It takes a high-dimensional image input and processes it through modified ResNet encoders to obtain a graph cost map and a start/goal heatmap. This is fed into a differentiable Dijkstra algorithm to obtain the shortest trajectory prediction which is trained using an expert-annotated trajectory via a Hamming distance loss. This module is evaluated in two dynamic game environments demonstrating generalization to unseen scenes.\n\n\n**STRENGTHS**\n- The general idea of integrating BlackBox combinatoric shortest path algorithms in a differentiable planning module is interesting and has a lot of potential to be useful. \n\n**WEAKNESSES**\n- The novelty compared to Vlastelica et al. (2020) is not clear.\n- The design choices are not clearly justified and the considered use-cases for this particular architecture are limited.\n- Important information is missing to make this work reproducible (see reproducibility section)\n- The evaluation considers only shortest-path planning scenarios that are amenable to the proposed architecture (see evaluation section). The authors should either provide a clear motivation of the considered scenario types or evaluation on scenarios learning more complex representations.\n\n**CLARITY**\n\nThe general idea of the work is clearly written although important information for reproducibility is missing (see below). I also felt that the authors did not make particularly good use of space. For example, Sec. 3 and Sec 4.1 could be condensed into a joint background section, leaving more space for more detailed experiments. The information in Sec 4.3 seems to be a better fit for either the related work or the conclusion section. \n\nSmaller clarification questions:\n- What is the y axis in fig 5 (a).\n- In the conclusion: What exactly is meant by knowing the topological structure of the latent planning graph a priori? How is this incorporated as an inductive bias into the neural network? \n\n**REPRODUCIBILITY**\n\nThe results in this work are not reproducible. Relevant information on training (e.g. which optimizer was used? what were the learning rates? ...), hyperparameters (which parameters were tuned? which range was considered? how were they tuned?), baseline method training (e.g., how long was PPO trained, how exactly were rewards defined, ...) and environment generation settings are missing.\n\n\n**EVALUATION**\n\nThe evaluation seems one of the weak points of this work. The problems here are threefold:\n1. the number of considered tasks is very limited and their type is very limited to scenarios where one image input provides enough information to generate a full cost map. This does not hold in most planning tasks. \n2. Because the architecture itself is a claimed contribution, this work would require a much more thorough evaluation of architecture design decisions such as which underlying CNN is used, what is the \n3. Simply using the PPO baseline is insufficient. First, there is no discussion on how and why this algorithm was chosen as a baseline. Second, more recent or closer related baselines are missing. Some of those are mentioned in related work and they seem to be more fair/useful comparison methods. \n\n\n**NOVELTY / IMPACT**\n\nThe work is not sufficiently motivated. While planning, in general, is an important problem and differentiable planners are an important research topic, the motivation of this work is not clear. The authors should not only name the use-cases where an intermediate planning module might be beneficial but also discuss what the main insights of this work are. As the authors write themselves, a differentiable implementation of TDSP in a neural network can simply be achieved by applying theory from Vlastelica et al. (2020). In fact, that paper already demonstrates the use of Dijkstra in a neural network computation graph. This opens up the question of what is the key idea and value of the present work? \n\nFurthermore, the authors did not sufficiently consider/discuss existing related work. The related work does not sufficiently cover state-of-the-art. Combining planning modules with deep learning pipelines (although in slightly different ways) has been considered in several works. More importantly, the related work should discuss why the proposed approach is beneficial compared to approaches containing differentiable planners. The related work is also missing numerous relevant papers. Some potential examples involve:\n\n- Kuo et al., Deep sequential models for sampling-based planning, IROS 2018\n- Kumar et al., LEGO: Leveraging Experience in Roadmap Generation for Sampling-Based Planning, IROS 2019\n- Gupta et al., Cognitive mapping and planning for visual navigation, CVPR 2017\n- Savinov et al., Semi-Parametric Topological Memory for Navigation, ICLR 2018\n- Tamar et al., Value Iteration Networks, NeurIPS 2016\n\nFinally, the related work section should not only provide a broader discussion of related works but also more clearly emphasize the relationship between these works and the present work (e.g. how and in what context is the present work better more useful than related works? Which ideas are used from related work and what is new to this work? ...).\n\n**REVIEW SUMMARY**\n\nOverall, I recommend rejection of this work because the issues raised in this review cannot be resolved without a significant amount of work. While this may be discouraging, I believe that the authors are considering an interesting topic that has a lot of potential and, after resolving the issues raised in this review, may result in a successful submission.\n\n**POST-DISCUSSION SUMMARY**\nI want to thank the authors for answering my questions and correcting misunderstandings and updating the paper. I still recommend rejection of this work given that the novelty is not yet fully clear. While the updated list of contributions is indeed a better match for this work, claiming that correct inductive biases improve generalization does not seem to be a new insight. As mentioned in my initial review, I still believe that the general line of work has a lot of potential and want to encourage the authors to fully address the general concerns raised in the reviews and resubmit the work.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1992/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1992/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neuro-algorithmic Policies for Discrete Planning", "authorids": ["~Marin_Vlastelica_Pogan\u010di\u01071", "~Michal_Rolinek2", "~Georg_Martius1"], "authors": ["Marin Vlastelica Pogan\u010di\u0107", "Michal Rolinek", "Georg Martius"], "keywords": ["planning", "reinforcement learning", "combinatorial optimization", "control", "imitation learning"], "abstract": "Although model-based and model-free approaches to learning the control of systems have achieved impressive results on standard benchmarks, generalization to variations in the task are still unsatisfactory.

The non-differentiability of the path planning is handled by recent work on differentiating through blackbox combinatorial solvers from [1]. The method is trained in a supervised manner from expert trajectories. Evaluations are presented on 2-D time-varying games where the addition of the path-planner is shown to improve performance over an imitation learning and PPO baseline.\n\n##### Pros:\n- The method is simple and looks to perform well in the experiments.\n- The description of the approach is fairly clear and well written.\n\n##### Cons:\n- The novelty relative to [1] is quite low. Specifically, [1] already uses the blackbox differentiation to do shortest path solving using a neural network architecture to estimate the costs.\n- Overall, the evaluation is a bit lacking.\n- The paper is missing key details that would aid anyone trying to build off of or replicate this work.\n\n#### Decision:\nGiven the low novelty and not-so-strong evaluation, I do not recommend this paper for acceptance. \n\n#### Questions:\n1. As far as I can tell, the main novelty relative to [1] is the use of a time-varying cost function (albeit encoded into a shortest-path search as in [1]) and the learned start and goal encoder. Am I missing something else?\n2. How does this approach compare to the recent work of [2]?\n3. Is the imitation learning baseline behavior cloning or something else? This needs more detail.\n4. The set of baselines is insufficient since PPO does not make use of the expert trajectories. Something like GAIL [3] or SQIL [4], which combines RL and imitation learning, should be used in addition to the other two baselines.\n4. In Section 4.2, the set of admissible paths seems like it may be a hard constraint to satisfy. How do you accomplish this?\n\n#### Comments:\n1. Given that there don\u2019t seem to be great baselines for these tasks, it would improve the evaluation to also show results on a simpler task that does have other baselines, such as non-time-varying shortest path search.\n2. Overall, the paper could use more detail on the architecture, the hyperparameters, the baselines, the domains, and anything else needed to get this to work. It would be quite nontrivial to reproduce this work from the paper alone. A subsection on training would also be nice, as the training details seem to be scattered throughout the other sections, which makes it hard to piece together exactly how it\u2019s done.\n3. Please learn the difference between citep and citet (from natbib) and use them appropriately to make the citations more intelligible for the reader.\n4. The first paragraph of the intro doesn\u2019t make it clear that this work falls on the first end of the discussed spectrum and uses expert demonstrations to learn from.\n5. For the related work section, don\u2019t just list related work, contrast that work to your own so that the reader gets a better understanding of your method in the context of the existing work.\n6.

The generalization is with respect to unseen levels.\n\n> \u201cThe evaluation considers only shortest-path planning scenarios that are amenable to the proposed architecture\u201d\n\n Indeed, we see this as one of the strengths of model-based and hybrid approaches, this allows certain structural priors to be used for encoding knowledge of the problems at hand in order to solve them more efficiently, similarly as stated in [1]. We make this more explicit in the introduction.\n\nWe acknowledge that there are problems of reproducibility, we have made adjustments to the writeup and published the code. Please read the general answer.\n\nRegarding novelty concerns, please read the general answer.\n\n>\u201cIn the conclusion: What exactly is meant by knowing the topological structure of the latent planning graph a priori? How is this incorporated as an inductive bias into the neural network?\u201d\n\nThe network outputs a DAG with a specific topology (encoding that there are 5 actions) and we learn the costs of the edges, this is the form of the inductive bias that we impose on the policy, we make this more explicit in the conclusion.\n\nRegarding evaluation concerns - We\u2019ve updated in detail the information about the architecture and the hyperparameters used for evaluation, this can be found in the appendix. PPO was chosen as a baseline because it was used in the original ProcGen paper [2]. Note that PPO is indeed unfair for different reasons and it mainly serves to show that learning tasks that require combinatorial generalization is too hard to simply apply model-free RL algorithms. We will clarify this in the appendix. \n\nOur method is an offline imitation learning method, which means that we don\u2019t get any additional information by interacting with the environment. This is the reason we have chosen to compare to a behavior cloning method (we\u2019ve made this more explicit in the writeup), since baselines such as GAIL and SQIL are online, i.e. they combine expert data with newly sampled data (as R4 noted). A more fair comparison would be an offline RL method, such as CQL [3] (Conservative Q-Learning), but this method has only been proposed recently, before the submission of this paper, and hasn\u2019t been published yet. Note that offline RL methods are solving a bit of a different problem by also trying to learn policies that are better than sub-optimal expert policies, since we propose a specific hybrid architecture that is a closed-loop policy, it could be also trained via an offline RL method, which is a promising area of future work.

We make the requirement explicit that a goal needs to be reached. This makes the shortest path a viable solution to the restricted MDP setting.\n\n> \u201cThe biggest concern I have with the paper is that it is extremely unclear what exactly is meant by the assumption of a known topology of the gcMDP\u201d\n\nThe topology describes what kind of structure the underlying MDP has, i.e. which state transitions can be made. In the case of gridworld environment, the topology of the MDP is such that transitions can be made only to 4 neighboring vertices (except on the edges of the grid). We clarify this in more detail in the paper.\u201d\n\n> \u201cI am also curious how much stochasticity in the environment can be handled by your method. This is in reference to the sentence 'Although the actual gcMDP solved by the expert may be stochastic, we learn a deterministic latent approximate gcMDP'\". \n\nThis is a good question that we want to address in future work. We believe that the costs would account for stochasticities rendering the found shortest path the one taking potential perturbations into account (as the expert performs well on average). Replanning in the MPC framework should make the policy locally resilient. \nSo we don\u2019t consider this as a limitation. Additionally, most real-world use cases are indeed deterministic, the stochastic formulation is used to account for unknown factors of variation that change the transition dynamics.\n\n> \u201cLooking ahead, I am curious if the authors have considered extending the proposed system to continuous environments\u201d \n\nYes, this is indeed something we plan to consider for future work.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1992/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1992/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neuro-algorithmic Policies for Discrete Planning", "authorids": ["~Marin_Vlastelica_Pogan\u010di\u01071", "~Michal_Rolinek2", "~Georg_Martius1"], "authors": ["Marin Vlastelica Pogan\u010di\u0107", "Michal Rolinek", "Georg Martius"], "keywords": ["planning", "reinforcement learning", "combinatorial optimization", "control", "imitation learning"], "abstract": "Although model-based and model-free approaches to learning the control of systems have achieved impressive results on standard benchmarks, generalization to variations in the task are still unsatisfactory.

The proposed architecture is suggested to show strong\ngeneralization capabilities due to the embedded combinatorial/discrete\nsearch. The authors study this architecture in the context of\nimitation learning from a small number of expert demonstrations. The\ncore approach builds on a previous work (Vlastelica et al. 2020) that\nprovides a framework for embedding combinatorial search within a\ndifferentiable model.\n\nOverall, I think this is a very solid work, and I recommend\nacceptance. The problem being studied is eminently important, and\nright now the field is in great need of policy optimization methods\nthat leverage the power of discrete search algorithms. The experiments\nare quite comprehensive, encompassing various gridworlds, and\ngenerally addressing the baselines I would have expected to see (most\nimportantly, Figure 6 which shows the performance vs. amount of data).\n\nThe biggest concern I have with the paper is that it is extremely\nunclear what exactly is meant by the assumption of a known topology of\nthe gcMDP. Does this topology basically represent the transition\nfunction (i.e., edges in the discrete state graph)? If so, then it\nseems unfair to compare to IL and RL baselines that are not given\naccess to this information. If not, then I really hope the authors can\nclearly convey (perhaps through a small example) what the topology is,\nand how much practical engineering effort is required to create it in\nyour domains.\n\nI am also curious how much stochasticity in the environment can be\nhandled by your method. This is in reference to the sentence \"Although\nthe actual gcMDP solved by the expert may be stochastic, we learn a\ndeterministic latent approximate gcMDP\".\n\nOne smaller question: when you say \"In gcMDPs the reward is such that\nthe maximal return can be achieved by reaching the goal state g\" --\nthis feels like a pretty weak condition to me, because it can be\nachieved by simply making the reward at g higher than the returns of\nany trajectory not reaching g. Is this condition necessary and\nsufficient for your approach to make sense?\n\nLooking ahead, I am curious if the authors have considered extending\nthe proposed system to continuous environments (e.g., if states are\nimages)? Perhaps a path forward here would be to learn an embedding to\na discrete latent space, and then apply NAP. I guess the challenge\nwould be that you would not be able to know the topology of that\nlatent a priori.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1992/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1992/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neuro-algorithmic Policies for Discrete Planning", "authorids": ["~Marin_Vlastelica_Pogan\u010di\u01071", "~Michal_Rolinek2", "~Georg_Martius1"], "authors": ["Marin Vlastelica Pogan\u010di\u0107", "Michal Rolinek", "Georg Martius"], "keywords": ["planning", "reinforcement learning", "combinatorial optimization", "control", "imitation learning"], "abstract": "Although model-based and model-free approaches to learning the control of systems have achieved impressive results on standard benchmarks, generalization to variations in the task are still unsatisfactory.

The paper proposes a neuro-algorithmic policy that can be trained end-to-end by differentiation and used together with a shortest path solver.\n\nStrengths:\n\ni) The motivation, organization and the overall writing of the paper are clear.\n\nWeakness:\n\ni) The manuscript is missing very relevant pieces of works that should have been discussed in detail and included as baselines in the experimental results section. Namely, the previous work (i.e., Latplan) [1,2] that performs (classical) planning from images in latent spaces using variational autoencoders in combination with off-the-shelf automated planners. Similarly, experimental comparison to work [3] is missing.\n\nii) How does the proposed approach (i.e., NAP) reason about the value of the planning horizon T which is an important aspect of automated planning? Note that Latplan would again provide useful insights here (since it leverages off-the-shelf automated planners).\n\niii) The benchmark domains seem too simple. For a more realistic image-based task, see Meta-World [4].\n\nAdditional comments:\n\nPage 1: In the third paragraph, can you please ground the claim for the statement \u201ctransition model is often harder than learning a policy\u201d? Moreover, instead of just saying \u201cthere exists several approaches\u2026\u201d, you should include previous works [5,6,7] as references that learn such transition models for planning.\n\nPage 2: Second item in the list on page 2: generalizing policies -> generalized policies\n\nReferences:\n[1] Classical Planning in Deep Latent Space: Bridging the Subsymbolic-Symbolic Boundary, Asai and Fukunaga AAAI-18.\n\n[2] Learning Neural-Symbolic Descriptive Planning Models via Cube-Space Priors: The Voyage Home (to STRIPS), Asai and Muise IJCAI-20.\n\n[3] Learning latent dynamics for planning from pixels, Hafner et al.
