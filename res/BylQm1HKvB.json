We address your concerns as follows.\n\n- There doesn't seem to be a proper baseline in any of the experiments conducted.\n\nIn current language emergence research, our sense is that there is no baseline as a common indicator because the model structure depends on the purpose. Therefore, we collected methods to find out the characteristics of the languages used in related research. We selected the ones that fitted the contents of this research.\nWhile, to confirm the effectiveness of the internal reflection function, a comparison was made based on the evaluation axis for the presence or absence of internal reflection. Like this, to evaluate the validity of the architecture, there is a study in language emergence research that evaluates architecture by controlling and disabling functions[1].\n\n- The writing generally is unclear, full of ungrammatical sentences and extremely hard to read.\n\nWe have incorporated your comments, so we have clarified you pointed out.\n\n     - \u00a73.2: \"A language system can emerge by a pure machine, excluding the human viewpoint.\"(p. 4, lines 4-5)\nThe proposed architecture enables language emergence by agent interaction without using human-prepared supervised signals and rewards.\n\n     - \u00a73.2: \"The structure, characteristics, and limitations of the messages generated by the machine can be determined.\"(p. 4, lines 6-7)\nWe can explore the structure and characteristics of messages organized by agent interaction.\n\n     - \u00a73.2: \"The agents as a whole have a movement to create a system in which languages is unsupervised and one conceptual pact is formed.\"(p. 4, lines 22-23)\nAn agent set takes an emergent behavior that forms a conceptual pact without supervised signals.\n\n     - \u00a73.3: \"Receive an image and generate a message based on self-knowledge.\"\nPlease see our 4th explanation.\n\n     - \u00a73.4: \"This formal rule was from the human perspective\".(p. 5, lines 41)\nThe analyzed formal rules such as pattern and key symbol were evaluated from a human criterion.\n\n- The evaluation section is very rambling and contains unnecessary parts that need not be included.\nWe appreciate the reviewer's concerns on this point. However, we consider our original text correct. We surveyed the evaluation method in related researches and selected indicators that can analyze the qualitative changes in language emergence by internal reflection. We consider that the features of the message, grammatical analysis, and the accuracy of the image reconstructed by messages were basic indicators for confirming the emergent language features in related researches. Thus, we would like to retain the original text.\n\n - e.g.1: Analyze formal rules (\u00a74.4.1 and Table 3)\nWe obtained one trained instance from each learning object and analyzed formal rules of messages. By analyzing the structural differences in the formal rules for each instance, we are able to know the necessary symbol conditions and symbol patterns to generate a concept. This aspect is a necessary condition for any language to be considered compositional. On the other hand, We agree that different training will produce different messages. However, in other language emergence research, in addition to the quantitative characteristics of the message, they analyzed the language system in the instance to evaluate specific differences and compositional nature[2-4]. For this reason, we believe that to describe the generated language system would be more appropriate.\n\n\n - e.g.2: Convergence of mean squared error loss between GRU output and latent space z (\u00a74.1)\nOur sense is that just confirming the generated messages is not enough to know the relationship between concepts and messages. If messages have formal rules but are not grounded in the concept, the language is considered meaningless. Therefore, we need an evaluation index that confirms the correspondence between messages and concepts. MSE Loss is an index that evaluates the validity of the ground relationship between the generated message and the corresponding label.\n\n[1] Das, A., Kottur, S., Moura, J. M., Lee, S., & Batra, D.

Despite the nice idea, the dire quality of writing makes it extremely difficult if not impossible to understand the proposed model and the results. Also, some of the experimental results seem unnecessary. In Table 3., for example, (1) in \u00a74.4.1 the authors merely list the rules without giving an overall conclusion. (2) I'm not certain what's the significant of the results in Table 3., as these are messages from one trained instance, and I'm sure a different training run will yield different messages.\n\nAlthough I am strongly leaning towards reject, I am willing to discuss with my co-reviewers if they have a different opinion.\n\nCons\n- There doesn't seem to be a proper baseline in any of the experiments conducted.\n- The writing generally is unclear, full of ungrammatical sentences and extremely hard to read: e.g. see examples below. \n     - \u00a73.2: \"A language system can emerge by a pure machine, excluding the human viewpoint.\"\n     - \u00a73.2: \"The structure, characteristics, and limitations of the messages generated by the machine can be determined.\"\n     - \u00a73.2: \"The agents as a whole have a movement to create a system in which languages is unsupervised and one conceptual pact is formed.\"\n     - \u00a73.3: \"Receive an image and generate a message based on self-knowledge.\"\n     - \u00a73.4: \"This formal rule was from the human perspective\".\n\n- The evaluation section is very rambling and contains unnecessary parts that need not be included, e.g. convergence of mean squared error loss between GRU output and latent space z.\n\nQuestions\n- The internal reflection function part, the core of this paper, is not properly explained until the end. For example, in \u00a73.3, \"when the comparison result is lower than the threshold value\": what is the \"comparison result\"? How does one compare a message and another message? Please elaborate on this further.\n- In the evaluation section \u00a73.4, the authors keep referring to \"dream\": \"correct answer rate of Dream\", \"We entered the message into an agent to evaluate the reconstructed Dream\". But the authors don't provide a formal definition of \"dream\" except providing a citation to Ha and Schmidhuber, 2018. Are the readers expected to know what this means? \n- In \u00a73.4, \"Jaccard coefficient were applied to test the message similarity between labels\". How does one apply Jaccard index to compute similarity between labels? This seems an important part of evaluation but not explained at all.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1610/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1610/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CONTRIBUTION OF INTERNAL REFLECTION IN LANGUAGE EMERGENCE WITH AN UNDER-RESTRICTED SITUATION", "authors": ["Kense Todo", "Masayuki Yamamura"], "authorids": ["k_todo@ali.c.titech.ac.jp", "my@c.titech.ac.jp"], "keywords": ["Language emergence", "Conceptual grounding", "Reflection", "Cognitive bias"], "abstract": "Owing to language emergence, human beings have been able to understand the intentions of others, generate common concepts, and extend new concepts.
