The first step is training a biGAN style GAN with normal data, then define a score function that measures anomalous. The score function is a combination of reconstruction and a loss function for anomaly. Anomaly loss can be cross-entropy or feature map loss. The experiment is performed on MNIST and KDD99. \n\nFirst concern is, GAN is used to capture training data distribution. In both AnoGAN and this work, the anomaly detection part is only performed at the score function. Which means, the GAN part can be replaced by any encoder-decoder model. The authors may need further explanation or experiment to show why it is GAN but not other model.\n\nSecond concern is, the experiment is not convincing. According to experiment table, DAGMM performs really well, and this work is not significantly better than DAGMM. Moreover, there is no explanation of what is full name of DAGMM.\n\nOverall I think this work is below acceptance threshold and there is more space to improve. \n\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Efficient GAN-Based Anomaly Detection", "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are able to model the complex high-dimensional\ndistributions of real-world data, which suggests they could be effective\nfor anomaly detection.
