The authors further develop a variant for the unsupervised domain adaption (UDA) task. The authors argue that the existing adversarial classifier based UDA solutions do not guarantee that the domain specific information does not contain any information that overlaps with the shared information in the target domain. Another shortcoming of these baselines is the learned representation in their domain-invariant feature space might not allow for accurate labeling in the target domain. To solves these limitations, the authors directly minimize the information sharing between representation, instead of using domain adversarial classifier and adversarial label predictor.\n\nThis paper is well structured and easy to follow. The authors make several interesting and insightful statements. While the justifications of these main statements are not well presented theoretically/experimentally. \n\nIn page 3, the authors argue that the existing solutions achieve a domain-invariant feature space in which the representation might not allow for accurate labeling in the target domain. The following explanation reads vague to me. A qualitive example or an analytical experiment is encouraged to have to justify the mentioned \u201csome elements\u201d will hinder the performance.\n\nMy major concern is the evaluation results compared with the baselines is not competitive. As shown in Table 2, in the benchmark MNIST/USPS/SVHN datasets, the proposed method is inferior to the baselines like SEDA, DWT, SBADA-GAN. Since these datasets are relatively simple, I would encourage the authors to conduct experiments on other more challenging UDA benchmarks, like DomainNet [ref-1] and VisDA2017 [ref-2]\n[ref-1] X.

However, the proposed method cannot consider the domain-specific and domain-orthogonal information, which may degrade the performance in experiments and deserves to be discussed further. So how to learn the domain-invariant representation in the model? Please explain more details.\n\nDiCyR is not explicitly trained to produce domain-invariant representations as can be done in other mentioned works using a domain discriminator. DiCyR indirectly learns to produce domain-invariant representations thanks to the feature-level cyclic-consistency. Making sure that a generated cross-domain sample has the same task-related features as the original sample from the opposite domain allows the task-related latent space to be domain invariant. Our contribution can be interpreted as narrowing down this domain-independent information to the more precise task-specific information.

IJCAI, 2019.\n\nSimilarly to our work, the authors aim to learn a task-related and a task orthogonal representation. However, their setting uses target data only to train an adversarial domain discriminator (along with source data), while the adversarial classifier is trained on the source data exclusively. If such a setting does allow an efficient disentanglement for elements of the source domain, generalizing this property to elements from the target domain is not straightforwardly guaranteed.\n\n>[2] Cao J et al., Dida: Disentangled synthesis for domain adaptation. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.08019, 2018.\n\nWith a similar method to the one used in [1], the authors learn a disentangled representation that is used to generate cross-domain image translation. These augmented samples are then used to train the classifier in the target domain. Yet, the lack of cycle consistency in both the semantic and the feature level does not guarantee an efficient mapping between domains in the domain invariant latent space and could lead to generated samples associated with a wrong label.\n\n>[3] Li H et al., Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in the Wild via Disentangling Representation Learning. IJCV, 2020.\n\nThe authors use a shared encoder and a shared generator to produce image-to-image translations. It also benefits from cyclic consistency to force the category-related information to be domain invariant.\nWe argue that constraining a feature level cyclic-consistency on the task-related information is not sufficient to ensure that no information redundancy is present in one of the representations.\nThe GRL layers we use to connect our feature predictors, associated with feature-level cyclic-consistency on both task and style features, avoid information sharing between the representations.\n\n>[4] Yang J et al., Unsupervised domain adaptation via disentangled representations: Application to cross-modality liver segmentation. MICCAI, 2019.\n\nThe authors learn disentangled representation in both domains simultaneously using feature cyclic-consistency exclusively. A major problem remains the incentive to assign a constant encoding to one of the representations (the style information being represented through the generator) thus allowing eventually to maintain a cycle consistency at the feature level while failing at achieving separation between task-related and style information. Our work prevents this behavior from happening using a triplet loss with both positive and negative samples.\n\nWhile the intentions of our method are similar to those of the work mentioned above, we believe that our representations offer superior guarantees on the quality of the learned representations in both domains. We believe that it is this principled approach on the quality of the representations that differentiate our method from previous work and allows it to obtain better results than the other methods using cycle-consistency and disentanglement. Besides, our method is the only one to allow disentanglement in a single domain setting as illustrated by the experiments of section 5.1.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper896/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper896/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Disentangled cyclic reconstruction for domain adaptation", "authorids": ["~David_Bertoin1", "~Emmanuel_Rachelson1"], "authors": ["David Bertoin", "Emmanuel Rachelson"], "keywords": ["Domain adaptation", "Disentanglement"], "abstract": "The domain adaptation problem involves learning a unique classification or regression model capable of performing on both a source and a target domain.

The core idea of DiCyR is to split the raw feature into the task-related one and its complimentary context where the task-related representations are projected into a shared space for alignment. From my point of view, disentangled representations learning is the most interesting part of this work.\n\n\n-Pros:\n1. This paper is well organized with clear logic to follow. The authors have introduced the problem statement and related works very well.\n2. The motivation of disentangled representations learning for domain adaptation is very straightforward and clear. \n3. The authors provide the demo code of this work to prove its reproductivity.\n4. There are some visual results that could attract readers a lot.\n\n-Cons:\n1. Novelty: \nTaking the cross-domain image translation is a smart way of data augmentation, which has been well studied. Since 2017, CyCADA has introduced the CycleGAN framework for domain adaptation and has received a significant impact since then. This work extends the image translation idea by applying the disentangled image generation based on cyclic consistency. Moreover, there are a lot of previous papers working on similar topics [1, 2, 3, 4]. In this way, I think the novelty of this paper is minor.\n\n2. Experiment:\nIn the domain adaptation task, the authors only evaluate its model on the toy datasets (Digital Datasets), which cannot fully prove this model's effectiveness. I am curious why not using the latest office-home, domainnet, or the Cityscapes-to-GTA5 as the main experiment. On MNIST to SVHN, the DiCyR performs rather weakly. Moreover, there are more recent works, such as [5] should be compared.\n\n3. Time and Computational Cost\nCycleGAN-based image translation usually takes a lot of training time. The author mainly used the small size images (32 \\times 32) for evaluation, and it requires a P100 GPU for training. What the time and computational cost will be if using large images such as 224 \\times 224? \n\nIf the authors could address all the concerns above, I will consider upgrading the score.\n\n\n[1] Cai R, Li Z, Wei P, et al.

I like the idea of utilizing disentanglement learning with a cycle constraint into the unsupervised domain adaptation issue. My major concern is about some unclear parts described in the paper and insufficient experimental comparison (see cons below). Hopefully, it would be grateful that the authors could address my concerns during the rebuttal period.\n\n#####################\n\nPros:\n\n(1) The idea in the paper to introduce disentanglement learning based on cyclic reconstruction to unsupervised domain adaptation is very novel and interesting, which can split the captured information from data into task-related representation and context-based features to help improve the domain generality of the model.\n\n(2) The disentanglement learning to split the information into a task-related representation and a context representation is reasonable and promising, which is beneficial to the task model adapted in different domains.\n\n(3) Extensive experimental results on several widely-adopted benchmarks show the effectiveness of the proposed model comparing with other state-of-the-art methods.\n\n#####################\n\nCons:\n\n(1) In the paper, the introduced disentanglement learning method can split information captured from images into a task-specific feature and another task-orthogonal representation. However, the proposed method cannot consider the domain-specific and domain-orthogonal information, which may degrade the performance in experiments and deserves to be discussed further. So how to learn the domain-invariant representation in the model? Please explain more details.\n\n(2) In the part of the experiment in the paper, the authors conduct the experiments on the task of image style transfer. However, the task of semantic segmentation on Cityscapes is always widely adopted in related UDA papers, which is not included in the paper. Please consider adding such experimental results and analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the paper if feasible.\n\n(3) In the paper, the author claims the proposed model can achieve high computational efficiency, but there are no figures or tables to demonstrate it. Please consider listing the comparison results of training time and test time in the experimental part.\n\n#####################\n\nQuestions during the rebuttal period: \n\nPlease address and clarify the cons above.
