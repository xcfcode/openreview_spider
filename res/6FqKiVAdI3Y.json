To calculate policy gradients, we need to estimate $Q_{tot}^{\\mathbf\\pi}$ in stead of $Q_{tot}^{*}$. Estimating $Q_{tot}^{\\mathbf\\pi}$ from off-policy data using a regular critic faces major challenges: (i) if we use importance sampling, the variance grows with the number of agents; (ii) if we use tree backup, we need to calculate an expectation ($E_{\\mathbf{a} \\sim \\mathbf{\\pi}}[Q_{tot}^{\\mathbf{\\pi}}(\\mathbf{\\tau}, \\mathbf{a})]$) over the joint action space. In our experiments (Sec. 5.2.1, ablation study `DOP with common tree backup`), we show that estimating this expectation by sampling hurts performance. In contrast, the expectation can be calculated in linear time with accuracy when using a DOP critic (please refer to the comparison between DOP and *DOP with common tree backup* in Fig. 3 on page 7). (2) The policy gradients calculated using a regular critic suffer from large variance due to the influence of other agents' actions. (We will discuss this point in detail after we list all three shortcomings and in Q2.) (3) In continuous action spaces, it is largely unclear how to achieve credit assignment when using a regular critic. (We discuss how DOP achieves credit assignment in Q5.)\n\nNow we explain why a regular critic results in large variance in policy gradients by addressing the concerns of the reviewer.\n- \"As such a critic is supposed to be \"true\" to the policy, the requirement of decentralization has little bearing on the variance of policy gradients.\"\n*Answer*: Although policy gradient induced by a regular critic is true in expectation, it suffers from large variance. Different from the single-agent case, we discuss the variance caused by the other agents' actions in our paper. Specifically, in existing multi-agent policy gradients (MAPG) methods, decentralized policies are conditioned on local actions, but policy gradients depend on regular critics, and thus are conditioned on all agents' actions, which can cause large variance (Eq. 4). In contrast, by decomposing the critic, DOP gradients are free from the influence of other agents' actions and thus can reduce variance.\n\nIn Fig. 2, we empirically show the variance of gradients of different methods. We can see that a regular critic (COMA and MADDPG) induces much larger variance than DOP. (The reviewer thinks the CDM issue can be solved by baselines. However, after using baselines, the advantage still depends on other agents' actions. We provide more experiments and discussions about baselines in Q2.)\n\n- \"Gradient noise increases with number of agents irrespective of whether there is centralized or decentralized execution. \"\n\n*Answer*: In our paper, we discuss the decomposition of critics, which is not related to or influenced by whether there is decentralized or centralized execution. Both DOP and previous MAPG methods learn decentralized policies and execute in a decentralized manner. As for gradient noise, we empirically show that DOP can reduce gradient variance (Fig. 2-left).\n\n**Q2**: \"CDM seems rather redundant. Such problem can easily be fixed using baselines.\"\n\n**A2**: CDM is caused by other agents' actions, and using baselines cannot get rid of the influence of these actions (because the advantage still depends on other agents' actions). For example, COMA already uses a baseline, but still suffers from much larger variance than DOP (Fig. 2). Furthermore, we show performance of COMA in Fig. 3. On the maps like `so_many_banelings`, COMA degenerates after learning a nearly optimal policy. This observation is in line with CDM -- the sub-optimality of individual policies can exacerbate each other through the variance induced by a regular critic.\n\nIn the reviewer's defense, a COMA baseline only marginalizes the action of one agent. Therefore, as suggested by the citation ([Sutton and Barto, 2018]), we study another baseline where actions of all agents are marginalized. We add a new appendix (Appendix G) to analyze the effect of such a baseline. In multi-agent settings, calculating this baseline requires computing an expectation over the joint action space, which is generally intractable (3570$G$ summations on the map `MMM2`). We thus estimate the expectation by sampling, and call this method `Regular Critics with Baseline`. In Fig. 8 on page 23, we compare *Regular Critics with Baseline* with DOP, and we can see that DOP performs significantly better. To eliminate the influence of off-policy learning, we further omit the off-policy learning component of DOP and find that *Regular Critics with Baseline* underperforms *On-Policy DOP* on all tasks. (Another interesting observation is that *Regular Critics with Baseline* outperforms COMA.) These observations indicate that decomposing the critic is an efficient way to avoid CDM."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1158/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1158/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1158/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1158/Authors"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1158/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DOP: Off-Policy Multi-Agent Decomposed Policy Gradients", "authorids": ["~Yihan_Wang1", "~Beining_Han1", "~Tonghan_Wang1", "~Heng_Dong1", "~Chongjie_Zhang1"], "authors": ["Yihan Wang", "Beining Han", "Tonghan Wang", "Heng Dong", "Chongjie Zhang"], "keywords": ["Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", "Multi-Agent Policy Gradients"], "abstract": "Multi-agent policy gradient (MAPG) methods recently witness vigorous progress.

Whether coordination is required in the experiment domains in the first place and if the performance improvement is just coming due to a biased but albeit easier to learn critic.\"\n\n**A3**: Although the critic is linearly decomposed, it is trained by using the global reward, which induces coordinated behaviors among agents. Moreover, in Proposition 2 of the updated version of the paper, we show that a linearly factored critic can guarantee policy improvement with respect to the expected global return. (The condition is relatively mild: we require the function class expressed by local Q-functions ($Q_i^{\\phi_i}$) is sufficiently large, e.g., neural networks, and the critic loss is minimized. Detailed proof can be found in Appendix C.2.)\n\nTherefore, for a large range of tasks, a linearly factored critic is sufficient to model inter-agent interactions. For example, the SC2 tasks we test in the original paper requires coordination, which is confirmed by the fact that IQL (independent Q-learning) cannot learn well in these tasks as shown in Fig. 6 on page 22, and DOP can significantly outperform IQL.\n\nHowever, like other fully decentralized execution methods (VDN, QMIX, and COMA), DOP may not be sufficient to model interactions among agents in highly uncertain or partial observable environments. In Appendix F of the updated paper, we show such an example. We also find that this problem can be solved by introducing a communication module into DOP.

By this sentence, we mean that after agent $i$ is effected negatively by the variance of the gradients, the suboptimality in its policy can similarly propagate to other agents again though the joint critic. In this way, the sub-optimality of individual policies will exacerbate each other, which is problematic.

The difference between this ablation and DOP is that the expectation required by tree backup (Eq. 3) is estimated by 200 samples. We see that this ablation performs worse than *On-Policy DOP* which does not use off-policy data. This observation indicates that sampling does not estimate the off-policy learning target accurately. In contrast, DOP can quickly and stably converge using a similar number of operations (200 summations).\n\n- (2) `Regular critics with baseline`, as discussed in detail in Q2.\n\nBased on these results, we conclude that sampling is not efficient in calculating the expectation with few samples. We hypothesize that this is because the landscape of Q functions can be sophisticated in complex multi-agent tasks.\n\n\n**Q7**: \"The authors need to shed more light on when the precondition $Q_i(\\tau, a_i) > Q_i(\\tau, a_i') \\iff \\beta_{a_i, \\tau}\\geq \\beta_{a_i', \\tau}$ in Prop. 1 holds beyond tabular settings.\"\n\n**A7**: We provide a new proposition (Proposition 2 on page 6 in the updated paper) to address your concern. We prove that policy improvement guarantee is still held without this precondition, as along as the function class represented by local Q-functions ($Q_i^{\\phi_i}$) is sufficiently large (e.g. neural networks) and the critic loss is minimized. We provide a detailed statement of this proposition on page 6, and its proof can be found in Appendix C.2 (page 19-20) of the revised paper.\n\n**Q8**: \"Why isn't comparison on SC2 done against more recent baselines like QTRAN, MAVEN, ROMA etc.?\"\n\n**A8**: In the updated version, we compare DOP against QTRAN, MAVEN, and ROMA. Results are shown in  Fig. 3. In addition to these baselines, we also show the comparison against two other recent papers: NDQ and QPLEX in the same figure. DOP outperforms all these algorithms with significantly reduced variance across different seeds and tasks.

The work discusses shortcomings of actor-critic methods for MARL and proposes a solution using linearly factored critic. The paper is somewhat difficult to read and can be made better by deferring the details about previous methods to appendix. However my main concern is with the problem of centralized-decentralized mismatch (CDM) motivated in the paper and its proposed solution itself. \n\n1. How exactly is a regular critic bad? As such a critic is supposed to be \"true\" to the policy, the requirement of decentralization has little bearing on the variance of policy gradients. Gradient noise increases with number of agents irrespective of whether there is centralized or decentralized execution. \n\n2. The so called problem of CDM seems rather redundant (see 1 above), for example the authors say in page 3, 3rd para from bottom in line 3 that if the critic expectation under policy is negative, then individual policy performance is hurt. Such problem can easily be fixed using baselines, see Sutton and Barto, 2018 for example.\n\n3. How is a linear factored critic compatible with an arbitrary joint policy? In general this not true and requires many strong assumptions, see for ex. Bhatnagar, 2009. While the authors acknowledge this, bypassing the actual complexity for modelling a joint critic with a linear one will in general render it insufficient to model inter-agent interactions. This puts into serious question, whether coordination is required in the experiment domains in the first place and if the performance improvement is just coming due to a biased but albeit easier to learn critic. \n\n4. There are some unsupported claims which need better explanation like \"This becomes problematic because a negative feedback loop is created, in which the joint critic is affected by the suboptimality of agent i, which disturbs policy updates of other agents\" How is that so? The updates in principle can affect the policies of already suboptimal agents, which might fix them?\n\n5. \"Learning the decomposed critic implicitly realizes multi-agent credit assignment, because the individual critic provides credit\ninformation for each agent to improve its policy in the direction of increasing the global expected return\" again how so? claims like this need to be well supported.\n\n6. Expectations are usually sampled so in principle even the $O(|A|^n)$ can be estimated with fewer samples incurring some variance, it might not be necessary to bias the critic drastically for this.\n\n7. The authors need to shed more light on when the precondition $Q_i(\\tau, a_i) > Q_i(\\tau, a_i') \\iff \\beta_{a_i, \\tau}\\geq \\beta_{a_i', \\tau}$ in Prop. 1 holds beyond tabular settings. It seems a rather strong assumption to hold for all trajectory and \n$O(|A|^n)$ inputs. Right now it seems rather grab bag to show policy improvement.\n\n8.

It demonstrated 2 existing problems in the baseline MAPG agents (COMA, MADDPG), namely \"centralized-decentralized mismatch\" problem and credit assignment issues, and offers a theoretically motivated solution with carefully conducted experiment results including ablation studies as well as comparison with sota gradient-based and value-based algorithms.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nReasons for score: \n \nThe paper is very well written. Its proposal is simple but theoretically motivated to solve existing problems in MAPG algorithms. The experiment results support its claims and provides additional insightful analysis. Therefore I recommend \"accept\". However, its theoretical justification is weakened by assuming a tabular case of pi and Q functions which is rarely the case in practice. Furthermore, in Proposition 1, the conditioning just above Eq. 11 looks quite particular and I'm not sure how general it is satisfied in practice. Last but not least, it would be nice to see comparisons with more recent value decomposition algorithms such as NDQ and QTRAN/QPLEX. Overall I gave it a score 7.\n \n##########################################################################\n\nPros: \n\n1. The paper is organized in very clear fashion. It is well motivated by existing problems and provides a simple and effective solution. \n2. It conducted clever experimental analysis that made the advantages of DOP very obvious and understandable.\n3. Its method of linear decomposition of the central critic into individual critics is simple yet powerful. The paper gave adequate theoretical support to this method. \n \n##########################################################################\n\nCons: \n\n1. Both the tabular assumption on functions pi and Q, and especially the conditioning of Proposition 1 weaken the theoretical guarantee that the algorithm will converge to local optima.\n2. The paper did not compare with more recent value decomposition algorithms such as NDQ and QTRAN/QPLEX.
