Based on the results, new classes that have never been seen by the model can converge much faster, due to the nice property of KNN. The proposed method does not hurt the final performance when the training examples for new classes become more.\n\nThe downsides of the method is its computational cost. The manuscript seems not mentioning how to do inference. But I guess it needs to base its inference on some existing training examples due to the nonparametric part, which would increase the computational cost. Also, this method is doable for small number of unique classes. If the number of classes is much more than the batch size, then it is very likely that during training an example might not see any other examples that belong to the same class. It would be great if the manuscript could also show results for this scenario.\n\nQuestions:\n- During inference, how to pick existing training examples for inference since a nonparametric method requires multiple training examples for inference?\n- For nonparametric part, the output of an example is the weighted sum of the label of other examples.

The proposed approach is technically sound, but a bit trivial and not particularly novel as the idea of combining parameter and non-parametric methods is not quite new in literature. Also the experimental results are not convincing without comparison to any state of the art related works. The proposed semi-parameter approach is not always better, and the improvement is quite marginal.  The authors should provide more detailed descriptions about different experiment settings, the evaluation measure and more analysis of the inconsistence and negative results in experiments. \n\n (in Figure 2, such as why parametric model had no gain in the first 10 epochs.
