The authors show that this can lead to a much smaller network with good accuracy (compared to the original network); thus this may be a good technique for sparsification.\n\n**Theory**\n\nPlease clarify what induced L2 penalty means. The use of primes to indicate differentiation was ambiguous. Please be explicit about what you are differentiating with respect to in the notation.\n\nCan you motivate why we should focus on the second order term during training?\n\nAlso if at all possible would be good to show the relevant quantities during training to see if the intuition is correct.\n\n**Experimental Evidence**\n\nError bars from multiple runs to get a sense of variation relative to the difference being measured in Table 1 seems critical. \n\nIn addition, showing data from the sparsity literature on what other methods are able to accomplish (particularly weight magnitude pruning) would be very useful. For example, [Blalock and Gonzalez: What is the State of Neural Network Pruning?] seems to have data for ResNet-50, but it may not exactly apply, so the ideal thing would be to provide data by doing the baseline comparison yourself. (That paper also has a checklist of things to be careful of when doing pruning research.)\n\nAlso, a claim in the introduction is that training is faster this way since pruning and finetuning don\u2019t need to be iterated. Would be good to back this up with actual numbers.    \n\n**Writeup**\n\nThe write-up could do with some more attention e.g. use \\citep instead of \\citet in most places. The mask M should be a tensor not a matrix. Also in your context, \u201cspeed\u201d could refer to training time or inference latency. Would be nice to use these more canonical terms instead of just speed.\n\n**Future Work**\n\nOne question that occurred to me while reading your paper (particularly the theory section) is what happens if you do the joint training as you describe, but instead of the adjoint loss, you use some sort of regular weight loss and different amounts of regularization penalties for the common weights and the weights unique to the large model. Would that give similar results?\n\nFor practical use of course, ResNet50 may not be the best target for sparsification since EfficientNets and MobileNets are already so much smaller. Please see the [Blalock and Gonzalez] paper (Sec 3.3) for perspective on this. \n\n**Post Rebuttal**\n\nThanks for the response. I still didn't get an answer for why the second order term and not the first order term is of interest in the Taylor expansion. Also the paper does not seem to be updated with the promised changes, particularly error bars. So I am leaving my score as is.

We added a section in the current draft which compares our method against other state of the art methods. The following table gives the details of the comparison. The results show that our method significantly outperforms all the other methods. While all other methods achieve a compression of about 2x or 3x our method achieves a compression of about 14x. One some other datasets like CIFAR-100, we even achieve compression of 99x which is order of magnitude better than other methods referenced.  \n\nMethod, Top-1 accuracy difference, Inference speed-up, Parameter reduction, Reference\n\nABCPruner, 2.15, 2.18X, 2.17X, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08565.pdf\n\nGBN, 0.67, 2.22X, 2.14X, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08174.pdf\n\nDCP, 1.06, 2.25X, 2.06X, https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2018/file/55a7cf9c71f1c9c495413f934dd1a158-Paper.pdf\n\nHRank, 4.17, 2.63X, 1.86X, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10179.pdf\n\nHRank, 7.05, 4.17X, 3.08X, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10179.pdf\n\nAdjoint Network, 1.57, 3.1X, 13.7X, Current work\n\nThe table above shows the difference in the top-1 accuracy between the standard network vs the network trained and pruned/compressed using the method referenced on the Imagenet dataset using the ResNet-50 architecture.

The reviewer is correct that philosophically [r5] also uses the same idea of jointly training the bigger and the smaller network together. However, the search is over architectures with a particular format; V1, V2, V4 and IT resembling the organization of the human visual cortex.  In contrast our method is plug-and-play. The design of the adjoint paradigm makes it easy to \"swap out\" any standard convolution layer and replace it with the adjoint convolution layer. There are also differences in the loss function.  Our loss function is also \"time-dependent\" and tunable $L = -y \\log p + \\lambda(t) KL(p, q)$. By choosing the $\\lambda$ function, we can choose to which rate we want the smaller network to learn from the larger network.\n\n\n$\\textbf{Imagenet}$\n\nWe trained the resnet-50 architecture on imagenet using the standard code available on pytorch github repo. https://github.com/pytorch/examples/ blob/master/imagenet/main.py  . We agree that different papers report different accuracies (in the range 73-75%) for the resnet50 on imagenet. For multi-gpu training accuracy in the same range (~73.5%) has also been reported by the official nvidia blog. https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/mixed-precision-training-deep-neural-networks/. \n\nThe project has been executed by two students who were severely budget constrained. We had to spend money out of our own pockets to do multi-GPU training on Imagenet. Hence, we had to be extremely selective on the choice and number of experiments we could do on the Imagenet dataset. We apologize that we could not execute the same experiment for resnet-18 as well.\n\n\n$\\textbf{Formatting and other issues}$\n\nWe have addressed the typos as pointed out by the reviewer. \n\nWe agree with the reviewer that Imagewoof shares several similarities with Imagenet. But we have compared our method on various other datasets like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, MNIST as well as Pets dataset. The choice of datasets is fairly typical of other papers. We have identified the following areas as avenues for future work. Comparison with other CNN models used in object detection, pose estimation and other vision models. In a preliminary work, we have seen 3.5x parameter reduction in a pose estimation model. However, we feel that including these comparisons is beyond the scope of this paper and will be covered in the follow-up paper that we are working on.  \n\nThe reviewer correctly points out the dropouts are not used with resnet architectures. We agree that the comparison is not entirely fair. In dropouts also the output is computed only a fraction of the weights (chosen at random). In adjoint paradigm as well the output of the smaller network is computed using only a fraction of weights. Hence, there is some conceptual similarity between the two training regimes and we included a section comparing the two.\n\nThe generalization ability of adjoint network can be seen from Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 3. This shows that the network trained in the adjoint fashion has better regularization and better validation accuracy than the same network trained in the standard fashion. \n\n "}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1360/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1360/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Better Together: Resnet-50 accuracy with $13 \\times $ fewer parameters and at $3 \\times $ speed", "authorids": ["un270@nyu.edu", "~Shrinu_Kushagra1"], "authors": ["Utkarsh Nath", "Shrinu Kushagra"], "keywords": ["Deep neural networks", "Theory of deep networks", "deep regularization", "Neural network compression"], "abstract": "Recent research on compressing deep neural networks has focused on reducing the number of parameters.

However, this is not the only difference. Another very important distinction is that in the current approach both the teacher and the student are trained together. While in the teacher-student setting the teacher is fixed and only the student learns. In the adjoint paradigm, the teacher also learns from the student. The advantage of this joint training is two fold. Table 1 shows that trained in this way, the smaller network performs better if it was trained in the TS fashion. Another very important advantage (as we see in Table 2) is that the bigger network also gains in performance when trained in the adjoint fashion. Hence, this way of training regularizes the bigger network as well, as is evident from Table 2 and Fig 3.\n\nAnother point, which has also been raised by other reviewers, is comparison against other works.

The main concern of the reviewer seems to be how our proposed method compares to teacher-student network. Below, we address those concerns.\n\n```The reviewer correctly points out that in the experiments presented, both the bigger and the smaller network are trained together from scratch. If we look at the loss function used for training. \n\n$L = - y \\log p + \\lambda(t) KL(p, q) $  \n\nwhere $\\lambda(t) = \\min \\{4t^2, 1\\}$ where $t = 0$ at the start of the first epoch and $t = 1$ at the start of the last epoch during training. Hence, at the beginning only the larger network is trained and the training of the smaller network only kicks in after $t \\ge 0.5$. Hence, using a pre-trained network corresponds to initializing the network differently and using a different regularization function $\\lambda(t)$. We have added this experiment in the current draft and we see similar gains and the same trends as in Table 1. This suggests (as the reviewer rightly suspected) that the approach is equally applicable for pre-trained networks too. \n\nThe second concern that the reviewer had was regarding the comparison against the smaller network trained in a teacher-student fashion. From Table 1, we see that the smaller network trained in the adjoint fashion consistently performs 1-2% better in terms of absolute accuracy as compared against the teacher-student mode of training. This gain is consistent across different datasets and two different architectures. We have also carried experiments across different sizes. We had not included this result in the current version due to space constraints. Below, is snapshot of the results comparing teacher-student with adjoint training on different compression sizes. The detailed results are included in the updated appendix. \n\nNetwork, Dataset, Mask Matrix (M), Adjoint small, Teacher student\n\nResnet 50,  Cifar-100, a4, 64.73, 63.57\n                                       \nResnet 50,  Cifar-100, a8, 65.37, 63.57\n\nResnet 50,  Cifar-100, a16, 65.11, 63.62\n\nResnet 50,  Cifar-10, a4, 90.25, 88.93\n                                       \nResnet 50,  Cifar-10, a8, 89.77, 89.54\n\nResnet 50,  Cifar-10, a16, 89.88, 89.08\n\nThe main conclusion is that the network trained in an adjoint fashion performs better as compared against the same network trained in the teacher-student way even for different compression sizes.\n\nRegarding the parameters shared, if we look at Fig 2; at the beginning of training a small fraction ($\\alpha$ fraction) of the convolution filters are selected and shared. This is represented by the mask matrix  $a_4$ (for example denoting that only 1/4th of the filters are selected and shared). In addition, a random subset is not used represented by the matrix $r_{0.8}$ (for example denoting that 80% of the weights are dropped)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1360/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1360/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Better Together: Resnet-50 accuracy with $13 \\times $ fewer parameters and at $3 \\times $ speed", "authorids": ["un270@nyu.edu", "~Shrinu_Kushagra1"], "authors": ["Utkarsh Nath", "Shrinu Kushagra"], "keywords": ["Deep neural networks", "Theory of deep networks", "deep regularization", "Neural network compression"], "abstract": "Recent research on compressing deep neural networks has focused on reducing the number of parameters.

The adjoint loss function $L = -y \\log p + \\lambda KL(p, q)$. The regularization behaviour is induced by the KL divergence term.  For any loss function, the L2 regularized loss function is $L = - y \\log p + \\lambda \\|w\\|^2$. Hence, by looking at the second order term in the taylor expansion of $f = KL(p, q)$, we can get the induced regularization behaviour. \n\nThe use primes denotes differentiation. In our context, it refers to the partial derivative of the function (for example $\\log p_i$) w.r.t to the given parameter $x$ or the parameter $y$. We thank the reviewer for pointing out this ambiguity. We have added a note in the paper addressing this issue.\n\n\n$\\textbf{Experiments}$\n\nWe did experiments over 3 runs and averaged the numbers. However, due to space constraints we did not add the error bars in the paper. Another reason why we did not add those error bars was that the results were fairly stable across multiple runs. We will add those bars the supplementary section.\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that reporting numbers from other methods would be useful. While we do compare our method against other methods in the introduction and other sections, we did not add numbers in the experimental section. We concede that this was missing in the current version.

The experiments are conducted on several image benchmarks using ResNet-18 and ResNet-50.\n\nStrengths:\n+: The experimental results show the proposed method can significantly reduce model complexity with slight performance loss. \n+: The proposed method seems simple and easy to implement.  \n\n\nWeaknesses:\n-: Lacking more clarification on significances of this work.\n(1) No state-of-the-art model compression method is compared for verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method. For filter pruning, many recently proposed methods [r1, r2, r3, r4] are presented to compress different sizes of CNN models (e.g., VGG, ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152) on various image benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet).

Particularly, one-shot NAS based on knowledge distillation has been studied [r5], which supernets and subnets are jointly trained. Meanwhile, [r5] also shows the searched small student models can achieve comparable or better performance than big teacher models. Therefore, what are advantages of the proposed method over [r5]?\n[r5] Neural Architecture Search by Block-wisely Distilling Architecture Knowledge.

Besides, why the authors did not report the results of ResNet-18 on ImageNet?\n\n(4) For fully verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method, the authors would better report the results using more CNN models, rather than those on various benchmarks.

Moreover, the weights of the student are a subset of those of the teacher. \n\nThe method is similar to classical knowledge distillation approach (student-teacher paradigm by Hinton et al 2015). The key difference seems to be in weight sharing across the two networks. This idea is partly novel, but should refer to the 2018 paper \"Rocket Launching: A Universal and Ef\ufb01cient Framework for Training Well-Performing Light Net\" by Zhou et al, who also consider weight sharing but use a different (but similar) loss function.\n\nThe results should be clarified.

This is so the trained small network will be able to simulate the larger one with a fraction of the parameters, which makes for less memory and faster inference at deploy time.\n\nThe paper additionally shows that the concurrent training also acts as a regularizer for the larger network, and empirically demonstrates to be more effective than dropout.\n\nIn general, I like the general idea and how this adjoined training encourages the large network to be more careful at optimizing a specific subset of its weights. The improvement on the accuracy of the large network when trained adjoined is also a nice byproduct.\n\nHowever, I have the following concerns:\n- From a practical standpoint, this approach requires to train the large network alongside the small one. So, at least as described, this approach cannot be used with existing pre-trained networks which is the more typical scenario. It'd be interesting to see if a similar approach could be applied to obtain a small network by fine-tuning a pre-trained architecture.\n- The results are marginally better than teacher-student, but the only architecture size being presented is the one for which the performance is comparable to that of the full network. I believe it's important to understand how the small adjoined network compares to the teacher-student network as a function of changing the desired size.\n\nMinor: it would help the reader to add a paragraph describing intuitively which pieces of the larger CNN are shared by the smaller one.  From what I understand, in each layer, a small subset of the output channels is selected and additionally a random subset of such weights is not used?\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1360/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1360/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Better Together: Resnet-50 accuracy with $13 \\times $ fewer parameters and at $3 \\times $ speed", "authorids": ["un270@nyu.edu", "~Shrinu_Kushagra1"], "authors": ["Utkarsh Nath", "Shrinu Kushagra"], "keywords": ["Deep neural networks", "Theory of deep networks", "deep regularization", "Neural network compression"], "abstract": "Recent research on compressing deep neural networks has focused on reducing the number of parameters. Smaller networks are easier to export and deploy on edge-devices. We introduce Adjoined networks as a training approach that can regularize and compress any CNN-based neural architecture. Our one-shot learning paradigm trains both the original and the smaller networks together. The parameters of the smaller network are shared across both the architectures. We prove strong theoretical guarantees on the regularization behavior of the adjoint training paradigm. We complement our theoretical analysis by an extensive empirical evaluation of both the compression and regularization behavior of adjoint networks. For resnet-50 trained adjointly on Imagenet, we are able to achieve a $13.7 \\times$ reduction in the number of parameters and a $3 \\times$ improvement in inference time without any significant drop in accuracy. For the same architecture on CIFAR-100, we are able to achieve a $99.7 \\times$ reduction in the number of parameters and a $5 \\times$ improvement in inference time. On both these datasets, the original network trained in the adjoint fashion gains about $3\\%$ in top-1 accuracy as compared to the same network trained in the standard fashion.
