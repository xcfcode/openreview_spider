The main step is bounding the eigenvalues of the full Fisher matrix in terms of the eigenvalues and singular values of individual blocks using Gersgorin disks. The analysis seems correct and (to the best of my knowledge) novel, and relationships between the Jacobian and FIM are interesting insofar as they give different ways of looking at linearized approximations. The Gersgorin disk analysis seems like it may give loose bounds, but the analysis still matches up well with the experiments.\n\nThe paper is not quite as strong when it comes to relating the anslysis to optimization. The maximum eigenvalue of the FIM by itself doesn't tell us much about the difficulty of optimization. E.g., if the top FIM eigenvalue is increased, but the distance the weights need to travel is proportionately decreased (as seems plausible when the Jacobian scale is changed), then one could make just as fast progress with a smaller learning rate. So in this light, it's not too surprising that the analysis fails to capture the optimization dynamics once the learning rates are tuned. But despite this limitation, the contribution still seems worthwhile.\n\nThe writing can still be improved.\n\nThe claim about stability of the linearization explaining the training dynamics appears fairly speculative, and not closely related to the analysis and experiments. I recommend removing it, or at least removing it from the abstract.\n", "title": "Paper Decision"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["piotr.sokol@stonybrook.edu", "memming.park@stonybrook.edu"], "title": "Information Geometry of Orthogonal Initializations and Training", "authors": ["Piotr Aleksander Sok\u00f3\u0142", "Il Memming Park"], "pdf": "/pdf/518fe69dd850c85be75561849db48ae9cbadf710.pdf", "TL;DR": "nearly isometric DNN initializations imply low parameter space curvature, and a lower condition number, but that's not always great", "abstract": "    Recently mean field theory has been successfully used to analyze properties\n    of wide, random neural networks.

We are however unfamiliar with any ways of directly lower-bounding that quantity. Under somewhat specific conditions Karakida et al [1] that as $\\lambda_{\\max}(G) \\to \\infty$ then $\\lambda_{\\min} \\to 0$. This result hinges on the assumptions that weight matrices are distributed as $ W_{i,j} \\sim \\mathcal{N} (0, \\sigma^2_{l}/ M_{l-1})$ where M_{l-1} is the number of neurons in layer $l-1$ then the mean eigevalue is  $|G|_{Fro}$ and the mean eigenvalue is $ \\frac{1}{P} |G|_{Fro}$ where is the total number of parameters. Importantly for Gaussian weights the maximum eigenvalue grows as $\\mathcal{O}(M)$ but the mean eigenvalue is proportional to $\\mathcal{O}(1/M)$ and a fortiori the minimal eigenvalue must decrease at least as fast.\nWe agree that an upfront discussion of this special case would give the reader a better understanding of the context and potential implications. In a similar vein, we believe that adding a disclaimer that estimating the condition number is generally numerically unstable.\n\nWe whole-heartedly agree that the some of the conditions necessary for the NTK may not hold in our experiments, and therefore ammended the manuscript appropriately. The authors in [2,3] consider widths of up to 10,000, compared to ours 400 neuron networks. However, [4] consider networks of similar width to ours.\nMoreover, it has been pointed out that gradient flow, like any differential equation admits a convergent forward Euler discretization, provided the norm of the eigenvalues of the one-step update obey $ |1 - lambda| \\le 1 $. We did not check that these conditions are met; we automatically chose learning rates that produced the highest validation accuracy after 50 epochs. We show the learning rates at the bottom of this response, and will release the entire entire set of hyperparameters as JSON files in the github repo.

We thank the reviewer for pointing out the typos. Upon reflection, we believe that the theorem would be best presented shortly in the main body, with a longer, more rigorous and easier to follow derivation in the appendix. This will both improve 'flow' of the paper and allow for a more rigorous exposition of our results.\n\n2. The major technical difference between our submission and Karakida's work [1] is that we do not make any assumptions on the distribution from which the weight matrices are sampled. \n\nMoreover, the intent behind our bound was different from that of Karakida et al. We set out to relate the conditioning of the input-output Jacobian to the Fisher information matrix curvature, while the authors of [1] strove to find an analytical expression for the maximum and mean eigenvalues of the Fisher information matrix under Gaussian weight assumptions. Our results allows us to recover Karakida's Frobenius norm bound (Eq. 16 in [1]) by using traces of random Gaussian matrices to bound the maximal singular of each layer.\n\nApart from this, we believe that the use of the block Gershgorin theorem might facilitate the analysis of optimization techniques such as K-FAC[2], where a block tri-diagonal approximation of the FIM is used.\n\n3. Indeed, the Riemannian geometry induced by the $W^2$ distance is highly relevant. We plan to explore it future work, and for the moment we will add reference to Wasserstein information geometry in the background section as alternatives to the Fisher-Rao metric.\n\n[1]R.

From these example figures, one can see that orthogonally constrained (Stiefel) optimization takes about twice as long as the stochastic optimizer without any manifold constraints on the weight matrices. Nota bene, our implementation heavily relies on a multicore CPU architecture to offload the matrix factorization. From our experiments, the GPU-only implementation is approximately 4 times as slow as the unconstrained descent method. All the numerical experiments were performed on a Tesla P-100 with a Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2690 v4 @ 2.60GHz and 128GB RAM.\n\nRegarding comparisons to highly performant models, we do not consider the networks analyzed in our submission to be practical, but rather consider them as tools to aide the understanding of training very deep and wide networks. The time complexity of a gradient update for each Stiefel layer is O(m^3) where m is the number of neurons, for the Oblique layers that complexity is O(m^2); which hampers the application of manifold constrained optimization in very wide architectures that have recently been proposed.In our theoretical experiments, we focus on multi-layer perceptrons; and while they do not attain competitive performance with convolutional neural networks, they are far more amenable to theoretical analysis. This has been a dominant approach in works like the Neural Tangent Kernel[3], and the random matrix analyses [1,4,5]. We diligently recreated previously reported performance with similar architecture, viz [1] and [2], with a Bayesian hyperparameter search algorithm. \n\nThe claims relating the Neural Tangent kernel were intentionally put in the appendix. We do not claim to make novel contributions, but rather report empirical results that can be explained by using recently obtained bounds on the stability of linearizing wide neural networks around their initial parameters. We do however argue that the interpretation of those results is novel, since the focus in literature thus far has been on the stability of the NTK. Here we observe experimentally that networks with a \"nearly isotropic\" parameter space often train poorly, which goes against intuition from convex optimization. We connect this to the previously known results.\n\nThe training curves for both CIFAR 10 and SVHN are the left hand panels in Figure 1, and they illustrate that the manifold constrained networks \"reduce training loss faster\" but do not benefit from an equivalent increase in test accuracy. We apologize for the confusing labelling of the figures, we will clearly state that the left-hand panels are the per sample cross-entropies during training.\n\nLastly, we apologize for the imprecise phrasing -- we agree that the Neural Tangent Kernel only coincides with the FIM for Gaussian likelihoods and l^2 losses. We will make it clearly that this is a qualified equivalence between the two matrices.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2521/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2521/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["piotr.sokol@stonybrook.edu", "memming.park@stonybrook.edu"], "title": "Information Geometry of Orthogonal Initializations and Training", "authors": ["Piotr Aleksander Sok\u00f3\u0142", "Il Memming Park"], "pdf": "/pdf/518fe69dd850c85be75561849db48ae9cbadf710.pdf", "TL;DR": "nearly isometric DNN initializations imply low parameter space curvature, and a lower condition number, but that's not always great", "abstract": "    Recently mean field theory has been successfully used to analyze properties\n    of wide, random neural networks.

By bounding the maximum eigenvalue of the Fisher in terms of the maximum squared singular value of the input-output Jacobian, this paper provides a partial explanation for the successful initialization procedures obeying \"dynamical isometry\". By additionally investigating optimization on the orthogonal weight manifold, this paper sheds light on the important of maintaining spectral uniformity throughout training.  These two analyses help fill in important gaps in the understanding of initialization, dynamical isometry, and the training of deep neural networks. For these reasons I recommend this paper for acceptance.\n\nThere are two aspects of the paper that could nevertheless use some clarification and improvement. First, unless I missed something, this paper does not provide any bounds on the condition number or the minimum eigenvalue of the Fisher or the NTK. It seems like the main arguments only depend on the maximum eigenvalues. Generally, I think the insights into the maximum eigenvalues are useful and important on their own, but perhaps some additional discussion up front clarifying which results were derived theoretically and which were observed empirically could be useful.\n\nSecond, it should be noted that the the networks trained in the experiments are likely in a regime that is well outside the NTK regime, in two important ways: the dataset is large compared to the width and the optimal learning rates may be large as well.\n\nOverall, I think this is a good paper that adds important insights into the study of initialization, local geometry, and their effects on training speed."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2521/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2521/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["piotr.sokol@stonybrook.edu", "memming.park@stonybrook.edu"], "title": "Information Geometry of Orthogonal Initializations and Training", "authors": ["Piotr Aleksander Sok\u00f3\u0142", "Il Memming Park"], "pdf": "/pdf/518fe69dd850c85be75561849db48ae9cbadf710.pdf", "TL;DR": "nearly isometric DNN initializations imply low parameter space curvature, and a lower condition number, but that's not always great", "abstract": "    Recently mean field theory has been successfully used to analyze properties\n    of wide, random neural networks.
