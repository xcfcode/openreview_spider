There have been attempts to provide such theoretical justifications in the literature [1,2] but their scope has been limited. It was not our intention to provide such rigorous theoretical justifications in this paper, but we hope that our empirical work in identifying and understanding the effects of ad-hoc parameters and techniques could clarify things and form a precursor for such theoretical analysis. \n\nRegarding your specific comments:\n\n> Length of the experiments\nWe have not used any budget limitation or early stopping in any of the experiments but this is a great point. In fact it makes a lot of sense to frame some our findings in the context of early stopping. In many cases we observed that once validation accuracy stops improving, there is often not a meaningful improvement in remaining training steps. We show how those extra steps allow squeezing a bit more accuracy from the model by training it for a very long time and relying on noise sources. Early stopping could be a good way to think about the actual capability of STE. \n\nWe have updated the paper to make it clear where early stopping fits in our study. We have also updated the final \u201cBest-Practices\u201d section accordingly.\n\n>  Deterministic vs. stochastic binary weights\nGood point. The abstract has now been updated to make it clear that we are studying deterministic binary models and not the stochastic ones.\n\n>  Statistical significance of Table 3\nWe have now updated the table in the paper to include the average results over 5 runs. Thank you for pushing us to do this. \n\n> Curves and figures for the two-stage clipping\nWe will update the paper soon to include these figures.\n\nFinally, we have updated the paper to include results on ImageNet dataset for Section 4. Hopefully this will make our experiments more comprehensive.\n\n[1] Li, Hao, et al. \"Training quantized nets: A deeper understanding.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2017.\n[2] Anderson, Alexander G., and Cory P.

This whitepaper is very relevant to the direction we have pursued in this paper. Interestingly, similar to our findings, it also identifies that Batch Normalisation should be handled differently when training quantized models to obtain better accuracies. It also looks at the consequences of using ReLU6 vs. ReLU. Another recent paper [2] recommended using PReLU to achieve better accuracy in Binary networks. It may be interesting to look more carefully at the choice of non-linearity function and its effects on the performance of quantized models. \n\nWe have now uploaded a newer version of our paper in which we have embedded your comments.

The empirical verification of the proposed hypothesis was viewed as weak as the only two datasets used are small datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10, and the used network architectures are also limited. Much more rigorous and thorough testing is required for an empirical paper which proposes new claims. \n\nTake the first claim \"end-to-end training of binary networks crucially relies on the optimiser taking advantage of second moment gradient estimates\" as an example. As it is known that choice of optimizer is highly dependent on the specific dataset and network structure, it is not convincing to jump to this conclusion using the observations on two small datasets and limited network architectures.  E.g, many binarization papers use momentum for ImageNet dataset with residual networks. Does Adam also outperforms momentum in this case? Similarly, it is also hard for me to judge whether the other conclusions made about weight/gradient clipping, the momentum in batch normalization and learning rate, are correct or not.\n\nSome minor issues are:\n1. In Figure 4, different methods are not run to convergence, and the comparison may not be fair.\n2.

In particular, different existing training methods are tested and compared for training both MLPs and CNNs.\n\nThe main findings of the paper are:\n- Using methods such as AdaGrad, AdaDelta, RMSProp and ADAM yields better performance than simpler momentum-based methods such as vanilla momentum and Nesterov momentum, which in turn are much better than vanilla SGD\n- When training binary models, it is common to clip weights and/or gradients for the proxy weights in the network. In the paper it is however shown that these methods hinder using a fast learning rate in the beginning of training, while the methods are required in later stages of training in order to achieve good results\n- Pre-training the model with full-precision training works well in speeding up training\n\nFor a practitioner, the paper presents a very useful reference for what methods work well when training binary networks. Although there are some proposals and hypotheses for reasons behind the results, I see the paper as a review paper of existing methods for training binary networks, showing experiments where the methods are tested using the same benchmark and training procedure in order to give a fair comparison.\n\nAs a practical guide, the paper therefore has clear value. What is lacking compared to typical ICLR papers is rigorously presenting new findings. The authors present a hypothesis for why different batch sizes are needed in the beginning compared to the end of training, but I found neither the justification nor the results very convincing with respect to the hypothesis. The way I see it, the actual novel proposals that are made in the paper are two two-stage training methods: one in which the tricks of weight and gradient clipping are only used towards the end of training, and one where the first stage of training is done using a full precision model. It is however quite well known that some training schemes with different stages can lead to improved performance: for instance with ADAM, even if it is an adaptive method, lowering the learning rate towards the end of training is often beneficial. It might therefore be fair to compare the methods to other multi-stage training methods. In addition, I could not find the training curves or final performance figures of the method where clipping is only activated towards the end of training.\n\nTo put it all together, the paper is clearly useful for the community as it provides a useful summary of the performance of different methods for training binary neural networks. In addition, it presents two two-stage training schemes that seem to make training even faster. What the paper lacks is rigorous theoretical justifications and clearly novel ideas.\n\nSmall comments:\n- How are the training lengths decided for the different methods? If I am not mistaken, in Figure 2, it seems like the SGD and momentum methods have not yet converged when training is halted. Is there a budget for wall clock time or is early stopping used or something similar? Considering the nature of the paper, I would see this kind of decisions as important to report.\n- In the abstract, you might want to refer to binary weights somewhere. Based on the abstract it is easy to mix the binary networks in this paper with stochastic binary networks that can also be trained using the STE estimator\n- Are the differences in the performances in Table 3 statistically significant?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper899/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "An Empirical study of Binary Neural Networks' Optimisation", "abstract": "Binary neural networks using the Straight-Through-Estimator (STE) have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results, but their training process is not well-founded.

This is due to the discrepancy between the evaluated function in the forward path, and the weight updates in the back-propagation, updates which do not correspond to gradients of the forward path. Efficient convergence and accuracy of binary models often rely on careful fine-tuning and various ad-hoc techniques. In this work, we empirically identify and study the effectiveness of the various ad-hoc techniques commonly used in the literature, providing best-practices for efficient training of binary models. We show that adapting learning rates using second moment methods is crucial for the successful use of the STE, and that other optimisers can easily get stuck in local minima. We also find that many of the commonly employed tricks are only effective towards the end of the training, with these methods making early stages of the training considerably slower. Our analysis disambiguates necessary from unnecessary ad-hoc techniques for training of binary neural networks, paving the way for future development of solid theoretical foundations for these. Our newly-found insights further lead to new procedures which make training of existing binary neural networks notably faster.", "keywords": ["binary neural networks", "quantized neural networks", "straight-through-estimator"], "authorids": ["milad.alizadeh@cs.ox.ac.uk", "javier.fernandezmarques@cs.ox.ac.uk", "nicholas.lane@cs.ox.ac.uk", "yarin.gal@cs.ox.ac.uk"], "authors": ["Milad Alizadeh", "Javier Fern\u00e1ndez-Marqu\u00e9s", "Nicholas D.
