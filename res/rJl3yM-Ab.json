This paper essentially follows the same paradigm, but leverages the state-of-the-art reading comprehension models for answer extraction, and develops the neural network models for the aggregating component.  Although the idea seems incremental, the experimental results do seem solid.  The paper is generally easy to follow, but in several places the presentation can be further improved.\n\nDetailed comments/questions:\n  1. In Sec. 2.2, the justification for adding H^{aq} and \\bar{H}^{aq} is to downweigh the impact of stop word matching.  I feel this is a somewhat indirect and less effective design, if avoiding stop words is really the reason.  A standard preprocessing step may be better.\n  2. In Sec. 2.3, it seems that the final score is just the sum of three individual normalized scores. It's not truly a \"weighted\" combination, where the weights are typically assumed to be tuned.\n  3. Figure 3: Connecting the dots in the two subfigures on the right does not make sense.  Bar charts should be used instead.\n  4. The end of Sec. 4.2: I feel it's a bad example, as the passage does not really support the answer. The fact that \"Sesame Street\" got picked is probably just because it's more famous.\n  5. It'd be interesting to see how traditional IR answer aggregation methods perform, such as simple classifiers or heuristics by word matching (or weighted by TFIDF) and counting.  This will demonstrates the true advantages of leveraging modern NN models.\n\nPros:\n  1. Updating a traditional open-domain QA approach with neural models\n  2. Experiments demonstrate solid positive results\n\nCons:\n  1. The idea seems incremental\n  2.

We have revised the paper to address the issues you raised  and fixed the presentation issues.\n\nABOUT THE NOVELTY: \n\nAlthough traditional QA systems also have the answer re-ranking component, this paper focuses on a novel problem of ``text evidence aggregation'': Here the problem is essentially modeling the relationship between the question and multiple passages (i.e., text evidence), where different passages could enhance or complement each other. For example,  the proposed neural re-ranker models the complementary scenario, i.e., whether the union of different passages could cover different facts in a question, thus the attention-based model is a natural fit.\n\nIn contrast, previous answer re-ranking research did not address the above problem: (1) traditional QA systems like (Ferrucci et al., 2010) used similar passage retrieval approach with answer candidates added to the queries. However they usually consider each passage individually for extracting features of answers, whereas we utilize the information of union/co-occurrence of multiple passages by composing them with neural networks. (2) KB-QA systems (Bast and Haussmann, 2015; Yih et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016) sometimes use text evidence to help answer re-ranking, where the features are also extracted on the pair of a question and a single-passage but ignored the union information among multiple passages.\n\nWe have added the above discussion to our paper (Page 11).\n\nRESPONSE TO THE DETAILED QUESTIONS:\n\nQ1: In Sec. 2.2, the justification for adding H^{aq} and \\bar{H}^{aq} is to downweigh the impact of stop word matching.  I feel this is a somewhat indirect and less effective design, if avoiding stop words is really the reason.  A standard preprocessing step may be better.\n \nA1: We follow the model design in (Wang and Jiang 2017). The reason for adding H^{aq} and \\bar{H}^{aq} is not only to downweigh the stop word matching, but also to take into consideration the semantic information at each position. Therefore, the sentence-level matching model (Eq. (5) in the next paragraph) could potentially learn to distinguish the effects of the element-wise comparison vectors with the original lexical information. We\u2019ve clarified this on Page 5.\n \nQ2: In Sec. 2.3, it seems that the final score is just the sum of three individual normalized scores. It's not truly a \"weighted\" combination, where the weights are typically assumed to be tuned.\n\nA2: We did tune the assigned weights for the three types of normalized scores on the dev set. The tuned version gives some improvement on dev and results in slightly better test scores, compared to simply summing up the three scores.\n \nQ3: Figure 3: Connecting the dots in the two subfigures on the right does not make sense.  Bar charts should be used instead.\n \nA3: We have changed the subfigures to bar charts in the updated version.\n \nQ4: The end of Sec. 4.2: I feel it's a bad example, as the passage does not really support the answer. The fact that \"Sesame Street\" got picked is probably just because it's more famous.\n \nA4: We agree that the passages in Table 6 do not provide full evidence to the question (unlike the example in Figure 1b where the passages fully support all the facts in the question). However, the \u201cSesame Street\u201d got picked not because it is more famous, but because it has supporting evidence in the form of the  \"award-winning\" and \"children's TV show\" facts, while the candidate \"Great Dane\" only covers \"1969\".\n\nWe selected this example in order to show another common case of realistic problems in Open-Domain QA, where the question is complex and the top-K retrieved passages cannot provide full evidence. In this case, our model is able to select the candidate with evidence covering more facts in the question (i.e. the candidate that is more likely to be approximately correct).\n\n \nQ5: It'd be interesting to see how traditional IR answer aggregation methods perform, such as simple classifiers or heuristics by word matching (or weighted by TFIDF) and counting.  This will demonstrate the true advantages of leveraging modern NN models.\n \nA5: Thank you for the valuable advice! We\u2019ve added a baseline method with BM25 value to rerank the answers based on the aggregated passages, together with the analysis about it in the current version. In summary, the BM25 model improved the F1 scores but sometimes caused a decrease in the EM scores.  This is mainly for two reasons: (1) BM25 relies on bag-of-word representation, so context information is not taken into consideration. Also it does not model the phrase similarities. (2) shorter answers are preferred by BM25. For example when answer candidate A is a subsequence of B, then according to our way of collecting pseudo passages, the pseudo passage of A is always a superset of the pseudo passage of B. Therefore F1 scores are often improved while EM declines.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Evidence Aggregation for Answer Re-Ranking in Open-Domain Question Answering", "abstract": "Very recently, it comes to be a popular approach for answering open-domain questions by first searching question-related passages, then applying reading comprehension models to extract answers.
