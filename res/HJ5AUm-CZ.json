Specifically, the authors propose using approximate posteriors shared across groups of examples, rather than posteriors which treat examples independently. The group-wise posteriors allow amortization of the information cost KL(group posterior || prior) across all examples in the group, which the authors liken to the \"KL annealing\" tricks that are sometimes used to avoid posterior collapse when training models with strong decoders p(x|z) using current techniques for approximate variational inference in deep nets.\n\nThe presentation of the core idea is solid, though it did take two read-throughs before the equations really clicked for me. I think the paper could be improved by spending more time on a detailed description of the model for the Omniglot experiments (as illustrated in Figure 3). E.g., explicitly describing how group-wise and per-example posteriors are composed in this model, using Equations and pseudo-code for the main training loop, would have saved me some time. For readers less familiar with amortized variational inference in deep nets, the benefit would be larger.\n\nI appreciate that the authors developed extensions of the core method to more complex group structures, though I didn't find the related experiments particularly convincing. \n\nOverall, I like this paper and think the underlying group-wise posterior construction trick is worth exploring further. Of course, the elephant in the room is how to determine the groups across which the posteriors can be shared and their information costs amortized.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Variational Homoencoder: Learning to Infer High-Capacity Generative Models from Few Examples", "abstract": "Hierarchical Bayesian methods have the potential to unify many related tasks (e.g. k-shot classification, conditional, and unconditional generation) by framing each as inference within a single generative model.

These have been fixed in our revised submission, and much of the language has also been updated to improve consistency. We now use \u2018set\u2019 for all elements which share a particular latent variable (e.g. all images of a particular character) and \u2018dataset\u2019 for the collection of all such sets (e.g. \u201cthe omniglot dataset\u201d). Thanks for highlighting this point of unclarity - we hope that our modification will make the exposition clearer for future readers.\n\n> Most of the results are qualitative\nFor our revised submission, we include a new section (4.1) in the main paper which compares VHE and Neural Statistician objectives on five simple synthetic datasets, aiming to provide stronger empirical support for the theoretical motivations of section 3. In Omniglot experiments, we now also include quantitative results comparing the generative performance for all eight architecture/objective combinations (Table 3), in addition to the classification accuracy results provided in Table 1.\n\n> Could you please elaborate on what's different (in terms of learning) between 3.2 and a normal latent Z that is definitely allowed to affect different classes of the data without knowing the classes?\nThe extended VHE objective allows us to learn latent variable models for structured datasets when the structure is known in advance. For example, our factorial objective might be applied to a dataset of rendered 3D faces when each image is labelled by identity, pose and lighting conditions (as in Deep Convolutional Inverse Graphics Network, Kulkarni et al. 2015) by introducing a separate latent variable for each identity, each pose and each lighting condition. \nWe do not tackle unsupervised learning of such categorical structure in this paper, although we\u2019d be keen to see our approach embedded within a larger EM-like training algorithm, alternating gradient steps with reassignment of elements to groups.\n\n> There is a possibility for potential regularization but there is definitely a big loss in estimation power.\nThis loss in estimation power is a significant limitation of our method; indeed, it was a great surprise to us that our model achieved such strong results despite this! We attribute its success to the high similarity between Omniglot images within the same class, allowing the approximate posterior q(c; D) to remain relatively robust to different choices of D. However, we expect that reduced estimation power may pose a greater challenge in domains with greater intra-class variation (such natural images) and with this in mind propose an alternative objective in Supplement 6.1 which may tighten the variational bound using an auxiliary inference network. Experimentation in this setting remains a direction of future research.\nWe\u2019d also like to note the tricky comparison to existing work with regard to estimation power. The Neural Statistician employs a tighter variational bound, but does so for only an approximate marginal likelihood (based on subsampled training sets). This approximation itself carries unbounded error with respect to the true likelihood. By contrast, the VHE objective uses resampling only within the inference network, trading off estimation power in order to provide a true lower bound on the likelihood of the complete training set.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Variational Homoencoder: Learning to Infer High-Capacity Generative Models from Few Examples", "abstract": "Hierarchical Bayesian methods have the potential to unify many related tasks (e.g. k-shot classification, conditional, and unconditional generation) by framing each as inference within a single generative model.

We have posted a revised version in which we aim to address each reviewer\u2019s specific concerns (individual comments are given below). The main changes are the following:\n- Rewriting the abstract/title to emphasise the relationship between our VHE objective and the PixelCNN architecture we apply it to.\n- Elaborating the training procedure (Algorithm 1)\n- Moving the synthetic data experiments to the main paper (Section 4.1)\n- Adding quantitative evaluation of generative performance on all 8 architecture/objective variants (Table 3)\n- Minor architectural modification on factorial architecture (Section 4.3), to obtain improved results (Figure 8)\n- Moving Silhouette generation experiments to Supplementary Material for space.\n\nWe believe that addressing these comments has significantly improved the presentation of our work, and hope that this improvement justifies the increased length of our paper (now 10 pages).\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Variational Homoencoder: Learning to Infer High-Capacity Generative Models from Few Examples", "abstract": "Hierarchical Bayesian methods have the potential to unify many related tasks (e.g. k-shot classification, conditional, and unconditional generation) by framing each as inference within a single generative model. We show that existing approaches for learning such models can fail on expressive generative networks such as PixelCNNs, by describing the global distribution with little reliance on latent variables. To address this, we develop a modification of the Variational Autoencoder in which encoded observations are decoded to new elements from the same class; the result, which we call a Variational Homoencoder (VHE), may be understood as training a hierarchical latent variable model which better utilises latent variables in these cases. Using this framework enables us to train a hierarchical PixelCNN for the Omniglot dataset, outperforming all existing models on test set likelihood. With a single model we achieve both strong one-shot generation and near human-level classification, competitive with state-of-the-art discriminative classifiers. The VHE objective extends naturally to richer dataset structures such as factorial or hierarchical categories, as we illustrate by training models to separate character content from simple variations in drawing style, and to generalise the style of an alphabet to new characters.", "pdf": "/pdf/9d1763e5a3c2061239bfa1612bbd2869f2b7350a.pdf", "TL;DR": "Technique for learning deep generative models with shared latent variables, applied to Omniglot with a PixelCNN decoder.", "paperhash": "hewitt|the_variational_homoencoder_learning_to_infer_highcapacity_generative_models_from_few_examples", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nhewitt2018the,\ntitle={The Variational Homoencoder: Learning to Infer High-Capacity Generative Models from Few Examples},\nauthor={Luke Hewitt and Andrea Gane and Tommi Jaakkola and Joshua B.
