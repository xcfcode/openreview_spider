The main idea behind this work is to exploit twin-least-square loss to perform background modeling in feature and image domains to alleviate the gradient vanishing problem of the previous GAN-based\u00a0anomaly detection methods. Specifically, they\u00a0proposed i) an MCM-aware strategy to construct the multi-scale priors, ii) a twin-least-square loss on GAN for training stabilization, and iii) an anomaly rejection loss for background estimation. The experiments on multiple benchmarks\u00a0show the superiority of the MTGAN to the state of the art hyperspectral anomaly detection methods.\n\n[Strengths]\n+ The interesting idea of\u00a0generating prior dictionaries to alleviate the lack of data for anomaly detection \n+ Tackling the GAN's gradient vanishing problem with the proposed twin-least-square loss sounds general-purpose\u00a0and applicable to other applications\n+ Experiments are performed on multiple datasets\n\n[Weaknesses] \n- Contributions are not clearly and accurately stated (e.g.,\u00a0the method section is very hard to follow)\n- There is a lack of motivation and discussion\u00a0as well as theoretical analysis\u00a0on the proposed method\n- I am not very familiar with the task of anomaly detection in HSI, but the experimental results seem just marginally better than the other methods \n- The English could be improved\n\n[Detailed Questions/Comments]\n- More in-depth discussion of the method is necessary, For example: Why does it work? When does it fail? \n-\u00a0Theoretical discussion is missing: e.g., there is no theoretically evidence is provided to support why\u00a0twin-least-square loss stabilizes the GAN for training\u00a0compared to the normal discriminator in GAN, etc. \n- A discussion on the computational costs (training time, convergence speed) and complexity of the proposed method could be helpful. \n- The authors observed that their proposed twin-least-square loss can alleviate the\u00a0GAN's gradient vanishing problem: it would be nice to evaluate this phenomenon for the generation with GANs and inspect the quality of the generated images\u00a0\n-\u00a0Providing experimental results on the outlier detection datasets would be very helpful. (see [M1] or an extensive outlier detection benchmark)\n- Some important references on the adversarial-discriminator based methods for anomaly/novelty/abnormality/outlier detection are missing: e.g., [M2, M3]\n\n[Missing References]\n\n[M1]\u00a0On the Evaluation of Unsupervised Outlier Detection: Measures, Datasets, and an Empirical Study by G.

However, some emerging methods based on generative adversarial network (GAN) suffer from the problems of gradient vanishing and training instability with struggling to strike a balance between performance and training sample limitations. In this work, aiming to remedy the drawbacks of existing methods, we present a novel multi-scale covariance map (MCM)-aware twin-least-square GAN (MTGAN). Instead of the widely used single-scale Gaussian hypothesis background estimation, in MTGAN, we introduce the MCM-aware strategy to construct multi-scale priors with precise second-order statistics, thereby implicitly bridging the spatial and spectral information. Thus, we reliably and adaptively represent the prior of HSI to change the priors-lack situation. Moreover, we impose the twin-least-square loss on GAN, which helps improve the generative ability and training stability in feature and image domains, overcoming the gradient vanishing problem. Finally, the network enforced with a new anomaly rejection loss establishes a pure and discriminative background estimation. Experiments demonstrate that the average detection accuracy of MTGAN reaches 0.99809, which is superior to the state-of-the-art algorithms.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "zhong|mcmaware_twinleastsquare_gan_for_hyperspectral_anomaly_detection", "one-sentence_summary": "A novel multi-scale covariance map (MCM)-aware twin-least-square GAN (MTGAN) is proposed to solve the problem of insufficient prior, gradient vanishing, and instability training in hyperspectral anomaly detection.", "pdf": "/pdf/7742091059a07e49a56a911b225cffd33cb32047.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=MG5kxC0ORl", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nzhong2021mcmaware,\ntitle={{\\{}MCM{\\}}-aware Twin-least-square {\\{}GAN{\\}} for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection},\nauthor={Jiaping Zhong and Weiying Xie and Jie Lei and Yunsong Li and Zan Li},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Y4SOA2qsYJS}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
