It investigates how the \"non-regularization period\", or period between regularization steps, interacts with other hyperparameters. \n\nOverall, the writing feels somewhat scattered, and it is hard to identify a clear argument for why the NRP should help. Certainly one could save computation this way, but regularizers like weight decay or weight noise incur only a small computational cost anyway. One explicit claim from the paper is that a higher NRP allows larger regularization. There's a sense in which this is demonstrated, though not a very interesting sense: Figure 4 shows that the weight decay strength should be adjusted proportionally to the NRP. But varying the parameters in this way simply results in an unbiased (but noisier) estimate of gradients of exactly the same regularization penalty, so I don't think there's much surprising here.\n\nSimilarly, Section 3 argues that a higher NRP allows for larger stochastic perturbations, which makes it easier to escape local optima. But this isn't demonstrated experimentally, nor does it seem obvious that stochasticity will help find a better local optimum.\n\nOverall, I think this paper needs substantial cleanup before it's ready to be published at a venue such as ICLR.\n", "title": "Paper Decision"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Decoupling Weight Regularization from Batch Size for Model Compression", "authors": ["Dongsoo Lee", "Se Jung Kwon", "Byeongwook Kim", "Yongkweon Jeon", "Baeseong Park", "Jeongin Yun", "Gu-Yeon Wei"], "authorids": ["dslee3@gmail.com", "mogndrewk@gmail.com", "quddnr145@gmail.com", "dragwon.jeon@gmail.com", "qkrqotjd91@gmail.com", "yji6373@naver.com", "gywei@g.harvard.edu"], "keywords": ["Model compression", "Weight Regularization", "Batch Size", "Gradient Descent"], "TL;DR": "We show that stronger regularization and high model compression ratio can be achieved when weight updates are conducted less frequently.", "abstract": "Conventionally, compression-aware training performs weight compression for every mini-batch to compute the impact of compression on the loss function.

For example, compression-related hyper-parameters can be updated on a regular basis to gradually improve compression ratio, or hyper-parameter search process can be automated by a loop that involves iterative fine-tuning and new hyper-parameter exploration. We added related papers in Section 5 even though such periodic compression techniques are different from our proposed method (most of previous works assume pNR=1). We found one paper introducing soft filter pruning associated with occasional pruning. But there is no any analysis on why such occasional pruning is effective.\nOur proposed technique can be combined with such period compression methods because even though we fixed ranks or quantization bits in this paper (to focus on introducing new training algorithm), such hyper-parameters can be fine-tuned by periodic compression techniques.\n\nQ2: The experiments are small scale and not exhaustive. There is very little comparison to previous work and alternative methods.\nA2: Due to the space limit, some experimental results (including pruning large PTB model and low-rank approximation using ResNet-34 on ImageNet) are described in Appendix. For each compression technique (pruning, quantization, or SVD), we selected well-known models that have been compressed in other papers with high compression ratio. Even though our experimental results could be more exhaustive, we believe that our comparisons using benchmark models are enough to suggest that our proposed compression scheme exhibits competitive (if not better) compression capability while training algorithm for compression can be significantly simplified.\n\nQ3: \"Regularization\" means \"compression\"?\nA3: Throughout the manuscript, we tried to deliver the message that model compression is a kind of weight regularization method (i.e., regularization includes compression as a superset). In the revised manuscript, we explicitly use \"weight regularization for compression\" whenever weights are manipulated to be compressed.\n\nQ4: What do you mean by \"asynchronous regularization\"? You seem to mean periodic compression?\nA4: We acknowledge that \"asynchronous regularization\" may be confusing to represent our proposed scheme. On the other hand, \"period compression\" may be understood in many different ways. We replaced \"asynchronous regularization\" with \"occasional regularization\" in the revised manuscript to emphasize that pNR is much larger than 1."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1018/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1018/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Decoupling Weight Regularization from Batch Size for Model Compression", "authors": ["Dongsoo Lee", "Se Jung Kwon", "Byeongwook Kim", "Yongkweon Jeon", "Baeseong Park", "Jeongin Yun", "Gu-Yeon Wei"], "authorids": ["dslee3@gmail.com", "mogndrewk@gmail.com", "quddnr145@gmail.com", "dragwon.jeon@gmail.com", "qkrqotjd91@gmail.com", "yji6373@naver.com", "gywei@g.harvard.edu"], "keywords": ["Model compression", "Weight Regularization", "Batch Size", "Gradient Descent"], "TL;DR": "We show that stronger regularization and high model compression ratio can be achieved when weight updates are conducted less frequently.", "abstract": "Conventionally, compression-aware training performs weight compression for every mini-batch to compute the impact of compression on the loss function.

In the revised manuscript, for every weight manipulation to compress weights, we chose \"weight regularization\" to be distinguished from weight updates for gradient descent, not only in abstract and introduction, but also in the entire manuscript. For batch size selection, we revised introduction and Section 5 to clarify that batch size is selected to be small for better generalization while weight regularization does not have to be performed for every mini-batch. We would be very happy if you can suggest any other parts to be improved in writing. Unfortunately, we cannot edit the title at this moment. We will find a chance to revise the title appropriately for the final manuscript.\n\n2) We acknowledge that Figure 5 may look different from Figure 3 and Figure 4 without detailed discussions, especially for SVD and pruning. To explain how those figures are closely related, we added experimental results (Figure 6) and detailed discussions in Section 5 while Figure 5 and 14 include additional results (using wider hyper-parameter exploration). In Section 4, the key message is that the amount of weight regularization divided by pNR is almost constant (hence, longer pNR allows stronger weight regularization). Unlike weight decay, compression ratio is not directly related to the average amount of weight regularization. Hence, we first obtained weight difference by compression and found that there is a particular optimal constant (weight difference)/(pNR) value for the best model accuracy regardless of compression ratio. Since model compression involves much more complicated weight regularization effects than weight decay, Figure 5 can be different from Figure 4. But in Figure 6, we observed that achieving an optimal constant of (weight difference)/(pNR) can explain both Figure 4 and Figure 5."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1018/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1018/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Decoupling Weight Regularization from Batch Size for Model Compression", "authors": ["Dongsoo Lee", "Se Jung Kwon", "Byeongwook Kim", "Yongkweon Jeon", "Baeseong Park", "Jeongin Yun", "Gu-Yeon Wei"], "authorids": ["dslee3@gmail.com", "mogndrewk@gmail.com", "quddnr145@gmail.com", "dragwon.jeon@gmail.com", "qkrqotjd91@gmail.com", "yji6373@naver.com", "gywei@g.harvard.edu"], "keywords": ["Model compression", "Weight Regularization", "Batch Size", "Gradient Descent"], "TL;DR": "We show that stronger regularization and high model compression ratio can be achieved when weight updates are conducted less frequently.", "abstract": "Conventionally, compression-aware training performs weight compression for every mini-batch to compute the impact of compression on the loss function.

Basically, the paper proposes to apply weight regularization and compression less frequently so that they can use stronger regularization/compression, hence achieving high compression ratio and model accuracy.\n\nOverall, the idea of asynchronous regularization and compression is interesting and worth further investigation. However, I vote for a reject for now because\n(1) The paper is hard to follow and the writing can be significantly improved especially for the abstract and introduction. I felt rather confused when I first read the abstract and introduction. The authors frequently use the word \"weight update\", however it is unclear whether it refers to gradient update or the update caused by regularization/compression. Besides, the title is also a little confusing. There's little discussion about the choice of batch size and I don't really understand how weight regularization is decoupled from batch size after reading the paper. I suggest the authors to think more about the title.\n(2) The reason why such a training scheme improves model compression is unclear and needs further investigations. In the paper, the authors first interpret model compression as a way of inducing weight decay (and random weight noise). Particularly, the model accuracy is roughly constant over different value of NR period (as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4) when weight decay is used. However, the results of model compression are quite different (according to Figure 5). The best performance is only achieved with very large NR period in the case of SVD and pruning. I think the authors should give some explanations for that difference. Also, I notice that quantization behaves more similarly to weight decay and it requires further discussion.\n\nTo sum up, I like the idea of asynchronous regularization/compression, but I'm not quite satisfied with current version of paper. I encourage the authors to improve their writing and add more discussions (see my point (2)) to the paper. I'm willing to increase my score if the authors can address my concerns."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1018/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1018/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Decoupling Weight Regularization from Batch Size for Model Compression", "authors": ["Dongsoo Lee", "Se Jung Kwon", "Byeongwook Kim", "Yongkweon Jeon", "Baeseong Park", "Jeongin Yun", "Gu-Yeon Wei"], "authorids": ["dslee3@gmail.com", "mogndrewk@gmail.com", "quddnr145@gmail.com", "dragwon.jeon@gmail.com", "qkrqotjd91@gmail.com", "yji6373@naver.com", "gywei@g.harvard.edu"], "keywords": ["Model compression", "Weight Regularization", "Batch Size", "Gradient Descent"], "TL;DR": "We show that stronger regularization and high model compression ratio can be achieved when weight updates are conducted less frequently.", "abstract": "Conventionally, compression-aware training performs weight compression for every mini-batch to compute the impact of compression on the loss function.
