Moreover, it would not be improved by LCN-Sinkhorn. We will thus remove this part of Prop. 1 (Eq. 15 and the second part of Eq. 13) in all future versions.

The most important feature of the solution \\bar{P} is that it has both marginals matching data, and that is not used in your current analysis.\n\nIf you have a pointer to an updated proof, I would be interested in looking at it but I remain skeptical about the rest of your statement, and would also be curious to hear whether you have carried out numerical validation. \n\nThe fact that \\bar{P} can be written as a by product of the optimal dual variables is indeed a well known fact, P = D(s)KD(t) with your notations, where s = \ud835\udf40 log \u03b1. \n\nI do not understand what you mean by\n\n\"At the optimum \\bar{P} we have f(C, \u03b1, P) = 0 and thus g(C, \u03b1) = \\bar{P}.\"\n\nAssuming you are reusing the notations of your theorem B. By doing this it seems you are now moving \u03b1 the same level than C. Yet \u03b1 (or P) is precisely one of the outputs of the Sinkhorn optimization algorithm. Therefore it makes little sense to include it in the \"solver\" g. What matters is precisely differentiating \u03b1's w.r.t. C (the differential of P w.r.t. \u03b1's is easy).\n\nAt this point I reiterate my belief that your proof looks incorrect as it stands in the draft, but that I also believe that the diagonal jacobian you mention is incorrect. Therefore I would be surprised if your other jacobians in that theorem can be validated numerically.\n\nAn interesting reference that does such computations, putting dual variables as outputs of g,  can be seen here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11897.pdf , which could be worth adding to your bibliography.\n\nSince I am bit uncomfortable with this exercise, if you still claim these quantities are valid, I would encourage you to provide a link (e.g. a colab or an updated pdf) that I could examine, hoping somewhat that I am wrong.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3231/Area_Chair1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3231/Area_Chair1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Warpspeed Computation of Optimal Transport, Graph Distances, and Embedding Alignment", "authorids": ["~Johannes_Klicpera1", "marten.lienen@in.tum.de", "~Stephan_G\u00fcnnemann1"], "authors": ["Johannes Klicpera", "Marten Lienen", "Stephan G\u00fcnnemann"], "keywords": ["Optimal transport", "sinkhorn distance", "locality sensitive hashing", "nystr\u00f6m method", "graph neural networks", "embedding alignment"], "abstract": "Optimal transport (OT) is a cornerstone of many machine learning tasks.

We appreciate the time you have invested and your attention to detail. Our work has substantially improved after every one of your comments.\n\nIndeed, you are partially right. Note that Prop. 1 concerns regular Sinkhorn and LCN-Sinkhorn. We thus implicitly assume that C has total support to guarantee existence of the minimizer. We should have stated this explicitly. Furthermore, the current proof indeed contains a mistake involving Eq. 46. \\bar{P} lies on the boundary of the marginal constraints. The gradient thus does not have to be zero, as wrongly stated after Eq. 46. Fortunately, there is a way around this and Prop. 1 is still correct.\n\nThe Sinkhorn distance is a convex optimization problem, a solution exists (assuming total support), and the positivity and marginal constraints are linear. Therefore, strong duality holds by Slater's condition. Furthermore, due to convexity the minimizer \\bar{P} of the dual problem is the same as the minimizer of the primal problem. Denoting the Lagrange multipliers by \u03b1_1 to \u03b1_5 we can thus identify x=(C, \u03b1), y=P, and f(C, \u03b1, P) as the derivative of the dual w.r.t. P, i.e. f(C, \u03b1, P) = C + \u03bb logP + \u03bb + \u03b1_1 \\vec{1}^T - \u03b1_2 \\vec{1}^T + \\vec{1} \u03b1_3^T - \\vec{1} \u03b1_4^T - \u03b1_5; note that \u03b1_1 to \u03b1_4 are vectors, while \u03b1_5 is a matrix. At the optimum \\bar{P} we have f(C, \u03b1, P) = 0 and thus g(C, \u03b1) = \\bar{P}. We then obtain the same diagonal Jacobian as in Eq. 47 and the same derivative as in Eq. 48, independently of the Lagrange multipliers. The remaining proof remains the same."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3231/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3231/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Warpspeed Computation of Optimal Transport, Graph Distances, and Embedding Alignment", "authorids": ["~Johannes_Klicpera1", "marten.lienen@in.tum.de", "~Stephan_G\u00fcnnemann1"], "authors": ["Johannes Klicpera", "Marten Lienen", "Stephan G\u00fcnnemann"], "keywords": ["Optimal transport", "sinkhorn distance", "locality sensitive hashing", "nystr\u00f6m method", "graph neural networks", "embedding alignment"], "abstract": "Optimal transport (OT) is a cornerstone of many machine learning tasks.

To do so, the authors propose to compute a low rank approximation of a sparsified (thresholded below a certain value to be 0) kernel matrix using Nystr\u00f6m, and then correct it by adding back the true entries at non-sparse entries, after removing those obtained from the approximation. This results in a matrix whose application then results in sparse + low-rank.\n\nThe first version of the paper contained mostly experimental evidence, which was deemed a bit short by some reviewers.The authors have added theoretical material on the way. Although I believe these are worthy additions, as AC, I do not feel comfortable accepting the paper as of now, because I believe these additions were not properly reviewed. I understand this must be disappointing for the authors, who have sprinted to add new content during the rebuttal phase, but I hope they agree that the rebuttal process is not here to handle entirely new sections, but rather to improve existing parts. In particular, that section should be reviewed by authors knowledgeable on low rank kernel factorization, something I did not see in the pool of reviewers. I also believe the paper still has a few shortcomings. Taken together, I therefore recommend a re-submission.\n\nideas to improve the paper\n\n- the authors claim to use Nystr\u00f6m on a sparsified matrix (see eq. 4). The sparsified kernel is no longer positive definite. I would like the authors to comment on this. I understand Nystr\u00f6m could be used naively without any psd-ness guarantees, but I think a heads-up is needed.There are, furthermore, several local/global factorizations of kernel matrices available out there (e.g. MEKA, https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v18/15-025.html), the main difference here being that the product by such approximation must be guaranteed to be positive for it to work in the Sinkhorn algorithm. I would expect that bounds in expectation to break down sometimes, and therefore result in \"catastrophic\" failures (i.e. nan's). I think that an algorithm that claims to improve or replace another one, and which has such blind spots, needs such additional experiments (I have read the Limitations section in Appendix B, something more precise would improve the paper). I understand these were not part of the original Nystr\u00f6m paper for Sinkhorn, but since this is an increment over that previous work, therefore lacking a bit its originality, more knowledge needs to be contributed.\n\n- For instance, since the authors write an entire paragraph on this (Appendix B), I am surprised that there is not direct mention to the fact that a sparse sinkhorn may simply *not* converge, because it may not satisfy the fully indecomposable property required of matrices for Sinkhorn's algorithm to converge. \n\n- i dont think that users have the various identities (14,15) in mind when they think about \"backpropagating\" through Sinkhorn. What is typically needed is to compute the differentiable properties of the regularized OT matric and/or of the regularized OT cost w.r.t. *point locations* (i.e. x_i). The statement \"LCN-Sinkhorn works flawlessly with automatic backpropagation\" is misleading in the sense that it ignores that problem altogether. Since so many extensions of OT today relay on that differentiability, the section, as it is written now, is problematic.\n\n- several methods claim to be faster of more efficient than Sinkhorn to solve OT. Either these methods display faster theoretical convergence (e.g. by using acceleration) or display faster practical convergence (e.g. heavy ball variants) using synthetic, controlled datasets. Using synthetic data helps exhibit highlight relevant regimes for regularization parameters, including those where LSE Sinkhorn may converge but LCN does not work, or vice-versa. I understand that the authors' wanted to use real data, but it would be great to clarify whether that setup was used because LCN works better there (in which case this becomes more of a paper at the intersection of OT and word embeddings) or because this happened to be the first and only example the authors thought of."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Warpspeed Computation of Optimal Transport, Graph Distances, and Embedding Alignment", "authorids": ["~Johannes_Klicpera1", "marten.lienen@in.tum.de", "~Stephan_G\u00fcnnemann1"], "authors": ["Johannes Klicpera", "Marten Lienen", "Stephan G\u00fcnnemann"], "keywords": ["Optimal transport", "sinkhorn distance", "locality sensitive hashing", "nystr\u00f6m method", "graph neural networks", "embedding alignment"], "abstract": "Optimal transport (OT) is a cornerstone of many machine learning tasks.

Then, it is pretty much welcome that attempts to patch the problems of Nystroms are made, so Optimal Transport becomes more scalable.\n\nThe reason for why my judgement is below acceptance is that I believe both theory and results altogether are not strong enough so they live up to what is promised in the abstract. Typically when new methods are proposed with the promise of bridging a gap and solving a relevant problem, I hope they will have a thorough theoretical justification, or the results will be compelling. None of this convincing enough here.\n\n1)On the theoretical side, I missed a convergence analysis, as the one in the Nystrom method. The theory side focuses on some derivative calculations, but I would love to see how the interplay between sparsity, Nystrom method and LSH lead to better convergence. I acknowledge this can be hard to do, though. Without having the theory it is hard to understand whether any reported experimental result is a consequence of choosing particularly good example for their method.\n\n2)I found the experimental/methodological side was a bit disconnected from the rest; the paper contains  several vignettes about some applications/improvements in the practical side, but when reading that felt like belonging to other paper. I recommend authors work in creating a more coherent story\n2a) I found the discussion on Multi-Head OT unjustified and even a bit misleading. The Authors refer to some NLP papers, like arguing OT plays a role there. But none of these papers have any OT at all. The analogy of  \"softmax for rows\" is not convincing as this is simply a softmax applied many times. There is a world of difference between that and the result of sinkhorn algorithm, but the narrative seems to downplay the actual difference between them. I recommend the authors elaborate more on this connection, because otherwise it is hard to follow (and the subsequent results).\n2b)Results on translation seem impressive (Table 2), but raise a concern. Why would your method outperform Sinkhorn if it is only approximation? is it perhaps the result of randomness? since an explanation of this phenomenon is missing I am led to believing. Authors should improve the exposition of the baseline \"original\". Why does full Sinkhorn does better than original?. In summary, I think authors should improve the discussion about the validity/significance of their empirical results, highlighting the regimes when they are supposed to express and when they are not.\n2c)The main figure is Fig 2.

Table 1 also gives the relative error of the overall Sinkhorn distance and we further analyze the distance approximation in Appendix L. Note that the Sinkhorn distance is a single value and not 10^6 values like the transport plan.\n\nAppendix L also explains why we defer the Sinkhorn distance  to the appendix, instead of the transport plan: \u201cKeep in mind that in most cases the OT plan is more important than the raw distance approximation, since it determines the training gradient and tasks like embedding alignment don\u2019t use the distance at all. This becomes evident in the fact that sparse Sinkhorn achieves a better distance approximation than LCN-Sinkhorn but performs worse in both downstream tasks investigated in Sec. 7.\u201d\n\n**b) Why did we analyze the transport plan, not the cost matrix C or the similarity matrix K?**\n\nSince we are interested in approximating Sinkhorn we think that analyzing its result instead of its input provides more conclusive information. Otherwise we would be missing many crucial influences.\n\n**c) Why did we use PCC to compare transport plans?**\n\nComparing the values of 10^6 pairs is rather challenging. We primarily use the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of the approximate transport plan entries $P_{ij}^{LCN}$ since this directly shows how well the values are correlated with the ground truth $P_{ij}$. In the best case this value will be 1, which means that the values lie on a perfect line with 0 width. The entries of $P_{ij}^{LCN}$ will then be exactly scaled versions of the ground truth $P_{ij}$ (around the fixed mean). In the worst case it will be 0 or even negative. We complement this with the IoU of top 0.1%, which puts more focus on the (most important) highest values.\n\nWe found that PCC and IoU reflect the actual performance much better than e.g. RMSE or MAE because almost all values in the transport plan are close to 0. If a row has a single $P_{ij}$ close to 1 that means that 9,999 values will be close to 0. Measures like the RMSE and MAE then only focus on the unimportant 9,999 values close to 0, while PCC and IoU will show how well the 1 important value is reflected.\n\nTo show that these summary statistics do not hide the bigger picture we also plot the raw values in Figure 1. Factored OT looks similar to the other low-rank approximation (Nystr\u00f6m Sinkhorn) in this comparison, i.e. it is almost flat.\n\nIf you are interested nonetheless, below you can find the RMSE and MAE (std. devs are of the order 0.01e-4). Note that on average LCN-Sinkhorn performs best even for these heavily biased measures.\n\n||MAE/10^-4 (EN-DE)|RMSE/10^-3 (EN-DE)|MAE/10^-4 (EN-ES)|RMSE/10^-3 (EN-ES)|MAE/10^-4 (EN-FR)|RMSE/10^-3 (EN-FR)|MAE/10^-4 (EN-RU)|RMSE/10^-3 (EN-RU)|\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n|Factored OT|1.58|3.94|1.63|4.83|1.62|4.70|1.49|2.87|\n|Multiscale OT|1.19|4.05|1.17|4.78|1.15|4.63|1.18|3.13|\n|Nystr\u00f6m Skh.|1.54|3.93|1.59|4.82|1.57|4.69|1.45|2.87|\n|Sparse Skh.|1.55|4.88|1.43|4.97|1.46|4.98|1.70|4.76|\n|LCN-Sinkhorn|1.27|3.50|1.16|3.71|1.18|3.73|1.33|3.04|\n\n## Ad 2) End-to-end performance\nWe are happy to hear that you agree on this point and that you appreciate the fact that we include the end-to-end performance in our evaluation. Most previous works forego this analysis.\n\nWe have omitted factored OT from experiments 2 and 3 due to its OT plan approximation in the first experiment being even worse than Nystr\u00f6m Sinkhorn and its non-competitive runtime.\n\nIf you are still curious to see the factored OT results, these are the results for experiment 2. Factored OT is more than 2x slower than LCN-Sinkhorn and other methods, which is due to factored OT\u2019s slow iterative refinement scheme. Moreover, it completely fails to align the embeddings. While this might be expected based on experiment 1, we do realize that results as clear as this are rather uncommon. Note that we let factored OT use as many landmarks as fit into GPU memory (200, i.e. 5x more than LCN-Sinkhorn) and the partially positive results in experiment 1 show that our implementation is correct. We would also again like to highlight that our experimental setup is completely transparent and reproducible, including the source code. This result thus just highlights this task's difficulty.\n\n||Time (s)|EN-ES|ES-EN|EN-FR|FR-EN|EN-DE|DE-EN|EN-RU|RU-EN|Avg.|\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n|Factored OT|210|0.0 \u00b1 0.0|0.1 \u00b1 0.0|0.2 \u00b1 0.2|0.1 \u00b1 0.0|0.0 \u00b1 0.1|0.1 \u00b1 0.0|0.0 \u00b1 0.0|0.0 \u00b1 0.0|0.1|\n\n## Summary\nWe would like to thank the reviewer for their response and are happy to have clarified any last questions.

The revised paper indeed is a better version addressing some of my previous concerns. I revisited the paper and has a few additional concerns.\n\n1. I realized the use of PCC (Pearson correlation coefficient) to quantify the order preserving of entries in matching plan, not for preserving the order of distances between all pairs. This is very counter-intuitive to me once I found it! Could you explain why you did not use the later choice to evaluate? The former has no application implication to me and is also not a good indicator for two plans being close. \n\n2. The comparison related to factor OT is only limited to the first experiment. And in my opinion, this does not tell much about how superior the authors' approach competes empirically.

The method performs comparatively well for high regularization, where it performs similarly to LCN-Sinkhorn (see Fig. 4, 9). However, similar to Nystr\u00f6m-Sinkhorn, it largely fails to approximate the transport plan at any reasonably low regularization (see Table 1, Fig. 3). Moreover, due to its iterative approach its runtime is multiple times higher than those of the other methods (see Table 9).\n\n## Theoretical analysis\nTo complement our empirical results we added a new section with a theoretical analysis.

Our method does not \u201cbalance (and join) Sinkhorn and Nystr\u00f6m in one distance\u201d. Instead, we approximate the similarity matrix $K=\\exp(-C/\\lambda)$ using (1) a sparse approximation and (2) a fused sparse/Nystr\u00f6m approximation (which we call locally corrected Nystr\u00f6m). We then use this approximate K _inside_ Sinkhorn and show that doing so yields a better and faster approximation of Sinkhorn than previous methods.\n\n## Improved readability\nWe have incorporated all of your helpful suggestions in the revised version. In particular:\n- We have significantly improved the introduction, now starting with a general problem description, as suggested.\n- We added many more explanations and definitions to address your various questions, e.g. regarding $s$, $t$, $K^{\\text{sp}}$, $\\bar{P}_{\\text{LCN}}$, and the cost function. This should prevent future misinterpretations of Eq. 5 (previously Eq. 4).\n- We improved the motivation for providing explicit gradients.\n- We have removed the OT enhancements section and moved its content to the graph transport network section, where we use them.\n\n## Nystr\u00f6m approximation\nSinkhorn uses kernels of the form $\\exp(-C/\\lambda)$. Kernels like these (e.g. the Gaussian kernel) typically have a reproducing kernel Hilbert space that is infinitely dimensional. The resulting Gram matrix thus always has full rank and can not be reconstructed by a low-rank matrix such as the one provided by the Nystr\u00f6m method (!). We have made this more clear in the paper.\n\n## Table 1\nWe are not sure if we understand your comment. The text describes the experimental setup before referring to Table 1. The goal of our method is to approximate Sinkhorn, so in this experiment it is not a baseline but the ground truth.\n\n## Theoretical analysis\nTo address your comment on validity we provide a new theoretical analysis in Section 4. In particular, we show that (a) LCN provides significant benefits over Nystr\u00f6m in both a uniform and clustered data model, (b) the error of approximate Sinkhorn is bounded, and (c) approximate Sinkhorn enjoys the same converge bounds as regular Sinkhorn.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3231/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3231/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Warpspeed Computation of Optimal Transport, Graph Distances, and Embedding Alignment", "authorids": ["~Johannes_Klicpera1", "marten.lienen@in.tum.de", "~Stephan_G\u00fcnnemann1"], "authors": ["Johannes Klicpera", "Marten Lienen", "Stephan G\u00fcnnemann"], "keywords": ["Optimal transport", "sinkhorn distance", "locality sensitive hashing", "nystr\u00f6m method", "graph neural networks", "embedding alignment"], "abstract": "Optimal transport (OT) is a cornerstone of many machine learning tasks.

In our understanding, such an analysis requires 2 parts:\n1. How good is the approximation?\n2. How fast does the approximation converge?\n\nTo answer (1) we first analyze the maximum error of the similarity matrix computed by LCN in comparison to regular Nystr\u00f6m in (a) a uniformly distributed data model and (b) a clustered data model. We then use the result by Altschuler et al. 2019 to relate these bounds to bounds for the final Sinkhorn approximation.\nTo answer (2) we only need to slightly modify the bound by Dvurechensky et al. 2018 to show that both sparse Sinkhorn and LCN-Sinkhorn have the same convergence rate bound as regular Sinkhorn.\n\n## Ad 2) Streamlined text\nWe tried to make the paper more coherent by improving the introduction and integrating the section on enhanced OT in the graph transport network section, for which these are an important component.\n\nAd 2a) We agree and have mostly removed this part of the motivation.\n\nAd 2b) LCN-Sinkhorn performing better than full Sinkhorn on word embedding alignment is most likely due to regularization effects caused by the approximation, which lead to better generalization. The original method used by Grave et al. 2019 performs Sinkhorn on an iteratively increasing, randomly sampled subset of the embeddings. Our experiments clearly show that this approach is far from ideal. We have added these explanations to the paper.\n\n_All_ figures and tables in the paper show standard deviations, thus the significance of our results is clearly marked. Furthermore, please note that as opposed to previous works we don\u2019t just show results on some potentially cherry-picked datasets but make the effort of fully integrating our approximations in a pipeline and evaluate end-to-end real-world performance. \n\nAd 2c) We have restructured the text to make this figure\u2019s description more prominent."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3231/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3231/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Warpspeed Computation of Optimal Transport, Graph Distances, and Embedding Alignment", "authorids": ["~Johannes_Klicpera1", "marten.lienen@in.tum.de", "~Stephan_G\u00fcnnemann1"], "authors": ["Johannes Klicpera", "Marten Lienen", "Stephan G\u00fcnnemann"], "keywords": ["Optimal transport", "sinkhorn distance", "locality sensitive hashing", "nystr\u00f6m method", "graph neural networks", "embedding alignment"], "abstract": "Optimal transport (OT) is a cornerstone of many machine learning tasks.

The corresponding approach is amenable to differentiation and can be used as a building block in different architectures. Numerical experiments in several settings are performed to compare  the proposed approach with existing ones and demonstrate its scalability.\n\nEvaluation:\nI believe the proposed framework is a valuable contribution in terms of practical performance and wide list of applications where OT could not be used before because of the high computational cost. So, I would recommend accepting this paper. \n\nPros:\n1. High scalability of the proposed approach and linear up to log factors in dimension complexity.\n2. Flexibility of the framework due to a combination of sparse and low-rank approximations, which are complementary to each other.\n\nCons:\n1. Some parts of the paper seem to be not clear for a general audience.\n\na. First page. $n$ is undefined.\n\nb. First paragraph of Sect. 2. What is \"set of embeddings\"?\n\nc. Last but one paragraph on p.2. $d$ is not defined.\n\nd. In (1) $F$ stands for the Frobenius product, does it?\n\ne. Proposition 1. $N$ is not defined.\n\nf. First paragraph of Sect. 5. What is \"OT with multiple heads\"?\n\ng. What is meant as embedding?\n\nh. In the experiments, what is used as the cost function to define the Sinkhorn kernel $K$? If this is an $L_2$ distance, the convolutions can be used to accelerate the standard Sinkhorn and it would be nice to see the comparisons with convolutional Sinkhorn, which is also log linear.\n\ni. Appendix A. $B,r,b$ are not defined when they are first used.\n\nj. In (17), how was the last equality obtained?\n\nk. In (19), (20), how were the first equalities obtained?\n\nl. Appendix E, first paragraph. What is \"log-sum-exp trick\"?\n\nm. Appendix G. What is \"similarity matrix\"?\n\n2. As far as I understood, the proposed approach is not amenable to parallel computations on GPU as opposed to standard Sinkhorn.\n\n\nMinor comments\n1. Maybe it is too strong to state in the abstract that this is the first log-linear time algorithm given that when the Sinkhorn kernel corresponds to a convolution, the Sinkhorn's algorithm is log-linear by using the FFT.\n2. Bibliographical note. (Altschuler et al., 2017) did not show $1/\\varepsilon^2$ bound for the Greenkhorn. Their bound for Greenkhorn is the same $1/\\varepsilon^3$ as for the Sinkhorn. The bound for Sinkhorn was improved to $1/\\varepsilon^2$ in http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/dvurechensky18a.html and the bound for Greenkhorn was improved to $1/\\varepsilon^2$ in http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/lin19a.html.\n3. Bibliographical note. Quadratic regularization for OT was proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08200.\n4. Appendix A. I believe that in this framework a general value of the regularization parameter $\\lambda$ is used. If it is the case, then the number of Sinkhorn iterations to find an $\\varepsilon$-solution to the regularized problem is $1/(\\varepsilon \\lambda)$. This follows from http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/dvurechensky18a.html Theorem 1 and an estimate for $R$ in Lemma 1. The bound $1/\\varepsilon^2$ corresponds to finding an $\\varepsilon$-solution for the non-regularized problem. In this case one has to set $\\lambda=\\varepsilon/(4 \\ln n)$, which may be too small.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3231/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3231/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Warpspeed Computation of Optimal Transport, Graph Distances, and Embedding Alignment", "authorids": ["~Johannes_Klicpera1", "marten.lienen@in.tum.de", "~Stephan_G\u00fcnnemann1"], "authors": ["Johannes Klicpera", "Marten Lienen", "Stephan G\u00fcnnemann"], "keywords": ["Optimal transport", "sinkhorn distance", "locality sensitive hashing", "nystr\u00f6m method", "graph neural networks", "embedding alignment"], "abstract": "Optimal transport (OT) is a cornerstone of many machine learning tasks.

LCN-Sinkhorn enables GTN to achieve this while still scaling log-linearly in the number of nodes.", "one-sentence_summary": "We propose the locally corrected Nystr\u00f6m (LCN) method for kernels, develop two fast approximations of entropy-regularized optimal transport (sparse Sinkhorn and LCN-Sinkhorn) and evaluate them for embedding alignment and graph distance regression.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "klicpera|warpspeed_computation_of_optimal_transport_graph_distances_and_embedding_alignment", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c79b4e1d32703ddeffd0da7752812896b93485f9.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/789d60b05160bb7cfb43897e75a7a1fe26aefa04.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=P0RZoBqGXC", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nklicpera2021warpspeed,\ntitle={Warpspeed Computation of Optimal Transport, Graph Distances, and Embedding Alignment},\nauthor={Johannes Klicpera and Marten Lienen and Stephan G{\\\"u}nnemann},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=AM0PBmqmojH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
