Thanks a lot for pointing out the references on iterative classification. ICA is indeed a powerful baseline that we have not considered previously and it compares favorably against some of the other baselines. We have put the code to reproduce the ICA baseline experiments on Github: https://github.com/tkipf/ica (the implementation is largely based on https://github.com/sskhandle/Iterative-Classification with some adaptions for the setting considered in our paper).\n\n2) In Appendix B, we have added experiments on how classification performance is influenced by model depth (i.e. number of layers used). We have also introduced a model variant that uses residual connections to help alleviate some of the issues that arise when introducing additional layers. It is important to note that with every added layer, the effective context of each node can substantially increase (by the size of its k-th order neighborhood for a model with k layers) and therefore training of deeper models can become challenging (in addition to depth-related issues like vanishing gradients).\n\n3) We have updated the related works section with additional comments on how our method relates to previous work on neural networks for graphs.\n\nBelow a few more comments on how our approach relates to Duvenaud et al. 2015 and Li et al. 2016:\n\nDuvenaud et al. 2015 consider classification of graphs with narrow node degree distributions (e.g. graphs with nodes that only have a maximum of 5 neighbors) and introduce a specialized architecture for this case where they assign node-degree specific weight matrices. For graphs with very wide node degree distributions (such as citation networks) this becomes impractical. In our work we instead use an appropriate normalization of the adjacency matrix to deal with varying node degrees and share weights over all locations in the graph (irrespective of node degree).\n\nLi et al. 2016 use an RNN-based approach with weight sharing across layers which requires a fixed node state size. Following the formulation in their paper, this would require, e.g., to have at least a 3,703-dim hidden state for the Citeseer dataset (as every node has a 3,703-dim initial feature vector), which can be impractical. Of course, one could imagine a hybrid approach where weights are shared over some layers but not all.\n\nAs a final note: we have recently released the source code for our model on Github: https://github.com/tkipf/gcn"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks", "abstract": "We present a scalable approach for semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data that is based on an efficient variant of convolutional neural networks which operate directly on graphs.

The algorithm is simple and training seems easy. Concerning the originality, the proposed algorithm is a simple adaptation of graph convolutional networks (ref Defferrard 2016 in the paper) to a semi-supervised transductive setting. This is clearly mentioned in the paper, but the authors could better highlight the differences and novelty wrt this reference paper. Also, there is no comparison with the family of iterative classifiers, which usually compare favorably, both in performance and training time, with regularization based approaches, although they are mostly used in inductive settings. Below are some references for this family of methods.\n\nThe authors mention that more complex filters could be learned by stacking layers but they limit their architecture to one hidden layer. They should comment on the interest of using more layers for graph classification.\n\n\nSome references on iterative classification Qing Lu and Lise Getoor. 2003. Link-based classification.

In one propagation step, what the model does can be simplified as, first linearly transform the node representations for each node, and then multiply the transformed node representations with the normalized affinity matrix (with self-connections added), and then pass through nonlinearity.\n\nThis model is used for semi-supervised learning on graphs, and in the experiments it demonstrated quite impressive results compared to other baselines, outperforming them by a significant margin.  The evaluation of propagation model is also interesting, where different variants of the model and design decisions are evaluated and compared.\n\nIt is surprising that such a simple model works so much better than all the baselines.  Considering that the model used is just a two-layer model in most experiments, this is really surprising as a two-layer model is very local, and the output of a node can only be affected by nodes in a 2-hop neighborhood, and no longer range interactions can play any roles in this.  Since computation is quite efficient (sec. 6.3), I wonder if adding more layers helped anything or not.\n\nEven though motivated from graph convolutions, when simplified as the paper suggests, the operations the model does are quite simple.  Compared to Duvenaud et al. 2015 and Li et al. 2016, the proposed method is simpler and does almost strictly less things.  So how would the proposed GCN compare against these methods?\n\nOverall I think this model is simple, but the connection to graph convolutions is interesting, and the experiment results are quite good.

For CPU/GPU benchmarking we used a two-layer model with 32 hidden units, i.e. similar to the models used in the other experiments on Citeseer, Cora, Pubmed and NELL. The speed-up on GPU (vs. CPU) was roughly 3-fold in these experiments. In our implementation, we used TensorFlow\u2019s sparse-dense matrix multiplications whenever applicable (e.g. for multiplication with the sparse adjacency matrix). These operations typically don\u2019t benefit from being evaluated on the GPU (see https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/api_docs/python/sparse_ops.html#sparse_tensor_dense_matmul for rough speed comparisons). Larger models (more layers or hidden units) will most likely see a bigger GPU speed-up.\n\nSo, in summary, the small GPU speed-up observed in our experiments can be explained both by the extensive use of sparse-dense matrix multiplications and by the comparatively small model size.\n\nWe updated the paper with additional information on the hyperparameter settings used in the CPU/GPU benchmarking experiments."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks", "abstract": "We present a scalable approach for semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data that is based on an efficient variant of convolutional neural networks which operate directly on graphs.
