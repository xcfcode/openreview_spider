The specific case of restricting the inputs to a line segment allows performing verification of robustness exactly (Exact-line approach, NeurIPS'19). The authors extend this work and apply it to verify robustness of some VAE and BEGAN like models.\n\nPositive aspects:\n- Rigorous work, I did not spot much typos.\u00a0\n- First proofs given for generative models.\n\nNegative aspects:\n\nMy main concern about this work is that the presentation is not didactic enough. \n- From the beginning, key concepts are not clearly defined, such as network certification, specification, and the \"verification problem\". In the definition of robustness, a reference to a \"safe set of outputs\", as in Gehr et al. would help the understanding.\n- The introduction is too short and lacks context. Figure 1 is not referred\u00a0in the text and is not understandable with notations that are not yet introduced.\u00a0\n- Then follows without transition two pages of background that are mostly definitions but without\u00a0a proper motivation, these are difficult to process.\n- The work, an extension of the Exact-line approach, only gives a 5 lines description which is not insufficient to understand the approach.\u00a0\n\nPerhaps my assessment is too negative because I am unfamiliar with the certification literature, but since the work present applications in generative modeling, I think it should be understandable by readers from this background as well.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nMinor:\nof of in caption of Fig 2\nlast line of page 5: J -> j\nI found the equivalence sign in the last equation of page 6 confusing, is it really supposed to be an equivalence here?\u00a0\nPage 6 : attribute detector... described below -> in appendix\n\nAfter seeing the authors changes in the manuscript the paper does look better, but similarly to Reviewer 2 I still judge it difficult to understand.

We will answer in two parts.\n\nQ1.1: It is not clear to me why the attribute consistency score, a key component in the paper, is a good measure of consistency in generative models. Notably, I miss motivation for why linear interpolations between encoded inputs should necessarily keep the attribute stable.\n\nThere have been a wealth of papers that propose autoencoder/generative model systems that claim that linear interpolations produce \"interpretable\" results [1-11]. It is in fact possible that not all defined attributes for a dataset should be preserved under \"interpretable\" interpolations. For example, interpolating between a person with only a beard and the same person with only a mustache would likely fail to satisfy the disjunctive attribute \"no beard or no mustache.\" However, for many attributes we do expect intuitively consistency along interpolations between examples with those attributes, such as \"has blond hair.\" One can examine the named attributes provided with CelebA to decide whether they should remain consistent among interpolations (we believe they should).\n\nInterestingly, this brings up the important point that deciding whether an attribute should correspond to a direction in the encoded representation for a dataset is likely a subjective question. We do not claim to answer this. Rather, our system attempts to verify this for a given dataset and given property.\n\nQ1.2: Especially, why is an attribute considered consistent if it is stable to linear interpolations in the latent space? \n\nWe clarify that we do not measure the consistency of an attribute in vacuum, but with respect to a particular autoencoder. An attribute which is consistent for one autoencoder might very well be inconsistent for another autoencoder, and this is not a judgement on the consistency of the attribute as much as it is a judgement on the consistency of the autoencoder.\n\n[1] Vincent Dumoulin, Ishmael Belghazi, Ben Poole, Olivier Mastropietro, Alex Lamb, Martin Arjovsky, and Aaron Courville.

We can also certainly include experiments comparing different auxiliary classifiers.  However, we note that the goal of our experimental section is to highlight the performance of our certification method and didactically demonstrate the variety of properties it is capable of certifying, and not to make claims about the full performance of models. Our hope is that our system might be used as yet another tool to evaluate these systems, rather than as a definitive answer to the superiority of any system at the moment.\n\nQ2.1: Did you perform any experiments on how the L1 score of the auxiliary classifier affects the consistency score? I would also like to see some quantitative numbers on the auxiliary classifier.\n\nDo you mean F1 Score?  We note that our contribution is to the efficiency of a technique for certifying models and not a judgement on whether the models are actually quality models. However, we would be happy to run such tests and include scores for any (relu) models that you think would be of interest to the community.\n\nQ2.3: Similarly, I would like to see some numbers on the quality of the encoder/decodes. Simply inspecting the interpolations in figure 3) the reconstructions seem quite blurry, likely due to the relatively small models used. Is it prohibitively expensive to run the proposed method on bigger models (e.g. ResNet based encoder/decoders or Unet-style models)?\n\nIt is true that our system is somewhat size-limited, but more relevantly to the models mentioned, our system is currently limited to feed-forward connections. While this is a practical limitation and not a theoretical limitation (DiffAI and ERAN can both handle recurrent connections), the non-convexity of the domain would mean that such connections would introduce multiplicatively many overapproximations. Specifically, n convex components (line segments or boxes) from a previous layer added to m convex components from a downstream layer would produce n*m boxes. While it is an interesting future research objective to optimize this case, it is out of the scope of this work.\n\nHowever, we would be happy to run our system on any feed-forward relu models, within an order of magnitude of the size we have shown, for any papers that you would like (especially if code is available).\n\nQ2.4: I believe it would be more informative to show the actual confidence intervals in figure 2b) instead of only the width of the confidence intervals?\n\nThe purpose of Figure 2b is only to demonstrate the relative performance of the different certification techniques. The confidence interval width does not refer to an estimate on the correct output of these methods, but to the comparable property of the output of these methods themselves. We are happy to put the actual confidence intervals in the appendix, but for HZono, Sampling, and Exact, these would be almost entirely vacuous (as the confidence interval widths are so large), and for ApproxLine it would be indistinguishable from a line in the middle of the graph, which we worry would be a confusing visualization to have in the main body when comparing certification methods.\n\nQ3: I found it quite challenging to understand how the proposed is implemented in practice - My suggestion is that the authors add a pseudo-code / algorithm to section 3 clarifying exactly how the bounds reported in the experimental section are calculated.\n\nWe have updated the paper to include pseudocode and have added an overview which explains our methods at a high level (we already updated the overview).

We will gladly incorporate your suggestions to reduce our reliance on terms and knowledge from abstract interpretation, and have included pseudocode so that our techniques can be understood in isolation.  As probabilistic abstract interpretation has proved a powerful framework for probabilistic bound inference in the program analysis community, we felt that it would be an important contribution on its own to describe a usage for the machine learning community.\n\nOn the significance over ExactLine:  providing fast and sound overapproximations to exact methods is known to be non-trivial, and certainly publishable (see [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]). While abstracting exact domains to less precise domains (sets of boxes) is a well known technique, the decision of whether, where, when, and what to approximate has no definitive answer. In the case of restrictions to lines, we found that for larger networks, to be significantly more performant than simply sampling (as can be seen in Figure 2 and Section 4.2), over-approximation of ExactLine was absolutely necessary. The design of our core novel contribution, a heuristic for the parts of ExactLine to approximate, turned out to be both a delicate and a critical problem. We tested quite a few seemingly obvious heuristics, such as clustering ExactLine edges using k-means (both in the original dimensional space and projected to single dimensions in various ways) before determining the necessity of ensuring connectedness between the nodes in each approximation cluster (which turned out to be the best heuristic, and the one we present). We will update the paper to mention these other options.\n\n[1] Singh Gagandeep, Gehr Timon, P\u00fcschel Markus, Vechev Martin. Boosting Robustness Certification of Neural Networks.

As this is the first time this method was introduced in this context, the presentation was not perfectly accessible, even though all definitions required to technically understand our work are present.\n\nBecause of this, we will work very hard on improving the presentation -- we have already updated the overview to provide for a more intuitive presentation. We will update the introduction and the paper to provide even more intuition and simplify our presentation by shifting some of the terms to appendix, explaining them less formally in the text, and reduce the overhead needed to understand key concepts.\n\n[1] Singh Gagandeep, Gehr Timon, P\u00fcschel Markus, and Vechev Martin.

The authors defines attribute consistency by 1) mapping pairs of input (x1, x2) with matching attribute to a latent space using an encoder n_E(x) and 2) measuring how correctly an auxiliary classifier will classify the known attribute using (decoded) linear interpolations between the two latent encodings. Importantly, the proposed method gives guaranteed bounds on this consistency score, as opposed to simply evaluating the classifier on a fixed set uniformly sampled points between x1 and x2. In experiments the authors use their method to test for attribute independence as well as consistency under left-right flipping of an image using two different autoencoder models (VAE and CycleAE) obtaining tighter bounds on the \u2018attribute consistency\u2019 score than competing methods.  \n\nDecision & supporting arguments:\nConceptually I found the paper very appealing, and it tackles an important problem in generative modelling. However I have some concerns with respect to the paper in its current state:\n1) It is not clear to me why the attribute consistency score, a key component in the paper, is a good measure of consistency in generative models. Notably, I miss motivation for why linear interpolations between encoded inputs should necessarily keep the attribute stable.\n2) Although I found the experiments interesting, I did not find the experimental section completely comprehensive. There is no discussion or experiments probing the dependency on the quality of the auxiliary classifier or the encoder/decoder model used. \n3) I did not find the description of the proposed method to be reasonably self-contained. Especially section 3 which describes the proposed method is challenging to follow. The background material in section 2 reads very much like a set of definitions. Since ICLR has a quite broad audience, I think the paper should be written in a more pedagogical way, with for instance clarifying examples. An example of a sentence that is incredibly hard to parse is on page 4, describing domain lifting: \u201cAny deterministic abstract domain can be directly interpreted as a probabilistic abstract domain, where the concretization of an element is given as the set of probability measures whose support is a subset of the set produced by the deterministic concretization.\u201d I think making this paper more pedagogical requires major rewriting.\n\nDue to the above reasons I currently score the paper as a \u2018weak reject\u2019.\n\nFurther detailed questions/comments:\nConsistency Score\nQ1: What is the motivation behind the definition of the consistency attribute score. Especially, why is an attribute considered consistent if it is stable to linear interpolations in the latent space? \n\nExperiment Results:\nQ2.1: Did you perform any experiments on how the L1 score of the auxiliary classifier affects the consistency score? I would also like to see some quantitative numbers on the auxiliary classifier.\nQ2.2: Why is the L1 score used for training the classifier instead of bernoulli which seems more natural for binary attributes?\nQ2.3: Similarly, I would like to see some numbers on the quality of the encoder/decodes. Simply inspecting the interpolations in figure 3) the reconstructions seem quite blurry, likely due to the relatively small models used. Is it prohibitively expensive to run the proposed method on bigger models (e.g. ResNet based encoder/decoders or Unet-style models)?\nQ2.4: I believe it would be more informative to show the actual confidence intervals in figure 2b) instead of only the width of the confidence intervals?\n\nReadability:\nQ3: I found it quite challenging to understand how the proposed is implemented in practice - My suggestion is that the authors add a pseudo-code / algorithm to section 3 clarifying exactly how the bounds reported in the experimental section are calculated. \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2192/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2192/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Verification of Generative-Model-Based Visual Transformations", "authors": ["Matthew Mirman", "Timon Gehr", "Martin Vechev"], "authorids": ["matthew.mirman@inf.ethz.ch", "timon.gehr@inf.ethz.ch", "martin.vechev@inf.ethz.ch"], "keywords": ["robustness certification", "formal verification", "robustness analysis", "latent space interpolations"], "TL;DR": "We verify deterministic and probabilistic properties of neural networks using non-convex relaxations over visible transformations specified by generative models", "abstract": "Generative networks are promising models for specifying visual transformations.

It is a nonconvex relaxation, therefore it is able to capture the nonconvexity of neural networks. APPROXLINE is applied to generative models to verify the consistency of image attributes through linear interpolations on the latent variables. \n\nTo me, the most significant part is that the proposed approach has the potential to become a reliable metric for evaluating whether a generator disentangles latent representations, as long as a reliable attribute classifier can be trained. I would suggest the authors to emphasize this part in their future versions.\n\nHowever, the current version is quite difficult for me to understand, and I guess it is difficult for a broad range of audiences without background in program analysis. Somehow I think the same message can be conveyed better without abusing terms from abstract interpretation. I would also suggest the authors to reduce such abuse of notations. At least, pseudocode could be provided. \n\nAs a result, I cannot give a confident judgement about whether the contribution of this paper is significant given the existence of EXACTLINE. Still, I tend to accept this paper for its potential to become a good metric for generative models.
