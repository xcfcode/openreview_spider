The research on the optimal learning of distributed learning is a fast-growing field. In this paper, we mainly focus on the distributed learning with random features, thus the single distributed learning may be ignored. In the rebuttal revision, we have added the reference [Optimal Distributed Learning with Multi-pass Stochastic Gradient Methods, ICML 2018] after the multi-pass SGD in page 1, added the reference about the distributed spectral algorithms [JMLR 2018, 19(1): 1069-1097] in page 2, and added other references [arXiv:1906.04870, JMLR 2020, 21(147): 1-63; Random design analysis of ridge regression, 2012 COLT; On the sample complexity of subspace learning, NeurIPS 2013; On the error of random Fourier features, UAI 2015;  Optimal Rates for Random Fourier Features, NeurIPS 2015] in the appropriate locations.  Thanks for your suggestions.\n\nExperiments on simulated datasets and real dataset (MINIST) have been provided to validate our theoretical findings. We will add more numerical results on different datasets to further exemplify the performance of the algorithm in the final version. In fact, we are doing experiments now, and hoping we can have the numerical results during the discussion phases. Thanks for your suggestion.\n\nAccording to Theorem 1,2,3, to guarantee the optimal rates, the regularization parameter $\\lambda$ should be around $|\\mathcal{D}|^{-1/2}$, thus in this paper, we consider using the 5-fold cross validation to fine-tune the $\\lambda$, the tuned set is $\\{2^{-5}|\\mathcal{D}|^{-1/2},2^{-3}|\\mathcal{D}|^{-1/2},\\ldots,2^5|\\mathcal{D}|^{-1/2}\\}$. Please refer to the detail in the first part of page 8. Because of using the 5-fold cross validation in selecting the optimal $\\lambda$, the computational complexity should be enlarged. However, it should be noted that even for the plain methods, tuning the optimal $\\lambda$ is also required, which will enlarge the computational complexity as well.

In (Rudi \\& Rosasco, 2017), they show that the optimal generalization bounds of KRR can be derived requiring only $O(\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{D}|})$ random features in the basic setting, as one can see that $M=\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{D}|}\\ll|\\mathcal{D}|$,  so the total computational complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(M^2|\\mathcal{D}|)$. Thus, the computational bottleneck in learning with random Fourier features to guarantee the optimal generalization performance not only depends on the size of random features, but also on the size of dataset. If we don't consider reducing the size of $\\mathcal{D}$, the computational complexity is $|\\mathcal{D}|^2$ in the basic setting, which is not suitable for large scale problems. Thus, how to reduce the size of $\\mathcal{D}$ is a key problem to further improve the effectiveness for optimal learning rates;\n\n(2) Distributed learning is one of the most popular methods to reduce the size of dataset. The distributed learning bring the distributed error, but can decrease the variance of the model (See Proposition 1 in appendix or Zhang et al., 2013, 2015, or Li et al., 2019a). Thus, how to choose an appropriate number of partitions to trade off the distributed error and the variance to guarantee the optimal performance is a very interesting and significant direction. In this paper, we prove that the optimal learning rate in expectation is shown to achieve by relaxing the requirement on the number of partitions from $O(1)$ (Li et al., 2019a) to $O(|\\mathcal{D}|^{0.5})$ in the basic setting (Theorem 1), so we can reduce the computational complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{D}|^2)$ (plain KRR with random features) to $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{D}|^{1.5})$. From (Rudi \\& Rosasco, 2017; Rudi et al., 2018), we can further reduce the size of random features by generating in a data-dependent manner under some more stricter conditions (Theorem 3 in Rudi \\& Rosasco, 2017). However, in this case, the item $|\\mathcal{D}|$ has no change, and even become more dominate in total computational complexity. If combining our results (see Theorem 4,5,6 in appendix) with the data-dependent manner-based random features (Rudi \\& Rosasco, 2017) under some more stricter conditions, we can reduce the size of random features and increase the partitions at the same time (see Remark 4 in appendix).\n\n(3) Moreover, when combining the distributed learning, random features and the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG), we can further speed up the KRR (see in Remark 3), which may open a path to reach the linear time complexity for optimal learning rate in the basic setting.\n\nOverall, the distributed setting for random features is a very interesting and significant direction for large scale kernel-based method.

It studies optimal learning rates of the generalization bounds both in expectation and in probability. In the case of DKRR with random features, the optimal learning rate in expectation is shown to achieve by relaxing the requirement on the number of partitions from $O(1)$ (Li et al., 2019a) to $O(|D|^{0.5})$ (Theorem 1). Within the same setup of random features, the number of partitions is relaxed to $O(|D|^{0.25})$ guaranteeing optimal generalization performance in probability (Theorem 2). The latter bound $O(|D|^{0.25})$ on partition count is much smaller then $O(|D|^{0.5})$. However, as proved in Theorem 3, allowing multiple communication rounds in DKRR-RF, up to $O(|D|^{0.5})$ partitions can be handled depending on the number of communication rounds. In other words, it can exploit more partitions at the cost of more communication rounds.\n\nThe idea of DKRR with random features and communications is a combination of DKRR with random features studied in (Li et al., 2019a) and DKRR with communications studied in (Lin et al., 2020). It seems that the communication strategy and Algorithm 1 presented in section 3 are adaptations from (Lin et al., 2020) handling random feature, which should be properly mentioned and credited.\n\nDuring the comparison with (Lin et al., 2020), it is mentioned that the letter work required communicating local data $D_j$ among partition nodes. However, I failed to spot it in (Lin et al., 2020), and instead found similar steps of Algorithm 1 in section 2.3 of (Lin et al., 2020), where only gradient information is communicated.

The main idea is to sample M random Fourier features and split the data into m chunks. Each chunk is processed on a separate machine that outputs a linear hypothesis using the sampled M random features. The hypotheses coming from different machines are then aggregated on the master machine via importance weighting. In particular, each hypothesis is assigned importance weight proportional to its data chunk size (see Eq. 3). The regularization parameter is fixed across different machines. The main contribution of the work is a consistency bound. In comparison to a previous bound on the divide & conquer algorithm (Li et al., arXiv 2019), this one does not require a constant number of machines (in my understanding of the related work section).\n\n##### clarity\nThe paper is clear and easy to follow. I would say that the related work is fairly well covered and the contributions are appropriately placed in this regard.\n\n##### quality & significance\nI have a fundamental disagreement when it comes to the considered distributed setting. In particular, the bottleneck in learning with random Fourier features is not the size of the dataset but the number of features. The computational complexity is linear in the dataset size and cubic in the number of features. Moreover, there are examples of machine learning problems where it is required to use a huge number of features for satisfactory results (e.g., see Kernel Approximation Methods for Speech Recognition, May et al.). Thus, I do not see this direction as significant. After all, the algorithm improves over variable amounting to linear computational complexity. What would be interesting is to use different sets of random features on different machines and then aggregate on the master machine. In that way, one would be tackling the factor contributing to cubic computational complexity.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1362/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1362/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Effective Distributed Learning with Random Features: Improved Bounds and Algorithms", "authorids": ["liuyonggsai@ruc.edu.cn", "liujiankun@iie.ac.cn", "sq.wang@siat.ac.cn"], "authors": ["Yong Liu", "Jiankun Liu", "Shuqiang Wang"], "keywords": ["Risk bound", "statistical learning theory", "kernel methods"], "abstract": "In this paper, we study the statistical properties of distributed kernel ridge regression together with random features (DKRR-RF), and obtain optimal generalization bounds under the basic setting, which can substantially relax the restriction on the number of local machines in the existing state-of-art bounds.

Specifically, we first show that the simple combination of divide-and-conquer technique and random features can achieve the same statistical accuracy as the exact KRR in expectation requiring only $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{D}|)$ memory and $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{D}|^{1.5})$ time. Then, beyond the generalization bounds in expectation that demonstrate the average information for multiple trails, we derive generalization bounds in probability to capture the learning performance for a single trail. Finally, we propose an effective communication strategy to further improve the performance of DKRR-RF, and validate the theoretical bounds via numerical experiments.", "one-sentence_summary": "This papaer focuses on the studies of  the statistical properties of distributed KRR together with random features", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "liu|effective_distributed_learning_with_random_features_improved_bounds_and_algorithms", "supplementary_material": "", "pdf": "/pdf/79a6a49d47bc7c0250c2c92272851fefc0880cb6.pdf", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Poster", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nliu2021effective,\ntitle={Effective Distributed Learning with Random Features: Improved Bounds and Algorithms},\nauthor={Yong Liu and Jiankun Liu and Shuqiang Wang},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=jxdXSW9Doc}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
