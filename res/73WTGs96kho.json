Nazabal, Alfredo, et al. \"Handling incomplete heterogeneous data using vaes.\" Pattern Recognition (2020)*__\n\nEarly experiments with the method of Shavitt & Segal (using their own code) showed results that were substantially inferior and we decided to not pursue deeper exploration of their method.

In particular, the categorical/tabular variables in each of the dataset considered is extremely small: just 1 for 4 datasets and 4,6 for the two additional datasets. Thus, the setting considered is mostly non-tabular in the categorical sense of the word. Moreover, the one-hot encoding they use to cope with tabular data, while reasonable for a small number of such variables, is less so when the domain has many categorical variables.\n\n__*Page 1, para 2, \"Moreover,...multi-modal data,...is problematic\": How does Net-DNF handle multi-modal data (e.g., \"medical records and images\")? Would it simply encode an image as a vector of bits and stack it in input x?*__\n\nWe believe that our work is a step toward the ultimate goal of being able to fuse tabular data on which neural network perform poorly and other types of data (e.g. images) where NNs are the natural champions. One can envision a Net-DNF that parallels, for example a convolution network, where both representations are merged, perhaps fortified with mutual attention, and then classified/regressed using a couple of fully connected layers.  The crucial point is that such a setting allows for joined, end-to-end optimization of both modalities together.\n\n__*Page 1, para 2, \"GBDTs...hard to scale\": How scalable is Net-DNF?

Net-DNF nets are similar to standard neural networks in that effective  optimization is carried via batches and methods like SGD. The effectiveness of this combination to learn strong models from huge datasets. \n\nfrom the paper: \"Scaling up the gradient boosting models was addressed by several papers (Ye et al., 2009; Tyree et al., 2011; Fu et al., 2019; Vasiloudis et al., 2019).

Why do you decide to modify the constant from 1.0 to 1.5, you suggested in the Appendix that \"the AND gate will be closer to 1\", but the OR gate will be affected, right? Then OR(0,0,0,1) = tanh(0.5) = 0.4, which is pushed away from 1. I believe there are some trade-offs for this hyperparameter, how do you decide it should be 1.5 rather than other numbers, do you have supporting evidence for your decision?*__\n\nIt is indeed likely that the value of the bias term has certain tradeoffs. Early on in our study we reasoned that it makes sense to emphasize the case of AND(1,1,...,1) and (arbitrarily) fixed it to 1.5 without further optimization (we realized that it can potentially hurt cases  like OR(1,0,0,...) and also AND(1,1,1,-1) = tanh(-5)). While we believe that this bias constant is not critical (because the first layer is trainable and can in principle compensate for any fixed bias term), in retrospect this was not a good choice due to symmetry arguments (and it justifiably raises doubts/questions like yours). At this stage it will be impossible for us  to repeat the entire empirical study with bias=1 in reasonable time, but we can add a quick examination that shows that results aren\u2019t too sensitive on average to this constant.\n\n__*In your feature selection part, the  is a learnable parameter to control the sparsity of the selected feature. You propose to achieve this by using the elastic net regularization. Is the trainable mask  shared among all the DNNF blocks or is it specific to a certain DNNF block?*__\n\n$w_t$ is specific to each block (we will clarify this).\n\n__*In your experiment table 1, some results from FCN are shown to cause OOM. I kind of get the idea that DNNF uses a more compact parameterization, but not entirely sure how it quantitatively compare with FCN. What is the parameter complexity for DNNF? Could you give a more formal explanation about why it's more compact?*__\n\nThe OOM was encountered when the DNF structure was replaced by a three hidden layer FCN. A fair comparison is obtained by defining the widths of the FCN layers in accordance with the widths in the Net-DNF with the given number of formulas (see Tables 1&2). To see the parameter complexity advantage of DNNF observe that in the pure DNNF block, only the first layer (which creates affine \u201cliterals\u201d or features) is trainable. If d is the input dimension and we consider m literals, the difference is O(dm) for DNNF vs O(dm + m^2) for the corresponding FCN.\n\n__*In table 3, some of the experimental results are better than XGBOOST and some are worse. I can understand that the current DNNF has not yet achieved the same performance as XGBOOST as XGBOOST has always been a go-to algorithm for tabular data. But could you explain why DNNF is much better than GAS Concentrations, is it because of some properties of this dataset? And do you have a more high-level suggestion as to \"under what circumstances is DNNF likely to out-perform XGBOOST\", what could be the reason for that? Is it because of the better generalization of the neural network?*__\n\nThis is an interesting open question for further research. While the inductive biases of XGBoost and Net-DNF both rely on a weighted sum of logical formulas, there are still substantial differences. For example, the formulas we use are over linear separators and XGBoost relies on decision stumps. Another major difference is the training process (SGD vs. decision tree learning and boosting). The family of generating distributions for tabular classification tasks is large and the labeling mechanisms can be diverse from very simple (e.g., labels defined by a very simple function of few input features) to very complex (e.g.,  parity-like). Thus, it is indeed likely that some datasets are better aligned with one representation or the other, but we believe that a-priori identification of what will work better is going to be quite elusive.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1574/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1574/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Net-DNF: Effective Deep Modeling of Tabular Data", "authorids": ["~Liran_Katzir1", "~Gal_Elidan1", "~Ran_El-Yaniv1"], "authors": ["Liran Katzir", "Gal Elidan", "Ran El-Yaniv"], "keywords": ["Neural Networks", "Architectures", "Tabular Data", "Predictive Modeling"], "abstract": "A challenging open question in deep learning is how to handle tabular data.

As a result, the number of datasets is indeed limited because the computation we explored for the baselines, to ensure extra fairness. See details provided in the supplementary material (864 configurations for XGBoost, and 3300 configurations for FCNs).  We agree with the reviewer that log-loss isn\u2019t natural to interpret. But,  it is the maximum likelihood function applied to test data and captures the extent to which the model fits the data. Importantly, this is the conventional/suggested metric on many of these tasks (check the *Kaggle* instructions for the competitions, e.g., the Otto competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge/overview/evaluation).\n\n__*It is unclear whether adding the Net-DNF layers, in the ablation study, gives improvement due to simply an increase of model capacity or the specific architecture of Net-DNF.*__\n\nIn terms of model capacity/parameters, some of the FCNs we considered were substantially larger (see response to Reviewer 2), but still were far behind in terms of error performance. \n\n__*In Exp 7, why there is OOM despite removing additional layer ?*__\n\nSee response to Reviewer 2.\n\n__*The authors did not discuss a similar recent work: TabNet*__\n\nThanks for the comment. We were not aware of this paper. We will add the following paragraph: TabNet\u2019s paper also tackles the same problem, of providing a deep-learning based predictive model for tabular data comparative or superior to gradient boosting technique. The differences are in the technique used to reach this goal. TabNet uses an attention mechanism to induce sparsity/feature selection, while Net-DNF uses DNF formulas and elastic net regularization for feature selection.\n\n__*The authors need to include additional datasets similar to TabNet experiments*__\nWe will add  TabNets experiments to the paper. We ran Tabnet on some of our datasets using the PyTorch implementation (https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet).  Tabnet results were slightly inferior to the results we obtained for XGBoost. For example, for the Gas Concentrations we got 4.89 log-loss (vs 2.22 on XGBoost).\n\n__*In $R(m_t, m_s)$ I think there should not be a division by 2*__\n\nThis is how elastic net is derived and implemented.

The primary motivation of this paper is the simulation of DNF, which simulates the Boolean formulas in decision making. The DNF form can better capture the non-distributional nature of tabular data and somehow simulates with the decision-tree algorithms in a more soft-threshold way. The general idea makes sense to me and sounds novel compared to the existing literature. However, I still have some doubts and questions about the paper:\n1) In Sec 2.1, this soft approximation is a very critical part of the paper. Why do you decide to modify the constant from 1.0 to 1.5, you suggested in the Appendix that \"the AND gate will be closer to 1\", but the OR gate will be affected, right? Then OR(0,0,0,1) = tanh(0.5) = 0.4, which is pushed away from 1. I believe there are some trade-offs for this hyperparameter, how do you decide it should be 1.5 rather than other numbers, do you have supporting evidence for your decision? \n2) In your feature selection part, the $w_t$ is a learnable parameter to control the sparsity of the selected feature. You propose to achieve this by using the elastic net regularization. Is the trainable mask $w_t$ shared among all the DNNF blocks or is it specific to a certain DNNF block? \n3) In your experiment table 1, some results from FCN are shown to cause OOM. I kind of get the idea that DNNF uses a more compact parameterization, but not entirely sure how it quantitatively compare with FCN. What is the parameter complexity for DNNF? Could you give a more formal explanation about why it's more compact?\n4) In table 3, some of the experimental results are better than XGBOOST and some are worse. I can understand that the current DNNF has not yet achieved the same performance as XGBOOST as XGBOOST has always been a go-to algorithm for tabular data. But could you explain why DNNF is much better than GAS Concentrations, is it because of some properties of this dataset? And do you have a more high-level suggestion as to \"under what circumstances is DNNF likely to out-perform XGBOOST\", what could be the reason for that? Is it because of the better generalization of the neural network?\n\nTypo: \n2.4 Spacial Localization -> Spatial Localization\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1574/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1574/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Net-DNF: Effective Deep Modeling of Tabular Data", "authorids": ["~Liran_Katzir1", "~Gal_Elidan1", "~Ran_El-Yaniv1"], "authors": ["Liran Katzir", "Gal Elidan", "Ran El-Yaniv"], "keywords": ["Neural Networks", "Architectures", "Tabular Data", "Predictive Modeling"], "abstract": "A challenging open question in deep learning is how to handle tabular data.
