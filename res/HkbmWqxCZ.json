Ideally, optimization would consist of maximizing log p(x) - | I(x,z) - M |, where M is the user-specified target mutual information (MI) and I(x,z) is the model\u2019s current MI value, but I(x,z) is intractable, necessitating the use of an auxiliary model r(z|x).  Optimization, then, consists of alternating gradient ascent on the VAE parameters and r\u2019s parameters.  Experiments on simulations and text data are reported, showing that increasing M has the desired effect of allowing more deviation from the prior.  Specifically, this is shown through text generation where the sampled sentences become more varied as M is decreased and better reconstructed as M is increased.  \n\n\nEvaluation\n\nPros:  I like how this paper formalizes failure in representation learning as information loss in z---although the formulation is not particularly novel, i.e. [Zhao et al., ArXiv 2017]), and constructs an explicit, penalized objective to allow the user to specify the amount of information retained in z.  In my opinion, the proposed objective is more transparent than the objectives proposed by related work.  For instance, Chen et al.\u2019s (2017) Lossy VAE, while aiming to solve essentially the same problem, does so by parameterizing the prior and using a windowed decoder, but there is no explicit control mechanism as far as I\u2019m aware (except for how many parameters / window size).  Perhaps the Beta-VAE\u2019s [Higgins et al., ICLR 2017] KLD weight is similarly interpretable (as beta increases, less information is retained), but I like that M has the clear meaning of mutual information---whereas the beta in the Beta-VAE is just a Lagrangian.  In terms of experiments, I like the first simulation; it\u2019s a convincing sanity check.  As for the second, I like the spirit of it, but I have some criticisms, as I\u2019ll explain below.\n\nCons:  The method requires training an auxiliary model r(z|x) to estimate I(x,z).  While I don\u2019t find the introduction of r(z|x) problematic, I do wish there was more discussion and analysis of how well the mutual information is being approximated during training, especially given some of the simplifying assumptions, such as r(z|x)=p(z|x).  If the MI estimate is way off, that detracts from the method and makes an alternative like the Beta-VAE---which doesn\u2019t require an auxiliary model---more appealing, since what makes the MAE superior---its principled targeting of MI---does not hold in practice.\n\nAs for the movie review experiment, I find the sentence samples a bit anecdotal.  Was the seed sentence (\u201cthere are many great scenes of course\u201d) randomly chosen or hand picked?  Was this interpolation behavior typical?  I ask these questions because I find the plot in Figure 3 all but meaningless.  It\u2019s good that we see reconstruction quality go up as M increases, as expected, but the baseline VAE model is a strawman.  How does reconstruction percentage look for the Bowman et al. (2015) VAE?  What about the Beta-VAE?  Or Lossy VAE?  Figure 3 would be okay if there were more experiments, but as it is the only quantitative result, more work should have gone in to it.  For instance, a compelling result would be if we see one or more of the models above plateau in reconstruction percentage and the MAE surpass that plateau.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nWhile I found aspects of this paper interesting, I recommend rejection primarily for two reasons.  The first is that I would like to see how well the mutual information is being estimated during training.  If the estimate is way off, this makes the method less appealing as what I like about it---the interpretable MI target---is not really a \u2018target\u2019, in practice, and rather, is a rough hyperparameter similar to the Beta-VAE\u2019s beta term (which has the added benefit of no auxiliary model).  The second reason is the paper\u2019s weak experimental section.  The only quantitative result is Figure 3, and while it shows reconstruction percentage increases with M, there is no way to contextualize the number as the only comparison model is a weak VAE, which gives ~ 0%.  Questions I would like to see answered: How good is the MI estimate?  How close is the converged VAE to the target?  How does the model compare to the Bowman et al. VAE or the Beta-VAE?  (It would be quite compelling to show similar or improved performance without the training tricks used by Bowman et al.)  Can we somehow estimate the appropriate M directly from data (such as based on the entropy of training or validation set) in order to set the target rigorously?         \n\n\n1.  S. Zhao, J.

MAE aims to address the limitation of regular variational autoencoders (VAE) for latent representation learning \u2014 VAE sometimes simply ignores the latent code z, especially with a powerful decoding distribution. The idea of MAE is to optimize the VAE objective subject to a constraint on the mutual information between the data x and latent code z: setting the mutual information constraints larger will force the latent code z to learn a meaningful representation of the data. An approximation strategy is employed to approximate the intractable mutual information. Experimental results on both synthetic data and movie review data demonstrate the effectiveness of the MAEs.  \n\nOverall, the paper is well-written. The problem that VAEs fail to learn a meaningful representation is a well-known issue. This paper presents a simple, yet principled modification to the VAE objective to address this problem. I do, however, have two major concerns about the paper:\n\n1. The proposed idea to add a mutual information constraint between the data x and latent code z is a very natural fix to the failure of regular VAEs. However, mutual information itself is not a quantity that is easy to comprehend and specify. This is not like, e.g., l2 regularization parameter, for which there exists a relatively clear way to specify and tune. For mutual information, at least it is not clear to me, how much mutual information is \u201cenough\u201d and I am pretty sure it is model/data-dependent. To make it worse, there exist no metrics in representation learning for us to easily tune this mutual information constraint. It seems the only way to select the mutual information constraint is to qualitative inspect the model fits. This makes the method less practical. \n\n2. The approximation to the mutual information seems rather loose. If I understand correctly, the optimization of MAE is similar to that of a regular VAE, with an additional parametric model r_w(z|x) which is used to approximate the infomax bound. (And this also adds an additional term to the gradient wrt \\theta). r_w(z|x) is updated at the same time as \\theta, which means r_w(z|x) is quite far from being an optimal r* as it is intended, especially early during the optimization. Further more, all the derivation following Eq (12-13) are based on r* being optimal, while in reality, it is probably not even close. This makes the whole approximation quite hand-waving. \n\nRelated to 2, the discussion in Section 6 deserves more elaboration. It seems that having a flexible encoder is quite important, yet the authors only mention lightly that they use the approximate posterior from Cremer et al. (2017). Will MAE not work without this? How will VAE (without the mutual information constraint) work with this? A lot of the details seem to be glossed over. \n\nFurthermore, this work is also related to the deep variational information bottleneck of Alemi et al. 2017 (especially in the appendix they derived the VAE objective using information bottleneck principle). My intuition is that using a larger mutual information constraint in MAE is somewhat similar to setting the regularization \\beta to be smaller than 1 \u2014 both are making the approximating posterior more concentrated. I wonder if the authors have explored this idea. \n \n\nMinor comments:\n\n1. It would be more informative to include the running time in the presented results. \n\n2. Since the goal of r_w(z | x) is to approximate the posterior p(z | x), what about directly using q(z | x) to approximate it? \n\n3. In Algorithm 1, should line 14 and 15 be swapped? It seems samples are required in line 14 as well. \n\n4. Nitpicking: technically the model in Eq (1) is not a hierarchical model. \n\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Mutual Autoencoder: Controlling Information in Latent Code Representations", "abstract": "Variational autoencoders (VAE) learn probabilistic latent variable models by optimizing a bound on the marginal likelihood of the observed data.

Beyond providing a good density model a VAE model assigns to each data instance a latent code. In many applications, this latent code provides a useful high-level summary of the observation. However, the VAE may fail to learn a useful representation when the decoder family is very expressive. This is because maximum likelihood does not explicitly encourage useful representations and the latent variable is used only if it helps model the marginal distribution. This makes representation learning with VAEs unreliable. To address this issue, we propose a method for explicitly controlling the amount of information stored in the latent code.
