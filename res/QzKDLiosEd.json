In particular, the GPU is snooped using an off-the-shelf magnetic induction sensor which is placed along the power cable of the GPU. It turns out that under some assumptions (knowledge of GPU model and deep learning framework, knowledge of input size and ability to launch query of specific batch size), based on the correlation of the power consumption pattern of the GPU with the operations being performed it is possible to recognize the type of operation being performed as well as the respective hyper-parameters with very few errors.\n\n\n# Strengths:\nThe paper presents a very interesting and novel method for \"spying\" on the Neural Network being executed on a GPU by capturing the magnetic signal induced by the GPU's power consumption. A BiLSTM is employed to classify captured samplers of the magnetic signal to segments corresponding to specific steps/operations of the neural network. Then DNNs specific for each type of step are employed for estimating the hyper-parameters of each step. Consistency between the hyper-parameters is enforced by solving an integer-programming problem.\n\nThe proposed method is able to recover the entire structure of various types of neural networks (including randomly generated ones) and the parameters of each step with very few errors. The similarity of the reconstructed networks is evaluated under various metrics, including the performance of target and reconstructed networks on a classification task. An interesting application is the use of the method to build surrogate models for performing black-box adversarial attacks with very high success rates. Possible counter-measures are proposed and the limitations of the method are also discussed.\n\nThe paper is very well-written and easy to read. The evaluation is quite comprehensive showing the ability of the method to fully recover the architecture of various networks while further results and clarifications are provided in the supplemental material.\n\n\n# Weaknesses and Questions:\nSome interesting aspects are not completely covered. For example, although transferability to different hardware is discussed, still the sensitivity of the method with respect to some factors is not discussed. In particular, are there any calibration issues that should be taken into account? How does the method perform if a sensor of different make is used with possible different sampling rate? In what range of sampling rates/placement distances the method works? Regarding GPU transferability, are the GPU pairs of the same make, frequency settings, etc.?\n\nAdditionally, regarding the segmentation of the samples in steps, one would expect that some over-segmentation issues would be present. Are there any measures for enforcing temporal consistency and for avoiding over-segmentation, or it is not an issue because the samples are so unambiguous?\n\nRegarding the applicability of the proposed method, in real-world conditions it may not always be possible to define the input of the batch size. On this topic, more details can be provided on the strategy to be used to find a suitable batch size for the method to work. Additionally, the paper considers only networks acting as encoders. Would the method naturally extend to decoders or are there any difficulties/ambiguities introduced? Also the paper focuses on the inference task, can the method be applied also for training tasks and with what adaptations?\n\nRegarding the defenses, what happens if inference optimizers (e.g. Tensor RT) are used? Is the performance of the method affected? Also, does multi-GPU setups introduce interference?\n\n## Minor comments:\n* Figure 1 right: the abbreviations (BN, MP), although common, should be explained in the text/caption.\n* Joint optimization paragraph: \"will generally not fully\"\n* page 5 before Section 4: \"Were it that DNN\"\n \n# Rating Justification:\nOverall, I think that the paper is highly novel and introduces an interesting way to recover the architecture of a NN by using a cheap sensor. There are many questions that rise by this work mainly though due to its novel and intriguing nature. I am not 100% sure that ICLR is the most suitable venue for this work, I am not considering though this aspect in my rating.\n\n# Rating and comments after the rebuttal\nI share the concerns of fellow reviewers regarding the practicality of the assumptions needed for launching the attack presented in the paper, however, based also on the discussion with the authors, I think that the paper is interesting regardless as it can lead to better insights regarding the development of suitable defence mechanisms for securing the architecture and the information carried by a Deep Learning model.\n\nI share also the concerns raised in the other reviews that the paper might be better appreciated by an audience focusing on cyber-security. However, I think that the subject can also be of relevance to ICLR as the paper made an effort to highlight the aspects more relevant to the ML community.\n\nHence, leaving the aspect of relevance to the ACs' discretion, I think that overall this is a clearly written paper based on well executed research that presents some interesting results that are potentially impactful in the aspects concerning security of systems employing Deep Learning models.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1655/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1655/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Can one hear the shape of a neural network?: Snooping the GPU via Magnetic Side Channel", "authorids": ["~Henrique_Teles_Maia1", "~Chang_Xiao1", "~Dingzeyu_Li2", "~Eitan_Grinspun3", "~Changxi_Zheng1"], "authors": ["Henrique Teles Maia", "Chang Xiao", "Dingzeyu Li", "Eitan Grinspun", "Changxi Zheng"], "keywords": ["side channel", "model extraction", "GPU", "magnetic induction", "sensors"], "abstract": "We  examine  the  magnetic  flux  emanating  from  a  graphics  processing  unit\u2019s (GPU\u2019s) power cable, as acquired by a cheap $3 induction sensor, and find that this signal betrays the detailed topology and hyperparameters of a black-box neural network model.

Attacker assumptions include:\n  - have physical access to the GPU\n  - know the exact input feature dimensions and batch size.\n  - know the deep learning framework, GPU brand and hardware/software versions.\n- The main innovation is demonstrating magnetic side channels from GPU cables reveal information about network structures. However, I\u2019m not sure if ICLR is the best venue for this type of contribution. This paper could be a much stronger submission to other security and system conferences.\n\nRecommendation: \n- I\u2019m inclined to recommend a reject. The main reason is that the results are based on multiple impractical assumptions, limiting the impact of this paper in reality. \n\nComments & questions:\n- How do the authors imagine launching this attack in reality? Specifically, how would one know the input dimensions and batch size of a black-box model? A clear explanation of this will help readers understand the value of this work.\n- Using consistency constraints to optimize for hyperparameter estimation is interesting.

Some threat models allow for significant virtual invasiveness (installing spyware [7, 8]) but no physical access, whereas other methods require physical access to measure physical variations near microcontrollers [3, 4]. Each methodology offers its own advantages, and either can be seen as \"more practical\" depending on the situation. \n\nPhysical side-channels can be accessed regardless of encryption or user-permissions, but the leaked information must be observed locally. Attacks based on physical proximity are practical and prejudicial, leading to insights that may be garnered on one more easily-accessed device and transferred to other physically-secured devices that deploy the same models or network architectures [8]. Software based side-channels trade off physical access for the ability to install and run processes on the host machine, at times even going as far as requiring that victim programs manipulate the same level cache as added spyware [7]. This trade-off between virtual and physical access is interesting to explore and expands the overall exposure to vulnerabilities.\n\n> > Knowledge of exact input feature dimensions and batch size\n\nAs mentioned previously, many side-channel attacks [1,2,3,4,5] involve running queries, and almost all black-box attacks involve running queries. If I can run a query, it means I can control the batch size; it also means I know the input dimensions. Since running queries is not unusual for side-channel attacks, it follows that knowledge of input dimensions and batch size are not unusual either.\n\n> > Knowledge of the deep learning framework, GPU brand and hardware/software versions\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, GPU hardware information is already known by virtue of the physical side channel attack requiring local access to the computer. However, knowledge of the underlying hardware is not an assumption of physical side-channel attacks alone. At times even _software access_ side-channel attacks (which for example depend on memory cache) must ensure their code is operating on the same physical hardware as the host. In fact, even for software access side-channel attacks, to validate the recovered side-channel information, it is often necessary to have local access to similar hardware used to profile and compare results [7]. As shown in our GPU transferability experiments, it is _not_ necessary for our method to perform training on the same victim hardware. Datasets can be collected offline on similar hardware, as suggested in [7], to collect signal proxies of how steps will appear in practice.\n\n> > Software framework\n\nAs for the software framework, the number of choices are limited. In the same manner as [7], there is no limitation that restricts which software may be used, only that the framework is publicly available so that offline training and analysis of the side-channel is possible. Therefore it is feasible and tractable to iterate through popular software candidates [7], such as PyTorch and Tensorflow, to collect samples of all the candidate signals when composing the training dataset.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

We have updated our paper to remedy the grammar and clarification edits that were raised, and below we provide answers to your questions and concerns.\n\n> Clarification of Example Attack and Motivation\n\n> > Q: How do the authors imagine launching this attack in reality? Specifically, how would one know the input dimensions and batch size of a black-box model? A clear explanation of this will help readers understand the value of this work.\n\nFor the specific question: Many side-channel attacks [1,2,3,4,5] involve running queries. If one can run a query, it means they can control the batch size; it also means they know the input dimensions. Since running queries is not unusual for side-channel attacks, it follows that knowledge of input dimensions and batch size are not unusual either.\n\nStepping back to the broader question: to set the stage, let us paint one concrete application. Imagine renting a vertically integrated internal cloud platform for ML (e.g., IBM Cloud Pak for Data with Watson Assistant deployed on local hardware [6]). Such platforms are designed to be tamper resistant: users should be able to access services via an application interface (API), but not have access to easily reverse engineer details of the vendor\u2019s proprietary design/architectures. While a user may be motivated to steal and replicate the design, their access is limited to the API and physical access, as opposed to \u201cvirtual\u201d (logic/software/programming) access.\n\nMost broadly, the threat model presented in the paper (page 1) offers interesting strengths and weaknesses compared to existing models. Because GPUs are now widespread in deep learning, having a variety of non-dominating threat models is useful. Compared to other attacking methods [7, 8], magnetic induction side-channel attacks do not require any code to run on the host machine in order to alter or leak logic. This makes electromagnetic side-channel attacks particularly attractive in cases where the attacker has no permission or opportunity to access software. These scenarios may lead to a false sense of security, since magnetic side channel exploits are pervasive and difficult to both detect and defeat [3]. Merely drawing power to perform operations can lead to changes in the nearby magnetic field for electricity driven hardware, making magnetic side-channel access to GPUs intrinsic. Our work explores the extent to which electromagnetic side-channels can leak network information in these settings.\n\n> Optimization vs Initial Estimate\n\nIn Table S3 of the supplemental document, we show that initial hyperparameter estimates are quite accurate, when considering each in isolation. However, our goal is to recover a _valid_ architecture: layers/steps must have compatible dimensions and hyperparameters. Without optimization, we found that for all but the shallowest networks, one or more inconsistencies in the estimated hyperparameters invalidated the architecture. Therefore, the optimization is not only highly effective, but is indeed a strictly necessary step to ensure recovery of a fully valid architecture.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Below we provide answers to your concern.\n\n> Relevance to the ICLR community \n\nOur work follows recent published works in the machine learning community that investigate side-channel exploits used to recover network architectures in detail. Notably [1], _published in ICLR 2020_, sought to reconstruct network models from leaked side-channel information. Their approach relied entirely on non-learning computational methods to generate and prune candidate network models from their extracted trace. No novel ML method (feature representations, layer definitions, or network compositions) was claimed or introduced, rather, the novelty was the side-channel based reconstruction itself. Similarly, the reviews for [2] (submitted concurrently to ICLR 2021) _do not question the relevance of side-channel attacks to ICLR_ (here again the novelty is not in the ML method).\n\nAs expressed in ICLR publications [1, 2], it is of great interest to the community to explore the hardware vulnerabilities of deployed deep learning systems. [1] argues that recovering network architectures is a good goal in its own right, and our method recovers more general and arbitrarily defined network specifications.

The underlying principle is this: we have observed mostly linear effects of batch size on the sensor\u2019s signal profile. Since the two inferences on the same network model have two different batch sizes, we solve for the linear rescaling (in amplitude and time) that best aligns the two observed signals. This linear rescaling acts to normalize the signal (in physics this is nondimensional analysis), and represents the observed data in a manner that has \u201cfactored out\u201d the batch size. We found that this works in practice. \n\nAlternatively, a suitable batch size can be approximated if offline queries to the hidden network are permitted on similar hardware. Again, since we have observed mostly linear effects of batch size on the sensor\u2019s signal profile, this gives us reason to believe that one could refine an approximation of the batch size from datasets generated with signals sampled coarsely at different batch sizes (e.g. 1, 32, 64, 128, 256, etc). Using these batch-labeled datasets, a DNN or KNN classifier could approximate individual parameters for each step. These estimates could then be used to run the extracted network topology at the candidate batch sizes to see which profile most closely aligns with the original signal. If necessary, the batch size estimate could be further refined by either repeating the procedure with a narrower search for batch candidates or attempting to interpolate ([6]) between two potential batch sizes.\n\n> Method Variations and Extensions\n\n> > Would the method naturally extend to decoders?\n\nThe handling of decoders differs in the constraints used for the integer programming problem to ensure parameter consistency. Decoders are composed of the same functional steps as encoders, but potentially grow in size across steps. Treating decoders requires reassessing the optimization constraints to enforce that layers remain the same size or grow. Recovering encoder-decoder networks introduces the additional challenge of pinpointing the switch from encoder to decoder. However, if this transition can be detected or approximated, an additional boundary constraint could be introduced to the integer programming optimization that would allow the network to be split into two optimization problems constrained to align at the transition. This formulation would provide a natural extension of our method to handle encoder-decoder networks though any such attempts remains future work.\n\n> > Can the method be applied for training tasks?\n\nThe method may naturally extend to training tasks by ignoring signals related to back-propagation and focusing only on the forward steps. Access to training would provide numerous examples of the network to work with, rather than the single extracted source acquired during inference, and would likely increase the recovery accuracy of our method. One could straightforwardly apply our method to every training epoch and consolidate the proposed networks using statistics and heuristics on the candidate models. \n\n> > What happens if inference optimizers are used? \n\nInference optimizers have the effect of introducing new categories to the supervised BiLSTM classification task, either by merging commonly paired operations (i.e. fully connected step and batch norm) or introducing new operations altogether (i.e optimized mean computation for average pooling). Changing the classification categories will therefore provide a defense against a BiLSTM classifier trained without optimizers in its dataset. However, it is possible to build up a dataset consisting of network inferences where optimizers are both turned on and off, generating an encompassing BiLSTM classifier that would be robust to such defenses.\n\n> > Do multi-GPU setups introduce interference?\n\nMulti-GPU setups do not introduce interference so long as their power cables are isolated and sufficiently far apart (>7mm). Recording the signal on the GPU itself or near the power cable plugs into the GPU is an easy way to avoid interference from multi-GPU setups. We have experimented with recording multi-GPU setups and found no issues isolating the side-channel information of the victim GPU. \n\nReferences:\n1.

We have updated our paper with the grammar and notation edits that were raised, and below we provide answers to your questions and concerns.\n\n> Sensitivity of Signal Extraction\n\n> > Are there any calibration issues that should be taken into account?\n\nThe only sensor calibration required is to ensure (a) that the sensor is within range of the electromagnetic signal and that (b) the sensor orientation is consistent. Since the magnetic induction signal decays inversely proportional to squared distance, we must place the sensor within 7mm of the GPU power cable. Flipping the flat sensor over will result in a sign change of the magnetic induction signal, thus a uniform orientation should be maintained to avoid having to align measurements across the dataset.\nWe have updated the paper to include the above clarifications in Appendix C.\n\n> > How does the method perform if a sensor of different make is used with possible different sampling rate?\n\nPrevious works have attempted electromagnetic side-channel attacks with industrial probes such as the Langer RF-U 5-2 [1]. These sensors are rated to measure at higher frequencies ranging from 30MHz to 3GHz, but are far more costly (\\\\$1,500+ USD) and require additional expensive equipment to operate. Other power side channel exploits have explored sampling at again higher rates varying from 400KHz to 2.5GHz [2, 3]. Sampling at these frequencies allows finer capture of hardware operations that can ease network step classification, although it significantly increases the amount of feature data to be processed. By contrast, our method involves a \\\\$3 USD sensor sampling at 47KHz. Sampling at lower rates than 47KHz would make it difficult to adequately capture short events on the GPU such as non-linear activation functions and small matrix multiplications that may occur.\n\n> > In what range of sampling rates/placement distances does the method work?\n\nWe were unable to vary the sampling rate of our sensor, and so all of our experiments use the factory 47KHz sampling frequency. Our measurements were taken at a distance of roughly 5mm from the GPUs power cable, although a reduced signal is still present up to 7-8mm away.\n\n> > Regarding GPU transferability, are the GPU pairs of the same make, frequency settings, etc.?\n\nWe acquired an identical make of our NVIDIA GTX-1080 GPU and used it to extract signals with the same sampling frequency of 47KHz when verifying transferability.\n\n> Signal Segmentation\n\nThe segmented output of our classification network on the extracted signal is largely unambiguous. Operations that follow one another (i.e. convolution, non-linear activation function, pooling) are distinct in their signatures and easily captured from the context learned by the BiLSTM classifier. Issues arise for very small-sized steps, closer to the sensor\u2019s sampling limit. In undersampled regions a non-linear activation may be over-segmented and split into two (possibly different) activation steps. To ensure consistency we postprocess the segmented results to (1) merge identical steps that are output in sequence, (2) cull out pooling before a non-linear activation, and (3) remove activation functions that are larger than the convolutions that precede them. We have updated the paper to include the above clarifications in Appendix A.\n\n> Determining the Batch Size\n\n> > Regarding the applicability of the proposed method, in real-world conditions it may not always be possible to define the input of the batch size. On this topic, more details can be provided on the strategy to be used to find a suitable batch size for the method to work.\n\nWe are not sure that we fully understand the question, and we would appreciate a clarification. Here we provide an answer to our best interpretation of the question.\n\nTo robustly recover network topology (as opposed to hyperparameters), we do not require knowledge of batch size, only that the batch size is sufficiently large enough to provide a clear signal. While we used a \\\\$3 sensor with limited sampling rate and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a sensor with high sampling rate and SNR would correspondingly require a smaller minimum batch size.\n\nTo estimate hyperparameters absent known batch size, others have considered fitting the proposed design with a known set of values using other heuristics or timing information [4, 5]; these approaches make assumptions on the family of networks within scope. \n\nOn the other hand, to estimate hyperparameters for unfamiliar architectures, knowledge of input and batch size is required. We discuss two strategies here, the first of which we have tried successfully.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1655/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1655/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Can one hear the shape of a neural network?: Snooping the GPU via Magnetic Side Channel", "authorids": ["~Henrique_Teles_Maia1", "~Chang_Xiao1", "~Dingzeyu_Li2", "~Eitan_Grinspun3", "~Changxi_Zheng1"], "authors": ["Henrique Teles Maia", "Chang Xiao", "Dingzeyu Li", "Eitan Grinspun", "Changxi Zheng"], "keywords": ["side channel", "model extraction", "GPU", "magnetic induction", "sensors"], "abstract": "We  examine  the  magnetic  flux  emanating  from  a  graphics  processing  unit\u2019s (GPU\u2019s) power cable, as acquired by a cheap $3 induction sensor, and find that this signal betrays the detailed topology and hyperparameters of a black-box neural network model.

In response, we discuss countermeasures to protect against our method and other similar snooping techniques.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "maia|can_one_hear_the_shape_of_a_neural_network_snooping_the_gpu_via_magnetic_side_channel", "one-sentence_summary": "We  examine  the  magnetic  flux  emanating  from  a  graphics  processing  unit\u2019s (GPU\u2019s) power cable and find that this signal betrays the detailed topology and hyperparameters of a black-box neural network model.", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/ba60e747781a114f7d76497c4feedfba29754cc9.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/a54e8fb6b7c012c819236654144d0a327bcc5b41.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=Ke1FBu2rL", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nmaia2021can,\ntitle={Can one hear the shape of a neural network?: Snooping the {\\{}GPU{\\}} via Magnetic Side Channel},\nauthor={Henrique Teles Maia and Chang Xiao and Dingzeyu Li and Eitan Grinspun and Changxi Zheng},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=QzKDLiosEd}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
