Our comments are as follows.\n\n*) \"Comparison to [Fei et al (2020)]\". The regularization is a critical part of our algorithm, but is not the only novelty of our Algorithm 2 compared to [Fei et al (2020)]. The need for regularization in linear function approximation makes algorithm design much more challenging. \nIn particular, the value iteration algorithm in [Fei et al (2020)], even with regularization added and the canonical bases therein replaced by linear features, would incur an extra multiplicative factor of  $\\log(\\max(1,e^{\\beta H}) / |e^{\\beta H}-1|)$ in regret compared to our current bound. Note that this extra factor grows exponentially as  $\\beta \\to 0$. Therefore, when $\\beta \\to 0$, the resulting bound would be  *exponentially* worse than our current bound, and would prevent us from recovering the regret bound in the risk-neutral setting.  \nThe novelty of our Algorithm 2 lies in the fact that it overcomes the above issue by using regression target and regressors on the order of $e^{\\beta H} - 1$ in the least-squares step (7) (or Line 4 in Algorithm 2). \nThis distinctive feature of Algorithm 2 makes it significantly different from the value iteration algorithm proposed in [Fei et al (2020)], which is designed only for the tabular case.\n\n*) In addition to the linear function approximation, our paper also provides a risk-sensitive RL algorithm and regret bound for general function approximation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that general function approximation is studied for risk-sensitive RL.

Please see below for our response.\n\n*) \"Practicality\". Our work focuses on theoretical analysis, and our algorithms are designed for that purpose. That being said, it is still possible to run the algorithms in practical settings with reasonable computational complexity. \nIn the setting of linear function approximation, one only needs to store the sampled trajectory of the current episode and previous episode, and the main step in Algorithm 2 (Line 4, which amounts to a least-squares update) can be implemented in an online fashion. In practice, various approximation techniques may be explored, including deployment of replay buffers, though this is beyond the scope of our work.\n\n*) \"Relevance\". \nRisk-sensitive RL is an important research area for RL applications where risk must be carefully handled, such as critical decision making processes involving human beings. We have listed various examples in the beginning of Section 1, and they are all practical applications of RL and AI. Hence, we think that our work is relevant to the theme of the conference.\n\n*) \"Meta algorithm/regret\". The meta algorithms/regret are used to disentangle  part of the analysis that relates to function approximation from the part that does not. We believe such formulation  is best for understanding the role of function approximation in regret analysis, as pointed out in Section 1 of our paper.

Please see our replies below.\n\n*) \"Randomized value function\". Our algorithms are quite different in nature from those based on randomized value function. Conditional on the sampled trajectory, our algorithms estimate parameters via deterministic update, whereas algorithms based on randomized value function sample parameter estimates from some Bayesian posterior distributions.\n\n*) \"Episodic MDP\".\nEpisodic MDP is a standard setting for regret analysis of RL. Please see, e.g., [Azar et al (2017); Jin et al (2018); Yang and Wang (2019)] among many others. The  results in the episodic MDP can be extended to other MDP settings, such as discounted MDP by adapting techniques in [Zhou et al (2020)], though this is beyond the scope of this work.\n\n*) \"Condition 1\".\nThe intuition of Condition 1 is that it ensures the stability of iterates {$\\{Q^k_h\\}$} while Algorithm 1 is running, so that {${Q^k_h}$} do not deviate too much from the ideal iterates {$\\{\\overline{Q}^k_h\\}$} defined on the bottom of pp6. \nCondition 1 serves as an abstraction of optimism for proving the meta regret bound in Theorem 1. In the concrete results (Theorems 2 and 3) that follow the meta regret bound, we show that both Algorithms 2 and 3 (which are special instances of Algorithm 1)  satisfy Condition 1 with high probability, and therefore prove that they attain the claimed concrete regret bounds. We would like to emphasize that in Theorems 2 and 3, Condition 1 is *not* an assumption, but rather something that our algorithms are proved to satisfy.\n\n*) \"Experiments\".\nOur paper focuses on theoretical aspects of risk-sensitive RL. It is an excellent suggestion to conduct numerical experiments to support our theoretical results. We will work on this in the future.\n\nReference:\n\nAzar et al (2017).

The paper proposes two algorithms based on the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle, one for linear function approximation and the other for general function approximation.

What\u2019s proposed for general function approximation is mostly a conceptual algorithm. It\u2019s unclear how it could be applied in practice. Even with linear function approximation, it seems that the algorithm requires storing all past iterates as well as sweeping over all states and actions for each episode, which is extremely computationally costly. \n\nEven though there\u2019s some nice theoretical contributions, I am not sure if this is the best venue for this paper, since it\u2019s not really related to representation learning\u2026 (although the conference has been constantly evolving over the years). \n\nGiven the points above, I am leaning towards rejection.\n\nThe organization of the paper is pretty clear.

Then the key to decide if the paper\u2019s contribution is enough is to see how hard such extension is. \n\nHowever, although [Fei et al. 2020] focus on the tabular setting, it seems that their proof techniques can be easily generalized to the linear function approximation setting (as they write the tabular representation using canonical basis, then the values could be written as the solution of a linear regression). I check the details of the proof and it indeed shares a lot of similarities with [Fei et al. 2020].

Utilizing the theoretical framework of Osband 2014, they extend the results to entropic-risk RL with linear function approximations on the transition dynamics and value function and later with general function approximation in episodic MDPs.\n\nUnfortunately I am not very familiar with the recent theoretical exploration results with randomized value functions. On the high-level, I find the contribution of extending this to entropic-risk RL reasonable. One main question is why episodic MDPs are chosen for deriving the main theoretical results, and can these results be extended to more standard MDP frameworks such as discounting MDPs. Moreover, on top of the technical description, can the authors provide some intuitive explanations of condition 1 (which is a main RSOFU assumption that pivots most of the theoretical results) and some examples on when this condition is satisfied? \n\nWhile I understand this paper's main contribution is theoretical and appreciate the efforts for deriving that. Since the algorithm in analysis is fairly standard, it'd be great to see at least some simple, proof-of-concept numerical experiments to evaluate the tightness of the regret bound. Without that, it's rather difficult to understand the several theoretical results, compare with the references mentioned, and justify their usefulness.

We consider the finite-horizon episodic MDP setting, and propose a meta algorithm based on value iteration. We then derive two algorithms for linear and general function approximation, namely RSVI.L and RSVI.G, respectively, as special instances of the meta algorithm. We illustrate that the success of RSVI.L depends crucially on carefully designed feature mapping and regularization that adapt to risk sensitivity. In addition, both RSVI.L and RSVI.G maintain risk-sensitive optimism that facilitates efficient exploration. On the analytic side, we provide regret analysis for the algorithms by developing a meta analytic framework, at the core of which is a risk-sensitive optimism condition. We show that any instance of the meta algorithm that satisfies the condition yields a meta regret bound. We further verify the condition for RSVI.L and RSVI.G under respective function approximation settings to obtain concrete regret bounds that scale sublinearly in the number of episodes. \n", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "fei|entropic_risksensitive_reinforcement_learning_a_meta_regret_framework_with_function_approximation", "pdf": "/pdf/82089929f026609e0ef417358fa618e145567947.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=Q3d4fe4KUC", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nfei2021entropic,\ntitle={Entropic Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning: A Meta Regret Framework with Function Approximation},\nauthor={Yingjie Fei and Zhuoran Yang and Zhaoran Wang},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=q_kZm9eHIeD}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
