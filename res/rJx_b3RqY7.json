The relation between z and X is X = Az + N(0, 0.01^2 * I), where A is a Gaussian matrix with i.i.d entries from N(0, 0.05^2). Note that A was generated at first and then fixed thereafter. We then randomly sampled 200,000 z\u2019s from the standard Normal distribution (16-dim), and then mapped them to the data space using A. Then we chose 100,000 of the samples for training, 50,000 for validation, and 50,000 for testing. The results are summarized below. The KL-divergence is calculated using the ITE-package [1] following the Adversarial Variational Bayes [2] paper.\n\n\n                               first epoch                               best KL                   best epoch/total epochs\n                         z                         X                     z                     X                       \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAIM                0.04                   76.54               0.31               2.02                    31 / 100\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nALI                  0.07                   62.83              0.37               5.66                    30 / 100\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVEEGAN         0.07                   47.95              0.33             11.41                    36 / 100\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVAE                 2.16                 619.30              0.02               9.15                    92 / 100\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the \"first epoch\" column, we report the KL-divergence of the first epoch. We choose the \"best epoch\" to be the epoch when KL(z, z_fake) + KL(x, x_fake) attains its minimum on the validation set, and then report the KL-divergence of the \"best epoch\" on the test set.\n\nFrom the table, we observe that VAE achieves a much smaller KL on z. One important reason could be its explicit minimization of KL(z, z_fake). AIM and the other two adversarial methods have similar z-space KL-divergence.\n\nIn the x-space, AIM has the best result, followed by ALI. VEEGAN has a slight improvement on z-space KL, but sacrifices the performance on x. Since in this case X only has one mode, our hypothesis is that VEEGAN makes a trade-off between alleviating mode collapse and maintaining the generating quality within each mode. However, this needs more experiments to confirm. VAE does not perform well on x-space, and its convergence seems much slower than the other methods. The KL on x may continue decreasing if we run other hundreds of epochs. But within 100 epochs, it does not give competitive results even though the experiment settings are very close to the VAE assumptions. However, our X does have covariance between different dimensions, while VAE assumes independent features to use the L2 loss. From our experiment, this violation indeed has a large impact on the performance.\n\nOverall, the experiment results are on par with our reports in the paper. AIM not only effectively infers the code z, but also uses the inference mechanism to further improve generating quality.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Szabo, Zoltan. \"Information theoretical estimators (ite) toolbox.\" 2013.\n[2] Mescheder, Lars, Sebastian Nowozin, and Andreas Geiger. \"Adversarial Variational Bayes: Unifying variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks.\" ICML, 2017.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1184/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1184/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1184/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AIM: Adversarial Inference by Matching Priors and Conditionals", "abstract": "Effective inference for a generative adversarial model remains an important and challenging problem.

Here is our point-to-point response to the comments and questions raised in this review:\n\n1. Section 4:\n- q(z) seems to be undefined. Is it the aggregated posterior?\n\nWe are sorry for the confusion. Yes, q(z) is the aggregated posterior. In this paper, p() stands for the distribution on the generator, and q() stands for the distribution on the encoder.\n\n- How is equation (1) related to ELBO that is used for training VAEs?\n\nTo better explain the relation between (1) and VAE, we have added a new Section 4.3. \n\nTo summarize, equation (1) is our method\u2019s objective. It means that AIM performs marginal distribution matching in the latent space and conditional distribution matching in the data space. But this objective cannot be optimized directly, so we transfer the problem using (3). It turns out VAE can be derived in a similar manner. Specifically, the objective of VAE can be understood as the equation (5), which is like the \u201creverse version\u201d of equation (3).  By reverse, we mean that VAE can be explained as performing marginal distribution matching in the data space and conditional distribution matching in the latent space. Note that the RHS of (5) is the well-known VAE form, i.e. a regularization on z (I_vae) plus a reconstruction term on x (II_vae). But we actually get it from a perspective different from ELBO. ELBO is a lower bound of the log-likelihood of the data, and we maximize ELBO in order to maximize the log-likelihood. However, in equation (5), we do not have any inequality and are not directly trying to increase the likelihood. Instead, the LHS of (5) is the summation of KL-divergence between the conditionals on z and between the marginals on x. This is the quantity that VAE tries to minimize, from our perspective motivated by (3).\n\n2. Some relevant references are missing: I\u2019d love to see a discussion of how this loss relates to other VAE-GAN hybrids.\n\nThank you for bringing these work to our attention. We have cited and discussed them in our updated draft. We also added another adversarial inference paper (adversarial variational Bayes). They are discussed in the second and fourth paragraph in the Related Work section. Empirical comparison with VEEGAN has also been added to Section 5.3.\n\n3. Section 5.1\n\nWe use MSE as the measure of how well our model reconstructs the samples. While there may not exist an absolutely perfect measure, we think the relative improvement on one measure still provides lots of information. For example, the best baseline model in Section 5.1 has MSE 0.080 on MNIST, while our model has only 0.026. On CIFAR-10, the best baseline MSE is 0.416, while ours is only 0.019. Moreover, all these improvements on MSE do not come with any compromise on generation. In fact, our model even improves the generating performance over GAN with the same architecture.\n\nBut per the reviewer\u2019s request, we add another measure called \u201cpercentage of high-quality samples\u201d to our mode-collapse experiment, motivated by the experiments in VEEGAN. The results are summarized in Table 2. We observe that the best baseline model covers about 24.6 modes with 40% generated samples to be of high quality, while our model can cover all the 25 modes with more than 80% high-quality samples. This together with the inception score provides strong evidence that AIM can generate higher-quality samples.\n\n4. Section 5.4\n\nWe are not very sure which error bar was the reviewer referring to. But for better illustration, we have summarized the results in a table (Table 2). And from that, we can see that our model covers all of the 25 modes every time with high-quality samples, and can indeed reliably reduce the mode collapse.\n\n5. Minor issue\n\nThank you for pointing out this typo =) We have corrected it!\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1184/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1184/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1184/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AIM: Adversarial Inference by Matching Priors and Conditionals", "abstract": "Effective inference for a generative adversarial model remains an important and challenging problem.

Here is our point-to-point response to the comments and questions raised in the review:\n\n1. \u201cThe space of adversarially trained latent variable models has grown quite crowded in recent years.\u201d\n\nAlthough there has been a large improvement in the topic of adversarial inference in recent years, some big issues are still not well addressed and limit the effectiveness of the inference mechanism in adversarial frameworks.\n\nFirstly, to the best of our knowledge, all of the works that attempt to incorporate the inference mechanism into GAN suffer from deteriorating the generation performance. This is supported by the paper [1], in which they conducted extensive experiments to compare many state-of-the-art models with DCGAN. The result shows that GAN variants with inference network perform worse than the standard DCGAN on image generation.\n\nSecondly, the inference performance is also very limited, and as the data distribution becomes more complicated, this issue will be more severe. For example, ALICE\u2019s reconstruction performance on CIFAR-10 is much worse than that on MNIST.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully handle these two issues simultaneously. For generation performance, our model AIM does not deteriorate the generation performance but actually further improve it compared with GAN with the same architecture. For the inference, AIM consistently achieves better results on even complicated distributions. \n\n2. \u201cI would like to understand better why it is that latent variable (z) reconstruction gives rise to better x-space reconstruction.\u201d\n\nWe have added a new Section 4.3 to demonstrate the connection between our model and VAE. Specifically, the objective of VAE can be understood as the equation (5), which is like the \u201creverse version\u201d of equation (3).  By \"reverse\", we mean that VAE can be explained as performing marginal distribution matching in the data space and conditional distribution matching in the latent space, while our model performs marginal distribution matching in the latent space and conditional distribution matching in the data space. \n\nNote that the latent z reconstruction alone does not guarantee a better data space reconstruction, just like a stand-alone x reconstruction of VAE will not work without the help of regularization on z. Our method has two simultaneous conditions on the generator, encoder, and discriminator: the generator has to generate samples that can fool the discriminator and the encoder has to bring these generated samples back to their latent codes. So the generator needs to not only generate samples that look real, but also map the latent codes to the \u201ccorrect\u201d locations (e.g. modes). Otherwise, the encoder will have a hard time to map the samples back (more precisely in our case, will have a low likelihood).\n\nAnother interesting property of (5) is that it actually provides a new perspective on VAE\u2019s objective, different from the maximum likelihood point of view. Note that there is also no inequality in (5), unlike the ELBO approach. We can get VAE\u2019s objective by decomposing the summation of the KL-divergence between posteriors on z and between marginals on x.\n\n3. I did not find the claims of better sample quality of AIM over ALI to be well supported by the data. In this context, it is not entirely clear what the significant difference in inception scores represents.\n\nProbably the 2D Gaussian mixture result will provide an insight here. From Table 2, we can see that ALI\u2019s generated samples only cover on average 16 (out of 25) modes while our method\u2019s can cover 25 every time. The ALI\u2019s result we show in Figure 3 is the best-covering result they report, and we include it only to give more insights on the difference between our method and the joint distribution matching scheme.\n\nFrom the quantitative results in Table 1, we also observe that AIM gives a higher inception score than ALI, and this happens when AIM also has a much lower reconstruction error. The main takeaway message is that, compared to the joint distribution matching of ALI, the separate marginal and conditional matching of AIM leads to better reconstruction and generation. Actually, from Figure 2, the reconstructions of ALI are not always faithful even on the MNIST dataset. We think this is because that it is still very hard for the adversarial game to discover the dependency relation between x and z.\n\nReference:\n[1] Distribution matching in variational inference.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1184/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1184/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1184/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AIM: Adversarial Inference by Matching Priors and Conditionals", "abstract": "Effective inference for a generative adversarial model remains an important and challenging problem.

The paper proposes a learning framework, in which a generating process p is modeled by a neural network called generator, and an inference process q by another neural network encoder. The ultimate goal is to match the joint distributions, p(x, z) and q(x, z), and this is done by attempting to match the priors  p(z) and q(z) and matching the conditionals p(x|z) and q(x|z). As both q(z) and q(x|z) are impossible to sample from, the authors mathematically expand this objective criterion and rewrite to be dependent only on p(x|z), q(x) and q(z|x), that can be easily sampled from. In the main part of the work, the authors use the f-divergence theory (Nowozin et al., 2016) to present the optimization problem as minmax optimization problem, that is learned using an adversarial game, using training and inference algorithms that are proposed by the authors. In experiments, the authors consider both reconstruction and generation tasks using the MNIST, CIFAR10 and CelebA datasets. Results show that the proposed method yields better MSE reconstruction error as better as a higher inception scores for the generated examples, compared to a standard GAN and a few other methods. \n\nThis work establishes an important bridge between the VAE and GAN framework, and has a a good combination of theoretical and experimental aspects.

As such it is\nvery much in the same spirit as existing methods such as ALI/BiGAN. The\nauthors go through an information theoretic motivation but end up with the\nstandard GAN objective function plus a latent space (z) reconstruction\nterm. The z-space reconstruction is accomplished by first sampling z from\nits standard normal prior and pushing that sample through the generator to\nget sample in the data space (x), then x is propagated through an encoder\nto get a new latent-space sample z'. Reconstruction is done to reduce the\nerror between z' and z.\n\nNovelty: The space of adversarially trained latent variable models has\ngrown quite crowded in recent years. In light of the existing literature,\nthis paper's contribution can be seen as incremental, with relatively low novelty. \n\nIn the end, the training paradigm is basically the same as InfoGAN, with\nthe difference being that, in the proposed model,  all the latent\nvariables are inferred (in InfoGAN, only a subset of the latent\nvariables are inferred) . This difference was a design decision on the part of the InfoGAN\nauthors and, in my opinion, does not represent a significantly novel\ncontribution on the part of this paper.  \n\nExperiments: The experiments show that the proposed method is\nbetter able to reconstruct examples than does ALI -- a result is not\nnecessarily surprising, but is interesting and worth further\ninvestigation. I would like to understand better why it is that latent\nvariable (z) reconstruction gives rise to better x-space reconstruction.\n\nI did not find the claims of better sample quality of AIM over ALI to be\nwell supported by the data. In this context, it is not entirely clear what\nthe significant difference in inception scores represents, though on this, the\nresults are consistent with those previously published\n\nI really liked the experiment shown in Figure 4 (esp. 4b), it makes the\ndifferences between AIM and ALI very clear. It shows that relative to ALI,\nAIM sacrifices coherence between the \"marginal\" posterior (the distribution\nof latent variables encoded from data samples) and the latent space\nprior, in favor of superior reconstructions. AIM's choice of trade-off is\none that, in many contexts, one would happy to take as it ensures that\ninformation about x is not lost -- as discussed elsewhere in the paper.\nI view this aspect of the paper by far the most interesting. \n\nSummary,\nOverall, the proposed AIM model is interesting and shows promise, but I'm\nnot sure how much impact it will have in light of the existing literature\nin this area. Perhaps more ambitious applications would really show off the\npower of the model and make it standout from the existing crowd. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1184/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AIM: Adversarial Inference by Matching Priors and Conditionals", "abstract": "Effective inference for a generative adversarial model remains an important and challenging problem.
