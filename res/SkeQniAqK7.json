It is not clear how smaller RBMs (and their associated parameters) are combined to obtain the larger RBM model. \n\nAs far as explaining the method of combination, and the associated mathematical properties, we have tried to do this in greater detail in section 3 (Approach). We used Figure 1 and the combination matrices to show what exactly is happening when we combine the models, and how the models mathematically combine. In our revision we have made an effort to outline this in greater detail.  \n\nR2: Overall, the paper seems to be a report consisting of a few interesting observations rather than introducing a solid and novel contribution with theoretical guarantees.\n\nIn regards to the lack of theoretical guarantees, we have shown that the equilibrium distribution is what we expect it to be, and mathematically have shown that the final distribution of interest has the mode we expect it to. It has been shown in many texts that Gibbs Sampling converges to this equilibrium distribution at a geometric rate in Markov Random Fields.  Finding the exact convergence rate involves calculation of the eigenstructure of the markov chain transition matrix, which is in general computationally intractable for RBMs of moderate size [1]. Given this, we have added an extra theorem to show how the upper bounds on convergence rate changes as we merge RBMs, this can be seen in Section 3.1 on \u201cConvergence Rate and MCMC\u201d. We show that the rate of convergence of the RBM is geometric in the number of sampling steps, and that the combined RBM will have a convergence rate bounded by the sum of the convergence rates of the individual RBMs. \n\n If we want to have further theoretical guarantees, we have the ability to exactly set model parameters, as mentioned in section 3.2 to get the exact distribution of interest, and to combine those RBMs with directly calculated parameters. As mentioned in that section, this is not a data efficient, or computationally efficient method which is why we chose to not pursue it. \n\n[1] Pierre. Bremaud.

Firstly, the stochasticity allows for full sampling from the RBMs distribution, and has the ability to identify all possible modes in a multimodal distribution if sampled for long enough.  As there are many possible solutions to a Boolean logic query (and integers can have many different factors), we note that the statistics that this method provides can give us a variety of answers to the queries, allowing the user to evaluate each individual solution based on its individual merit. \n\nR3: How do deterministic neural networks perform on the addition and factoring tasks? The choice of RBMs is not motivated well and without any comparisons to alternatives, it comes across as arbitrary.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, deterministic neural networks have not been well studied for the integer factorization problem. In [4] deterministic neural networks are used, but are able to factor smaller integers, on a more restricted problem, and are fully trained on the subset of all integers. We have cited this work in our related works section, and mentioned its impact.  \n\nR3: That learning simple functions and composing them to compute more complex functions would be more data efficient than directly learning the complex functions does not seem very surprising.\n\nWe agree that this method of composing simple functions to compute more complex ones is intuitive, and may not be very surprising, but we think that this helps data and model efficiency in a different manner than presented in previous papers. \n\nAs far as scaling up the tasks and problem sizes, we are showing a method of combination here, and are scaling up the problem sizes continuously. We believe this combination method could be used for other things, and have presented it here as a proof of concept rather than a definitive survey with all possible uses. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper696/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper696/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper696/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Combining Learned Representations for Combinatorial Optimization", "abstract": "We propose a new approach to combine Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) that can be used to solve combinatorial optimization problems.

We acknowledge there are pros and cons to both approaches; directly calculating the weights gives guarantees on probabilities and mixing rates, while training can produce a more compact, data, and computationally efficient model. Some algorithms will be more amenable to training, while others more amenable to directly calculating and setting weights, so we believe that this should be addressed on an algorithm by algorithm basis. We try to present one possible algorithm and a possible combination mechanism that we believe could work for others.  \n\nR4: \u201cThe paper states that the problem of training \"large modules\" is \"equivalent to solving the optimization problem\", but does not explain how.\u201d\n\nTraining a full module to solve an optimization problem in the context presented here involves supplying samples from a large portion of the subspace that we are trying to model. Based on the results we have seen, we only achieve good performance once we have samples from >30% of the subspace (depending on the problem). In addition, the RBMs perform significantly better when trained on the full space we are trying to model.  We view this as the RBM creating an associative memory where it \u201cmemorizes\u201d examples and recalls them afterward, and do not view this as a data and computationally efficient method of solving these problems. \n\nR4: An example is presented in Figure 3 but is not expanded upon in the main text. I\u2019d like the authors to validate my understanding: \nAn RBM is trained to implement a complete binary adder circuit by having it model the joint distribution of the adder\u2019s inputs and outputs [A, B, Cin, S, Cout] (A is the first input bit, B is the second input bit, Cin is the input carry bit, S is the output sum bit, and Cout is the output carry bit), where (I assume) the distribution over [A, B, Cin] is uniform, and where S and Cout follow deterministically from [A, B, Cin]. After training, the output of the circuit is computed from [A, B, Cin] by clamping [A, B, Cin] and sampling [S, Cout] given [A, B, Cin] using Gibbs sampling.\u201d \n\nYes, your understanding is correct. We train on the joint density over inputs and outputs, and solving a problem amounts to clamping (conditioning) a subset of the units and sampling the remaining units via Gibbs Sampling. We have made an effort in the revision to make sure that this is more clear. In the case of solving factorization problem, we clamp some of the visible units to the integer we are trying to factor, and use gibbs sampling to get statistics for the remaining units conditioned on the output number. \n\nR4: I\u2019m also confused by the presentation of the results. For instance, I don\u2019t know what \"log\", \"FA1\", \"FA2\", etc. refer to in Figure 6. Also, Figure 6 is referenced in the text in the context of binary multiplication (\"[...] is able to outperform a multiplier created just by training, as can be seen in Figure 6\"), but presents results for addition and factorization only.\n\nWe have presented results for addition and factorization in the main body of the paper, but refer to readers of the paper to the appendix where we have included a larger set of results. The results were omitted from the main body of the paper for the sake of brevity. The naming of units as \u201clog\u201d \u201cFA1\u201d, \u201cFA2\u201d, etc. are meant to represent the size of the base unit that was merged to create this larger unit, \u201clog\u201d referring to logical units (AND, XOR, etc.), \u201cFA1\u201d being 1 bit full adder, \u201cFA2\u201d being a 2 bit full adder, etc. we have made this clear in the figure caption.\n\nR4: The way I see it, implementing reversible boolean logic circuits using RBMs is an artificial problem, and the key idea of the paper -- which I find interesting -- is that in some cases it appears to be possible to combine RBMs trained for sub-problems into larger RBMs without needing to fine-tune the model. \n\nWe also agree that there may be other applications to this type of merging of RBMs without further training, and we are working to look at those in greater detail. Invertible Boolean Logic provides a good test bed for this idea, and as explained above, we do believe it has a very intimate relationship with Boolean Satisfiability problems and other combinatorial optimization problems. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper696/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper696/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper696/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Combining Learned Representations for Combinatorial Optimization", "abstract": "We propose a new approach to combine Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) that can be used to solve combinatorial optimization problems.

We have tried to be more clear in our methods, and have tried to restructure the paper slightly to ease understanding of the approach and concepts. In addition, we have went further into explaining certain important concepts (such as the exact method of combination) in greater detail. \n\n\n\nR4: I have two issues with the chosen example: 1) the connection with combinatorial optimization is not clear to me, and 2) it\u2019s not very well explained.\n\nR3: \u201cThe term \"combinatorial optimization\" is used in a confusing way -- addition would not usually be called a combinatorial optimization problem.\u201d\n\nR2: \u201cThe term \"Combinatorial optimization\", which is used in the title and throughout the body of paper, sounds a bit confusing to the reviwer. This term is typically used in other contexts.\u201d\n\nWe have also further in explaining our usage of the term \u201ccombinatorial optimization\u201d. We view our combination method with invertible Boolean logic as a method of solving the Boolean satisfiability problem, which is the classic example of an NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problem, and many combinatorial optimization problems can be reduced to it (as shown in the paper by Karp et al. [3]) . We have shown arithmetic and integer factorization as a further application of the invertible Boolean logic that inherently solves the boolean satisfiability problem in its construction. This is further supported by showing the method of creating a full adder circuit through combinations of logic circuits. \n\nWe have revised the paper to further explain this concept, and refer the reviewers to the Section 3 \u201cApproach\u201d.  \n\nAll three reviewers also commented on our choice of invertible Boolean logic to validate this approach.  We note that the integer factorization problem is in NP, and the Boolean satisfiability problem (which is solved within our invertible Boolean logic formulation) is also an NP-Complete problem. The reviewers also suggested using this approach on a more complex task such as TSP. We argue that integer factorization, invertible Boolean logic, and Boolean satisfiability can be harder in some ways than TSP, as integer factorization is an \u201call or nothing\u201d problem, where the solution is either completely correct or completely incorrect.  Our choice of invertible Boolean logic was due to the simple and intuitive factorization of the problem into smaller sub problems. We also note (as mentioned above, and the revision of the paper) that NP-Complete formulations of the TSP problem can be reduced to a Boolean satisfiability problem ([2, 3]). We have also suggested how we could directly implement a TSP problem in the RBM.  \n\n[1] Pierre. Bremaud.

Results are presented on RBMs trained to implement binary addition, multiplication, and factorization, where the proposed approach is compared with the baseline of training a full model from scratch.\n\nI found the paper confusing at times. It is well-written from a syntactical and grammatical point of view, but some key concepts are stated without being explained, which gives the impression that the authors have a clear understanding of the material presented in the paper but communicate only part of the full picture to the reader.\n\nFor instance, there\u2019s a brief exposition of the connection between Boltzmann machines and combinatorial optimization problems: the latter is mapped onto the former by expressing constraints as a fixed set of Boltzmann machine weights and biases, and low-energy states (i.e. more optimal solutions) are found by sampling from the model, which involves no training. What\u2019s less clear to me is what kinds of combinatorial optimization problems can be mapped onto the RBM *training* problem. The paper states that the problem of training \"large modules\" is \"equivalent to solving the optimization problem\", but does not explain how.\n\nSimilarly, the paper mentions that the \"general approach to solving these combinatorial optimization problems is to recognize the atomic unit necessary to solve the problem\", but at that point the reader has no concrete example of what combinatorial optimization problem would be mapped onto training and inference in RBMS.\n\nA concrete example is provided in the Experiments section: the authors propose to implement invertible (reversible?) boolean logic circuits by combining smaller pre-trained RBMs which implement certain logical operations into larger circuits. I have two issues with the chosen example: 1) the connection with combinatorial optimization is not clear to me, and 2) it\u2019s not very well explained. As far as I understand, these reversible boolean logic operations are expressed as sampling a subset of the RBM\u2019s inputs conditioned on another subset of its inputs. An example is presented in Figure 3 but is not expanded upon in the main text. I\u2019d like the authors to validate my understanding:\n\nAn RBM is trained to implement a complete binary adder circuit by having it model the joint distribution of the adder\u2019s inputs and outputs [A, B, Cin, S, Cout] (A is the first input bit, B is the second input bit, Cin is the input carry bit, S is the output sum bit, and Cout is the output carry bit), where (I assume) the distribution over [A, B, Cin] is uniform, and where S and Cout follow deterministically from [A, B, Cin]. After training, the output of the circuit is computed from [A, B, Cin] by clamping [A, B, Cin] and sampling [S, Cout] given [A, B, Cin] using Gibbs sampling.\n\nThe alternative to this, which is examined in the paper, is to train individual XOR, AND, and OR gates in the same way and compose them into a complete binary adder circuit as prescribed by Section 3.\n\nI think the paper has the potential to be a lot more transparent to the reader in explaining these concepts, which would avoid them spending quite a bit of time inferring meaning from figures.\n\nI\u2019m also confused by the presentation of the results. For instance, I don\u2019t know what \"log\", \"FA1\", \"FA2\", etc. refer to in Figure 6. Also, Figure 6 is referenced in the text in the context of binary multiplication (\"[...] is able to outperform a multiplier created just by training, as can be seen in Figure 6\"), but presents results for addition and factorization only.\n\nThe way I see it, implementing reversible boolean logic circuits using RBMs is an artificial problem, and the key idea of the paper -- which I find interesting -- is that in some cases it appears to be possible to combine RBMs trained for sub-problems into larger RBMs without needing to fine-tune the model. I think there are interesting large-scale applications of this, such as building an autoregressive RBM for image generation by training a smaller RBM on a more restricted inpainting task.

This term is typically used in other contexts.\n\nTypos:\n** Page 2 -- Paragraph 2: \"Therefore, methods than can exploit...\"\n** Page 3 -- 2nd line of math: Super-scripts are missing for some entries of the matrices W^A and W^{A+B}\n** Page 5 -- Last paragraph: \"...merged logical units is more likly to get get stuck in a ...\"\n** Page 5 -- Last paragraph: \"...and combining their distributions using the mulistart heuristic...\"\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper696/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Combining Learned Representations for Combinatorial Optimization", "abstract": "We propose a new approach to combine Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) that can be used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. This allows synthesis of larger models from smaller RBMs that have been pretrained, thus effectively bypassing the problem of learning in large RBMs, and creating a system able to model a large, complex multi-modal space. We validate this approach by using learned representations to create ``invertible boolean logic'', where we can use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches to find the solution to large scale boolean satisfiability problems and show viability towards other combinatorial optimization problems. Using this method, we are able to solve 64 bit addition based problems, as well as factorize 16 bit numbers. We find that these combined representations can provide a more accurate result for the same sample size as compared to a fully trained model.
