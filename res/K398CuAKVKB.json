The authors argue that the underlying algebraic structure of complex/hyper-complex coordinate systems enable greater weight-sharing compared to usual real-valued networks. Inspired by this, the authors also propose the idea of vector map convolutions which captures the aforementioned properties but at the same time, are not subjected to the dimensionality constraints. Several empirical studies are also provided to demonstrate the potential effectiveness of vector map convolutions.\n\nI have to first acknowledge that I have not very familiar with much of the background literature on complex and quarternion networks. Also, for the experiments in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, I am not familiar with any of these data-sets as well as the evaluation measures (Jaccard score, etc.). Hence, I am not too confident in my assessment of this paper.\n\nDetailed Comments/Questions:\n\n- I would prefer a clearer and more comprehensive way of introducing the background work and how it leads to the intuition of vector map convolutions. It would be much better if the authors could provide exact mathematical descriptions of usual complex and quarternion networks (esp. as this paper is < 8 pages right now) and how vector map convolutions are the natural generalization- I don't see this as obvious based on looking at the equations in Sections 3.1\n\n- I assume that Equation (1) and the discussion above it is the definition of the vector map convolutions? So only right-shift permutations are used and not other permutations (i.e., a subgroup instead of the full symmetric group S_n?) \n\n- I think that the results for CIFAR-10/100 are potentially interesting as they show that the proposed approach achieves competitive performance with the standard approach while reducing parameter count significantly. However, there's far too little details given about the experimental setup; for example, what are the hyper-parameters used (Batch-size, learning rate, optimizer choices, batch-norm, dropout, etc.) and are they used in a consistent way when comparing between real, quarternion, and vector map? \n\n===============\nPost-rebuttal:\n\nI would like to thank the authors for their rebuttal and addressing some of my concerns. However, after reading the updated manuscript as well as the other reviews, I decide to maintain my current ranting. I would still like to see more rigour in the paper: more of the mathematics need to be fleshed out and how the proposed approach compares with the existing works in complex/quarternion networks in a more mathematical way.

The proposed method can work with vectors of any dimension. The benchmarks are conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and satellite imaging data DSTL. The paper also conducts an experiment on recoloration.\n\n# Quality\n\nWhile I like the general idea to explore the methods of using complex and hyper-complex representations, I found that this work is weak both in terms of the theoretical and experimental research.\n\nThe theoretical part of the paper proposes a method to multiply n-dimensional vectors similarly to complex and quaternion numbers. This method is not a generalization of the former two (as seen in Eq 2, 4). I am concerned that the paper does not discuss the properties of the operation. Such numbers do not form an algebra and they are not commutative. While quaternions are neither commutative they exhibit useful properties, like associations with rotations. \n\nAnother important aspect missing in the theoretical part of the paper is how to define the batch-norm.\n\nThe experimental part also looks weak. I am not convinced about the significance of CIFAR results. There is also no \"apple to apple\" comparison for the networks with the same amount of parameters. The results reported in Table 2 contradict the claim that the proposed method outperforms the quaternions.\n\nThe DSTL results look significant. I think, this result demonstrates the strength of the proposed method. Therefore I encourage to extend this section to give more details on this experiment. Even though, the result is not SOTA here, the previous results should be mentioned in the table (Kaggle winner entry is ~0.49).\n\n# Clarity\n\nThe paper is clearly written and easy to follow. The math is explained well and helps to build intuition about the proposed method. One point I found unclear if the L is shared or learned separately for each layer. This seems to be an important difference from complex and quaternion numbers. The paper would benefit from discussion of parameter L and ablation experiments on its importance.\n\n# Originality\n\nThe paper is original.\n\n# Significance\n\nThe paper is significant for the community. There are plenty of applications where we need to encode multidimensional data. While I do not believe that this work is a clear cut solution for such applications, it is a step in the right direction.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis is an ok paper, but needs many improvements:\n\n- Error bars for experiments\n- Comparisons to previously published results\n- It would greatly benefit from running this method with close to SOTA architecture, for example DenseNet for CIFAR\n- Discussions on the properties of the proposed operation\n- Derivations for batch-norm\n\n## EDIT: Update\n\nThe paper was improved. In particular I like the added explanation of the batch-norm and some improved explanation and phrasing.\n\nNevertheless, the experimentation remains weak both compared to the state of the art and previously published work (e.g. CIFAR reported in Trabelsi et al., 2017 and Gaudet & Maida, 2017).\n\nTherefore, I increase the score by one point, as this work is just very slightly above the acceptance threshold right now.

This should clarify that we are only getting parameter count reduction of an added benefit, but the main goal is to capture that each output unit shares the weights and are therefore forced to discover joint correlations within the input dimensions. The reviewer's suggested experiments comparing other models have merit if one is trying to establish SOTA performance, however that is not our main point and we reserve that for future work.\n- We feel the overall goal clarification of trying to capture complex/hyper-complex algebras forced local relations may paint the experiments in a different light. The CIFAR work shows a simple comparison against work previously done with complex and hyper-complex CNNs. The CAE experiments show strong evidence we did capture the important piece of the compared quaternion results, while dropping the dimensionality constraints imposed by the algebra. To remove the confusion about the Jaccard Score we pointed out that it is the Intersection-Over-Union (IOU). We do not understand the concern with comparing the real-valued U-Net model to the Vector Map U-Net because the data presented in Table 3 did show the results of the comparison.\n\n---\nAddressing Questions and Feedback:\n\nWe added clarification about the increased computation of both quaternion and vector map batch-norm. In a way you are trading memory for compute, but the quaternion and vector map models have higher accuracy.\n\nThank you for the space reduction feedback, we have removed unneeded figures.\n\nWe have also fixed the numbers in Table 2 (PSNR results)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper473/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper473/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Removing Dimensional Restrictions on Complex/Hyper-complex Convolutions", "authorids": ["~Chase_John_Gaudet1", "~Anthony_S._Maida1"], "authors": ["Chase John Gaudet", "Anthony S.

It is proposed that using these operations in a convolutional kernel will result in higher parameter efficiency for the same accuracy. The authors derive the functional formula for the vector map by generalizing the quaternion algebra proposed in a previous paper in the literature.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPositives and negatives\n\n+ The approach is very interesting from a theoretical perspective, and the derivation proposed is well motivated and sufficiently explained in the methods section.\n\n+ The figures are well constructed and illustrate the point very concisely.\n\n- The major problem with this paper is that it severely goes over the 8 page limit, which is hidden by putting a lot of figures that are crucial to understanding the main text in the appendix. I believe this is a violation of the submission rules.\n\n- The paper does not do a good enough job of discussing related approaches that also reduce parameter efficiency (e.g. separable convolutions, dynamic convolutions, stand-alone self-attention) or that mix channels in a similar spirit (e.g. ICLR 2020 \u201cmultiplicative interactions and where to find them\u201d) \n\n- The results are not convincing. For the satellite data case, the authors show that their proposal achieves a slightly lower Jaccard Score with fewer parameters, but it\u2019s not clear at all what is the Jaccard Score or what its scale is. So I have no idea how a \u201cUNet Real\u201d Architecture with 5.9M parameters would compare with the proposed Vector Map Unet.\n\n- In the case of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 the architecture does seem to give some improvements in parameter efficiency. But how does it compare to previous work in parameter efficiency as discussed above?\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRecommendation\n\nWith the paper in its current state I have to recommend a strong reject because it seems to be violating the conference guidelines by putting several crucial images beyond the 8 page limit. If this issue is addressed, the recommendation can be reviewed. In that case, I would still recommend more work in the experiments section (More comparisons for the image classification task, better explanation and comparisons for satellite task).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuestions\n\nWhat is the Jaccard Score?\nWhile the networks are shown to be more parameter efficient, what about the FLOPS of the resulting networks? Are we effectively trading memory for compute?\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFeedback (not related to the score)\n\nMy suggestion to the authors to gain some space would be to completely remove section 4.2 or move to appendix, and use that space for the actually important figures. Not only is current figure 2 occupying a lot of space while making a weak argument, the whole section does not help in understanding either why Vector Map convolutions work, nor persuade the reader that they are empirically better (in fact the PSNR results look quite a bit worse).\nIn general I would recommend the authors to tighten their writing quite a bit. For example the authors repeat quite a lot of motivation for Hamiltonian algebra. While it\u2019s useful to provide some context in a paper, the authors could summarize that information a bit better so that the reader can get to the actual contribution, the Vector Map convolution faster. On the other hand, it might be worthwhile spending a bit more time explaining  the DSTL challenge, even with a figure, since most readers will not be familiar with it.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper473/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper473/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Removing Dimensional Restrictions on Complex/Hyper-complex Convolutions", "authorids": ["~Chase_John_Gaudet1", "~Anthony_S._Maida1"], "authors": ["Chase John Gaudet", "Anthony S.
