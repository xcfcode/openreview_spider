Thus, the curse of sample size does not occur for fixed d. \n\nSecond, behind the order notation, there is a term depending on d. Actually, the log(n)^d term is originally comes from (log(n)/d)^d term (more precisely, it comes from D_{K,d} defined in Sec.3.2 where K will be O(log(n))). Thus, this term slowly increases (O(n^\\epsilon) for a small constant \\epsilon) under an assumption that d <= C log(n) for a sufficiently small C. On the other hand, for the convergence rate n^{-2s/(2s + d)} on the Besov space, d is not allowed to be log(n)-order. Actually, as long as d is log(n)-order, n^{-2s/(2s + d)} does not converges to 0. This contrasts the difference of the two settings, Besov and m-Besov settings.\n\nFinally, we also would like to remark that if d is O(log(n)), then the overall convergence rate will be changed.

How can piecewise linear approximations of piecewise polynomial functions lead to minimax optimal rates? \n\nA: Thank you for raising a concern about an important point. As you concern, a piecewise linear approximation does \"not\" achieve the minimax optimal rate. This is because we need large number of linear pieces to approximate smooth functions. Hence, as long as we use a shallow network, we can not achieve the minimax rate with ReLU activation. However, the situation is very different if we use a deep neural network. Actually, the number of pieces \"exponentially\" grows up as the depth increases, and this property enables us to approximate the higher order B-spline bases by ReLU-DNN with a log(n)-order size. This is the main reason why we can achieve the minimax rate (up to log(n)-term) by the ReLU-DNN.\n\n(2)\nQ: A second question is ... how should I interpret claims like \"any linear/non-linear approximator\nwith fixed N -bases does not achieve the approximation error ... in some parameter settings such as 0 < p < 2 < r \"?\nWavelets provide a fixed N-basis and achieve optimal rates for Besov spaces. \n\nA: \nIndeed, the Donoho-Johnstone's wavelet shrinkage estimator achieves the minimax optimal rate in terms of the estimation error. Here, we would like to emphasize that the approximation error analysis and estimation error analysis are separated (although they are closely connected): the approximation error is evaluated by the number of bases and the estimation error is evaluated by the sample size. As for the approximation error analysis, the shrinkage estimator should prepare a huge number of bases beforehand which could be much larger than the number of non-zero parameters selected by the shrinkage estimator. In that sense, there is no contradiction about the approximation error analysis because the Kolmogorov width states only about the total number of bases which should be prepared beforehand. On the other hand, a remarkable property of the shrinkage estimator is that it appropriately selects a small number of subsets of the bases in an adaptive way (in this sense, the wavelet shrinkage is an adaptive method). Consequently, it achieves the minimax optimal estimation error rate although the whole number of parameters is still large compared with the selected non-zero components. This adaptivity highly relies on the non-linearity of the soft thresholding operator.\nOn the other hand, the deep neural network directly constructs the necessary number of bases for each function in the Besov space. This contrasts the shrinkage estimator; that is, the shrinkage estimator prepare a large number of bases first and then selects a small subset of them (which leads to the minimax optimal estimation error), on the other hand, deep learning directly generates the required bases.\nThis difference would be analogous to the relation between a sparse estimator and a low rank matrix estimator.\n\nThe difference between the linear estimator and the nonlinear estimator occurs when p < 2 = r (Proposition 3). Interestingly, this is the regime where the approximation errors are different between adaptive methods and non-adaptive ones (see Eq.(5)). In this setting (p < 2 = r), functions is the Besov space can has high spatially inhomogeneous smoothness which is hard to be captured by a linear method.\n\n(3)\nQ: A minor note: some of the references are strange\n\nA:\nThank you for your informative suggestion. The citation [Gine & Nickl, 2015] for the minimax optimal rate on a Besov spaces is a comprehensive text book that was not intended to be the original paper but just a nice reference to overview the literature.

As you pointed out, using another terminology such as a \"regularized empirical risk minimizer\" might be more specific instead of \"deep learning.\" However, the purpose of this paper is to show the superiority and limitation of deep neural network approaches by investigating its best achievable performance.

Actually, we think this type of analysis is becoming popular in the statistics community. Moreover, recent intensive studies about convergence properties of SGD for deep learning implies that it is not so much vacuous to assume we can achieve the global optimal solution with a good generalization guarantee.

Imo, this is standard in most texts I have seen. \n\nA:\nThank you for your detailed comment. Yes, it is one of very popular definitions of the Holder class for integer beta. On the other hand, one could also define it just by max_{|\\alpha|<=beta}||D^\\alpha f||_\\infty where the last term is not involved (in other words, beta=m). Moreover, it could be defined by B_{\\infty,\\infty}^m. Unfortunately, for an integer \\beta, these spaces do \"not\" coincide with each other. To avoid this kind of confusions, we decided to define the Holder space only for non-integer beta.\n\n(4)\nQ: - The authors claim that the approximation error does not depend on the dimensionality needs clarification, since N clearly depends on the dimension. ... what the authors meant was that the   exponential dependence on d has now been eliminated. \n\nA:\nYes, the convergence rate is dependent on d. What we have meant by \"exponential dependence on d is avoided\" is that the dimensionality d is not coming directly to the polynomial order of n, that is, the exponent of the term n^{-2s/(2s + 1)}. Indeed, d also comes into the exponent of the log(n)-term as log(n)^d. However, comparing the polynomial order and poly-log order, poly-log order is milder. Then, we said \"the curse of dimensionality is eased.\"\n\n(5)\nQ: Other - On page 4, what does the curly arrow notation mean? \n\nA:\nIt means a continuous embedding. Namely, if X \\hookrightarrow Y for two norm spaces X and Y, then X can be continuously embedded in Y (i.e., X is a subset of Y and there exists a constant C such that |x|_Y <= C |x|_X for x \\in X). We have added the definition in the revised version.\n\n(6)\nQ:- Given the technical nature of the paper, the authors have done a good job with the presentation.

We have revised our paper according to your comments, though unfortunately some of them could not be addressed due to the lack of space.\n\n(1)\nQ: My main criticism is that the total rate of convergence (estimation error + approximation error) has not been presented in a transparent way. ... how the parameters W, L etc. should be chosen so as to balance them. \n \nA:\nWe have presented the approximation error bound in a concrete way to minimize misunderstandings, which would have made the presentation a bit opaque instead. The error bound O(N^{-s/d}) is rather typical notation in the approximation theory. Since we think the parameters s,p,q,d as constants, the approximation error in Proposition 1 can be written as R_r = O(N^{-s/d}) under the conditions L=O(log(N)) (depth), W = O(N) (width) and S = O(N log(N)) (sparsity) for an integer N. Roughly speaking, N corresponds the number of parameters, S, upto log(N) order. Thus the convergence rate is written as a function of the number of parameters under an appropriate choice of depth L and width W. We can see that the convergence rate of the error is completely controlled by the smoothness s and the dimensionality d against the number of parameters S. On the other hand, as for the m-Besov case, the approximation error is evaluated as O(N^{-s} \\log^{s(d-1)}(N)) for L=O(log(N)), W = O(N) and S = O(N log(N)) for an integer N. Here we again observe that the convergence rate is controlled by the smoothness s and the dimensionality d. We think these representations are more transparent. We have added sentences to explain these relations just after Proposition 1 and Theorem 1.\n\n(2)\nQ: While the mixed Besov spaces enables better bounds, the condition appears quite strong. In fact, the lower bound is better than for traditional Holder/Sobolev classes. Can you please comment on how th m-Besov space compares to Holder/Sobolev classes? Also, can you similarly define mixed Holder/Sobolev spaces where traditional linear smoothers might achieve minimax optimal results? \n\nA:\nYes, the condition for the mixed Besov space is much stronger than the ordinary Besov space. Yes, we can define mixed smooth Holder/Sobolev space. They are defined just by setting p=q=infty or p=q=2. Hence, the mixed smooth Besov space is much wider class of mixed smooth Holder/Sobolev space. Roughly speaking, the mixed smooth Besov space consists of functions having form g(f_1(x_1),...,f_d(x_d)) where each f_i(x_i) is a function in a Besov space on [0,1] and g:R^d \\to R is a sufficiently smooth function. Then, we can see that the m-Besov space includes an additive model \\sum_{i=1}^d f_i(x_i) and a tensor model \\sum_r \\prod_{i=1}^d f_{r,i}(x_i) as special cases. \nWe can also define an intermediate function class between the ordinary Besov space and the m-Besov space by taking a tensor product of B_{p,q}^s([0,1]^{d_1}), ..., B_{p,q}^s([0,1]^{d_K}) where d_1 + d_2 + ... d_K = d (if each d_i = 1, then it is reduced to the m-Besov space). We can also show a convergence rate which is between those of the m-Besov space and the Besov space, but we don't pursue this direction due to space limitation.

The authors show that deep Relu networks,\nunlike linear smoothers, can achieve minimax optimality. Moreover, they show that in a\nrestricted class of functions called mixed Besov spaces, there is significantly milder\ndependence on dimensionality. Even more interestingly, the Relu network is able to\nadapt to the smoothness of the problem.\n\nWhile I am not too well versed on the background material, my educated guess is that the\nresults are interesting and relevant, and that the analysis is technically sound.\n\n\n\nDetailed Comments:\n==================\n\n\nMy main criticism is that the total rate of convergence (estimation error + approximation\nerror) has not been presented in a transparent way. The estimation error takes the form\nof many similar results in nonparametric statistics, but the approximation error is\ngiven in terms of the parameters of the network, which depends opaquely on the dimension\nand other smoothness parameters. It is not clear which of these terms dominate, and\nconsequently, how the parameters W, L etc. should be chosen so as to balance them.\n\n\nWhile the mixed Besov spaces enables better bounds, the condition appears quite strong.\nIn fact, the lower bound is better than for traditional Holder/Sobolev classes. Can you\nplease comment on how th m-Besov space compares to Holder/Sobolev classes? Also, can\nyou similiarly define mixed Holder/Sobolev spaces where traditional linear smoothers\nmight achieve minimax optimal results?\n\n\nMinor:\n- Defn of Holder class: you can make this hold for integral beta if you define m to be\nthe smallest integer less than beta (e.g. beta=7, m=6). Imo, this is standard in most\ntexts I have seen.\n- The authors claim that the approximation error does not depend on the dimensionality\n  needs clarification, since N clearly depends on the dimension. If I understand\n  correctly, the approximation error is in fact becoming smaller with d for m-Besov\n  spaces (since N is increasing with d), and what the authors meant was that the\n  exponential dependnence on d has now been eliminated. Is this correct?\n\nOther\n- On page 4, what does the curly arrow notation mean?\n- Given the technical nature of the paper, the authors have done a good job with the\n  presentation. However, in some places the discussion is very equation driven. For e.g.\n  in the 2nd half of page 4, it might help to explain many of the quantities presented in\n  plain words.\n\n\n\nConfidence: I am reasonably familiar with the nonparametric regression literature, but\nnot very versed on the deep learning theory literature.

The general idea of connecting network parameters such as depth, width, and sparsity to classical function spaces is interesting and could lead to novel insights into how and why these networks work and under what settings. The authors carefully define Besov spaces and related literature, and overall the paper is clearly written. \n\nDespite these strengths, I'm left with several questions about the results. The most critical is this: piecewise polynomials are members of the Besov spaces of interest, and ReLU networks produce piecewise linear functions. How can piecewise linear approximations of piecewise polynomial functions lead to minimax optimal rates? The authors' analysis is based on cardinal B-spline approximations, which generally makes sense, but it seems like you would need more terms in a superposition of B-splines of order 2 (piecewise linear) than higher orders to approximate a piecewise polynomial to within a given accuracy. The larger number of terms should lead to worse estimation errors, which is contrary to the main result of the paper. I don't see how to reconcile these ideas. \n\nA second question is about the context of some broad claims, such as that the rates achieved by neural networks cannot be attained by any linear or nonadaptive method. Regarding linear methods, I agree with the author, but I feel like this aspect is given undue emphasis. The key paper cited for rates for linear methods is the Donoho and Johnstone Wavelet Shrinkage paper, in which they clearly show that nonlinear, nonadaptive wavelet shrinkage estimators do indeed achieve minimax rates (within a log factor) for Besov spaces. Given this, how should I interpret claims like \"any linear/non-linear approximator\nwith fixed N -bases does not achieve the approximation error ... in some parameter settings such as 0 < p < 2 < r \"?\nWavelets provide a fixed N-basis and achieve optimal rates for Besov spaces. Is the constraint on p and r a setting in which wavelet optimality breaks down? If not, then I don't think the claim is correct. If so, then it would be helpful to understand how relevant this regime for p and r is to practical settings (as opposed to being an edge case). \n\nThe work on mixed Besov spaces (e.g. tensor product space of 1-d Besov spaces) is a fine result but not surprising.\n\nA minor note: some of the references are strange, like citing a 2015 paper for minimax rates for Besov spaces that have been known for far longer or a 2003 paper that describes interpolation spaces that were beautifully described in DeVore '98. It would be appropriate to cite these earlier sources.
