In the contrary, the authors propose to discretize the target space to construct a differentiable approximation of the utility function.\n\nI'm really not an expert on multi resource spatial coverage, so I am not able to judge if the presented results are original, nor significant.\n\nHowever, I found the paper clearly written, and the subject nicely presented with examples.\n\nI suggest a few points of improvement:\n- Part of the conclusion and the abstract mention that the paper proved that \"multiple-ressources are combinatorially hard to approximate with neural networks\". I didn't see proofs of that statement, I agree that the authors develop an approach that doesn't seem to suit NN and they outperform a few NN. This can be enough to show that the presented method is efficient but it is not enough to claim that the compared methods are not. \n- I read appendix A1, and I still do not understand why the NN curves, why do they have biases ?\n- In table 1 and 2, it would be great to indicate how confidence intervals are computed.\n\n\n----- Edit after rebutal ------\n\nThank you for the answers.\nThe authors only answered partly my concerns. I'm still not convinced by their explanation on the NN curves. I don't understand how their performance decreases with the number of iterations, it seems that they weren't well tuned.\n\nAnyway I've been convinced by R4 and R1 that a few baseline models are missing.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3170/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3170/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Differentiable Approximations for Multi-resource Spatial Coverage Problems", "authorids": ["~Nitin_Kamra1", "~Yan_Liu1"], "authors": ["Nitin Kamra", "Yan Liu"], "keywords": ["Multi-agent coverage", "Multi-resource coverage", "Areal coverage", "Differentiable approximations"], "abstract": "Resource allocation for coverage of physical spaces is a challenging problem in robotic surveillance, mobile sensor networks and security domains.

We first request you to read our joint response to all reviewers posted separately and we further address your individual comments below.\n\nQ1. \"I am slightly concerned that this paper's work does not really fit ICLR, as its goal is to approximate the Nash Equilibrium of a game, without any learning process involved.\"\n\nA1. This paper is not about approximating Nash Equilibria of a game. Please also see our joint response to all reviewers for more clarification on this. As for having no learning involved, our key contribution is to derive and implement an unbiased gradient estimator for coverage problems. In so far as we understand, ICLR also invites papers involving statistical techniques, optimization, gradient estimation and other ML applications. Our work fits as a gradient estimation technique and can also be further extended for general purpose learning involving coverage.\n\nQ2. \"The presentation of this paper lacks clarity and a good structure. I could not figure out the problem this paper wants to solve after reading the first three pages. The abstract and the introduction claim that the paper wants to solve the resource allocation problem, but it turns out the specific target is to approximate the gradient.\"\n\nA2. We understand the confusion caused due to the structure of the paper. We will address this in the updated draft. Please also see our joint response to all reviewers.\n\nQ3. \"From my view, using the proposed decomposition is a doable method, but I cannot see the novelty in doing so. The paper mentions some hardness to be overcome: (a) the integration has no closed-form and (b) the coverage drops to zero outside the coverage area. However, the paper does not justify how the aimed hardness was addressed by the proposed method.\"\n\nA3. As you rightly mentioned, the hardness is in dealing with the finite coverage fields and not having a closed-form for the integrals. The former, namely the discontinuity in coverage has been addressed in the proof of Theorem 1 (sec 3.1). The key idea is to break the integral in two parts at the resource's coverage boundaries and then apply the Newton-Leibniz theorem to both parts separately. We subsequently use geometric relations between the boundaries of resulting integrals and implicit boundary differentiation to derive the full gradient expression. The latter, namely, the approximation of integrals is handled using spatial discretization and is explained in section 3.2.\n\nQ4. \"The paper mentions some existing methods (such as DeepPF in a published paper) but does not take them as competitors. I am also confused that the paper names the proposed method also as DeepPF, so how does it compare to the existing DeepPF?\"\n\nA4. We have included both results of the original DeepFP and of our modifications to it in table 2. We still call the method DeepFP since we have not introduced a fundamentally new game theoretic algorithm in this paper (as also mentioned in our joint response to all reviewers), but rather replaced certain sub-components of DeepFP with our contributions to highlight their effectiveness. The numbers for original DeepFP were in the \"brnet\" part of Table 2 with the nn-function approximator (also mentioned in sec 4.2 on page 8).\n\nQ5. \"It looks like the competitors in experiments are baselines without much calibration. The information in the appendix does not provide sufficient details.\"\n\nA5. We have tried to adequately tune, calibrate and even replace parts of DeepFP wherever applicable and have provided results with all the variants in Table 2. If you can let us know exactly what is missing, we will be happy to provide the details and/or calibrate our approach better.\n\nQ6. \"Instead of providing code in the appendix, it could better to include source files and datasets in the supplementary materials. The currently provided information does not support reproducibility.\"\n\nA6. The pseudo-code in the appendix is not for reproducing the complete project. The full code-base is large and would indeed have to be uploaded in a separate repository. The pseudo-code is only present to explain a sub-component of the framework, namely, our efficient divide-and-conquer discretizer to discretize sets into binary tensors. We will be happy to upload the full code as a separate repository upon acceptance.\n\nQ7. Other writing improvements.\n\nA7. We are happy to incorporate the other writing changes that you have suggested in the updated draft.\n\nWe hope that the above explanations clarify your concerns."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3170/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3170/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Differentiable Approximations for Multi-resource Spatial Coverage Problems", "authorids": ["~Nitin_Kamra1", "~Yan_Liu1"], "authors": ["Nitin Kamra", "Yan Liu"], "keywords": ["Multi-agent coverage", "Multi-resource coverage", "Areal coverage", "Differentiable approximations"], "abstract": "Resource allocation for coverage of physical spaces is a challenging problem in robotic surveillance, mobile sensor networks and security domains.

Please see our joint response to all reviewers.\n\nQ2. \"The author believes discretization the continuous domain is not a good way to solve resource allocation problem. However, the proposed method still have to adopte the discretization on computing the integral of r and \\partial r/u.\"\n\nA2. Saying that discretization is not a good way without context can be misleading! Our claim is that when one discretizes the action set for placing the resources, it results in a combinatorial explosion in the solution space. For instance, discretizing the (x,y,z) coordinates of drones in our example 1 into B bins along each axis gives B^3 locations for the placement of a single drone. With m drones (a.k.a. resources), one has to test for B^(3m) locations which scales exponentially with m. With just 100 bins per axis and just one drone, one already has to explore 100^(3) = 1 million bins. For as small as m=2, the number becomes 10^12!! Instead, we keep the action space U undiscretized so we can exploit the continuity in action u and incrementally tune it using gradients (\\partial r / \\partial u). We only discretize the underlying target domain (not the same as action space) into bins when approximating the spatial integrals required during evaluation of r and its above-mentioned gradient. Since its size is fixed and independent of m, such discretization does not lead to any combinatorial explosion with increasing number of resources (m).\n\nQ3. Comparison against PSRO.\n\nA3. We do not introduce any new game-theoretic algorithms in this paper to try and outperform existing methods like PSRO (as also described in our joint response to all reviewers). The mention of sample efficiency and high variance of policy gradients is to motivate the usage of actor-critic methods in the subsequent paragraph of the introduction. This paper does not aim to address sample efficiency and high variance of policy gradient based methods.

We want to clarify some misunderstandings about the paper for all reviewers and will address the individual queries from all reviewers in separate responses.\n\nThis paper's key contribution is to derive an unbiased gradient estimator for the multi-resource coverage problem and provide a discretization-based framework to approximate it. In this process, we address the following key challenges: (a) each resource has discontinuities at the boundaries of its coverage field, and (b) the objective function takes the form of an integral over an arbitrary [and potentially non-convex] shaped target domain, which has no closed-form expression.\n\nWe then show the application of our gradient estimation framework for both single and two agent multi-resource coverage problems. However, due to the inclusion of the adversarial two-agent domain as a potential application, we have had to include considerable discussion on game theory, nash equilibria and fictitious play based methods while formulating the problem and solution techniques. We have also had to dedicate a sizeable chunk of space to experiments involving variants of the DeepFP method (Kamra et al. 2019). This has led to the reviewers:\n1. Having trouble understanding the contributions [R1], \n2. Finding the notation cumbersome [R3],\n3. Believing that the paper is about approximating Nash Equilibrium [R1], and\n4. Feeling that our method is just an incremental improvement over DeepFP [R4] and whether it can outperform other game theoretic methods like PSRO [R4].\n\nWe want to clarify that our work is not focused on developing a new method to approximate Nash Equilibria or compete against existing methods like DeepFP or PSRO. Our work proposes an unbiased gradient estimation framework for coverage problems and to showcase its use-cases we have applied our framework as a sub-component within existing methods: (a) within gradient ascent for the single agent coverage example, and (b) within DeepFP for the adversarial two-agent example. The novelty of our work lies in proposing the gradient estimation framework for such applications, where it would normally not be possible to use gradient-based methods since an unbiased gradient estimator is unavailable or otherwise one would have to train differentiable approximators, e.g. neural nets, to get an estimate of the gradient (like DeepFP does).\n\nWe plan to substantially re-write the paper for the next draft to make the notation less cumbersome and move the game-theoretic aspects into a single section so that the true contributions of the paper are better highlighted."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3170/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3170/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Differentiable Approximations for Multi-resource Spatial Coverage Problems", "authorids": ["~Nitin_Kamra1", "~Yan_Liu1"], "authors": ["Nitin Kamra", "Yan Liu"], "keywords": ["Multi-agent coverage", "Multi-resource coverage", "Areal coverage", "Differentiable approximations"], "abstract": "Resource allocation for coverage of physical spaces is a challenging problem in robotic surveillance, mobile sensor networks and security domains.

The proposed method simulates the game by iteratively updating the best response, and the main contribution is an algorithm to approximate the gradient of the utility function with respect to the resource allocation (over the space). In particular, the paper proposes to decompose the gradient into two parts and estimate each part by discretization. \n\n##########################################################################\nWhile the paper presents a viable method, I vote for reject for several reasons. The paper does not successfully justify the merits of the proposed method, with many hidden parts that are hard to follow. The paper lacks a good organization, and the writing could have been more formal (see detailed comments). The experiments are not convincing.\n##########################################################################\n\nDetailed comments:\n\nFirst of all, I am slightly concerned that this paper's work does not really fit ICLR, as its goal is to approximate the Nash Equilibrium of a game, without any learning process involved. The only part I see relevant is that two learning-based methods were adopted as competitors.  \n\nThe presentation of this paper lacks clarity and a good structure. I could not figure out the problem this paper wants to solve after reading the first three pages. The abstract and the introduction claim that the paper wants to solve the resource allocation problem, but it turns out the specific target is to approximate the gradient. \n\nFrom my view, using the proposed decomposition is a doable method, but I cannot see the novelty in doing so. The paper mentions some hardness to be overcome: (a) the integration has no closed-form and (b) the coverage drops to zero outside the coverage area. However, the paper does not justify how the aimed hardness was addressed by the proposed method. \n\nThe paper mentions some existing methods (such as DeepPF in a published paper) but does not take them as competitors. I am also confused that the paper names the proposed method also as DeepPF, so how does it compare to the existing DeepPF?\n\nIt looks like the competitors in experiments are baselines without much calibration. The information in the appendix does not provide sufficient details. In addition, instead of providing code in the appendix, it could better to include source files and datasets in the supplementary materials. The currently provided information does not support reproducibility. \n\n\nThe organization and writing of this paper could be improved \u2013 e.g.,\n-\tPlease specify the domain when introducing a variable.\n-\tThe definition U=\\times_{p \\in P} {U_p} is problematic \u2013 {U_p} is wired since U_p is already a set.\n-\tThe definition cvg: q \\times u -> R is problematic \u2013 it should be cvg: Q \\times u -> R\n-\tInstead of saying the agents aim to achieve Nash equilibrium, it would be better to say the game will reach the Nash equilibrium. In addition, is the Nash equilibrium unique? \n-\t\u201cfor e.g.\u201d is not correct.\n\n\n\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3170/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3170/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Differentiable Approximations for Multi-resource Spatial Coverage Problems", "authorids": ["~Nitin_Kamra1", "~Yan_Liu1"], "authors": ["Nitin Kamra", "Yan Liu"], "keywords": ["Multi-agent coverage", "Multi-resource coverage", "Areal coverage", "Differentiable approximations"], "abstract": "Resource allocation for coverage of physical spaces is a challenging problem in robotic surveillance, mobile sensor networks and security domains.

However, the proposed method still have to adopte the discretization on computing the integral of r and \\partial r/u. Although the author emphasise that they do not need to discretize the action domain, but it seems to me that why it is significant is unclear. \n\n2. The author mentioned that model-free methods such as PSRO, has the issue of low sample efficiency and high variance issue for policy gradient methods, however, both of which has not been addressed by this work, and this proposed method is not compared to model-free method either. PSRO and its variants, for example, have shown many success on blotto type of game, so I think the advantages over PSRO [Lanctot 2017] type of methods need clarifying.
