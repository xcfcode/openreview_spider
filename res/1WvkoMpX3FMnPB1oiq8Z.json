An instantiation of SWWAE uses a convolutional net (Convnet) (LeCun et al. (1998)) to encode the input, and employs a deconvolutional net (Deconvnet) (Zeiler et al. (2010)) to produce the reconstruction. The objective function includes reconstruction terms that induce the hidden states in the Deconvnet to be similar to those of the Convnet. Each pooling layer produces two sets of variables: the \"what\" which are fed to the next layer, and its complementary variable \"where\" that are fed to the corresponding layer in the generative decoder.", "pdf": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02351.pdf", "paperhash": "zhao|stacked_whatwhere_autoencoders", "conflicts": ["nyu.edu"], "authors": ["Junbo Zhao", "Michael Mathieu", "Ross Goroshin", "Yann LeCun"], "authorids": ["junbo.zhao@cs.nyu.edu", "mathieu@cs.nyu.edu", "goroshin@cs.nyu.edu", "yann@cs.nyu.edu"]}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "tmdate": null, "cdate": 1454464564200, "ddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "duedate": 1455833700000, "tcdate": 1454464564200, "id": "ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/-/submission", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"pdf": null, "forum": null, "replyto": null, "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*", "description": "Your displayed identity associated with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"pdf": {"order": 4, "description": "Either upload a PDF file or provide a direct link to your PDF on ArXiv.", "value-regex": "upload|http://arxiv.org/pdf/.+"}, "title": {"order": 3, "description": "Title of paper.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "abstract": {"order": 4, "description": "Abstract of paper.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}, "authors": {"order": 1, "description": "Comma separated list of author names, as they appear in the paper.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "author_emails": {"order": 2, "description": "Comma separated list of author email addresses, in the same order as above.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "conflicts": {"order": 100, "description": "Semi-colon separated list of email domains of people who would have a conflict of interest in reviewing this paper, (e.g., cs.umass.edu;google.com, etc.).", "value-regex": "^([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))+(;[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))*$"}, "CMT_id": {"order": 5, "value-regex": ".*", "description": "If the paper is a resubmission from the ICLR 2016 Conference Track, enter its CMT ID; otherwise, leave blank."}}}, "invitees": [], "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "expdate": 1463609700000}}}], "count": 1}
