The main hypothesis is that stronger repulsive terms contribute towards learning discrete structures, while stronger attractive terms contribute towards learning continuous/manifold structures. The paper empirically explored the space parameterized by the relative weighting of the attractive and repulsive terms for the t-SNE and UMAP algorithms, using several data sets, and qualitatively confirmed their conclusions about the impact of the attractive and repulsion terms as the relative weights vary. \n\nThe experimental validation of the paper's main hypothesis is thorough and the use of diverse data sets and neighbor embedding methods is appreciated-- as the authors point out, several reviewers missed this contribution. However, several reviewers point out that the insight presented in the paper is already largely present in the literature, and that beyond its analysis the paper does not present new algorithms based on this insight. The authors rebut this claim by arguing that the novelty of the paper lies in it: (1) showing the contrary to the established opinion, UMAP works despite, instead of because, it uses cross-entropy loss, and (2) the paper offers for the first time a theoretical understanding of why ForceAtlas2 highlights continuous developmental trajectories, and (3) prior work has not made the connection between UMAP, ForceAtlas2, and t-SNE or suggested using exaggeration throughout the optimization process for t-SNE rather than simply as a warm-up. The paper does indeed present intuitions for (1)-(3) based on the attraction-repulsion ideas, and makes the connection between these neighbor embedding algorithms by viewing them as variations on the theme of attraction-repulsion, but these intuitions are not significant steps forward with respect to what is already known about how neighbor embeddings balance attraction and repulsion. The mathematical analyses consist of stating the gradient for the algorithms and explaining how weighing the attraction and repulsion terms differently lead to different qualitative observations. The use of exaggeration throughout the optimization process is straightforward, and no strong mathematical characterization of the properties of the resulting algorithm is given.\n\nIt is recommended that this paper be rejected, as it consists of a thorough empirical validation of an understanding of the trade-off between attractive and repulsive forces in neighbor embedding methods that was already present in the literature, along with some straightforward arguments connecting several popular neighbor embedding methods, but does not introduce any significantly new actionable insights or novel algorithms.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Unifying Perspective on Neighbor Embeddings along the Attraction-Repulsion Spectrum", "authorids": ["~Niklas_B\u00f6hm1", "~Philipp_Berens1", "~Dmitry_Kobak2"], "authors": ["Niklas B\u00f6hm", "Philipp Berens", "Dmitry Kobak"], "keywords": ["visualization", "t-SNE", "UMAP", "dimensionality reduction", "nonlinear dimensionality reduction"], "abstract": "Neighbor embeddings are a family of methods for visualizing complex high-dimensional datasets using kNN graphs.

The authors show that t-SNE, UMAP, FA2, and LE can be (approximately) unified as a common approach that use different levels of tradeoff between these two terms. They also discuss the increased attraction in UMAP as a result of negative sampling.\n\n\nReview: a main portion of the technical contribution of the paper is simply writing down the gradients of the commonly used DR methods and providing an intuitive comparison of gradient terms. However, there is not much rigorous mathematical result to support the claim. I am aware of the complexity of such a strong theoretical result (e.g. the work of (Arora et al. 2018)). However, the current version of the paper does not offer any concrete result and remains on an intuition level observation. The experiments partially support the claims, but similar observations have been made before in related work. For instance, (Amid and Warmuth 2019) qualitatively sort DR methods by means of their \"global score\" (which is a notion of how well a method preserves cluster information).\n\nA minor note on the experiments: in order to eliminate the bias in initializing some methods with PCA, I encourage the authors to also consider random (shared) initialization for all methods (Kobak and Linderman 2019). Also, since the paper is mainly experimental, (larger scale) experiments on a more diverse set of datasets would improve the paper.

So we think the paper clearly argues that large lambdas work the best and does not discuss the tradeoff that we focus on. Also, please note that the data in that Figure 3 is a small two-dimensional toy dataset with no cluster structure, whereas we analyze multiple high-dimensional real datasets with lots of structure. We are happy to extend our discussion of the EE paper also in the \"related work\" section, but we continue to maintain that our findings are novel and in particular go beyond the EE paper.\n\nWe will upload a revision on Monday.

However, we disagree with most of the listed Cons, and will respond to each of them below. In light of our replies, we would be glad if the reviewer would reevaluate their assessment. \n\n1. The novelty of our paper is in two parts. First, we show that varying the exaggeration in t-SNE leads to the continuity-discreteness tradeoff. Whereas \u201cearly exaggeration\u201d has been discussed and analyzed before in the exaggeration->\u221e limit, our results about spectrum and tradeoff are entirely novel. But second, even more importantly, we explain how UMAP and ForceAtlas2 fall on this spectrum, and this is 100% new results with no prior research whatsoever.\n\n  Perhaps it will be helpful to give some context here. t-SNE and UMAP (and to a smaller extent ForceAtlas2) are *immensely* popular methods in the single-cell transcriptomic community. Hundreds and thousands of biology papers use these methods to visualize single cell data. Recently, especially after Becht et al 2018 (Nat Biotechnology), the \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d in transcriptomic and also in manifold learning community is that UMAP is better suited for single cell analysis because its cross-entropy loss function is more adequate than the Kullback-Leibler loss function of t-SNE. There are numerous articles and popular blog posts that make this claim. Our work shows that this is simply not the case; in fact, UMAP works *despite* the cross-entropy loss (because negative sampling effectively lowers the repulsion by several orders of magnitude!). This is an entirely novel statement that we are certain must be surprising to many in the field.\n\n  Similarly, ForceAtlas2 is widely used in the transcriptomic community (see references in our paper) to highlight continuous developmental trajectories, and there has been no theoretical explanation for why it would work like this. Our paper resolves this puzzle.\n\n2. Several reviewers raised the concern that our conclusions are \u201conly empirical\u201d but we e.g. present a mathematical analysis of UMAP optimization, prove that it effectively decreases the repulsion, and then re-implement UMAP using Barnes-Hut to demonstrate this experimentally. We do not understand how this can be described as \u201conly empirical\u201d.\n\n3. The focus of this work was not in developing new methods, so the reviewer is right that this paper does not suggest any. Our goal was to provide a unifying framework to think about neighbor embeddings. We certainly hope that this can motivate further method development, e.g. by highlighting the continuity-discreteness tradeoffs between existing methods and opening the questions of how to preserve both types of structure in a single embedding, or how to choose which of the embeddings on this spectrum is more adequate to the underlying data.\n\n4. The reviewer suggests to analyze \u201cvarious real data [...] that have been studied in the literature\u201d but we feel there must be some confusion here because we used nine (!) different real datasets, five of which are published transcriptomic datasets extensively analyzed in the respective original publications. The main text shows 2 real datasets (Figures 1 and 3) and the Appendix shows 7 more (Figures S3--S11).

More importantly though, CP2010 suggested to slowly relax attraction forces, which is an important optimization trick, as we say in the Discussion. However, CP2010 did *not* suggest that different levels of attraction strength can yield separately interesting embeddings, and did *not* show any examples of real datasets where different attraction levels would show different aspects of the data. Moreover, CP2010 says nothing about UMAP or ForceAltas2, which is the entire focus of our paper. In light of that, we were surprised that the reviewer would characterize our manuscript as \u201cincremental\u201d.

For example, we present a mathematical analysis of UMAP optimization, prove that it effectively decreases the repulsion, and then re-implement UMAP using Barnes-Hut to demonstrate this experimentally. \n\n2) Of course whether a contribution is \u201csignificant\u201d enough is in the eye of the beholder, but we would like to draw reviewer\u2019s attention to the fact that the entire manifold learning community + the entire transcriptomic community is convinced that UMAP separates clusters and highlights continuous structures better than t-SNE due to mathematical properties of the cross-entropy loss. There are numerous articles and popular blog posts that make this claim. Our work shows that this is simply not the case; in fact, UMAP works *despite* the cross-entropy loss. This is not only novel, but also unexpected and important.\n\n3) Amid & Warmuth 2019 is a very interesting work (which we cite) and the \u201cglobal score\u201d that measures similarity of the embedding to the first two PCs is useful. However, in their experiments, t-SNE and UMAP get around the same \u201cglobal score\u201d, so we don\u2019t see how this is similar to our claim that t-SNE and UMAP have markedly different (orders of magnitude!) attraction strength.\n\n  Furthermore,  it would be interesting to approximately position TriMap (Amid & Warmuth 2019) on the attraction-repulsion spectrum, and inspection of Figure 5 of Amid & Warmuth 2019 suggests that TriMap has stronger attraction than UMAP (e.g. for Fashion MNIST the TriMap embedding looks remarkably close to the FA2 embedding shown in our paper). We would be happy to add some further discussion of TriMap into our Discussion.\n\nRegarding the experiments, we would like to point out two things:\n\n4) The reviewer seems to have overlooked that we *already* did the control experiment they are suggesting, i.e. we already used shared random initialization for our Figure 2. All our conclusions stay the same, irrespective of initialization. We can point that out more clearly in the text.\n\n5) The reviewer may also have overlooked all the other datasets shown in the Appendix.

The main message is that, Laplacian eigenmaps and t-SNE are governed by a single formula, and the difference of them can be seen as a difference of a hyperparameter value. We can also approximately recover two different embedding methods --- UMAP and ForceAtlas2. Using a few benchmark data sets, the relationships of these methods are visualized.\n\n\nDetailed comments:\nFirst of all, I have almost no experience to study visualization methods, and my assessments, especially towards non-technical parts, could be biased. \n\nThe main result --- a general equation that covers several embedding methods --- is technically interesting. However, it would be not clarified what kind of benefits we can get from the finding. A possible direction is to tune $\\rho$ so that we can get the most effective visualization. Is it possible to do something like this?\n\nAnother concern is that it is not easy to judge the visualization results (e.g. Fig 2) because they are qualitative and subjective. To prove the significance of this study, more quantitative results that everyone can understand would be necessary.\n\n\nMinor comments:\n- $\\sim$ in Eq. (3) seems to mean the equality up to constant but such usage would be not common. It would be better to add an explanation.
