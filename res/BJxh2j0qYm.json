FBS was applied to VGG-16 and reduced the amount of computation by a factor of 3.01x.  Inference now took 175.13ms, thus achieving a speedup of 2.97x (in terms of wall-clock time).  Similarly, a model with 4.00x computation reduction took 142.17 ms, which translates to a 3.66x actual speedup.  This means that the overhead of our PyTorch implementation is less than 10%.\n\nA line-by-line profiling of our implementation revealed that the overhead of the extra computations introduced by FBS in convolutional layers are fairly minimal (we have annotated the percentage of execution time of each component here: https://imgur.com/YVQormC ).  We found that the excessive data movements we mentioned earlier contribute to the majority of the observed overhead, while actual computations introduced by FBS amount to only 3.0% of the total time required to compute the layers.  As we have suggested, the data movements are entirely redundant due to API limitations.\n\nOur FBS-based ResNet-18 provided a 1.98x reduction in the amount of computation, which took 63.73 ms for each inference, while the baseline required 101.82 ms, thus achieving a 1.60x real performance gain.  We found that in addition to the overhead introduced by the FBS implementation above, the add operations for residuals cannot be accelerated in PyTorch for channel-wise sparse activations, and incur excessive copy operations as a result of the API limitations.  Even with these limitations, the real speedup provided by FBS surpasses/matches the actual speedups of all other works compared in Table 1:\n------------------------------------------------------------------ -------------- ------------- ------\nMethod                                                                                  Top-5 error  Theoretical  Real\n------------------------------------------------------------------ -------------- ------------- ------\nSoft Filter Pruning (He et al., 2018)                                            12.22%           1.72x  1.38x\nDiscrimination-aware Channel Pruning (Zhuang et al., 2018)    12.40%           1.85x  1.60x\nLow-cost Collaborative Layers (Dong et al., 2017)                    13.06%           1.53x  1.25x\nFeature Boosting and Suppression (this work)                          11.78%           1.98x  1.60x\n------------------------------------------------------------------ -------------- ------------- ------\n\nWe hope this answers your concern regarding the actual performance gains."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper748/Authors"], "readers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper748/Authors", "everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper748/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper748/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dynamic Channel Pruning: Feature Boosting and Suppression", "abstract": "Making deep convolutional neural networks more accurate typically comes at the cost of increased computational and memory resources.

To be specific, the proposed method firstly predicts the importance of each channel and then use an affine function to amplify/suppress the importance of different channels. However, the idea of dynamic channel pruning is not novel. Moreover, the comparisons in the experiments are quite limited. \n\nMy detailed comments are as follows.\n\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. The motivation for this paper is reasonable and very important. \n\n2. The authors proposed a new method for dynamic channel pruning.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. The idea of dynamic channel pruning is not novel. In my opinion, this paper is only an extension to Network Slimming (Liu et al., 2017). What is the essential difference between the proposed method and Network Slimming?\n\n2. The writing and organization of this paper need to be significantly improved. There are many grammatical errors and this paper should be carefully proof-read.\n\n3. The authors argued that the importance of features is highly input-dependent. This problem is reasonable but the proposed method still cannot handle it. According to Eqn. (7), the prediction of channel saliency relies on a data batch rather than a single data. Given different inputs in a batch, the selected channels should be different for each input rather than a general one for the whole batch. Please comment on this issue.\n\n4. The proposed method does not remove any channels from the original model. As a result, both the memory and the computational cost will not be reduced. It is confusing why the proposed method can yield a significant speed-up in the experiments.\n\n5. The authors only evaluate the proposed method on shallow models, e.g., VGG and ResNet18. What about the deeper model like ResNet50 on ImageNet?\n\n6. It is very confusing why the authors only reported top-5 error of VGG. The results of top-1 error for VGG should be compared in the experiments.\n\n7. Several state-of-the-art channel pruning methods should be considered as the baselines, such as ThiNet (Luo et al., 2017), Channel pruning (He et al., 2017) and DCP (Zhuang et al., 2018)\n[1] Channel pruning for accelerating very deep neural networks.

This problem is reasonable but the proposed method still cannot handle it.\nAccording to Eqn. (7), the prediction of channel saliency relies on a data batch rather than a single data. Given different inputs in a batch, the selected channels should be different for each input rather than a general one for the whole batch. Please comment on this issue.\"\n\nThe prediction of channel saliency *does not* rely on a batch of data. In equation (7), x_(l-1) is the output of the (l-1)-th layer, which comprises of C_(l-1) features, each feature has the spatial dimensions H_(l-1) * W_(l-1), as defined in Section 3.1. Throughout this paper, x_l for all layers is a single input image, which consists of multiple channels. Equation (7) reduces each channel in an image to a scalar, which is then used to predict the output channel saliencies in equation (8). Although this process is identical for each input image, each evaluation of equation (8) may produce drastically different predicted channel saliencies dependent on the input image.\n\nWe would like to update this section to remove any sources of ambiguity, would it be possible for you to describe how our intended meaning was lost?\n\n4. \"The proposed method does not remove any channels from the original model. As a result, both the memory and the computational cost will not be reduced. It is confusing why the proposed method can yield a significant speed-up in the experiments.\u201d\n\nIt is hopefully clear from previous comments that this is not the case.\n\nTypically, convolutional layers are stacked to form a sequential convolutional network. Prior to computing the costly convolution, FBS uses the input (or the output from the previous layer) to predict the saliencies of output channels of the costly convolution. If an output channel is predicted to have a zero saliency, the evaluation of this output channel can be entirely skipped, as the entire output channel is predicted to contain only zero entries.\n\nIn addition, each convolutional layer takes as its input the output of the previous layer. This input can have channel-wise sparsity (channels consisting of only zero entries), if the previous layer is a convolutional layer. It is clear that these inactive input channels can always be skipped when computing the convolution.\n\nThe input- and output-side sparsities therefore doubly accelerate the expensive convolution and thus achieve a huge reduction in compute. Such reduction in computation is also seen in [2], as it shares the same goal but uses an entirely different method.\n\n5. \"The authors only evaluate the proposed method on shallow models, e.g., VGG and ResNet18. What about the deeper model like ResNet50 on ImageNet?\"\n\nThe method we propose is a per-layer method, which should not make a difference when targeting deeper models. Unlike NS, we do not rank channel importance globally to produce pruning decisions. We are working on generating results on deeper models, but this might be limited by the amount of time available.\n\n6. \"It is very confusing why the authors only reported top-5 error of VGG. The results of top-1 error for VGG should be compared in the experiments.\"\n\nWe will update Table 2 to include top-1 errors. However, some works we compare to, e.g. He et al.'s channel pruning [4], may have missing top-1 errors as they were not reported.\n\n7. \"Several state-of-the-art channel pruning methods should be considered as the baselines, such as ThiNet (Luo et al., 2017), Channel pruning (He et al., 2017) and DCP (Zhuang et al., 2018).\"\n\nThank you for pointing out these works.

FBS adds small auxiliary layers on top of each existing convolution. These auxiliary layers have trainable parameters that are optimized using SGD and control whether individual channels are evaluated at run-time or not. Using this conditional execution, the overall computation required is reduced significantly. Furthermore, the output of the auxiliary layers is used to scale each channel output. Channel saliencies are computed by the auxiliary layers on a per input basis. FBS utilizes sparse input channels (from the previous dynamically pruned convolutional layer) to predict which channels to skip in the output channels, so that we have large reduction in computations, as we exploit both input- and output-side sparsities.\n\nThe weaknesses identified by the reviewer (1,3 and 4) do not hold for the approach described above. We will address each of these comments in turn.\n\nIntroductory statement:\n\"firstly predicts the importance of each channel and then use an affine function to amplify/suppress the importance of different channels\"\n\nThis statement is not true. To clarify, the amplification of channels is dependent on the input (Equation 5), whereas the suppression process effectively performs important channel selection (Equation 6). Both yield strictly non-affine transformations on the batch normalized channel output. \n\n1. \"The idea of dynamic channel pruning is not novel. In my opinion, this paper is only an extension to Network Slimming (Liu et al., 2017).\nWhat is the essential difference between the proposed method and Network Slimming?\"\n\nThe Network Slimming (NS) procedure is applied statically and only prunes channels away. Our technique is applied at run-time and is input dependent. We prune channels away and boost important channels at run-time.\n\nWe consider our method, FBS, to be very different from Network Slimming. For each input image during inference, FBS predicts the relative importance of each channel, and selectively evaluates a subset of output channels that are important for the subsequent layer, given the activation of the previous layer. Different input images would therefore activate drastically different execution paths in the model.\n\nFigure 3b corroborates this observation, as the heat maps show that many channels demonstrate high varying probabilities of being suppressed when being shown images of different categories. Our work is more related to runtime neural pruning [2] and conditional computation [3], where channels are dynamically selected for evaluation in each convolution, yet [2], [3] and FBS use very different methods to achieve this goal. In contrast, NS does not employ dynamic execution, as the pruned channels are *permanently removed* from the model, resulting in a network structure that remains static for all inputs where some capabilities will be permanently lost. \n\nIn addition, FBS preemptively steers feature attention: as FBS not only uses the saliency metrics to predicatively prune unimportant channels at run-time, it further amplifies important channels. The non-linearity added to the network is conceptually similar to Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) [1], as FBS captures inter-dependencies among input channels and adaptively recalibrates output features in a channel-wise fashion. Even without pruning, FBS can improve the baseline accuracies of CIFAR-10 and ImageNet models (Section 4.2), which is absent from static/dynamic channel pruning methods including NS, RNP, [4] and others.\n\nBecause of the above differences, FBS can achieve a much improved accuracy/compute trade-off when compared to other channel pruning methods.\n\n2. \"The writing and organization of this paper need to be significantly improved. There are many grammatical errors and this paper should be carefully proof-read.\"\n\nWe will complete another round of polishing to address any shortcomings. Could you suggest how/where the organization of the paper could be improved?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper748/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper748/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper748/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dynamic Channel Pruning: Feature Boosting and Suppression", "abstract": "Making deep convolutional neural networks more accurate typically comes at the cost of increased computational and memory resources.

Nevertheless, the authors did not present a real-world application in which it is important to speed up by 2 or 3 times at a small cost, so it is hard to judge the real impact of the proposed method.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper748/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dynamic Channel Pruning: Feature Boosting and Suppression", "abstract": "Making deep convolutional neural networks more accurate typically comes at the cost of increased computational and memory resources. In this paper, we reduce this cost by exploiting the fact that the importance of features computed by convolutional layers is highly input-dependent, and propose feature boosting and suppression (FBS), a new method to predictively amplify salient convolutional channels and skip unimportant ones at run-time. FBS introduces small auxiliary connections to existing convolutional layers. In contrast to channel pruning methods which permanently remove channels, it preserves the full network structures and accelerates convolution by dynamically skipping unimportant input and output channels. FBS-augmented networks are trained with conventional stochastic gradient descent, making it readily available for many state-of-the-art CNNs. We compare FBS to a range of existing channel pruning and dynamic execution schemes and demonstrate large improvements on ImageNet classification. Experiments show that FBS can respectively provide 5\u00d7 and 2\u00d7 savings in compute on VGG-16 and ResNet-18, both with less than 0.6% top-5 accuracy loss.", "keywords": ["dynamic network", "faster CNNs", "channel pruning"], "authorids": ["xt.gao@siat.ac.cn", "yaz21@cam.ac.uk", "lukaszd.mail@gmail.com", "robert.mullins@cl.cam.ac.uk", "czxu@um.edu.mo"], "authors": ["Xitong Gao", "Yiren Zhao", "\u0141ukasz Dudziak", "Robert Mullins", "Cheng-zhong Xu"], "TL;DR": "We make convolutional layers run faster by dynamically boosting and suppressing channels in feature computation.", "pdf": "/pdf/49336570b19e8f9fe58503dd974c4f8373b56ae6.pdf", "paperhash": "gao|dynamic_channel_pruning_feature_boosting_and_suppression", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\ngao2018dynamic,\ntitle={Dynamic Channel Pruning: Feature Boosting and Suppression},\nauthor={Xitong Gao and Yiren Zhao and \u0141ukasz Dudziak and Robert Mullins and Cheng-zhong Xu},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxh2j0qYm},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper748/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234385271, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "BJxh2j0qYm", "replyto": "BJxh2j0qYm", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper748/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335794406, "tmdate": 1552335794406, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper748/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 18}
