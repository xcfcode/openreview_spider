The central contribution is described as providing results for general activation functions. The technique is described as straightforward, but robust enough to handle a variety of activation functions. The reviewers found the method elegant. The most positive position was that the article develops non trivial techniques that extend existing universal approximation results for deep narrow networks to essentially all activation functions. However, the reviewers also expressed reservations mentioning that the results could be on the incremental side, with derivations similar to previous works, and possibly of limited interest. In all, the article makes a reasonable theoretical contribution to the analysis of deep narrow neural networks. Although this is a reasonably good article, it is not good enough, given the very high acceptance bar for this year's ICLR. \n", "title": "Paper Decision"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Universal Approximation with Deep Narrow Networks", "authors": ["Patrick Kidger", "Terry Lyons"], "authorids": ["kidger@maths.ox.ac.uk", "tlyons@maths.ox.ac.uk"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "universal approximation", "deep narrow networks"], "abstract": "The classical Universal Approximation Theorem certifies that the universal approximation property holds for the class of neural networks of arbitrary width.

Unlike recent results focusing on ReLU networks approximating scalar valued target functions, this paper provides universal approximation theorems for a wide range of activation functions and vector valued target functions. \n\nThis paper provides a number of universal approximation theorems on different activation functions, but the central result can be stated as follows: \nGiven input dimension n and output dimension m and activation \\rho, assume \\rho is a continuous function and there exists \\alpha \\in R such that \\rho is continuously differentiable at \\alpha and the derivative \\rho\u2019 is nonzero at \\alpha. Then, a fully connected network with layer width n+m+2 and unbounded depth can approximate any continuous function on a compact domain to arbitrary sup-norm accuracy.\n\nI would like to vote for acceptance of this paper because the authors develop nontrivial techniques that extend existing universal approximation results on width-bounded ReLU networks to essentially \u201call\u201d other activation functions. I think this paper is well-written and well-organized; it gives a good overview of the existing results that contextualizes this paper well, briefly summarizes the main results, and then reveals the details of construction. I haven\u2019t checked the full details of the proofs in the appendix, but as far as I can tell they look correct.\n\nWhile I think that Section 4 reveals the proof techniques reasonably well, I believe that proofs of Propositions 4.3 and 4.7 should be covered/sketched in greater detail in the main text. For example, Theorem 4.4 builds upon Proposition 4.3 by approximating identity function locally using \\rho. The main text only reveals approximation of identity function by \\rho and defers the whole proof of Proposition 4.3 to the appendix. I think adding proof sketches for the propositions will be more helpful to the readers, and to this end, cutting down some text in the recurring paragraph \u201cuniform continuity preserves uniform convergence\u2026\u201d should be helpful.\n\nAccording to Remark 4.9, it seems that the proof strategy for polynomials can also be applied to nonpolynomials. This motivates a natural question: why can\u2019t you apply the proof strategy for nonpolynomials to polynomials? I believe you can\u2019t because Proposition 4.3 relies on the existing universal approximation results which requires \\rho to be nonpolynomial (which is not mentioned in the main text). In my opinion, adding some comments on \u201cwhy nonpoly techniques can\u2019t be applied to poly activations\u201d would help readers better understand the proof techniques.\n\nAnother question just out of curiosity: can you prove tightness of your construction, e.g., show that a square model with width n+m is NOT a universal approximator?"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper405/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper405/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Universal Approximation with Deep Narrow Networks", "authors": ["Patrick Kidger", "Terry Lyons"], "authorids": ["kidger@maths.ox.ac.uk", "tlyons@maths.ox.ac.uk"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "universal approximation", "deep narrow networks"], "abstract": "The classical Universal Approximation Theorem certifies that the universal approximation property holds for the class of neural networks of arbitrary width.

They cite the paper by Lu et al '17 which essentially uses this proof technique).  \n\nWhile there are some technically interesting parts (e.g. the polynomial activation part has some trickiness in maintaining the width at n+m+1), I don't think will be very interesting to the ICLR community at large, and I think it is fairly incremental. \n\nThe writing is by and large clear, though Appendix C is a little wordy and hand-wavy. \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper405/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper405/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Universal Approximation with Deep Narrow Networks", "authors": ["Patrick Kidger", "Terry Lyons"], "authorids": ["kidger@maths.ox.ac.uk", "tlyons@maths.ox.ac.uk"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "universal approximation", "deep narrow networks"], "abstract": "The classical Universal Approximation Theorem certifies that the universal approximation property holds for the class of neural networks of arbitrary width.

We go on to consider extensions of this result. First we show an analogous result for a certain class of nowhere differentiable activation functions. Second we establish an analogous result for noncompact domains, by showing that deep narrow networks with the ReLU activation function exhibit the universal approximation property with respect to the $p$-norm on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Finally we show that width of only $n + m + 1$ suffices for `most' activation functions.", "pdf": "/pdf/aba857fa58e8744b9d3844a3e85f7faf6db48fbf.pdf", "paperhash": "kidger|universal_approximation_with_deep_narrow_networks", "original_pdf": "/attachment/526bc8e8569dd3c9811ad64931653c36d7364cb3.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkidger2020universal,\ntitle={Universal Approximation with Deep Narrow Networks},\nauthor={Patrick Kidger and Terry Lyons},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1xGGTEtDH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
