This is motivated by the idea that some types of misclassifications (e.g. mistaking one type of dog for another) may be less harmful than others (e.g. mistaking a dog for a truck); thus, adversarial examples will be more harmful if they cause coarse-grained errors as opposed to fine-grained ones. The authors further propose a network architecture that is designed to be more robust in the hierarchical sense, and they provide some experimental evidence comparing their methodology to standard adversarially trained networks.\n\nI am in favor of rejecting this paper because it does not provide adequate baselines or proper and thorough robustness evaluation, which is especially important for the field of adversarial robustness.\n\nThe main strength of this work is the idea to analyze hierarchical adversarial examples. The reasoning for studying this is sound, and using CIFAR-100 to do so seems quite reasonable (The fact that the authors focused on CIFAR for their work is fine for me. If the authors wish to also do experiments on ImageNet, hierarchies based on ImageNet can also be created based on https://wordnet.princeton.edu/, for example, as in https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04859.)\n\nHowever, the paper has weaknesses in terms of its baselines and evaluation. The main idea of studying hierarchical adversarial examples is clear, but is simple, so it would be good to have comprehensive evaluation to help us understand how different architectures, different training methods, and different Lp-norms and Lp-epsilon values affect this property. The authors only present results that vary the training method and they try two architectures (a standard ResNet34 and their proposed HAR architecture), but they do not study different Lp norms, epsilons, or a larger number of standard architectures.\n\nNext, it is not surprising that standard models, which are trained to be robust to standard (fine-grained) adversarial examples, are less robust to coarse-grained adversarial examples compared to HAR, which is specifically designed with the task of coarse-grained adversarial examples in mind. Instead, I would have liked to see a simple adversarial training baseline that involves creating coarse-grained adversarial examples during the adversarial training phase. Otherwise, it is hard to understand how much the HAR architecture itself is important (as opposed to focusing on coarse-grained adversarial robustness rather than fine-grained adversarial robustness during training). Finally, HAR is actually worse than standard networks (trained for fine-grained robust classification) on most evaluation metrics except for \u201ctargeted\u201d coarse attacks, where HAR shows some improved robustness.\n\nNext, evaluating robustness to adversarial examples in general requires much more rigor than is presented. This is a particularly problematic aspect of the robustness field, as pointed out in https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00420, https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06705, and https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08347. One example of a change is that the authors could perform a much stronger attack than PGD20 (e.g. PGD200 or PGD1000, and ideally with random restarts), in addition to performing the sanity checks discussed in https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06705, before claiming improved empirical robustness.\n\nMinor comment:\n\nMy understanding was that generating worst-case targeted hierarchical adversarial examples takes a long time, because it requires iterating over all possible fine-grained classes. Is there a way to make this faster? A faster way to do this would make it more feasible to do standard adversarial training, where coarse-grained adversarial examples are generated during the training.\n\n\nPost Rebuttal Update:\n\nI have read the author's rebuttal, and appreciate the additional experiments. I will maintain my score due to the importance of extensive evaluation for showing empirical robustness, and a lack of proper baselines. In particular, I think that some version of \"adversarial training with coarse labels\" should be better than standard adversarial training in terms of hierarchical robustness; only after that can we evaluate the benefits of HAR in comparison to \"adversarial training with coarse labels.\"", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2845/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2845/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving Hierarchical Adversarial Robustness of Deep Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~Avery_Ma1", "~Aladin_Virmaux1", "~Kevin_Scaman1", "~Juwei_Lu2"], "authors": ["Avery Ma", "Aladin Virmaux", "Kevin Scaman", "Juwei Lu"], "keywords": ["Adversarial Robustness"], "abstract": "Do all adversarial examples have the same consequences?

Specifically, the authors propose HAR networks, wherein the learning/inference problem is decomposed into coarse-grained classification followed by a number of fine-grained classifications. The proposed approach is evaluated on CIFAR-10 and (a subset of) CIFAR-100 for linf adversarial attacks.\n\nComments: The problem studied in this paper is a natural and pertinent one. The paper is also fairly well-written. The proposed approach does seem to offer some gains in coarse targeted accuracy, albeit occasionally at the cost of fine accuracy.  However:\n\n* One thing that is not entirely clear from the paper is how exactly the authors perform the worst-case targeted attack. The description in Section 2.1 is vague and the authors should clarify. From what I understand, the authors maximize the loss with respect to every fine-grained label belonging to a different coarse class and pick the worst. How exactly do the authors determine the loss with respect to fine-grained labels from other coarse classes? What happens if you instead do an *untargeted* attack on the *coarse classifier* alone? This exactly corresponds to the quantity of interest and the authors should include an evaluation based on this attack.\n\n* The authors do not justify why they choose separate networks for the coarse and fine classification tasks. One could imagine training a single flat model with a hierarchical robust loss. This idea has been explored in prior work for standard models---for instance, YOLO 9000 does this for ImageNet https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242. Does this perform worse than the HAR architecture proposed in the paper? Overall, training a flat classifier with a hierarchical loss seems like a more efficient and scalable approach for larger datasets that may have many levels of coarse classes.\n\n* I also think the claims in the paper would be stronger with additional evaluation. Specifically: (i) The authors should show that these trends hold for a few different eps and for l2-robust models as well. It would also be valuable to validate these results on all of CIFAR100 or even subsets of ImageNet (which may have more than one level of coarse labels). (ii) As a sanity check, the authors should evaluate the robustness of their models (trained with linf eps=8/255) as a function of inference time eps ([0, 1]) and PGD steps. Further, the authors should evaluate black box accuracy of their models.\n\nMinor:\n- Section 2.1 typo: \u201cnone-true target label\u201d.\n- Section 4.1 typo: \u201ctraininig\u201d.\n\nOverall, I think this paper studies an interesting problem, but could be improved in terms of experimental evaluation and comparison to baselines (as described above). I also have concerns about the scalability of this approach to larger datasets with a multi-level hierarchical structure. I would be happy to increase my score if the authors address my concerns.\n\n\n### Post-Rebuttal Update ###\n\nI thank the authors for their response and edits to the paper. In particular, the authors have tried to address comments from the reviewers pertaining to further empirical evaluation of their approach. However, I still have two concerns about the paper post-rebuttal:\n\n[Baselines] I share Reviewer 4's concern that the authors do not compare to several natural baselines. As I mentioned in my review, I am still not convinced about the design choice of using multiple networks for each set of coarse/fine-grained labels. There are a host of approaches (both training losses and architectures) to deal with hierarchical classification in the standard setting. The authors do not justify quantitatively why adapting these methods to the robust setting (i.e., incorporating ADV/TRADES there) will not work. Further, I do not find the justification of fine-grained labels within a dataset being uneven for using multiple networks to be sufficient . This seems like a more fundamental problem that should be fixed by changing the dataset/class hierarchy. In fact, having even coarse/fine classes is essential to justify the merits of HAR in the first place.\n\n[Evaluation] Based on the new results added to the paper in the rebuttal phase, it seems that HAR does worse than vanilla ADV on coarse accuracy under untargeted attacks (Table 1); while vanilla ADV  does worse than HAR using worst-case attacks (Table 2). If we compare the minimum over the two attacks (as is standard to correctly measure robustness), the coarse robustness is actually *better for vanilla ADV than HAR* (24.60% vs 20.71%). This finding seems to go against the main claim of the paper.\n\n[Other] There seems to be a discrepancy in Table 1---the robust accuracies go up between the PGD20 eval and PGD50 eval.\n\nBased on the concerns listed above, I will maintain my original score.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2845/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2845/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving Hierarchical Adversarial Robustness of Deep Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~Avery_Ma1", "~Aladin_Virmaux1", "~Kevin_Scaman1", "~Juwei_Lu2"], "authors": ["Avery Ma", "Aladin Virmaux", "Kevin Scaman", "Juwei Lu"], "keywords": ["Adversarial Robustness"], "abstract": "Do all adversarial examples have the same consequences?

The observation that a vast majority of the misclassifications from the untargeted attack are within the same coarse label can be seen in Table 1.

The *worst-case* nature of the proposed hierarchical attack in Section 2.1 is that we perform a targeted PGD attack and iterate through ALL possible fine labels, i.e., fine labels which do not belong in the same coarse class. This iterative attack process terminates if 1. perturbation results in a successful targeted misclassification; 2. all candidate fine labels have been used as targets. Thus, we do not compare losses. We use the *worst-case* descriptor to differentiate the proposed attack from *average-case* and *best-case* attacks, which we discuss in detail in Section 2.1 We included an algorithm box to better illustrate the proposed method. For evaluation of untargeted attacks on the coarse classifier alone, we discuss this in Section 4.3, where we generate untargeted attacks based on the coarse classifier of HAR. Our result shows that such attacks are not as strong as the hierarchical attacks we introduced in Section 2.1.\n\nThe method described in the YOLO is for a rather different goal. They leveraged the hierarchical structure of a larger dataset to combine two separate, but related datasets. Previous work has shown that the YOLO and other object detection algorithms are vulnerable to attacks (Zhao, Yue, et al, 2019). Since the visual separability between groups of fine labels can be highly uneven within a given dataset, and thus some coarse labels are more difficult to distinguish than others. This motivated us to use separate networks for the coarse and fine classification tasks.  Intuitively, HAR benefits from a single robustified CNN with improved robustness between coarse classes, and multiple robustified FNN with improved robustness between visually similar fine classes.\n\nLastly, we revised the paper with an extensive empirical study on CIFAR100 including attacks with different step sizes, $\\epsilon$, both $\\ell_\\infty$ and $\\ell_2$ norms. \n\n\nReference:\nZhao, Yue, et al. \"Seeing isn't Believing: Towards More Robust Adversarial Attack Against Real World Object Detectors.\" Proceedings of the 2019 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security. 2019."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2845/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2845/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving Hierarchical Adversarial Robustness of Deep Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~Avery_Ma1", "~Aladin_Virmaux1", "~Kevin_Scaman1", "~Juwei_Lu2"], "authors": ["Avery Ma", "Aladin Virmaux", "Kevin Scaman", "Juwei Lu"], "keywords": ["Adversarial Robustness"], "abstract": "Do all adversarial examples have the same consequences?

We revised the paper with an extensive empirical study on CIFAR100, including attacks with different step sizes, $\\epsilon$, both $\\ell_2$ and $\\ell_\\infty$ norm. Also, all PGD adversaries are randomly initialized. We also included a modified PGD adversarial training (ADV-T) with adversaries generated in a similar, targeted fashion. In particular, given an input pair from the training set $(x,y)$ and $y \\in z^*$, the perturbation is computed based on a targeted PGD attack where the target label is uniformly random sampled from {$y \\mid y \\not \\in z^*$}. Note that ADV-T only applies to vanilla models. We observed that vanilla models trained using ADV-T shows improved robustness against untargeted PGD attacks compared to the original adversarial training method. However, we noticed that there is a significant decrease in the hierarchical robustness of ADV-T models against the hierarchical adversarial examples proposed in Section 2.1, leading to a worse hierarchical robust accuracy compared to ADV. Lastly, we emphasize that since evaluating robustness empirically using attacks only shows an *upper bound* on the true robustness of the model, so one should focus on the metric that results in the *lowest* upper bound. For this reason, a network outperforming HAR on weaker metrics does not imply it has better hierarchical robustness. We agree with the reviewer that the current design of the worst-case targeted attack is not suitable for adversarial training (thus the random label selection in ADV-T). One possible candidate is to generate a targeted attack based on an intra-epoch evaluation on a hold-out set.

Since the visual separability between groups of fine labels can be highly uneven within a given dataset, and thus some coarse labels are more difficult to distinguish than others. This motivated us to first train a classifier that focuses on distinguishing perturbations at the coarse-level, i.e., distinguishing vehicles from animals.

Misclassifying a person for a car is a \u201ccoarse misclassification\u201d, but misclassifying a bus for a car is a \u201cfine misclassification\u201d. The paper introduces both a metric for hierarchical adversarial robustness, and a method to improve this metric (which is a hierarchical formulation of resnet architectures). \n\n# Strong & Weak points\n## Strong points\n\n  * This paper addresses the problem of hierarchical adversarial examples, which is a phenomenon most often ignored in related literature. Adversarial attacks, like PGD, often yield classes in the same coarse class. \n  * Table 2 shows that the Hierarchical formulation of the network improves robustness against worst case targeted adversarial attacks. \n\n## Weak points \n\n  * The paper relies on experimental results with small datasets, like CIFAR10 and a subset of CIFAR100. Moreover, the ImageNet dataset is mentioned already in the second paragraph and the frequent citation \u201cDeng 2012\u201d also uses ImageNet. So I am surprised that this paper does not cover this dataset. If this paper aims to focus future research on hierarchical adversarial robustness, I suggest including at least the definition of coarse labels for the ImageNet and OpenImages datasets.\n  * It is unclear to me how the adversarial class is defined. To quote from the paper \u201c In our work, we consider a worst-case attack by iterating through all eligible target labels until a successful misclassification occurs, and the attack is unsuccessful when the target list is exhausted.\u201d The definition of a worse-case attack is key to the proposed method, and necessitates a clear explanation.\n\n# Statement\nRecommendation: 4\nReasons\n\n  * Results on small datasets like CIFAR10 and a subset of CIFAR100, while the ImageNet is mentioned and cited multiple times. \n  * Motivation is not backed by data or citations. The paper hinges on the claim that PGD attacks yield misclassifications within the same coarse label, but this claim is not substantiated with data or citations. \n\n# Supporting arguments\n\n  * I suggest the paper gets grounded in more relevant literature, or provide more extensive experiments. The paper contains only two experiments (table 2 and table 3), has no \u201crelated work\u201d section, and has nor 23 cited works. I\u2019m aware that the ICLR conference places no restriction on the structure of the paper, or the number of experiments, but I suggest expanding either the experiments or the related work to increase the arguments in the paper. \n  * The paper misses numbers to quantify the motivation for this research. The contributions even state that \u201cWe find that a vast majority of the misclassifications from the untargeted attack are within the same coarse label\u201d, but this statement is not backed by data in the rest of the paper. The proposed method is only useful when PGD attacks indeed yield misclassifications within the same coarse label, so quantifying this phenomenon will provide a strong argument for adoption of the new metric.\n\n# Questions\n\n  * The paper defines a new subset of CIFAR100, named CIFAR100-5x5. What were the design choices for this new dataset and why?\n  * In what light to ResNet10 and ResNet34 have the same capacity? To quote from the paper \u201cWe use models with a lower capacity so that both vanilla models and the hierarchical classifiers have the same order of magnitude of parameters\u201d. Could you please elaborate on the calculation?\n\n# Minor feedback\nThese points are not part of the assessment\n\n  * When defining $F(x) : R^d \\arrow R^n$, the variables $d$ and $n$ are not defined. Moreover, when defining the dataset, $\\{ x, y \\}_n$, the variable $n$ is reused in a different context. \n  * Please be consistent in the mathematical expressions. On page 2, the prediction is defined as $\\arg \\max_i F(x)_i$, on page 3, the prediction is defined as $\\arg \\max F(x)$, and later on page 3 the prediction is indicated with lower case, $f(x)$. \n  * Table 2 (and its reference in the main text) consider \u201cperformance\u201d of the model. Please either a) use terms such as accuracy/error-rate to indicate what the numbers represent, or b) write in the caption whether a higher score or lower score indicates better performance. \n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2845/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2845/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving Hierarchical Adversarial Robustness of Deep Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~Avery_Ma1", "~Aladin_Virmaux1", "~Kevin_Scaman1", "~Juwei_Lu2"], "authors": ["Avery Ma", "Aladin Virmaux", "Kevin Scaman", "Juwei Lu"], "keywords": ["Adversarial Robustness"], "abstract": "Do all adversarial examples have the same consequences? An autonomous driving system misclassifying a pedestrian as a car may induce a far more dangerous --and even potentially lethal-- behavior than, for instance, a car as a bus. In order to better tackle this important problematic, we introduce the concept of hierarchical adversarial robustness. Given a dataset whose classes can be grouped into coarse-level labels, we define hierarchical adversarial examples as the ones leading to a misclassification at the coarse level. To improve the resistance of neural networks to hierarchical attacks, we introduce a hierarchical adversarially robust (HAR) network design that decomposes a single classification task into one coarse and multiple fine classification tasks, before being specifically trained by adversarial defense techniques.
