It presents a modification of the recent algorithm of Bhattacharya & Kannan (SODA, 2020) which takes time O(k * nnz(A)), where A is the matrix of perturbed data points. The modified algorithm works with a low-dimensional sketch of the matrix A instead of A, and thereby avoids the dependence on k in the running time of the original algorithm, which used k passes over the data set. The main result of the paper is thus that the latent simplex problem can be solved in O(nnz(A)) time for instances of the problem that satisfy the \"Spectrally Bounded Perturbation\" property introduced by the authors.\n\nThe main questions of the reviewers concerned the question of whether the assumptions needed for the analysis of the novel algorithm to apply hold on real data sets. The authors point out that the assumptions may be stronger than are needed in practice, and suggest that the assumptions could be weakened to assuming that a spectrally-accurate sketch could be used--- this would increase the run-time dependence from just nnz(A), but weakens the assumptions needed. It was also observed that, in addition to a faster runtime, the method outperforms the benchmark method.\n\nThis paper should be accepted, due to its theoretical and practical contributions to the problem of latent simplex recovery: it presents an algorithm that provably runs in true input sparsity time given an amenable instance, and practically this algorithms performs well relative to the baseline, verifying the theoretical claims."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning a Latent Simplex in Input Sparsity Time", "authorids": ["~Ainesh_Bakshi1", "~Chiranjib_Bhattacharyya1", "~Ravi_Kannan1", "~David_Woodruff1", "~Samson_Zhou1"], "authors": ["Ainesh Bakshi", "Chiranjib Bhattacharyya", "Ravi Kannan", "David Woodruff", "Samson Zhou"], "keywords": ["Latent Simplex", "numerical linear algebra", "low-rank approximation"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning a latent $k$-vertex simplex $K\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$, given $\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times n}$, which can be viewed as $n$ data points that are formed by randomly perturbing some latent points in $K$, possibly beyond $K$.

Although our analysis explains why our algorithm performs better than the previous benchmark in running time, it is true that we do not have any theoretical statements that explain why our algorithm performs better than the previous benchmark in least squares loss. One possible explanation is that a smaller sketch size could perform an implicit form of denoising or regularization for least squares loss; this is an interesting direction to further explore. Another interesting question is which loss functions would be the most appropriate for each application.

The paper argues that in some important machine learning applications (e.g., LDA), the newly introduced assumption holds. Moreover, they show that only considering the three assumptions of Bhattacharyya and Kannan, there does not exist an asymptotically faster algorithm than of Bhattacharyya and Kannan (unless there exists a constant factor spectral low-rank approximation algorithm in the same running time). Finally, the paper presents empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets and shows that the proposed method achieves a better running time and least square error compared to the prior method.\n\nThe paper is very well-written. It is very interesting that LDA and stochastic block models satisfy this assumption. Moreover, the analysis of the algorithm is novel and interesting.
