The most important clarification that we would like to make, is that \"Pareto dominance is a rather weak relation\" makes the model rather strong. That is because the dominance relation is the assumption of the IRL models, and weak assumptions are desired. We believe that justifies our motivation of studying the Pareto dominance in the IRL regime.\n\nOn the empirical study, we agree that presenting the algorithm on only the real-world environments may depend on the rational assumption. In fact, we are aware of that the diversity in action originates from both the diversity of the agents' objective and their optimality (or even rationality). There is not too much one can resolve in the real-world dataset, but we can test the algorithm on the well-known RL environment and show the performance.

A quick note is that pg. 5 \"If otherwise all elements in \\phi are generative\" the \\phi is the existence specification by the separation theorem. It is not what mentioned in Section 3.2 and is not restricted to the simplex. We are updating Section 3.2 to avoid the possible ambiguity. We also note that the model is trained and tested on disjoint subsets of WoWAH. The spider map was calculated by the entire population though.\n\nFor the contribution of the paper, we believe it is indeed worth investigating combining IRL with the diversity of preferences among agents. In fact, the problem of IRL with scalar-valued reward has been long open. The assumption (that is used by almost every IRL algorithm) is too strong to complex agents (such as humans). We developed Theorem 3.1 which significantly weaker the assumption. We agree that armed with the theorem, Section 3.2 and Section 4 was not aiming at a clear objective as you may expect. To make the objective more clear, it is more reasonable to reproduce the policy (or the set of policy) that was used to generate the trajectory dataset. That is because we already have the reward vector and also the Pareto optimal relationship assumption, and the policy is the only unknown element. Some updates on the algorithm will be necessary then, which is currently undergoing.\n\nFor experiments, we agree that it can be confusing to demonstrate the real-world problem. There are several constraints to run the algorithm on the real-world dataset, such as the query of the state transition function. That makes the experiments itself more dependent on its context. As a solution, we find it better to add some well-known experiments such as openAI gym or gridworld with vector-reward, which provide a more intuitive understanding of the empirical performance of the algorithm. We are currently working on that.\n\nWe have updated the writing in the revised version of the paper.

A key motivation of the paper, as suggested by its title, is to incorporate and analyze the complex human motivations.\n\nThe proposed setting seems new to me, although vectored-valued rewards and Pareto optimality have been studied in the context of RL. The biggest issue of this paper, in my opinion, is it doesn't properly support its claim that it improves the understanding of the agents' motivations and the reward functions. Details comments / questions are listed below.\n\n- Pareto dominance is a rather weak relation. When the number of criteria increases, it is less likely one alternative dominates another. In this case, the binary comparisons defined in Sec. 2.1 becomes less discriminative.

They assume that each agent is trying to maximize \\sum_t \\gamma^t (\\phi . r_t) where \\phi is a preference vector that lives on the simplex. Their goal is to calculate \\phi (and maybe also an optimal policy under \\phi?). The \n\nThe authors first prove that this problem can be decomposed into finding Q functions for optimal policies for each component of r_t individually, and then solving for \\phi that rationalizes the trajectory of actions in terms of these Q functions. Given the entire collection of trajectories, they perform off-policy Q-learning on each component of r_t in order to learn the Q function for that component, and then use linear programming to solve for \\phi based on these Q function.\n\n========== Comments =============\n\nI think it's a worthwhile direction to combine IRL with modeling a diversity of preferences among agents. I can imagine several reasons you might want to do this, but the authors are not clear what their goal is besides \"to propose methods that can help to understand the intricacy and complexity of human motivations and their behaviors\". Is the goal to do better policy prediction? To do better policy prediction conditional on \\phi? To infer \\phi to understand people's preferences from a social science perspective? These all seems reasonable but not sufficiently teased out in the work. (For comparison, IRL is typically - although not always - interested in learning the reward function in order to construct robust policies that maximize it). The authors also don't seem to solve a particular task of importance on the WoW dataset.\n\nThe theoretical approach seems sound, and I liked the way their algorithm was motivated and the way the problem was decomposed into off-policy Q-learning and then solving for \\phi.\n\nHowever, I found myself quite confused in the experimental section (4.3). The authors evaluate their approach by action prediction. Given the trajectories, is \\phi computed for each player and then compute actions based on that value of \\phi? Is \\phi computed on the same trajectory data used for evaluation or a different subset? Or is action prediction performed in aggregate across the entire population? The experimental setup was never clarified for this (main) experiment.\n\nI was also confused about the motivation for Figure 2 and Appendix D. The authors are showing that their predictions about which reward is motivating the players is consistent with external factors. But wouldn't you see the same thing if you just plotted the observed *rewards* themselves? E.g. players in a guild will achieve more Relationship reward. \nThe proposed approach takes the vector of reward, learns which actions are consistent with achieving each reward, then infers from the actions which reward is trying to be achieved. What advantages does this have vs. just looking at the empirical trajectory of rewards for each player/group?\nI can certainly imagine that the IRL approach has certain advantages over looking at the empirical reward stream, but the authors have not talked about this nor compared against it experimentally.\n\nThe writing could also use some improvement for a future iteration, I've listed a few points below:\n\npg.1, Neither Brown & Sandholm nor Moravcik et al use \"RL algorithms\"\npg.1, Finn et al unmatched )\npg.1, \"a scalar reward despite observed or not\" -> \"a scalar reward whether observed or not\"\npg.2, \"Either the range of\" -> \"Both the range of\" (and this sentence needs further cleanup)\npg.2, \"which records the pathing of players\" ??\nTheorem 3: \"each of the set e_i has an unique element...\" This isn't clear. I think you mean \"For each e_i there is a unique vector v^\\pi(s) for all \\pi \\in \\Pi_{e_i} . The equality holds if these vectors are distinct for each e_i\".\npg. 5 \"If otherwise all elements in \\phi are generative\" how can they be negative if they are on the simplex?\npg.5 \"we do not perform any scalarization on the reward...the model assumption is easier to be satisfied\" I think this is a strange comparison to IRL because in IRL you're trying to find a (possibly parametric) function (s,a) -> R, whereas here you're *given* the vector R and are trying to find \\phi. So while you have more degrees of freedom by adding \\phi, you lose the original degrees of freedom in the reward function.\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper681/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Beyond Winning and Losing: Modeling Human Motivations and Behaviors with Vector-valued Inverse Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "In recent years, reinforcement learning methods have been applied to model gameplay with great success, achieving super-human performance in various environments, such as Atari, Go and Poker.\nHowever, those studies mostly focus on winning the game and have largely ignored the rich and complex human motivations, which are essential for understanding the agents' diverse behavior.\nIn this paper, we present a multi-motivation behavior modeling which investigates the multifaceted human motivations and models the underlying value structure of the agents.\nOur approach extends inverse RL to the vectored-valued setting which imposes a much weaker assumption than previous studies.\nThe vectorized rewards incorporate Pareto optimality, which is a powerful tool to explain a wide range of behavior by its optimality.\nFor practical assessment, our algorithm is tested on the World of Warcraft Avatar History dataset spanning three years of the gameplay.\nOur experiments demonstrate the improvement over the scalarization-based methods on real-world problem settings.", "keywords": [], "authorids": ["wangbx66@gmail.com", "tongfs@uw.edu", "sam.zheng@deephow.com"], "authors": ["Baoxiang Wang", "Tongfang Sun", "Xianjun Sam Zheng"], "pdf": "/pdf/c65d92a5c2e3498b6a3fec74ba4f6c87c2d5d111.pdf", "paperhash": "wang|beyond_winning_and_losing_modeling_human_motivations_and_behaviors_with_vectorvalued_inverse_reinforcement_learning", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nwang2019beyond,\ntitle={Beyond Winning and Losing: Modeling Human Motivations and Behaviors with Vector-valued Inverse Reinforcement Learning},\nauthor={Baoxiang Wang and Tongfang Sun and Xianjun Sam Zheng},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkVe3iA9Ym},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper681/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234404210, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "SkVe3iA9Ym", "replyto": "SkVe3iA9Ym", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper681/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335779313, "tmdate": 1552335779313, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper681/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 8}
