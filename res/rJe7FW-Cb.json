We have included this explanation in the \u201cRelated Work\u201d section, as a specialized solution for multilabel classification, where instead of learning universal modules, a ResNet is modified to improve its multilabel classification by enhancing the predictions with the learned most relevant regions.\n\nDifferently from this ICLR, in [1], instead of designing a general mechanism like the one proposed in our submission, the authors design an specialized attention mechanism for multilabel classification and test it on MSCOCO, NUS-WIDE, and WIDER. Namely, they use the features in \u201cres4b22 relu\u201d in order to extract attention scores for each label through three convolutional layers. To avoid attending to labels not present for the input being processed, these attention maps are multiplied by \u201cconfidence maps\u201d, which are learned to be 1 if the label is present, and 0 if not. The attentional predictions are average with the network predictions. Differently, we want to incorporate fine detail at different levels of abstraction to the final prediction, thus, we propose a general \u201cAttention Module\u201d, that can be applied at many levels to any network, to enhance the final prediction weighted by the relevance of each prediction (for instance, details in the texture might help do distinguish between two birds which are similar at abstract level).\n\nChanges will be visible in the final version of the paper."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Painless Attention Mechanism for Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "We propose a novel attention mechanism to enhance Convolutional Neural Networks for fine-grained recognition.

We think the comments help to keep a high standards on this conference, and our paper has greately improved the quality thanks to them.\n\n>> Unfortunately, I do not think this rebuttal addresses my main complaint. I understand that the benchmarks include systems that use attentional mechanisms. My main issue is that the paper is about attention but different attentional mechanisms are never compared on a level play-field (i.e., using the same architectures, optimizers, etc etc). There is no way from the benchmarks to properly assess how much of the improvement is actually driven by the proposed attentional mechanism as opposed to anything else. \n\nWe understand the concern, this is exactly why we worked hard during the review period to find the time to include a comparison between STNs and the proposed attention mechanism under the same exact settings (same base architecture, learning algorithm, hyperparameters, training steps, etc.) showing that ours generalizes much better.

The approach is also consistently tested on the main fine-grained recognition datasets (the Adience age and gender recognition benchmark, Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, Stanford Cars, and UEC Food-100).\n\nOn the negative side, the paper could be better written and motivated.\n\nFirst, some claimed are made about how the proposed approach \"enhances most of the desirable properties from previous approaches\u201d (see pp 1-2) but these claims are never backed up. More generally since the paper focuses on attention, other attentional approaches should be used as benchmarks beyond the WRN baseline. If the authors want to claim that the proposed approach is \"more robust to deformation and clutter\u201d then they should design an experiment that shows that this is the case. \n\nBeyond, the approach seems a little ad hoc. No real rationale is provided for the different mechanisms including the gating etc and certainly no experimental validation is provided to demonstrate the need for these mechanisms. More generally, it is not clear from reading the paper specifically what computational limitation of the CNN is being solved by the proposed attentional mechanism. \n\nSome of the masks shown in Fig 3 seem rather suspicious and prompt this referee to think that the networks are seriously overfitting to the data. For instance, why would attending to a right ear help in gender recognition? \n\nThe proposed extension adds several hyperparameters (for instance the number K of attention heads). Apologies if I missed it but I am not clear how this was optimized for the experiments reported. In general, the paper could be clearer. For instance, it is not clear from either the text or Fig 2 how H goes from XxYxK for the attention head o XxYxN for the output head.\n\nAs a final point, I would say that while some of the criticisms could be addressed in a revision, the improvements seem relatively modest. Given that the focus of the paper is already limited to fine-grained recognition, it seems that the paper would be better suited for a computer vision conference.\n\n\nMinor point: \n\n\"we incorporate the advantages of visual and biological attention mechanisms\u201d not sure this statement makes much sense. Seems like visual and biological are distinct attributes but visual attention can be biological (or not, I guess) and it is not clear how biological the proposed approach is.

In order to better back up these properties, we have added a table in the introduction (Table 2) comparing the different architectures in the literature with ours, showing that ours accumulates the best of them.\n\n>> More generally since the paper focuses on attention, other attentional approaches should be used as benchmarks beyond the WRN baseline. \n\nPlease note that we include other attentional approaches for fine-grained recognition in all tables: \n  * Table 3 -> FAM [A]; \n  * Table 4 -> RA-CNN [B], STN [C], B-CNN [D], PD [E], FCAN [F]; \n  * Table 5 -> DVAN [G], FCAN [F], B-CNN [C], RA-CNN [B]; \n  * Table 6 -> DVAN [G], FCAN [F], RA-CNN [B]. \n\nMoreover, most of these approaches propose singular architectures that have been especially engineered for solving their respective recognition tasks, while the purpose of our approach is to demonstrate that our proposed mechanism works on general purpose architectures.\n\n[A] Rodr\u00edguez, P., Cucurull, G., Gonfaus, J.

No real rationale is provided for the different mechanisms including the gating etc and certainly no experimental validation is provided to demonstrate the need for these mechanisms. \n\nIn section 3, the rationale for the different mechanisms is mentioned in each of the subsections. For instance, gates regulate the relative importance of the predictions of each attention head. This is important when AW is high and the current input has a few informative regions. In this case, just one attention head would be enough and thus, heads focusing in other regions can be dampened by the gates. This explanation is now added in section 3.4 and the conclusion.\nIn addition, we have included experiments on cluttered MNIST showing that gates are critical to obtaining good performances with high AW (see Figure 4d in the new version of the paper).\n\n>> More generally, it is not clear from reading the paper specifically what computational limitation of the CNN is being solved by the proposed attentional mechanism. \n\nThe proposed paper addresses the same problem as other attentional methods in the literature [A,B,C, ...], i.e. it enhances the model to find the most informative parts of the image and to discard irrelevant information.

In order to address this concern, we have included experiments on deformable mnist where it can be seen that the performance increases with higher AW, and AD (Figure 4b and 4c in the new version of the paper). \n\n>> The choice of which layer to add this module is unclear to me.  \n\nPlease note that the same placing problem is present in most of the well-known CNN layers such as Dropout, Local-contrast normalization, Spatial Transformers, etc. \nHowever, as we answer to R1\u2019s first question, we have established a systematic methodology which consists in adding the attention mechanism after each subsampling layer of the WRN in order to obtain features of different levels at the smallest possible computational cost. This information is now included at the end of section 3.3, when Table 2 is introduced, and in the second paragraph of section 4. \n\n>> 2) No analysis on using the extra regularization loss actually helps.\n\nThe analysis has been included in section 4.1, where experiments with Cluttered Translated MNIST show that regularization adds an extra performance increment.\n\n>> 3) My main concern is the improvement gain is very small. In Table3, the gain of using the gate module is only 0.1%. It argues that this attention module can be added to any layer but experiments show only 1 layer and 1 attention map already achieve most of the improvement. \n\nWe hope that the new experiments on Cluttered Translated MNIST in section 4.1 help to clarify this point. Also, as it can be seen in Figure 4d, gates are crucial when AD and AW grow. \n\n>> From Table 4 to Table 7, WRNA compared to WRN only improve ~1% on average.  \n\nPlease note that 1% is a remarkable amount given that, for instance, other relevant papers such as Spatial Transformer Networks only reported an improvement of 0.8% on CUB200-2011 with respect to their own baseline (see table 3 in their work).

It is not clear to me if the attention modules are applied over all  pooling layers.\n\nAny layer of the network can be augmented with the attention mechanism. We chose to use the augmentation after each pooling layer in order to reduce even further the computational cost. We have clarified this point at the end of section 3.3, when Table 2 is introduced, and in the second paragraph of section 4.\n\n>> How they are combined? \n\nAs it can be seen in Fig 1, 2a, and 2b, a 1x1 convolution is applied to the output of the layer we want to augment, producing an attentional heatmap. This heatmap is then element-wise multiplied with a copy of the layer output, and the result is used to predict the class probabilities and a confidence score. This process is applied to an arbitrary number N of layers, producing N class probability vectors, and N confidence scores. Then all the class predictions are weighted by the confidence scores (softmax normalized so that they add-up to 1) and averaged (using Eq 9). This is the final combined prediction of the network. This overall explanation is now placed in the \u201cOverview\u201d section before section 3.1.\n\n>> Why use cross -correlation as the regulariser? Why not much stronger constraint such as orthogonality over elements of M in equation 1? \n\nPlease note that the 2-norm operation requires to square all the elements of the matrix, thus the minimum norm is achieved when the inner product of all the different pairs of masks is 0 (orthogonal). Thus, orthogonality is constrained by regularizing the 2-norm of a matrix. This is now clarified after Eq 3.\n\n>> What is the impact of this regularisation?\n\nIn order to address questions R1.1, etc.. we have added experiments on deformable mnist, showing the importance of each module. In figure 4d it can be seen that the regularized model performs better than the unregularized counterpart.\n\n>> Why use soft-max in equation 1? One may use a Sigmoid as well? Is it better to use soft-max?\n\nWe use softmax because it constrains the network to choose only one region in the image, thus forcing it to learn which is the most discriminative region. Using sigmoids attains the risk of just learning to predict 1s for every region, or all zeros. Note that multiple regions can still be identified by using multiple attention heads. This explanation has been included in section 3.1.\n\n>> Equation 9 is not entirely clear to me. Undefined notations.\n\n\u201coutput\u201d is the predicted vector of class probabilities, \u201cg_net\u201d is the confidence score for the original output of the network \u201coutput_net\u201d (without attention). This information has been appended after equation 9.\n\n>> In Table 2, why stop from AD= 2 and AW=2?  What is the performance of AD=1, AW=1 with G? Why not perform this experiment over all 5 datasets? \n\nWe had to constrain the number of experiments to a limited amount of time and resources, which makes it difficult to brute-force all hyperparameter combinations with all datasets. We hope that this question is now clarified with the experiments on deformable-mnist (Section 4.1 in the new version of the paper).\n\n>> Is this performances, dataset specific?\n\nNo, generally increasing AD and AW results in better performance in all datasets.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Painless Attention Mechanism for Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "We propose a novel attention mechanism to enhance Convolutional Neural Networks for fine-grained recognition.
