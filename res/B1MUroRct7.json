The computation of ISIR is dependent on maintaining the matrix \\hat \\Sigma\u2019 (or its inverse), which requires O (p^2) time and space. In my opinion, this complexity is too expensive for high dimensional datasets which makes the main result of this paper is not strong.

It is more reasonable to introduce a ridge term to make the algorithm more stable.\n\n3. The experiments only evaluate on some small datasets.
