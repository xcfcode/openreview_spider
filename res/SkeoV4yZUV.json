The proposed technique allows use to incrementally update the weights of the CNN when encountering examples from classes the networks has not seen before. The paper builds on the idea of weight imprinting, introducing an adaptive weight imprinting scheme that enables updating the weights of previously learned classes. The results on the PASCAL-5^i dataset look convincing, however the text lacks clarity and needs to be proofread and corrected.  Specifically, I have the following questions/comments: \n\n    Multiple grammatical and syntactical  errors make the text hard to follow, e.g.,  the last sentence of the first paragraph of the introduction does not make sense, and citations need fixing. \n\n    \"Masked weight imprinting is performed on multiple resolution levels in order to improve the segmentation accuracy\" --> the multiscale nature of the algorithm is not captured by eq. 2. It is not clear how weight imprinting is performed at multiple resolutions. \n\n    What does \"interleaved with backpropagation\" mean? This should be clarified in the text.
