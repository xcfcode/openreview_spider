Building upon this the paper proposes a new \"optimizer\" which modifies the gradients to encourage corelations among output channels. They provide a theoretical foundation for the method, by deriving the gradient through placing a riemannian metric on the manifold of parameter tensors which encourages smoothness along the output channel dimension. Two variants (one based on a Sobolev metric) are proposed and are experiments are provided. The underlying idea and the derivation of the gradients were generally appreciated by the reviewers. However some reviewers maintained their concern regarding the effectiveness of the performed experimentation. The gains demonstrated are relatively small over the baselines and more importantly the baselines are quite far off the state of the art baselines for the particular problems. This is the primary reason for my recommendation as experiments are the only source of understanding whether the method is effective (there is little theory - mostly at an intuitive level to justify the form of the optimizer). Overall, I strongly encourage the authors to explore the idea further and strengthen the paper with stronger baselines (perhaps on larger datasets) and resubmit.

The proposed method was used to train CNNs with gradient based optimisation methods such as SGD and Adam. \n\nIn general, the proposed method and motivation are interesting. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves baseline accuracy for small batch sizes.\n\nHowever, there are some major issues with the proposed method and analyses:\n\n- In the proposed method, Sobolev gradients are formulated by considering the space of parameter tensors as a Riemannian manifold, and choosing the Sobolev metric on the tangent space. That is, the method is proposed as a new optimisation method on Riemannian manifolds of parameters. Therefore, the following issues should be resolved by additional analyses and explanations:\n\n\u2014 How do you identify the Riemannian manifold of these tensors?\n\u2014 How do you assure that tensors remain on the manifold during training of networks?\n\u2014 Please compare the proposed method with other Riemannian optimisation methods applied to train CNNs in the experimental analyses.\n\n- Please provide variance of accuracy for all the experiments, esp. for classification tasks to analyse statistical significance of results, since mean accuracy values of baseline and the proposed methods are very close to each other.\n\n- Parameter correlations for CNNs trained on Imagenet were analysed in Figure 1. However, additional analyses on employment of the proposed method for these CNNs were not given in the experimental analyses. Please apply the proposed method on larger benchmark datasets such as Imagenet, and provide these results as well. These results may be also used to examine the claim proposed in Figure 1.\n\n- The proposed code snippets were useful to see how of the methods are implemented using PyTorch. However, we implemented similar experiments using these code snippets, but could not achieve similar results (indeed, obtained worse accuracy wrt baseline in some cases). A reason of this observation may be difference in implementation of other parts. Therefore, it would be useful and more helpful if you could provide the complete, esp. for experiments on image classification using Cifar 10 and semantic segmentation using Pascal VOC.\n\n\nAfter the rebuttal:\n\nI checked comments of other reviewers and response of authors.\n\nFirst, thank you for the detailed response. Since some of my questions and concerns are partially addressed, I improve the overall rating.\n\nHowever, there are still parts which should be improved:\n\n- Regarding manifolds: There are some statements which should be clarified and appropriately analyzed in the paper. For instance, it is stated that \"The manifold of parameter tensors is a linear space, and so any linear combination of the parameter set with a tangent vector (another tensor) will remain on the manifold. We are changing the metric on the tangent space from the ordinary Euclidean metric to our channel directed (Sobolev, and re-weighted L2) metrics, which effectively changes the lengths of paths on this manifold of parameter tensors, making it a non-trivial Riemannian manifold.\"\n-- This statement claims that the \"structure\" of the manifold of tensors changes by changing the metric on tangent space by changing geodesic or paths on manifolds. However, it is not clear how the geodesic or in general, geometry of the manifold changes by just changing the metric on the tangent space (while, the tangent space can change depending on change of the manifold).  \n-- Then, it is claimed that this leads to a non-trivial Riemannian manifold (a nonlinear space), while it is also claimed that the manifold of parameter tensors is a linear space (why is it a linear space?). \n\n- Regarding experimental results: Thank you for the updated results. However, these results show that the accuracy of the proposed method is pretty close to the baseline. To show superiority of the proposed method, the experiments should be extended using larger benchmark datasets.\n\n-- There are Riemannian optimization method that encodes this channel-directed structure, but there are various Riemannian optimization methods which claim to improve accuracy of models in various tasks such as the following:\n\nS.

In this paper we define our channel-directed Sobolev gradients to further impose smoothness/correlation only in the output channel direction that leads to such correlation in the output direction of the tensor (see Sect 2.4 first paragraph).\n\n\n2) What's the key difference between Laplacian smoothing and Sobolev gradients? \n\n-- The standard form of the Sobolev metric gives a Sobolev gradient that is effectively computed using Laplacian smoothing. The Sobolev metric that we propose is based on the mean value of the tensor, and leads to gradient computations which have less computational complexity than Laplacian smoothing (O(n) vs O(nlog(n)), page 5, 'This saves one ...'). The previous paper that introduced Laplacian smoothing, however didn't look into channel directed versions.\n\nThe framework that we are presenting illustrates the process of how prior knowledge in the structure of the tensor can be imposed in the metric and hence the gradient. It illustrates how in general one can start with a prior, encode it in a metric and impose in the optimization procedure. Although computationally, the Sobolev gradient reduces down to Laplacian smoothing with a particular form of Sobolev metric, the fact that we formulate this as changing the underlying Riemannian geometry to derive gradients more general than Laplacian smoothing. We hope this framework will motivate new research into new metrics.\n\n\n3) The relationship and difference between channel-directed gradients and Sobolev gradients should be analyzed.\n\n-- Sobolev gradients are general gradients with smoothness; channel-directed Sobolev is a type of Sobolev gradient with smoothness in particular directions of the tensor.  Channel-directed reweighed L2 is a version of the L2 with certain channel direction components more heavily weighted. In practice, both versions of channel-directed perform similarly but channel-directed Sobolev performs better with ADAM.\n \n\n4) The authors should compare the proposed algorithm with sophisticated methods such as manifold optimization algorithms.\n\n-- Please see response 2) to Anonymous Reviewer 5."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1318/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1318/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Channel-Directed Gradients for Optimization of Convolutional Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~Dong_Lao1", "~Peihao_Zhu1", "~Peter_Wonka2", "~Ganesh_Sundaramoorthi1"], "authors": ["Dong Lao", "Peihao Zhu", "Peter Wonka", "Ganesh Sundaramoorthi"], "keywords": ["stochastic optimization", "Riemannian geometry", "Riemannian gradient flows", "convolutional neural nets"], "abstract": "We introduce optimization methods for convolutional neural networks that can be used to improve existing gradient-based optimization in terms of generalization error.

How do you assure that tensors remain on the manifold during training of networks? \n\n-- The manifold of parameter tensors is a linear space, and so any linear combination of the parameter set with a tangent vector (another tensor) will remain on the manifold. We are changing the metric on the tangent space from the ordinary Euclidean metric to our channel directed (Sobolev, and re-weighted L2) metrics, which effectively changes the lengths of paths on this manifold of parameter tensors, making it a non-trivial Riemannian manifold.\n\n\n2)   Please compare the proposed method with other Riemannian optimisation methods applied to train CNNs in the experimental analyses.\n\n-- Our intention in this paper is to show how prior structure in the parameter tensors can be favored through changing the underlying Riemannian metric on the manifold of tensors, which effectively gives a gradient with that structure encoded.  We are not aware of any other Riemannian optimization method that encodes this channel-directed structure. While there are optimization methods leveraging Riemannian Geometry (e.g. natural gradient methods), they do not have the same purpose as encoding this prior structure (e.g., natural gradients are to obtain re-parameterization invariance).  We should note that Laplacian Smoothing (which we compared to) can also be interpreted as a Riemannian optimization (though not mentioned in that work), and we out-perform it, though it encodes a different prior structure.\n\n\n3) Provide variance of accuracy.\n\n-- Figure 5 and Figure 10 do show the statistical significance by box plots. Note that accuracy reported on Cifar are the average of over 25 independent trials for SGD and 10 trials for ADAM (page 6, 'We run 25 ...').

These results may be also used to examine the claim proposed in Figure 1.\n\n-- We do provide numerical analysis of correlations on trained convolutional layers by our proposed method in Appendix C (page 12) on CIFAR. Both reweighted L2 and Sobolev optimized networks show stronger correlation in the output direction than SGD trained networks. Note SGD does still show correlation, but smaller than networks trained with our optimizers.\n\n\n5) Implementation details; reproducibility.\n\n-- We will make the code publicly available. The readers are free to verify the results. In the experiments, we used exactly the same environment and settings as LS (Osher et al. 2018). Detailed training parameters including learning rate schedule, momentum and weight decay are provided in Section 4 and Table 1.

It proposes two metrics, a reweighed L2 metric, and a specific Sobolev metric, and presents how to compute modified gradients in a compute efficient manner.  Motivated by empirical observation that parameters of trained CNN tensors tend to be correlated along output dimension, the paper focuses on metrics that promote such correlation.\n\nThe approach of considering new metrics is appealing in that it allows keeping original loss function, model parameterization, and optimization methodology; it modifies the gradients in potentially beneficial ways leading to better optimization.  The formulation presented is mathematically rigorous.\n\nThe biggest criticism I have is that the baseline systems presented in the paper appear very far behind the best known results. For instance,\n    * State of the art accuracy on CIFAR-10 is over 99% but the models presented in the paper achieve below 90%. This is a very large gap.\n    * For PascalVOC the mean IoU is in high 80s, not sure why the paper cites numbers near 40. I\u2019ve re-read the paper a few times to find out what am I missing but can\u2019t tell why the numbers are so different.\nWith baselines like that it becomes very hard to assess the real value of the proposed approach.\n\nAnother weak aspect of the paper is the choice of output channel dimension for smoothing.  It is empirically motivated based on the correlations in parameters along output dimension.  At the same time results also show that other dimensions such as input channel dimension lead to accuracy degradation.  However, since the method allows for selecting any subset of variables to smooth over, could there be more principled approaches for identifying optimal subset?  Could the optimal metric be somehow learnt?\n\nFor aforementioned reasons I feel the paper needs more work prior to publication.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1318/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1318/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Channel-Directed Gradients for Optimization of Convolutional Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~Dong_Lao1", "~Peihao_Zhu1", "~Peter_Wonka2", "~Ganesh_Sundaramoorthi1"], "authors": ["Dong Lao", "Peihao Zhu", "Peter Wonka", "Ganesh Sundaramoorthi"], "keywords": ["stochastic optimization", "Riemannian geometry", "Riemannian gradient flows", "convolutional neural nets"], "abstract": "We introduce optimization methods for convolutional neural networks that can be used to improve existing gradient-based optimization in terms of generalization error.
