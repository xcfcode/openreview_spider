Graphical lasso is applied to obtain the sparse inverse covariance matrix, resulting in an approximate solution to the FD discovery problem. The proposed method is compared with prominent FD discovery methods such as PYRO and RFI, showing much higher precision and recall on a synthetic dataset. On a real dataset of data cleaning, the proposed method outperforms HoloClean, which uses manually written FDs.\n\nStrengths:\n1. The relaxation of the FD discovery problem to structure learning in elegant.\n2. The empirical performance on synthetic and real datasets are impressive.\n\nWeakness:\nLack of theoretical guarantee: perhaps there's a way to get error bound on B_hat from the error bound for Glasso?\n", "rating": "4: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper32/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper32/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unsupervised Functional Dependency Discovery for Data Preparation", "authors": ["Zhihan Guo", "Theodoros Rekatsinas"], "authorids": ["zhihan@cs.wisc.edu", "thodrek@cs.wisc.edu"], "keywords": ["Functional Dependencies", "Sparse Regression", "Structure Learning", "L1-regularization", "Weak Supervision"], "abstract": "We study the problem of functional dependency (FD) discovery to impose domain knowledge for downstream data preparation tasks.
