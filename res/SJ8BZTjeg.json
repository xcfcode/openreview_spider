Unsupervised learning methods with GANs is certainly a relevant topic but this paper does not propose anything particularly novel as far as I can tell. More importantly, the evaluation methods in this paper are extremely lacking. The authors omit classification results on CIFAR and STL-10 and instead the only quantitative evaluation plot the performance of the clustering algorithm on the features. Not only are classification results not shown, no comparisons are made to the wealth of related work. I list just a few highly related techniques below.

The general topic of unsupervised learning is important, and the proposed approach makes some sense, but experimental evaluation is very weak and does not allow to judge if the proposed method is competitive with existing alternatives. Therefore the paper cannot be published in its current form. \n\nMore detailed remarks (many of these are copies of my pre-review questions the authors have not responded to):\n\n1) Realted work overview looks incomplete. There has been work on combining clustering with deep learning, for example [1] or [2] look very related. A long list of potentially related papers can be found here: https://amundtveit.com/2016/12/02/deep-learning-for-clustering/ . From the GAN side, for example [3] looks related. I would like the authors to comment on relation of their approach to existing work, if possible compare with existing approaches, and if not possible - explain why.\n\n[1] Xie et al., \"Unsupervised Deep Embedding for Clustering Analysis\", ICML 2016 http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v48/xieb16.pdf\n[2] Yang et al., \"Joint Unsupervised Learning of Deep Representations and Image Clusters\", CVPR 2016 http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Yang_Joint_Unsupervised_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf\n[3] J.T. Springenberg, \"Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning with categorical generative adversarial networks\", ICLR 2016, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06390v2.pdf\n\n2) The authors do not report classification accuracies, which makes it very difficult to compare their results with existing work. Classification accuracies should be reported. They may not be a perfect measure of feature quality, but reporting them in addition to ARI and NMI would not hurt.\n\n3) The authors have not compared their approach to existing unsupervised feature learning approaches, for example feature learning with k-means (Coates and Ng 2011), sparse coding methods such as Hierarchical Matching Pursuit (Bo et al., 2012 and 2013), Exemplar-CNN (Dosovitskiy et al. 2014)\n\n4) Looks like in Figure 2 every \"class\" consists essentially of a single image and its slight variations? Doesn't this mean GAN training failed? Do all your GANs produce samples of this quality? \n\n5) Why do you not show results with visual features on STL-10?\n\n6) Supervisedly learned filters in Figure 3 looks unusual to me, they are normally not that smooth. Have you optimized the hyperparameters? What is the resulting accuracy?\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Unsupervised Learning Using Generative Adversarial Training And Clustering", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach that makes use of two components; a deep hierarchical feature extractor, and a more traditional clustering algorithm.

Looks like in Figure 2 every \"class\" consists essentially of a single image and its slight variations? Doesn't this mean GAN training failed? Do all your GANs produce samples of this quality? \n\n2. Could you please report classification accuracies? Otherwise it is impossible to compare your method to most other works.\n\n3. Why have you not compared to existing well-performing unsupervised learning methods? For example, feature learning with k-means (Coates and Ng 2011), sparse coding methods such as Hierarchical Matching Pursuit (Bo et al., 2012 and 2013), Exemplar-CNN (Dosovitskiy et al. 2014) .\n\n4. Why do you not show results with visual features on STL-10?\n\n5. Supervisedly learned filters in Figure 3 looks unusual to me, they are not normally that smooth. Have you optimized the hyperparameters? What is the resulting accuracy?\n\n6. Could you relate your method to Categorical GAN https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06390.pdf ?\n\nThanks!"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Unsupervised Learning Using Generative Adversarial Training And Clustering", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach that makes use of two components; a deep hierarchical feature extractor, and a more traditional clustering algorithm.
