The idea is to use the method of Wang et al.

The claims are that (1) on simulated test data it works well (2) the multiscale trick is beneficial (3) the additional reconstruction cost is useful to prevent over-fitting. A few comments:\n\n- I think the \"snowball training method\" would need some clarification.\n- The usage of simulated data would need more analysis -- it is unclear how faithful the data statistics are to the real dataset, so some comparative images would be good. Describing how the data was generated would be helpful.\n- There are no comparisons with other methods so it is unclear how good the proposed model actually is in comparison with other alternatives.\n- Results with/without extra regularization would be helpful, as well as a deeper analysis (metrics such as training and validation errors over time so that we can see the effect of over-fitting etc).\n- How would the authors train if they had access to some labeled data (which I assume is also a realistic scenario)? There is an obvious way to mix the supervised and unsupervised objectives, but that's not the only way.\n\nAll in all, this paper applies some pretty standard tools on a potentially novel set of data, but otherwise falls short in terms of novelty and depth of analysis.\n\n\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"CMT_id": "", "title": "Using Encoder-Decoder Convolutional Networks to Segment Carbon Fiber CT", "abstract": "Materials that exhibit high strength-to-weight ratio, a desirable property for aerospace applications, often present unique inspection challenges.

Images with multi-resolutions are encoded by a pretrained encoder, and two decoders are employed to perform segmentation and reconstruction, respectively. The model is trained on a synthesized dataset and one result of real image is shown.\n\nThe novelty of the work is quite limited (and lack of detailed analysis) since simply two extra features are added on top of the typical encoder-decoder convolutional networks, namely (1) multi-resolution images and (2) two decoders (one for segmentation and the other for reconstruction) as regularization during training. Feature (1) has been known to be helpful for segmentation as demonstrated by [1, 2, 3] and Chet et al. arXiv 2015. Employing multi-resolutions brings about 2% (in meanIOU), but the experimental details are missing, such as how many resolutions are employed (and some ablation analysis of experimenting with multi-resolutions). Feature (2) is claimed to be useful in the paper, while no analysis experiment at all to support the claim (e.g., what will happen in terms of training speed and performance accuracy experimentally if no regularization employed?). Besides, the encoder-decoder convolutional network framework is typical. A few more baselines, such as Segnet, in the experiment are needed for comparison.\n\nEmploying deep neural networks (especially convolutional networks) to segmentation is a hot topic, while the lack of cited references in the paper cannot reflect this. The authors should elaborate more about the related work section. For example, [4] is also relevant to the work from the aspect of convolution-deconvolution network for medical images.\n\nThe paper also lacks a few analysis experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Specifically, (1) the claim that the usage of nearest-neighbor upsampling is helpful for faster convergence during training, (2) the performance gain of the proposed model is unclear (good simulated dataset or model generalization), and (3) what is the reconstruction result (and how good it is), and is it possible to show its effect on preventing overfitting? Even though the dataset for medical images is relatively small, the authors could try to analyze the models on other larger segmentation datasets or could employ some data augmentation, since I think it is crucial to analyze the proposed model carefully. Furthermore, some details are missing, such as how to synthesize the dataset.\n\n\n[1] C. Farabet, C. Couprie, L. Najman, and Y. LeCun. Learning hierarchical features for scene labeling.
