The paper claims that instance segmentation is more challenging than semantic segmentation.\nThe idea is to approximate the eigenvectors of the \u201cideal\u201d Laplacian matrix (where k(x_i, x_j) = 1, if pixels x_i and x_j belong to the same object and 0 otherwise using a neural network by using the rank k reconstruction loss (k is the number of components)\nThe paper claims that any method that performs semantic segmentation by solving a multiclass classification problem, can be modified in the last layer to generate eigenvectors instead. The authors use FCN-8 (a network architecture used for semantic segmentation) network architecture.\nThe performance of both original FCN-8 and the proposed method is same on PASCAL VOC dataset, however since the authors claim the instance segmentation is harder, this is a good thing.\n\nIssues:\nMore experiments are needed to justify the validity of the proposed method.\nHow will the number of objects be chosen in a new test image?\n\nOther Interesting Points:\nThe authors use KwikCluster algorithm (and not k-means) on the approximation to the similarity matrix obtained from the algorithm to finally cluster pixels. I think there are two advantages of this:\nIndividual eigenvectors need not be perfect. In fact, they need not be eigenvectors at all if they are sufficiently good at reconstructing the similarity matrix S. They are not using eigen embeddings for clustering\nKwikCluster runs in linear time as opposed to k-means and hence it is computationally better.\nOne downside is that KwikCluster is a randomized approximation algorithm that may perform very poorly due to randomness.\n\nOverall Opinion: Marginally above acceptance threshold.

This is particularly useful for the problem of image segmentation, as it allows converting existing semantic segmentation networks (a basic multi-class classification problem) into instance segmentation networks (a more complex structured prediction problem). We show some convenient theoretical properties of this graph Laplacian, propose several rounding schemes (with error bounds) of the eigenvectors, and present preliminary results showing an insignificant change in error after converting from semantic to instance segmentation on the PASCAL VOC dataset.", "paperhash": "barnes|deep_spectral_clustering_for_object_instance_segmentation", "keywords": ["Spectral clustering", "image segmentation", "deep learning", "graph Laplacian"], "_bibtex": "@misc{\n  barnes2018deep,\n  title={Deep Spectral Clustering for Object Instance Segmentation},\n  author={Matt Barnes and Artur Dubrawski},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1OvoK1vG}\n}", "authorids": ["mbarnes1@cs.cmu.edu", "awd@cs.cmu.edu"], "authors": ["Matt Barnes", "Artur Dubrawski"], "TL;DR": "Optimize the spectral loss of a network to retrain a semantic segmentation network (e.g. FCN) for instance segmentation (a more complex structured prediction problem).
