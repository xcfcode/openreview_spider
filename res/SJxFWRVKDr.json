It is claimed that the missing information that could not be encoded during learning from training set can be revealed by taking the gradient of an example with respect to the model parameters. Based on this idea, a new learning algorithm is proposed to combine both the conventional loss for activation-based presentation and gradient-based regularization. As an illustration, the method is evaluated on anomaly detection benchmarks with gradient-based representation as part of the anomaly inference. \n\n[Comments]\nI\u2019m not sure if I fully understand the claimed contribution and how it is justified either theoretically and empirically. It seems to me that the paper claims the the current activation-based network does not fully encode information from training set during learning, and taking the gradient over a novel example (either training or test) with respect to (w.r.t,) model parameters can encode the missing information. I don't quite follow a few things, and had a difficult time in interpreting the novelty here.\n- What is the missing information (a model should learn but fails to capture from training set) exactly? The example in the introduction uses digit 0 for training and digit 6 for testing and claims the vertical edge in 6 is missing. But isn\u2019t that expected if the model is only trained with digit 0s only? How would one expect the model to learn the vertical edge if there is none in the training data?       \n- More critically, the idea of taking the gradient of a model w.r.t.its parameters over an example to encode geometric relationship of the example in the data manifold is by no means novel at the conceptual level. There have been at least a bunch of similar classical methods derived from the perspective of information geometry. For instance, the Fisher kernel and vector  have been well studied for more than a decade, with both theoretical treatment (e.g., \u201cExploiting Generative Models in Discriminative Classifiers\u201d in NIPS 1998) and application across multiple areas (e.g., \u201cFisher Kernels on Visual Vocabularies for Image Categorization\u201d in CVPR 2007). I don\u2019t see any novelty here by doing this to a new model (deep neural networks), and it is frustrating to see classical methods are being \u201cinvented\u201d over and over again by decorating them with fashionable wrappers without any reference to the origin in the literature.  \n- Besides, to use gradients to capture missing information, the paper proposes to append a regularization term by enforcing the gradient at particular learning iteration to be close to the mean of those of previous iterations (via cosine similarity) as in (3). This seems not quite different from many existing popular inertia-based strategies like gradients with momentum, Adam, etc. It needs to be elucidated more how the proposed optimizer compares to these benchmark methods.        \n\nIn terms of implementation, I also found some details missing. For instance, the objective function of (4) requires evaluation of second order derivatives (since the second term in the cosSIM involves dL/dPhi(x, Phi)). How to efficiently compute this term is not clear to me yet.   It is also mentioned that only decoder of the AE is used for constraint gradient, The reason for this is also not explained.\n\nFor evaluation, only anomaly detection examples are provided. It would be great if more general tasks like image classification can be studied. After all, the proposed method is claimed to be a fairly general framework (the introduction actually uses image classification as the example), and evaluation on the most popular benchmarks provides the most convincing justification. Even on the anomaly detection tasks, the proposed approach does not seem to have solid advantages over baselines. I\u2019m not sure how significant are the differences of 0.007 between GradCon and OCGAN (table 2 and 3), and those less than 1% in table 4.\n\nOverall the paper does not seem to have a clear and well-defined motivation, contribution is also vague and trivial compared to literature, plus very convincing empirical justification. Thus I do not think it is ready for publication at ICLR.     \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper973/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper973/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Characterizing Missing Information in Deep Networks Using Backpropagated Gradients", "authors": ["Gukyeong Kwon", "Mohit Prabhushankar", "Dogancan Temel", "Ghassan AlRegib"], "authorids": ["gukyeong.kwon@gatech.edu", "mohit.p@gatech.edu", "cantemel@gatech.edu", "alregib@gatech.edu"], "keywords": ["Representation learning", "Missing Information in Deep Networks", "Gradient-based Representation"], "TL;DR": "We propose a gradient-based representation for characterizing information that deep networks have not learned.", "abstract": "Deep networks face challenges of ensuring their robustness against inputs that cannot be effectively represented by information learned from training data.

Yet, this is only shown to be true if that gradient information is \"bent\" to follow a given orthogonality constraint in a fairly heuristic way (Eq. 4). Many choices are going under the hood:\n\n\"We train CAEs by setting \u03b1 = 0.03 and \u2126(z; \u03b8, \u03c6) = 0 in (4). This loss utilized for training is utilized as an anomaly score during testing but with the increased \u03b1 of 0.12\" \n\nThe sentence above is quite mysterious. The framework is tested with an anomaly detection task, which is a bit underwhelming, and to be frank, the results in Tables 3 or 4 (MNIST / CIFAR10) are not particularly convincing, specially when one factors the fact that \u03b1 has been strangely changed.\n\nBecause of this, I feel that overall the paper starts with a nice idea but has not reached yet the state in which it deserves being published.\n\nother comments:\n- I think it would help to formalize from the introduction what kind of gradient you are specifically referring to. Is it the gradient of the loss XE of the classifier w.r.t. an arbitrary label? although this is clarified later in the paper, the introduction is not informative enough (Fig. 1 is nice, but a proper statement is needed). In particular, gradients is presented as an alternative to Jacobians, but shouldn't it be some form of Jacobian (or collection of gradients)\n- in Eq. 1, why use *both* z and f_theta(x) in the same line, since they are equal? \n- Around Eq. 1, \"The training is performed by minimizing the loss function, J(x; \u03b8, \u03c6), defined as follows\". This is inacurate, J is not minimized to compute theta and phi: the sum over J(x_i; ...) is minimized. J is just an examplar loss. You minimize the expectation of J.\n- \"can be calculated through the backpropagation\" --> remove \"the\"\n- Your narrative in bottom of p.3 from \"We visualize the\" is a bit flawed: one could imagine an example where x_out ~= \\hat{x}_out, i.e. for which the loss L is small but the regularizer is large, or inversely one in which J is dominated by a small regularizer loss but where the loss L is large. So associating the size of the gradient of J to the departure from the manifold is misleading. It seems however that this is corrected later in p.5, in which you now allude only to d \\mathcal{L}\n- aren't there analogies with these gradients and Fisher score vectors in parametric stats? i.e. d log p_theta(x) / d theta ?\n- add more caption to Fig.3 describing what's going on, or at the very least a direct reference on the section / location in which the experiments are described.\n- \"with our proposed method which will be described in the following section\" : I would avoid this kind of \"movie\" narrative which tries to create a \"cinematic buildup\". Stick to scientific order, i.e. describe first method, test and experiment with it next.\n- \"is the primal loss for a given task\" --> supervised or unsupervised task?"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper973/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper973/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Characterizing Missing Information in Deep Networks Using Backpropagated Gradients", "authors": ["Gukyeong Kwon", "Mohit Prabhushankar", "Dogancan Temel", "Ghassan AlRegib"], "authorids": ["gukyeong.kwon@gatech.edu", "mohit.p@gatech.edu", "cantemel@gatech.edu", "alregib@gatech.edu"], "keywords": ["Representation learning", "Missing Information in Deep Networks", "Gradient-based Representation"], "TL;DR": "We propose a gradient-based representation for characterizing information that deep networks have not learned.", "abstract": "Deep networks face challenges of ensuring their robustness against inputs that cannot be effectively represented by information learned from training data. We attribute this vulnerability to the limitations inherent to activation-based representation. To complement the learned information from activation-based representation, we propose utilizing a gradient-based representation that explicitly focuses on missing information. In addition, we propose a directional constraint on the gradients as an objective during training to improve the characterization of missing information. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we compare the anomaly detection performance of gradient-based and activation-based representations. We show that the gradient-based representation outperforms the activation-based representation by 0.093 in CIFAR-10 and 0.361 in CURE-TSR datasets in terms of AUROC averaged over all classes. Also, we propose an anomaly detection algorithm that uses the gradient-based representation, denoted as GradCon, and validate its performance on three benchmarking datasets.
