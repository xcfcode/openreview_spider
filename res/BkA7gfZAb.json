This allows the authors to turn the standard min max problem of adversarial training into a single minimization problem, which is easier to solve. The method is demonstrated on a toy example and on the task of unsupervised domain adaptation.\n\nStrengths:\n- The derivation of the dual formulation is novel\n- The dual formulation simplifies adversarial training\n- The experiments show the better behavior of the method compared to adversarial training for domain adaptation\n\nWeaknesses:\n- It is unclear that this idea would generalize beyond a logistic regression classifier, which might limit its applicability in practice\n- It would have been nice to see results on other tasks than domain adaptation, such as synthetic image generation, for which GANs are often used\n- It would be interesting to see if the DA results with a kernel classifier are better (comparable to the state of the art)\n- The mathematical derivations have some errors\n\n\nDetailed comments:\n- The upper bound used to derive the formulation applies to a logistic regression classifier. While effective, such a classifier might not be as powerful as multi-layer architectures that are used as discriminators. I would be interested to know if they authors see ways to generalize to better classifiers.\n\n- The second weakness listed above might be related to the first one. Did the authors tried their approach to non-DA tasks, such as generating images, as often done with GANs? Showing such results would be more convincing. However, I wonder if the fact that the method has to rely on a simple classifier does not limit its ability to tackle other tasks.\n\n- The DA results are shown with a linear classifier, for the comparison to the baselines to be fair, which I appreciate. However, to evaluate the effectiveness of the method, it would be interesting to also report results with a kernel-based classifier, so as to see how it compares to the state of the art.\n\n- There are some errors and unclear things in the mathematical derivations:\n* In the equation above Eq. 2, \\alpha should in fact be \\alpha_i, and it is not a vector (no need to transpose it)\n* In Eq. 2, it should be \\alpha_i \\alpha_j instead of \\alpha^T\\alpha\n* In Eq. 3, it is unclear to me where the constraint 0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 1 comes from. The origin of the last equality constraints on the sums of \\alpha_A and \\alpha_B is also unclear to me.\n* In Eq. 3, it is also not clear to me why the third term has a different constant weight than the first two. This would have an impact on the relationship to the MMD\n\n- The idea of sample reweighting within the MMD was in fact already used for DA, e.g., Huang et al., NIPS 2007, Gong et al., ICML 2013. What is done here is quite different, but I think it would be worth discussing these relationships in the paper.\n\n- The paper is reasonably clear, but could be improved with some more details on the mathematical derivations (e.g., explaining where the constraints on \\alpha come from), and on the experiments (it is not entirely clear how the distributions of accuracies were obtained).\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Stable Distribution Alignment Using the Dual of the Adversarial Distance", "abstract": "Methods that align distributions by minimizing an adversarial distance between them have recently achieved impressive results.

They motivate their approach by repeating the previously made claim that the naive gradient approach is non-convergent for generic saddle point problems (Figure 1); while a gradient approach often works well for a minimization formulation.\n\nThe dual problem of regularized logistic regression is an entropy-regularized concave quadratic objective problem where the Hessian is y_i y_j <x_i, x_j>, thus highlighting the pairwise similarities between the points x_i & x_j; here the labels represent whether the point x comes from the samples A from the target distribution or B from the proposal distribution. This paper then compare this objective with the MMD distance between the samples A & B. It points out that the adversarial logistic distance can be viewed as an iteratively reweighted empirical estimator of the MMD distance, an interesting analogy (but also showing the limited power of the adversarial logistic distance for getting good generating distributions, given e.g. that the MMD has been observed in the past to perform poorly for face generation [Dziugaite et al. UAI 2015]). From this analogy, one could expect the method to improves over MMD, but not necessarily significantly in comparison to an approach which would use more powerful discriminators.\n\nThis paper then investigates the behavior of this adversarial logistic distance in the context of aligning distributions for domain adaptation, with experiments on a visual adaptation task. They observe better performance for their approach in comparison to ADDA, improved WGAN and MMD, when restricting the discriminators to be a linear classifier.\n\n== Evaluation \n\nI found this paper quite clear to read and enjoyed reading it. The observations are interesting, despite being on the toyish side. I am not an expert on GANs for domain adaptation, and thus I can not judge of the quality of the experimental comparison for this application, but it seemed reasonable, apart for the restriction to the linear discriminators (which is required by the framework of this paper).\n\nOne concern about the paper (but this is an unfortunate common feature of most GAN papers) is that it ignores the vast knowledge on saddle point optimization coming from the optimization community. The instability of a gradient method on non-strongly convex-concave saddle point problems (like the bilinear form of Figure 1) is a well-known property, and many alternative *stable* gradient based algorithms have been proposed to solve saddle point problems which do not require transforming them to a minimization problem as suggested in this paper. Moreover, the transformation to the minimization form crucially required the closed form computation of the dual function (with w* just defined above equation (2)), and this is limited to linear discriminators,  thus ruling out the use of the proposed approach to more powerful discriminators like deep neural nets. Thus the significance appears a bit limited to me.\n\n== Other comments\n\n1) Note that d(A, B'_theta) is *equal* to min_alpha max_w  (...)  above equation (2) (it is not just an upper bound). This is a standard result coming from the fact that the Fenchel dual problem to regularized maximum likelihood is the maximum entropy problem with a quadratic objective as (2).  See e.g. Section 2.2 of [Collins et al. JMLR 2008] (this is for the more general multiclass logistic regression problem, but (2) is just the binary special case of equation (4) in the [Collins ... ] reference). And note that the \"w(u)\" defined in this reference is the lambda*w*(alpha) optimal relationship defined in this paper (but without the 1/lambda factor because of just slightly different writing; the point though is that strong duality holds there and thus one really has equality).\n\n\n[Collins et al.

[0, 1]-constraints on \\alpha values are required by the upper bound - otherwise it would not hold; equation 3 illustrates computing a quadratic form in block form by putting down terms that correspond to interactions between points from same and different domains separately; the interaction is symmetric, therefore there are two identical cross-domain terms that results in a multiplier of two in front of that term. We added these details (page 4).\n\nThe constraint on alpha sums (sum over A = sum over B) results from optimality conditions on the bias term of the discriminator - and it indeed does not quite follow from our derivations in their current form, you are completely right. We also added that.\n\n3. \u201c<..> - The idea of sample reweighting within the MMD was in fact already used for DA, e.g., Huang et al., NIPS 2007, Gong et al., ICML 2013. What is done here is quite different, but I think it would be worth discussing these relationships in the paper.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Gong et al. were optimizing a sample reweighted MMD but restricted weights of points from one of domains to always equal one (1.0). They had somewhat different reasoning, as they were choosing points for auxiliary tasks at multiple scales, therefore, no iterative reweighting was performed.

For example, MMD-based methods also use kernels and obtain state of the art results for domain adaptation. \n\nWhile we agree that the exact dual exists only in the logistic discriminator case, when one can use the duality and solve the inner problem in closed form, we want to stress that our paper presents a more general framework for alignment that can be extended to other classes of functions. More specifically, one can rewrite the quadratic form in kernel logistic regression [eq. 3, page 4] as a Frobenius inner product of a kernel matrix Q with a symmetric rank 1 alignment matrix S (outer product of alpha with itself). The kernel matrix specifies distances between points and S chooses pairs that minimize the total distance. This way the problem reduces to \u201cmaximizing the maximum agreement between the alignment and similarity matrices\u201d that in turn might be seen as replacing \u201cadversity\u201d in the original problem with \u201ccooperation\u201d in the dual maximization problem. In our paper, S is a rank 1 matrix, but we could choose different alignment matrix parameterizations that would correspond to having a neural network discriminator in the adversarial problem. It is not exactly dual to minimization of any existing adversarial distances, but exploits same underlying principle of \u201citeratively-reweighted alignment matrix fitting\u201d discussed in this paper. We assert that in order to understand the basic properties of the resulting formulation, an in-depth discussion of the well-studied logistic case is no less important than the discussion involving complicated deep models, which deserves a paper of its own. This paper proposes a more stable \u201ccooperative\u201d problem reformulation rather than a new adversarial objective as many recent papers do.\n\nWe added a section discussing relations to existing methods from this \u201ccooperative point of view\u201d and exciting future possibilities.
