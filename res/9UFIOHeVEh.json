The approach consists of i) disentangled representations ii) a classifier on the top of the trained representations iii) technique that select dimensions of representation of an objects' (factors), that impact the uncertainty of a model the most. The i) and ii) are done in a known way; The disentanglement is done via Deep Convolutional Inverse Graphics Network (2015), and a classifier is trained with a standard maximum likelihood approach.\nThe iii) suggests selecting a dimension that influences uncertainty the most, based on the gradient of uncertainty criteria (entropy of p(y|z), where z is embedding). In other words, the suggestion is to select the component of representation that \"provides the highest decrease in entropy\".\nThe experiments are done in a controllable setting, where the generative process is known and can be controlled. The model demonstrated the ability to learn disentangled representations, in the case when control of generative prosses is available. Specifically, it is required to generate/have objects were \"only one generative variable changes across the images\". However, the connection to uncertainty is weak.\n\nReview:\n\nI have very mixed feelings about the work. On one hand, the problem is interesting (perhaps novel) and deserves the attention of the community. On the other hand, the paper is half-baked, there are conceptual flaws, the evaluation protocol is weak, there is an incorrect interpretation of experiment results;  \n\nMy comment on novelty is the following: I would say that algorithmic novelty, is the weak point, however, bringing the attention of the community to important problems is not less important than new algorithms (and even is more important IMO). Taking into account that \"novelty\" is extremely subjective, I would say that there is nothing wrong with the novelty side. \n\nWriting: the paper is clearly written. \n \nConcerns:\n\n1) The identified factors do not proofed to be meaningful and useful. Pure identifying factors of uncertainty or reduction uncertainty of a model do not give us the full picture. The factors may be flawed in many ways: factors may be too dependent on random errors of the model but not to be semantically meaningful. Reduction uncertainty of a model is not always useful, as most models nowadays are often wrongly overconfident, more confidence is not necessarily good! It has not been proven that identified factors are connected to uncertainty. \n\n2) There is a noticeable connection between the proposed method and adversarial attacks. We can interpret a method as a way to \"trick\" a model to be more ceratin on adversarial modifications of embeddings. In this case, the results would not be useful.\n\n3) There are two flaws of experiments in section 4.2: i) the authors compare Expected Calibration Error between different datasets, these figures are not comparable, it is the same as compare accuracy between MNIST and ImageNet  ii) ECE is a biased estimate of true calibration with a different bias for each model, so it is not a valid metric to compare even models trained on the same data (see Vaicenavicius2019). Yes, ECE is the standard in the field, but it is the wrong standard that prevents us from meaningful scientific progress, so we should stop using it.\n\nOverall: The direction is interesting, however, the evaluation protocol needs to be more thoughtful. At the moment, it is impossible to verify the real performance of the method.\n\nSuggestions:\n\n1) Evaluate the identifying algorithm on downstream problems. For example, can we use these factors to collect additional data that will improve predictive performance better than uniformly sampled data (aka active learning)? There should be many more interesting settings.\n\n2) Evaluate the model on controllable uncertainty estimation setting: identify setting where we understand on which examples we expect the model to be uncertain (due to not enough data in a dataset in a certain region, etc.), validate selected factors.\n\n3) To use the squared kernel calibration error (SKCE) proposed in [Widmann2019] along with de facto standard, but biased ECE. The SKCE is an unbiased estimate of calibration. There might be some pitfalls of this metric that I'm not aware of, but the paper looks solid and convincing. Also, please put attention to Figure 83 in the ar\u0425iv version. \n\nEditing:\n- Citations: It is better to use \"authors (year)\" style when a citation is a part of a sentence---\"(Gabbay & Hoshen, 2020) proposes\" to \"Gabbay & Hoshen, (2020) propose\", and otherwise \"(authors, year)\" when a citation is not a part of a sentence \"on original VAE framework Higgins et al.

Experiments on a synthetic dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can disentangle different extrinsic variables' contribution to the prediction uncertainty.  In addition, the authors propose to modify the latent variables to decrease uncertainty in the predictions.\n\n### Clarity\n#### Pros\n- This paper provides a clear discussion of the main contributions, assumptions, experimental settings. \n\n#### Cons\n- The experiment section needs more analysis. For example, how to explain the results in Table 1, which variable contributes most to the uncertainty and which contributes least?\n- The paper contains typos and grammatical errors and need to be proofread carefully.\n- Several questions needed to be addressed.\n\nQuestions:\n1. How to choose the latent representations? In real applications, there are usually more factors.\n2. It is not clear how the model in Figure 2 is trained. e.g. what is the loss function, do you need supervision on the latent variable.\n\n### Originality\n#### Pros\n- The paper proposes a  method to identify sources of uncertainty by disentangling representations in latent spaces in object classification tasks.\n\n#### Cons  \nThe contribution is unclear as the disentangling method is based on the DC-IGN method.  Moreover, it is unclear how to relate the imaging factors to the latent variables as multiple imaging factors can impact the same latent variable. \n\n### Significance\n#### Pros\n- It addresses an important problem; the problem of decomposition of the sources of uncertainty in model prediction is important and has not been sufficiently addressed in existing works.\n\n#### Cons\n- Entropy of the softmax is not a reliable criterion to capture uncertainty and, more importantly, other factors besides the imaging factors such as the input data density can also contribute to the uncertainty of the prediction. \n- The experiment is performed on synthetic data, which leads to limited evaluation conditions. As there is a distribution difference between synthetic data and real data, it would be more significant if the proposed method can be applied to real images.\n- The latent variables in the study are limited, only including light intensity, pose, color, etc. In real applications, there are usually many more factors such as background, occlusion, noise, resolution, etc. It would be better if the authors can study more factors or explain why specific factors are chosen.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3701/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3701/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Identifying the Sources of Uncertainty in Object Classification", "authorids": ["~Luis_Armando_P\u00e9rez_Rey1", "berk.isler94@gmail.com", "~Mike_Holenderski1", "d.s.jarnikov@tue.nl"], "authors": ["Luis Armando P\u00e9rez Rey", "Berk \u0130\u015fler", "Mike Holenderski", "Dmitri Jarnikov"], "keywords": ["Classification", "Interpretability", "Disentangled Representations", "Uncertainty Estimation"], "abstract": "In image-based object classification, the visual appearance of objects determines which class they are assigned to. External variables that are independent of the object, such as the perspective or the lighting conditions, can modify the object's appearance resulting in ambiguous images that lead to misclassifications. Previous work has proposed methods for estimating the uncertainty of predictions and measure their confidence. However, such methods do not indicate which variables are the potential sources that cause uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a method for image-based object classification that uses disentangled representations to indicate which are the external variables that contribute the most to the uncertainty of the predictions. This information can be used to identify the external variables that should be modified to decrease the uncertainty and improve the classification.", "one-sentence_summary": "In this work we propose a method for the identification of the external factors that affect the confidence of predictions in image-based object classification via the use of disentangled representations.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "rey|identifying_the_sources_of_uncertainty_in_object_classification", "pdf": "/pdf/88366dd5c1d62492570d35dad7b1c29905ddfcef.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=GokCfuBpXg", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nrey2021identifying,\ntitle={Identifying the Sources of Uncertainty in Object Classification},\nauthor={Luis Armando P{\\'e}rez Rey and Berk {\\.I}{\\c{s}}ler and Mike Holenderski and Dmitri Jarnikov},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=9UFIOHeVEh}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
