Despite the long discussion, the authors and reviewer did not come to an agreement on this point. Given that it is a crucial point for determining the significance of the contribution, my decision is to decline the paper.

We agree that turn-based games (or in general asynchronous decision-making games) can all be modeled (mapped) as Strategic Games/Markov Games (in a simultaneous decision-making fashion), by exactly the mapping mechanism you mentioned earlier, say, allowing multiple action sets for each agent. This is clear from the definition of $n$-person stochastic game $G$ in Sec 2 on page 5 in [1], which has a Selector function $\\sigma_i(s)$ (governed by the environment/game), indicating which action set to use in a particular round/turn. This Selector function is essentially the player function $Y$ we introduced in our work. \n\nHowever, we are solving multi-agent GAIL problems. The previous MA-GAIL work [RRR1] did not model the Selector Function (or our player function), thus it can only solve a subset of Markov Games (though it claimed Markov Games), where each player has only one action set and all players simultaneously play in each turn. \n\nGeneralizing MA-GAIL [RRR1] to AMA-GAIL to tackle this specific problem, we make two contributions: 1) explicitly modeling the Selector/Player function for Multi-agent GAIL problems under general asynchronous Markov Game settings, and 2) developing theoretical and algorithmic solutions to solve the problem. As a result, our contributions are novel and significant in advancing imitation learning techniques for multi-agent settings. \n\nAn updated paper is available now, where we have cited references you provided, and rephrased the game setting to emphasize our focus as (general) Markov Games, allowing asynchronous decision-making processes.

We are also grateful for your comments and have tried very hard to address your and other reviewers\u2019 concerns, as detailed in our point-by-point responses below.\n\nQuestion #1: I think section 4 (Practical Asynchronous Multi-Agent Imitation Learning) and section 5 (Experiments) should be much clearly written.\n\nResponse #1: Thank you for your suggestion. We are revising our section 4 and 5 to make them more clear. We will make the updated version available over the weekend. \n\nQuestion #2: It seems that the key difference between MA-GAIL and AMA-GAIL is whether we consider the cost function when the indicator is 0 or not, but it\u2019s difficult to figure out just by comparing (3) (MA-GAIL objective) and (14) (AMA-GAIL objective) at the first glance. Similarly in Appendix B, it\u2019s difficult to figure out the difference between MA-GAIL algorithm and AMA-GAIL except for the fact that eMGs are assumed. I think some additional explanation is needed.\n\nResponse #2: Thank you for pointing out our carelessness. The proposed AMA-GAIL is a more general problem to MA-GAIL, where diverse player participation scenarios are modeled by the introduced player function $Y$. In eq. (14), the two expectations $\\mathbb{E}$ should both be with a subscript of $Y$ as $\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi_{\\theta},Y}$, and $\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi_{E},Y}$, respectively. Such an expectation definition is clearly defined in Sec 2.1 (Extensive Markov Games), i.e., the last sentence in Sec 2.1. We will fix this in the updated version.\n\nQuestion #3: How did you generate expert trajectories in eMGs setting? Suppose there is an agent taking an action \u201c1\u201d at time t, but it was not applied to the dynamics because the indicator variable of the agent is equal to 0 at time t. In this case, what would be stored in the expert trajectories? \u201cNull\u201d or \u201c1\u201d? If the agent cannot take an action in advance (before looking at its indicator variable), I think adding indicator variables in a condition of policy, e.g., $\\pi(a|s,i) = \\pi(a|s)$ if $i=1$ , otherwise $a=$\"Null\" , is mathematically rigorous.\n\nResponse #3: Thanks for your questions and suggestions. It is \u201cnull\u201d. Yes. As you mentioned, the agent cannot take an action in advance (before looking at its indicator variable). Yes. Adding indicator variables in a condition of policy is absolutely correct mathematically. We still prefer to separate them 1) for the consistency with MA-GAIL paper (Song et al.2018), using the same form in $\\pi$, and 2) for highlighting the difference from MA-GAIL, by the player function $Y$.\n\nQuestion #4: Assuming that experts\u2019 trajectories include \u201cNull\u201d actions, how did you use MA-GAIL and BC with those trajectories? \n\nResponse #4: In the implementation, we added \u201cnull\u201d (no-participation) as an additional action to each agent\u2019s action set in MA-GAIL and BC experiments. The detailed results are shown in Figure 2, Table 1, and Appendix C.1 & C.2. They all show that our AMA-GAIL outperforms other baselines, i.e., MA-GAIL and BC. This is because \u201cno-participation\u201d itself is out of control of agents, and it is purely controlled/governed by the environment (e,g., in a stochastic turn-based game, the environment may by chance block some agents from participating in the game in certain rounds).\n\nQuestion #5: The performance of BC seems weird to me since adding lots of training data reduces supervised learning errors and can also reduce covariate shift problems in BC since the theorem tells us that the regret is bounded by (error) * (episode length) ^ 2 in the worst case [Ross and Bagnell, \u201cEfficient reductions for imitation learning\u201d]. Such a tendency is empirically shown in MA-GAIL paper as well, i.e., the performance of BC increases as the amount of expert trajectories increases. Is there any reason, BC shows poor performance in eMGs?\n\nResponse #5: Thanks for your comments and for providing the reference link to us. We will cite it in our updated version. As for the performance of BC, in Figure 2(b) the performance is poor at the beginning but increases rapidly and then converges at around 0.65 with 300 demonstrations. This is, in fact, consistent with MA-GAIL work, because in MA-GAIL, they only evaluated up to 400 demonstrations, where we evaluated from 200 to 1000 demonstrations.\n\nMoreover, in Figure 2(a), deterministic cooperative navigation is easier to learn compared with the stochastic cooperative navigation game shown in Figure 2(b), since there is no randomness in the player function. The performance from the beginning (200 demonstrations) has already stabilized at 0.7.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2551/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2551/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["xzhang17@wpi.edu", "whuang2@wpi.edu", "rjliao@cs.toronto.edu", "yli15@wpi.edu"], "title": "ASYNCHRONOUS MULTI-AGENT GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL IMITATION LEARNING", "authors": ["Xin Zhang", "Weixiao Huang", "Renjie Liao", "Yanhua Li"], "pdf": "/pdf/9728b75a4c734514f9b1f4bd934aee6dda0b021d.pdf", "TL;DR": "This paper extends the multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning to extensive-form Markov games.", "abstract": "Imitation learning aims to inversely learn a policy from expert demonstrations, which has been extensively studied in the literature for both single-agent setting with Markov decision process (MDP) model, and multi-agent setting with Markov game (MG) model.

In fact, what you just suggested is identical to what we proposed in our paper. \n\nFirst, for the reward function, and policy function of each agent, yes, our proposed AMA-GAIL introduces the player function $Y$ as the gate function controlling whether the policy and reward functions ignore a particular agent at a certain round or not. Please refer to Figure 1 (b) and (c) in our submission for a visual illustration of AMA-GAIL, which matches the idea you outlined. \n\nSecond, when the multi-agent games involve asynchronous decision-making processes, the transition probability function $P$ (governed by the environment or the game settings) works exactly as you outlined, say, ignoring the non-acting agents, where the input is also controlled by the player function $Y$. \n\nOf course, in this case, each agent keeps only one action set, rather than multiple action sets.\n\nNote that MA-GAIL does not have the player function $Y$ (given its simultaneous decision-making nature) to enable the steps of ignoring agents in asynchronous games. \n\nDoes this match what is in your mind? If yes, that is great, since this is exactly what we proposed.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2551/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2551/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["xzhang17@wpi.edu", "whuang2@wpi.edu", "rjliao@cs.toronto.edu", "yli15@wpi.edu"], "title": "ASYNCHRONOUS MULTI-AGENT GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL IMITATION LEARNING", "authors": ["Xin Zhang", "Weixiao Huang", "Renjie Liao", "Yanhua Li"], "pdf": "/pdf/9728b75a4c734514f9b1f4bd934aee6dda0b021d.pdf", "TL;DR": "This paper extends the multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning to extensive-form Markov games.", "abstract": "Imitation learning aims to inversely learn a policy from expert demonstrations, which has been extensively studied in the literature for both single-agent setting with Markov decision process (MDP) model, and multi-agent setting with Markov game (MG) model.

Cambridge University Press, 2008.\nhttp://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall08/files/SLB.pdf\n\nMoreover, you mentioned that MGs and EFGs are *functionally* equivalent because of your statement in Response #2, and there exist mappings between MG <-->EFG. We have responded to it in *Author Response to Reviewer #3 (Part 2/2)*, which clearly explains why the simple mapping you outlined would not work for our AMA-GAIL problem. It seems that you overlooked it. For your ease of accessing it, we re-attach our response below. Please let us know if you have any questions:\n\n________________________________________\nQuestion #2:  Sorry for the confusion. I did not mean that no-op is an \"additional action\" for the agent, but rather that agents *only have a single no-op action* at decision points where they do not act. E.g. to model chess as a SG, the specification of the *environment* is such that the agent has a choice of moves when it is their turn, and has only a single no-op move when it is the other player's turn.\n\n________________________________________\nResponse #2: Thanks for the clarification. It is an interesting idea to model the no-op move as an action set (with only one choice though). In this case, the agent has two action sets for different rounds (participation rounds vs no-participation rounds). Such a model is still an asynchronous decision-making case, and cannot be handled by MA-GAIL. Please find the detailed explanations below.\n\nSuch modeling matches a general asynchronous decision-making scenario, because though each agent makes an action at each round, the action set the agent uses is still governed/chosen in an ASYNCHRONOUS fashion by either a turn-based player function (in deterministic game), or more generally, by a stochastic player function, e.g., the action set is chosen by a (conditional) distribution defined by the environment. As a result, using such a multi-action-sets modeling, the multi-agent imitation learning with asynchronous decision-making processes cannot be simply solved by MA-GAIL [RR4], because MA-GAIL only allows one action set for each agent, namely, each agent takes an action at each round from the same action set. To allow multi-action-sets, an environment-defined function needs to be introduced, which is exactly our proposed player function. \n\nWe like this discussion. Thank you for bringing up interesting ideas. This reminds us that our player function can not only model whether an agent participates (i.e., choosing an action between a single no-op action set and a regular action set), but also support switching between multiple (N>=2) action sets. We will try to incorporate this interesting discussion into our paper (and acknowledge the reviewers).  \n\n[RR4] Song, Jiaming, et al. \"Multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2018. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.09936.pdf\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2551/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2551/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["xzhang17@wpi.edu", "whuang2@wpi.edu", "rjliao@cs.toronto.edu", "yli15@wpi.edu"], "title": "ASYNCHRONOUS MULTI-AGENT GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL IMITATION LEARNING", "authors": ["Xin Zhang", "Weixiao Huang", "Renjie Liao", "Yanhua Li"], "pdf": "/pdf/9728b75a4c734514f9b1f4bd934aee6dda0b021d.pdf", "TL;DR": "This paper extends the multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning to extensive-form Markov games.", "abstract": "Imitation learning aims to inversely learn a policy from expert demonstrations, which has been extensively studied in the literature for both single-agent setting with Markov decision process (MDP) model, and multi-agent setting with Markov game (MG) model.

Please find our point-by-point responses below.\n\nQuestion #1: The main criticism is that I don't think that MDPs and EFGs are really two separate classes of problem, they're just different terminology used by different communities, with a slightly different way of representing the same class of problems. In [R3] for example, notice in slide 8 they say \"One example of a two-player zero-sum stochastic game is Backgammon\", which has \"two agents who take turns\". So it seems that SG includes turn-based games. I can find nowhere in the literature that talks about SGs and EFGs being distinct classes of problem based on whether actions are simultaneous, but I'd be happy to be pointed to it.\n\nResponse #1:  In fact, MDPs and EFGs are two classes of problems: MDPs model SINGLE agents\u2019 decision making processes, and EFGs characterize games involving MULTIPLE agents. We guess you meant to say  \u201cMarkov games (MGs)/Stochastic Games (SGs)\u201d, rather than \u201cMDPs\u201d. \n\nMGs/SGs generalize MDPs from a single agent to multi-agent scenarios [RR4],[RR5]. However, MGs and EFGs are still two classes of problems, with MGs for simultaneous decision-making and EFGs for more general cases allowing asynchronous decision-making. Please find strong evidence below.\n\n1. In [RR2] (Page 1) by Prof Ramesh Johari, stochastic games are clearly defined as follows:\n``(Stochastic Games) The game starts in state $x^0$ . At each stage t, all players simultaneously choose (possibly mixed) actions $a^t_ i$ , with possible pure actions given by the set $A_i(x^t)$.\u2019\u2019\n\n2. In Section 6.2 on Page 159 in [RR1], stochastic games are defined as below, namely, a collection of normal-form games, where each normal-form game (as defined in earlier chapters in [RR1] and the Wikipedia page [RR3]) involve all agents making decisions simultaneously. \n\n\u201cA stochastic game is a collection of normal-form games; the agents repeatedly play games from this collection, and the particular game played at any given iteration depends probabilistically on the previous game played and on the actions taken by all agents in that game.\u201d\n\n3. In MA-GAIL [RR4] and MA-AIRL [RR5], the authors explicitly define MGs with all players' simultaneous decision-making at each round. Please refer to Sec 2.1 on page 2 and Sec. 4.1 on page 8 in [RR4] and Sec 2.1 on page 2 and Sec. 3.3 on page 5 in [RR5] for more details.\n\n[RR1] Shoham, Yoav, and Kevin Leyton-Brown.

I was talking about the typical way these terms are used, but you're right that people study \"perfect info EFGs\" and \"partially observed MGs\". Arguing over this distinction is a distraction from my main criticism.\n\nThe main criticism is that I don't think that MDPs and EFGs are really two separate classes of problem, they're just different terminology used by different communities, with a slightly different way of representing the same class of problems. In [R3] for example, notice in slide 8 they say \"One example of a two-player zero-sum stochastic game is Backgammon\", which has \"two agents who take turns\". So it seems that SG includes turn-based games. I can find nowhere in the literature that talks about SGs and EFGs being distinct classes of problem based on whether actions are simultaneous, but I'd be happy to be pointed to it.\n\nRe Response #2: Sorry for the confusion. I did not mean that no-op is an \"additional action\" for the agent, but rather that agents *only have a single no-op action* at decision points where they do not act. E.g. to model chess as a SG, the specification of the *environment* is such that the agent has a choice of moves when it is their turn, and has only a single no-op move when it is the other player's turn.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2551/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2551/AnonReviewer3", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["xzhang17@wpi.edu", "whuang2@wpi.edu", "rjliao@cs.toronto.edu", "yli15@wpi.edu"], "title": "ASYNCHRONOUS MULTI-AGENT GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL IMITATION LEARNING", "authors": ["Xin Zhang", "Weixiao Huang", "Renjie Liao", "Yanhua Li"], "pdf": "/pdf/9728b75a4c734514f9b1f4bd934aee6dda0b021d.pdf", "TL;DR": "This paper extends the multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning to extensive-form Markov games.", "abstract": "Imitation learning aims to inversely learn a policy from expert demonstrations, which has been extensively studied in the literature for both single-agent setting with Markov decision process (MDP) model, and multi-agent setting with Markov game (MG) model.

The fundamental difference between these two formalisms is that Markov Games aka Stochastic Games (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_game) are fully observed while EFGs in general are not fully observed. EFGs are called Partially-Observed Markov Games in the RL literature. \"Go\" is actually a MG, in contradiction with the authors' statement in the intro.\n\nResponse #1:  Thanks for pointing this out, but we do not agree with your statement. The difference between Markov games vs. Extensive-form games has nothing to do with full vs partial observability.\n\nMarkov games (aka stochastic game) are normal-form games with multiple stages, and at each stage all agents need to make simultaneous decisions. In Extensive-form games (or extensive games), agents make asynchronous decisions over game stages (See Page 89 Chapter 6.1.1, line 1 in [R1], and [R3]). On the other hand, fully vs. partially observable games are also called perfect information games vs. imperfect information games (See [R1]). For a game, being a perfect or imperfect information game is totally orthogonal to whether it is a Markov game or an extensive-form game. For example, [R2] discussed that Markov games can be perfect information or imperfect information; [R1] discussed that extensive games can be perfect information (Part 2 in [R1]) or imperfect information (Part 3 in [R1]). Chess is an extensive game with perfect information (Page 100 in [R1]), so is Go. \n\nBTW, we checked the wiki link provided by the reviewer, which does not seem to support the statement of \u201cstochastic games are fully observed\u201d at all.\n\n[R1] Osborne, Martin J., and Ariel Rubinstein.

In fact, when we implemented MA-GAIL in evaluations, we took the \u201cno-participation\u201d as an action for agents, and Fig 2 (a)-(c) show the comparison results with AMA-GAIL, and BC, and our AMA-GAIL outperforms the other baselines.\n\nQuestion #3: I don't understand the necessity of (t+1)-step constraints in order the achieve a SPE.\n\nResponse #3: Thanks for pointing this out. Given the AMA-RL problem with Subgame Perfect Equilibrium (SPE) constraints defined in eq.(8)-(9), we are not using (t+1)-step constraints to achieve the SPE. Instead, we use (t+1)-step constraints to find the corresponding AMA-IRL problem eq.(12), in a consistent form as MA-IRL in MA-GAIL (Song et al.2018) and IRL in GAIL (Ho et al. 2016). With eq.(12), we can further formulate the AMA-RL $\\circ$ AMA-IRL problem in (Theorem 3 and eq.(13)) and employ the GAN framework to solve it.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2551/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2551/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["xzhang17@wpi.edu", "whuang2@wpi.edu", "rjliao@cs.toronto.edu", "yli15@wpi.edu"], "title": "ASYNCHRONOUS MULTI-AGENT GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL IMITATION LEARNING", "authors": ["Xin Zhang", "Weixiao Huang", "Renjie Liao", "Yanhua Li"], "pdf": "/pdf/9728b75a4c734514f9b1f4bd934aee6dda0b021d.pdf", "TL;DR": "This paper extends the multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning to extensive-form Markov games.", "abstract": "Imitation learning aims to inversely learn a policy from expert demonstrations, which has been extensively studied in the literature for both single-agent setting with Markov decision process (MDP) model, and multi-agent setting with Markov game (MG) model.

The fundamental difference between these two formalisms is that Markov Games aka Stochastic Games (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_game) are fully observed while EFGs in general are not fully observed. EFGs are called Partially-Observed Markov Games in the RL literature. \"Go\" is actually a MG, in contradiction with the authors' statement in the intro.\n\nThe authors make an artificial distinction that \"turn-based\" games cannot be handled under the MG formalism. In fact, turn-based games (even when the turn order is dynamic/stochastic) is easily handled by the MG formalism, by assigning \"no-op\" moves to players who are not active at this decision point. Therefore, I don't see why any additional mechanics are needed to apply MA-GAIL to turn-based games.\n\nSimilarly, I don't understand the necessity of (t+1)-step constraints in order the achieve a SPE, which appears to be the central contribution of this work. The one-shot deviation principle still holds even if some players' actions are \"no-ops\" at certain decision points.\n\nI did not read the proofs or experiments closely since I believe there are flaws in the central idea of this work.

Compared to Markov Games (MGs), extensive Markov Games (eMGs) introduces indicator variables, which means whether agents will participate in the game at the specific time step or not, and player function, which is a probability distribution of indicator variables given histories and assumed to be governed by the environment, not by the agents. Such a model allows us to consider asynchronous participation of agents, whereas MGs only consider synchronous participation, which is assumed in the existing multi-agent imitation learning algorithms such as MA-GAIL and MA-AIRL.\n\nThe contribution of this submission can be summarized as follows. From a theoretical perspective, the submission extends the theorems in MA-GAIL to those in eMGs, where most of them deal with Lagrange multiplier, its meaning, and properties. Followed by Theorem1 and 2, authors define an extensive occupancy measure, a natural extension of occupancy measures in MGs, and cast a multi-agent imitation learning problem into extensive occupancy measure matching problem in Theorem 3. For a practical algorithm, AMA-GAIL is proposed and shown to have a performance gain relative to BC and MA-GAIL.\n\nThe submission is highly interesting, but I think section 4 (Practical Asynchronous Multi-Agent Imitation Learning) and section 5 (Experiments) should be much clearly written. The followings are comments regarding those sections:\n- It seems that the key difference between MA-GAIL and AMA-GAIL is whether we consider the cost function when the indicator is 0 or not, but it\u2019s difficult to figure out just by comparing (3) (MA-GAIL objective) and (14) (AMA-GAIL objective) at the first glance.\n- Similarly in Appendix B, it\u2019s difficult to figure out the difference between MA-GAIL algorithm and AMA-GAIL except the fact that eMGs are assumed. I think some additional explanation is needed.  \n- How did you generate expert trajectories in eMGs setting? Suppose there is an agent taking an action \u201c1\u201d at time t, but it was not applied to the dynamics because the indicator variable of the agent is equal to 0 at time t. In this case, what would be stored in the expert trajectories? \u201cNull\u201d or \u201c1\u201d? If the agent cannot take an action in advance (before looking at its indicator variable), I think adding indicator variables in a condition of policy, e.g., $\\pi(a|s, i)=pi(a|s)$ if $i=1$, otherwise $\\mathbb{I}\\{a=\"Null\"\\}$, is mathematically rigorous.\n- Assuming that experts\u2019 trajectories include \u201cNull\u201d actions, how did you use MA-GAIL and BC with those trajectories? \n- The performance of BC seems weird to me since adding lots of training data reduces supervised learning errors and can also reduce covariate shift problems in BC since the theorem tells us that the regret is bounded by (error) * (episode length) ^ 2 in the worst case [Ross and Bagnell, \u201cEfficient reductions for imitation learning\u201d]. Such a tendency is empirically shown in MA-GAIL paper as well, i.e., performance of BC increases as the amount of expert trajectories increases. Is there any reason, BC shows poor performance in eMGs?\n\nThere are some minor comments:\n\n- In 2.1., $\\eta$ (initial state distribution) is not explicitly defined.\n- In 2.1., MGs assume each agent\u2019s reward function depends on other agents\u2019 actions as well as agents\u2019 own actions, but in the submission, rewards only depend on agents\u2019 own actions. This may be due to the asynchronous setting, but I think it should be mentioned in the paper.  \n- In Definition 1, null action is describe as $0$, whereas it was defined as $\\phi$ in 2.1.\n- In a sentence below Definition 1, $\\eta(i)=1$ -> $\\zeta(i)=1$.\n- Below (14), we don\u2019t have full knowledge of transition P, but we can sample from it (like black-box model). \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2551/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2551/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["xzhang17@wpi.edu", "whuang2@wpi.edu", "rjliao@cs.toronto.edu", "yli15@wpi.edu"], "title": "ASYNCHRONOUS MULTI-AGENT GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL IMITATION LEARNING", "authors": ["Xin Zhang", "Weixiao Huang", "Renjie Liao", "Yanhua Li"], "pdf": "/pdf/9728b75a4c734514f9b1f4bd934aee6dda0b021d.pdf", "TL;DR": "This paper extends the multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning to extensive-form Markov games.", "abstract": "Imitation learning aims to inversely learn a policy from expert demonstrations, which has been extensively studied in the literature for both single-agent setting with Markov decision process (MDP) model, and multi-agent setting with Markov game (MG) model.

Given our AMA-RL problem with Subgame Perfect Equilibrium (SPE) constraints defined in eq.(8)-(9), our goal is to find the formulation of AMA-IRL problem, that has a consistent format to MA-IRL in MAGAIL (Song et al. 2018) and IRL in GAIL (Ho et al. 2016).  This is challenging for the non-convex AMA-RL problem. As a result, we \"relax\" the primal problem by choosing a particular \\lambda as shown in Theorem 2, which leads to the consistent AMA-IRL formulation (in eq.(12)) to that of MA-IRL and single agent IRL. Such relaxation enables us to solve AMA-RL \u25e6 AMA-IRL with GANs models (as outlined in Sec 4).  Again, we never tried to use the specific $\\lambda$ to solve the dual, nor the original AMA-RL problem. \n\n(Song et al. 2018) Jiaming Song, Hongyu Ren, Dorsa Sadigh, and Stefano Ermon.
