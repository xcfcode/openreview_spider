We think this discussion is helpful and important in understanding the paper. \n\n\u201c\u2026 I still don't quite get how to go from an ODE/PDE to the Lagrangian. What is the relation between these two as well as the Lyapuno function ...\u201d\n\nIt is actually the other way around. First, the Lagrangian is formulated. Then, ODE/PDEs are obtained from the Lagrangian.  \n\nThe Lagrangian function in Eq. (2) is motivated by Lagrangian mechanics. In Lagrangian mechanics, the Lagrangian function is equal to the difference between kinetic energy and the potential energy. The Lagrangian in Eq. (2) has similar form when one think of X_t as position, U_t as velocity, and the objective function f(x) as potential energy. The time-varying scaling parameters are employed to obtain the convergence to the minimum. \n\nLyaponov functions are commonly understood as functions that capture the \u201cenergy\u201d of the system. They should be positive everywhere, except at the equilibrium, where they should equal to zero. The Lyapunov function Eq. (6) that appears in the paper has almost the form of sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy.\n\nPlease note that we point out the role of \u201ckinetic energy\u201d and \u201cpotential energy\u201d in the Lagrangian in Eq. (2). For detailed discussion, we refer the interested reader to Wibinoso et. al. (2016).\n\n \u201c\u2026 Although the paper considers a different PDE (part of it is the first order Langevin PDE), I think same technique can be applied to the 2nd order PDE, which can also be defined by a Wasserstein gradient flow on the joint space.\u201c\n\nThe accelerated flow proposed in our paper can NOT be defined by a Wasserstein gradient flow on the joint space. It does not belong to the family of Wasserstein gradient flows that appear in the paper that you mentioned [A blob method for diffusion] for any choice of functionals.   \n\nThe situation is similar to the vector case. The accelerated flow is not a gradient flow. It can NOT be obtained from gradient of any function on the joint space. It is actually a Hamiltonian flow as it was shown in Wibinoso et. al. (2016), also reviewed in Sec. 2 of our paper.  \n\nSimilarly, the accelerated flow for probability distribution that is presented in our paper is NOT a Wasserstein gradient flow with respect to any functional.  It does not belong to the family of the Wasserstein gradient flows for any choice of the functionals. Actually, the accelerated flow presented in our paper is a Hamiltonian flow on the space of probability distributions, as it is shown in Theorem 1. \n\nIn fact, if it was possible, showing that the second order Langevin equation is a Wassertein gradient flow is a great contribution, and we are very interested to know how this derivation is done exactly. \n\n\u201cthis paper seems to proposes a different way to get the 2nd order Langevin PDE, but the final numerical solution seems to be a numerical solution directly from some specific Wasserstein gradient flow\u201d\n\nWe disagree with the conclusion for the following reasons:  \n\n1) The accelerated flow presented in our paper is different from the 2nd order Langevin equation both in PDE form and in ODE form (please see our previous response and Appendix D). \n\n2) This paper is proposing a variational formulation to construct accelerated flow for probability distributions. We want to emphasize the important role of variational formulation (please see our previous response). Note that the same criticism also holds for Lagrangian mechanics. It can also be said that Lagrangian mechanics is \u201ca different way\u201d to obtain Newton\u2019s second law. However, such evaluation is undermining the importance of Lagrangian mechanics.  \n\n3) The numerical algorithm is obtained from discretizing the accelerated flow which itself is obtained from the variational formulation. The numerical algorithm is not obtained from any Wasserstein gradient flow because the accelerated flow proposed in our paper is not a Wasserstein gradient flow.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1497/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1497/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1497/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Accelerated Gradient Flow for Probability Distributions", "abstract": "This paper presents a methodology and numerical algorithms for constructing accelerated gradient flows on the space of probability distributions.

We would like to clarify that this is not the case for the second order equation considered in this paper. \n\nFor a first order Langevin equation, it is indeed true that the Brownian motion and $\\nabla log(p)$ yield the same distribution. In other words, if one replaces the Brownian motion with $\\nabla log(p)$ in the first order Langevin equation, the resulting Fokker-Planck equation and thus the distribution remains the same. \n\nHowever, this property does not hold for the second order Langevin equation considered in this paper. In the second order system, we are dealing with the joint distribution on position and momentum. If one replaces the Brownian motion (in the momentum update) with $\\nabla log(p)$ where $p$ is the marginal on the position, the resulting Fokker-Planck equations are different.  Consequently, the distributions are also different.  \n\nSince this is an important point, we have included a new section (Appendix D) as part of the supplementary material in the paper to show the difference between the first order and the second order cases.  \n\n\u201c.. Actually, I think the derivation of accelerated gradient flow formula from the view of optimal control formalism does not seem necessary ..\u201d \n\nVariational formulation of fundamental equations is a cornerstone of Mathematics.  \n    1. Lagrangian mechanics is a variational formulation of Newtonian mechanics;\n    2. Feynman\u2019s path integral formulation of quantum mechanics;\n    3. For the Fokker-Planck equation, the celebrated gradient flow construction of the Jordan- Kinderlehrer-Otto;\n    4. Finally, Wibisono et. al. is itself a variational formulation of the Nesterov ode (which has been known since 1980-s).\n`    5. As noted in the introduction, the objective of this paper is to generalize Wibisono el. al. (2016). So a variational construction is natural.  \n  \nIn all these cases 1-4, variational formulations have been worthy of study not only for numerical reasons but also because of their rich mathematical structure, geometric aspects which makes the derivation of models and algorithms independent of the choice of coordinates, first integrals and Lyapunov function which provides insights into conserved quantities and convergence analysis etc.  Variational formulations have also been useful for numerics, e.g., development of symplectic integrators.  \n\n\u201c \u2026 One can get the same formula by deriving it from Wasserstein gradient flows. \u201d\n\n We disagree that the proposed accelerated algorithm can be derived using Wasserstein gradient flows. Or at least, we are not aware of how to do that.   \n\n\" ... though the derivation of accelerated gradient flow formula seems interesting, the resulting algorithm does not seem benefit from this derivation\"\n\nThe concern of the reviewer is justified. The numerical algorithm is obtained from discretizing the Hamilton\u2019s equations (16).  These equations are directly derived from the variational formulation. One may try to obtain the numerical algorithm directly from the variational formulation by discretizing (in both time and space) the Lagrangian directly. For example, the symplectic integration is the result of such a time discretization. We believe that it is possible express the variational problem in terms of particles in the Gaussian setting with the solution given by the proposed numerical algorithm in the Gaussian settings. However, doing so in more general setting is beyond the scope of this paper. \n\n\u201cThe authors then shows empirically that the proposed method is better than SGHMC, which I think only comes from the numerical methods.\u201d\n\nRegarding the numerical comparison, the revised version of the paper includes comparison to MCMC, HMCMC (which is the same as the second order Langevin equation), and a method based on the density estimation. Please note that, as clearly described in the Introduction, the main contribution of the paper is the variational formulation and the generalization of the Wibisono et. al. and not the numerical algorithm in of itself. The numerical experiments are included to illustrate the theoretical results (e.g., accelerated convergence rates), show the potential and limitations of the proposed algorithm (e.g., bias-variance tradeoff depicted in Fig. 3 (d) and computational complexity depicted in Fig. 3 (c), and provide some preliminary comparisons with MCMC and HMCMC (Fig. 3). \n\nWe do not claim that the proposed algorithm is better than all the existing algorithms.  Such a claim will require extensive numerical experiments which are outside the scope of this paper.

The generalization of variational formulation from finite space to the space of probability measures seems new, but the resulting PDE seems to be a known result, which is the Fokker-Planck equation (with some minor modifications) for the 2nd order Langevin dynamic. From this point of view, the resulting algorithm from the derived PDE seems not having much practical advantage over SGHMC (a stochastic version of 2nd order Langevin dynamics).\n\nActually, I think the derivation of accelerated gradient flow formula from the view of optimal control formalism does not seem necessary. One can get the same formula by deriving it from Wasserstein gradient flows. When considering the functional as relative entropy, one can derive the formula simply from the Fokker-Planck equation of 2nd order Langevin dynamics. As a result, the proposed methods seems to be a new way to derive the Wasserstein gradient flow (or Fokker-Planck equation), which does not make impact the algorithm, e.g., both ways result in the same algorithm.\n\nBesides, I found the writing needs to be improved. There are a lot of background missing, or the descriptions are not clear enough.  For example:\n1. Page 2: the divergence operator is not defined, though I think it is a standard concept, but would be better to define it.\n2. Page 2: the Wasserstein gradient and Gateaux derivative are not defined, what are the specific meanings of \\nabla_\\rho F(\\rho) and \\partial F / \\partial \\rho?\n3. 1st line in Section 2: convex function f of d real variables seems odd, I guess the author means argument of f is d-dimensional variable.\n4. Section 2, the authors directly start with the variational problem (3) without introducing the problem. Why do we need to variational problem? It would be hard to follow for some one who does not have such background.\n5. Similarly, what is the role of Lyapunov function here in (6)? Why do we need it?\n6. Why do you define the Lagrangian L in the form of (10)? What is the relation between (10) and (2)?\n7. It is not clear what \"The stochastic process (X_t, Y_t) is Gaussian\" means in Proposition 1? It might need to be rephrased.\n8. Second last line in page 5: I guess \\nabla \\log(\\rho) should be \\nabla\\log(\\rho_t).\n\nFor the theory, I think eq.15 only applies when the PDE, e.g. (13), is solved exactly, thus there is not too much practical impact, as it is well known from the Wasserstein gradient theory that the PDE decays exponentially, as stated in the theorem. When considering numerical solutions, I think this results is useless.\n\nFor the relation with SGHMC, let's look at eq.16. Actually, the derivative of the log term \\nabla \\log \\rho_t(X_t)) is equivalent to a brownian motion term. This can be seen by considering the Fokker-Planck equation for Brownian motion, which is exactly d \\rho_t = \\Delta \\rho_t. Consequently, instead of using the numerical approximations proposed later, one cane simply replacing this term with a Brownian motion term, which reduces to SGHMC (with some constant multipliers in front). \n\nThe authors then shows empirically that the proposed method is better than SGHMC, which I think only comes from the numerical methods.\n\nFor the kernel approximation, it makes the particles in the algorithm interactive. This resembles other particle optimization based algorithms such as SVGD, or the latest particle interactive SGLD proposed in [1] or [2[.  I think these methods need to be compared.\n\n[1] Chen et al (2018), A Unified Particle-Optimization Framework for Scalable Bayesian Sampling.\n[2] Liu et al (2018), https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01750.pdf\n\nTo sum up, though the derivation of accelerated gradient flow formula seems interesting, the resulting algorithm does not seem benefit from this derivation. The algorithm seems to be able to derived from a more direct way of using Wasserstein gradient flows, which results in a Wasserstein gradient flow for 2nd order Langevin dynamics, and is thus well known.

The preliminary numerical results demonstrate that, using the same number of samples, the proposed numerical algorithm achieves better accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art.  The theoretical contributions together with these preliminary results are likely to fuel future study to develop more practical lower-complexity algorithms.

The basic idea is to define accelerated gradient flows on the space of probability distribution. Because the defined flows include a term depending on the current distribution of the system, which is difficult to compute in general, the authors introduce an interacting particle approximation as a practical numerical approximation. The experiments are a proof-of-concept on simple illustrative toy examples.\n\nQuality: The ideas are generally of high quality, but I think there might some typos (or at least some notation I did not understand). In particular\n- tilde{F} is not defined for Table 1\n- the lyapunov function for the vector column of table one includes a term referring to the functional over rho. I think this is a typo and should be f(x) - f(xmin) instead.\n\nClarity: The paper is generally clear throughout.\n\nOriginality & Significance: The paper is original to my knowledge, and a valuable extension to the interesting literature on the Bregman Lagrangian. The problem of simulating from probability distributions is an important one and this is an interesting connection between that problem and optimization.\n\nPros:\n- An interesting extension that may fuel future study.\n\nCons:\n- This algorithm appears naively to have an O(n^2) complexity per iteration, which is very expensive in terms of the number of particles. Most MCMC algorithms would have only O(n) complexity in the number of particles.
