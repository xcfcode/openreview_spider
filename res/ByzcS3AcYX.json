What dimension did you use, and did you try to use smaller size? 2) The GST layer in Wang et al.'18 is an even more aggressive bottleneck layer, which could (almost) eliminate style info entangled with content info. \n\n* The sampling process to get x_{aud}^{-} needs more careful justifications/ablations.\n-- Is random sampling enough? What if the model samples a x_{aud}^{-} that has the same speaking style as x_{aud}^{+}? (which could be a common case).\n\n* Did you consider the idea in Fader Netowrks (Lample et al.'17)', which corresponds to adding a simple adversarial loss on the style embedding? It occurs to be a much simpler alternative to the proposed method.\n\n* Table 1. \"Tacotron2\" is often referred to Shen et al.'18, not Skerry-Ryan et al.'18.

The three-component adversarial loss is novel to this task.  While it has technical merit, the presentation of this paper make it unready for publication.  The technical descriptions are difficult to follow in places, it makes some incorrect statements about speech and speech synthesis and its evaluation is lacking in a number of ways.   After a substantial revision and additional evaluation, this will be a very good paper.\n\nThe title of the paper and moniker of this approach as \u201cTTS-GAN\u201d seems to preclude the fact that in the last few years there have been a number of approaches to speech synthesis using GANs.  By using such a generic term, it implies that this is the \u201cstandard\u201d way of using a GAN for TTS.  Clearly it is not. Moreover, other than the use of the term, the authors do not claim that it is. \n\nWhile the related works regarding style modeling and transfer in end-to-end TTS models are well described, prior work on using GANs in TTS is not.  (This may or may not be related to the previous point.)  For example, but not limited to:\nYang Shan, Xie Lei, Chen Xiao, Lou Xiaoyan, Zhu Xuan, Huang Dongyan, and Li Haizhou, Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesis Using Generative Adversarial Networks Under a Multi-task Learning Framework, ASRU, 2017\nYuki Saito, Shinnosuke Takamichi, Hiroshi Saruwatari, Text-to-speech Synthesis using STFT Spectra Based on Low- /multi-resolution Generative Adversarial Networks, ICASSP 2018\nSaito Yuki, Takamichi Shinnosuke, and Saruwatari Hiroshi, Training Algorithm to Deceive Anti-spoofing Verification for DNN-based Speech Synthesis, ICASSP, 2017.\n\nSection 2 describes speech synthesis as a cross-domain mapping problem F : S -> T, where S is text and T is speech. (Why a text-to-speech mapping is formalized as S->T is an irrelevant mystery.)  This is a reasonable formulation, however, this is not a bijective mapping.  There are many valid realizations s \\subset T of a text utterance t \\in S.  The true mapping F is one-to-many.    Contrary to the statement in Section 2, there should not be a one-to-one correspondence between input conditions and the output audio waveform and this should not be assumed.  This formalism can be posed as a simplification of the speech synthesis mapping problem.  Overall Section 2 lays an incorrect and unnecessary formalism over the problem, and does very little in terms of \u201cbackground\u201d information regarding speech synthesis or GANs.  I would recommend distilling the latter half of the last paragraph.  This content is important -- the goal of this paper is to disentangle the style component (s) from the \u201ceverything else\u201d component (z)  in x_{aud} by which the resultant model can be correctly conditioned on s and ignore z.\n\nSection 3.2 Style Loss: The parallel between artistic style in vision and speaking style in speech is misplaced.  Artistic style can be captured by local information by representing color choices, brush technique, etc.  Speaking style and prosodic variation more broadly is suprasegmental.  That is it spans multiple speech segments (typically defined as phonetic units, phonemes, etc.).  It is specifically not captured in local variations in the time-frequency domain.  The local statistics of a mel-spectrogram are empoverished to capture the long term variation spanning multiple syllables, words, and phrases that contribute to \u201cspeaking style\u201d.  (In addition to the poor motivation of using low-level filters to capture speaking style, the authors describe \u201cprosody\u201d as \u201crepresenting the low-level characteristics of sound\u201d. This is not correct.)  These filter activations are more likely to capture voice quality and speaker identity characteristics than prosody and speaking style.\n\nSection 3.2: Reconstruction Loss: The training in this section is difficult to follow.  Presumably, l is the explicit style label from the data, the emotion label for EMT-4 and (maybe) speaker id for VCTK.  It is a rather confusing choice to refer to this as \u201clatent\u201d since this carries a number of implications from variational techniques and bayesian inference.  Similarly, It is not clear how these are trained. Specifically, both terms are minimized w.r.t. C but the second is minimized only w.r.t G.  I would recommend that this section be rewritten to describe both the loss functions, target variables, and the dependent variables that are optimized during training.\n\nSection 3.3 How are the coefficients \\alpha and \\beta determined?\n\nSection 3.3 \u201cWe train TTS-GAN for at least 200k steps.\u201d Why be vague about the training?\n\nSection 3.3. \u201cDuring training R is fixed weights\u201d Where do these weights come from? Is it an ImageNet classifier similar with a smaller network than VGG-19?\n\nSection 5: The presentation of results into Table 1 and Table 2 is quite odd.  The text material references Table 1 in Section 5.1, then Table 2 in Section 5.2, then Table 1 in Section 5.3 and then Table 2 again in Section 5.3.  It would be preferable to include the tabular material which is being discussed in the same order as the text.\n\nSection 5: Evaluation.  It is surprising that there is no MOS or naturalness evaluation of this work.  In general increased flexibility of a style-enabled system results in decreased naturalness.  While there are WER results to show that intelligibility (at least machine intelligibility) may not suffer, the lack of an MOS result to describe TTS quality is surprising.\n\nSection 5: The captions of Tables 1 and 2 should provide appropriate context for the contained data.  There is not enough information to understand what is described here without reference to the associated text.\n\nSection 5.1: The content and style swapping is not evaluated.  While samples are provided, it is not at all clear that the claims made by the authors are supported by the data.  A listening study where subjects are asked to identify the intended emotion of the utterance would be a convincing way to demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique.  As it stands, I would recommend removing the section titled \u201cContent and style swapping\u201d as it is unempirical.  If the authors are committed to it, it could be reasonably moved to the conclusions or discussion section as anecdotal evidence.\n\nSection 5.3: Why use a pre-trained WaveNet based ASR model?  What is its performance on the ground truth audio?  This is a valuable baseline for the WER of the synthesized material.\n\nSection 5.3 Style Transfer: Without support that the subject ratings in this test follow a normal distribution a t-test is not a valid test to use here.  A non-parametric test like a Mann-Whitney U test would be more appropriate.\n\nSection 5.3 Style Transfer: \u201cEach listened to all 15 permutations of content\u201d.  From the previous paragraph there should be 60 permutations.\n\nSection 5.3 Style Transfer: Was there any difference in the results from the 10 sentences from the test set, and the 5 drawn from the web?\n\nTypos:\nSection 1 Introduction: \u201cx_{aud}^{+} is unpaired\u201d -> \u201cx_{aud}^{-} is unpaired\u201d\nSection 2: \u201cHere, We\u201d -> \u201cHere, we\u201d\nSection 5.3 \u201cTachotron\u201d -> \u201cTacotron\u201d", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1570/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural TTS Stylization with Adversarial and Collaborative Games", "abstract": "The modeling of style when synthesizing natural human speech from text has been the focus of significant attention.

In general prosodic modifications lead to decreased quality.  Assessing how large this degradation is valuable in assessing this work.  For what it's worth, both the GST and prosody-tacotron papers would significantly benefit from this kind of evaluation and I find it surprising that they were omitted.  \n\n\"So other than some evaluation metrics used in regular TTS, we also performed a set of experiments that do not typically appear in TTS work.\"\nThe main evaluation metrics for \"regular TTS\" are subjective tests that look at naturalness and to a lesser extent (given the state of the art) intelligibility. The typical tests are MOS, MUSHRA, or ABX (AXB, AXY).  The intelligibility dimension has been assessed by the WER evaluation.  Naturalness (or quality) has not.  It might be reasonable to claim that for this work TTS quality (measured in terms of naturalness) is not important, and is therefore not evaluated.\n\n\"The most important claim in our paper is the ability to disentangle content and style. We believe this [swapping] experiment actually is most important evaluation in validating our claim.\"  \nI agree that this is the most important claim of the paper and the most important evaluation.  This is why it is so surprising that there is no evaluation here.  Rather 16 examples are offered.  It would be reasonable to ask a human rater to assess the emotional content of the utterance as either neutral, happy, sad, angry.  This seems to be the most direct assessment of the claim of the paper.  Does the newly synthesized utterance contain the desired emotional information?  The style transfer evaluation is much more effective at demonstrating this.  The examples without evaluation are unconvincing.  \n\nStyle transfer: \n\"To validate that the test follows a normal distribution would require a large amount of subjective studies.  We followed the precedent in the most recent works (GST, and prosody-Tacotron).\"\n1) you do not need to use a t-test.  There are non-parametric tests available (specifically the Mann-Whitney U-test) that do not assume that the observations follow a normal distribution.  Most (all?) statistical packages support this test. 2) the test used in GST is not described.  In prosody-tacotron a 95% confidence interval is described, but not a t-test.  I hope that the confidence interval is generated non-parametrically in that work.  Using a mean and standard deviation derived from observations that are not normally distribtued would have generated a biased estimate of the confidence intervals. 3) even if these papers did use an unsupported statistical test, the t-test is still not valid without confirmation that the analyzed ordinal subject responses follow a normal distribution (in most cases they do not).

A given text, with the same condition (style), can be produced as \"angry\" with different acoustic realizations.    The content, speaker and condition can all be transmitted and there are still valid variations of the realization.    This could be theoretically true, if the condition is considered to be a specific prosodic realization P of speaker A speaking utterance X, and the target of generating speaker B speaking utterance X with realization P.  However, 1) given the state of the art and understanding of prosody, it is very underdetermined, and not exactly useful.  it is underdetermined because we do not have a way of disentagling prosodic realization from speaker identity.  While we have some approaches to map from one speaker's pitch range to another, transformation of normal and affected speaking rhythm and voice qualities from one speaker to another are not well understood or all that thoroughly well studied.  And 2) it's also not clear that this is the desired mapping.  The goal is to retain the conditioning variable -- here a coarse description of affect.  The realization of speaker A speaking utterance X with \"angry\" prosody in and of itself is not unique.  Neither are the realizations of speaker B speaking utterance X with \"angry\" prosody.  Even if there is a theoretical bijective mapping based on a highly specified condition, the practical mapping that is being learned here is many-to-many.    The broader point is that the \"Ideal\" F is not even a function.  The target is a set, not a point, f(x_txt, x_aud) = {t \\in trg_{txt, aud}} where trg_{txt, aud} is the set of all valid realizations of the text, txt, and conditioning information, aud, by the target speaker. \n\nStepping back, the concern with maximum likelihood that is being raised is that the learned F may not be injective, i.e. that the learned function may map multiple elements of the domain to the same realization and completely ignore x_{aud}.  This is a fair concern.  One issue with the term bijective is that determines that F should also be surjective -- that every element in \\hat{x} should be mappable from some x_txt and x_aud.  This aspect isn't addressed by the work.\n\nMaking this discussion more constructive -- 1) consider removing the term \"Ideally\" from section 2.  The description here is much more practical than it is ideal.  2) consider replacing bijective with injective.  I believe it's more consistent with the problem that is being solved.\n\nStyle loss:\nMy initial description of prosody was perhaps too pointed at addressing the (since deleted) statement in the previous draft that claimed that prosody was only the low-level characteristics.  Prosody does include local time-frequency elements -- particularly as they capture voice quality.  The previous point was that prosody (in its entirety) cannot be captured by these representation.  Prosody includes (but is not limited to) pitch (intonation), intensity, speaking rate/rhythm, and the use of pauses (usually, but not only to impact phrasing) as well as voice quality.  The use of pitch and intensity are primarily relevant in a suprasegmental context.  For example, in English(es), an absolute pitch observation carries very little information, but a rising or falling pitch contour (or contextualized within the speakers pitch range or register) can have significant information on the semantics pragmatics and paralinguistics of the utterance.  I did not mean to suggest that there isn't important information in the time-spectrum.  However, if you consider the literature on prosody as a whole you'll find that the relative value of local spectral content is much less relevant than suprasegmental content.  (This includes the references mentioned in the comment above. There are corresponding papers for each of the tasks (sarcasm recognition, emotion recognition, prosody in speaker recognition) that show that suprasegmental representations of prosody are more valuable that short time analyses.)

Thus, we provide content - text - and style - voice. It leverages recent - phenomenal - progress in TTS with Deep Neural Networks as seen from exemplar works such as Tacotron (and derivatives), DeepVoice, which use seq2seq RNNs and Wavenet families of models. The work is extremely relevant in that audio data is hard to generate (expensive) and content-style modeling could be useful in a number of practical areas in synthetic voice generation. It is also quite applicable in the related problem of voice conversion. The work also uses some quite complex - (and very interesting!) - proposals to abstract style, and paste with content using generative modeling. I am VERY excited by this effort in that it puts together a number of sophisticated pieces together, in what I think is a very sensible way to implement a solution to this very difficult problem. However, I would like clarifications and explanations, especially in regards to the architecture.  \n\nDescription of problem: The paper proposes a fairly elaborate setup to inject voice style (speech) into text. At train time it takes in text samples $x_{txt}$, paired voice samples (utterances that have $x_{txt}$ as content) $s+$ and unpaired voice samples $s-$, and produces two voice samples $x+$ (for paired  <txt, utterance>) and $x-$ (for unpaired txt/utterance). The idea is that at test time, we pass in a text sample $x_{txt}$ and an UNPAIRED voice sample $x_{aud}$ and the setup produces voice in the style of $x_{aud}$ but whose content is $x_{txt}$, in other words it generates synthetic speech saying $x_{txt}$. The paper goes on to show performance metrics based on an autoencoder loss, WER and t-SNE embeddings for various attributes. \n\nContext:  The setup seems to be built upon the earlier work by Taigman et al (2016) which has the extremely interesting conception of using a {\\it ternary} discriminator loss to carry out domain adaptation between images. This previous work was prior to the seminal CycleGAN work for image translation, which many speech works have since used. Interestingly, the Taigman work also hints at a 'common' latent representation a la UNIT using coupled VAE-GANs with cycle consistency (also extremely pertinent), but done differently. In addition to the GAN framework by Taigman et al, since this work is built upon Tacotron and the GST (Global Style Tokens) work that followed it, the generative setup is a sophisticated recurrent attention based seq2seq model.\n\nFormulation:\nA conditional formulation is used wherein the content c (encoding generated by text) is passed along with other inputs in the generator and discriminator. The formulation in Taigman assumes that there is an invariant representation in both (image) domains with shared features. To this, style embeddings (audio) gets added on and then gets passed into the generator to generate the speech. Both c and s seem to be encoder outputs in the formulation. The loss components of what they call \u2018adversarial\u2019, \u2018collaborative\u2019 and \u2018style\u2019 losses. \n\nAdversarial losses\nThe ternary loss for D consists of \n\nDiscriminator output from \u2018paired\u2019 style embedding (i.e. text matching the content of paired audio sample)\nDiscriminator output from \u2018unpaired\u2019 style embedding (i.e text paired with random sample of some style)\nDiscriminator output from target ground truth style. The paper uses x_+, so I would think that it uses the paired sample (i.e. from the source) style.\n\nGenerator loss (also analogous to Taigman et al) consists of generations from paired and unpaired audio, possibly a loose analogue to source and target domains, although in this case we can\u2019t as such think of \u2018+\u2019 as the source domain, since the input is text. \n\nCollaborative losses \nThis has two components, one for style (Gatys et al 2016) and a reconstruction component. The reconstruction component again has two terms, one to reconstruct the paired audio output \u2018x+=x_audio+\u2019 - so that the input content is reproduced -  and the other to encourage reconstruction of the latent code. \n\nDatasets and Results:\nThey use two datasets: one, an internal \u2018EMT-4\u2019 dataset with 20k+ English speakers, and the other, the VCTK corpus. Comparisons are made with a few good baselines in Tacotron2, GST and DeepVoice2. \n\nOne comparison technique to test disentanglement ability is to compare autoencoder reconstructions with the idea that a setup that has learnt to disentangle would produce higher reconstruction error because it has learnt to separate style and content. \n\nt-SNE embeddings are presented to show visualizations of various emotion styles (neutral, angry, sad and happy), and separation of male and female voices. A WER metric is also presented so that generations are passed into a classifier (an ASR system trained on Wavenet). All the metrics above seem to compare excellently (better than?) with the others. \n\nQuestions and clarifications:\n\n(Minor) There\u2019s a typo in page 2, line 2. x_{aud}^+ should be x_{aud}^-.\n\nClarification on formulation: Making the analogy (is that even the right way of looking at this?) that the \u2018source\u2019 domain is \u2018+\u2019, and the target domain is \u2018-\u2019, in equation (5), the last term of the ternary discriminator has the source domain (x_{aud}^+) in it, while the Taigman et al paper uses the target term. Does this matter? I would think \u2018no\u2019, because we have a large number of terms here and each individual term in and of itself might not be relevant, nor is the current work a direct translation of the Taigman et al work. Nevertheless, I would like clarification, if possible, on the discrepancy and why we use the \u2018+\u2019 samples. \n\nClarification on reconstruction loss: I think the way it is presented, equation (8) is misleading. Apparently, we are sampling from the latent space of style and content embeddings for paired data. The notation seems to be quite consistent with that of the VAE, where we have a reconstruction and a recognition model, and in effect the equation (8) is sampling from the latent space in a stochastic way. However, as far as I can see, the latent space here produces deterministic embeddings, in that c = f(x_{txt}) and s = g(x_{aud}^+), with the distribution itself being a delta function. Also, the notation q used in this equation most definitely indicates a variational distribution, which I would think is misleading (unless I have misinterpreted what the style tokens mean). At any rate, it would help to show how the style token is computed and why it is not deterministic. \n\nClarification on latent reconstruction loss: In equation (9), how is the latent representation \u2018l\u2019 computed? While I can intuitively see that the latent space \u2018l\u2019 (or z, in more common notation) would be the \u2018same\u2019 between real audio samples and the \u2018+\u2019, \u2018-\u2019 fake samples, it seems to me that they would be related to s (as the paper says, \u2018C\u2019 and \u2018Enc_s\u2019 share all conv layers) and the text. But what, in physical terms is it producing? Is it like the shared latent space in the UNIT work, or the invariant representation in Taigman? This could be made clearer with an block diagram for the architecture. \n\n(Major) Clarification on network architecture\nThe work references Tacotron\u2019s GST work (Wang et al 2018) and the related Skerry-Ryan work as the stem architecture with separate networks for style embeddings and for content (text). While the architecture itself might be available in the stem work by Wang et al, I think we need some diagrams for the current work as well for a high level picture. Although it is mentioned in words in section 3.3, I do not get a clear idea of what the encoder/decoder architectures look like. I was also surprised in not seeing attention plots which are ubiquitous in this kind of work. Furthermore, in the notes to the \u2018inference\u2019 network \u2018C\u2019 it is stated that C and Enc_s share all conv layers. Again, a diagram might be helpful - this also applies for the discriminator. \n\nClarification on stability/mode collapse: Could the authors clarify how easily this setup trained in this adversarial setup? \n\nNote on latent representation: To put the above points in perspective, a small note on what this architecture does in regards to the meaning of the latent codes would be useful. The Taigman et al 2016 paper talks about the f-constancy condition (and 'invariance'). Likewise, in the UNIT paper by Ming-Yu Liu - which is basically a set of coupled VAEs + cycle consistency losses, there is the notion of a shared latent space. A little discussion on these aspects would make the paper much more insightful to the domain adaptation practitioner.\n\nReference: This reference - Adversarial feature matching for text generation - (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03850) contains a reconstruction stream (as perhaps many other papers) and might be useful for instruction. \n\nOther relevant works in speech and voice conversion: This work comes to mind, using the StarGAN setup, also containing a survey of relevant approach in voice conversion. Although the current work is for TTS, I think it would be useful to include speech papers carrying out domain adaptation for other tasks.\n\nStarGAN-VC: Non-parallel many-to-many voice conversion with star generative adversarial networks. \nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02169 \n\nI would rate this paper as being acceptable if the authors clarify my concerns, and in particular, about the architecture. It is also hard to hard to assess reproducibility in a complex architecture such as this.

We also mentioned this in our paper (Sec. 1 ln 6-7). However, we want to clarify our claim, by saying \u2018bijective\u2019, we refer to style modeling in TTS (a conditional generation), i.e. given textual string and a reference audio sample, the synthesized audio should one-to-one correspond to the given conditions (content from text and style from reference audio). If it is not a bijective mapping, e.g. one-to-many mapping, then one textual string could map to different styles, which neglects our style condition (reference audio). We have also elaborated on our claim, which can be seen in Sec. 2 (last paragraph).\n\nStyle loss\nWith all due respect, we disagree with the reviewer that prosody cannot be captured in local variations in the time-frequency domain. In fact, certain prosodic characteristics, such as emotion, are captured by local statistics in the time-frequency domain. For example, Cheang and Pell (2008) have shown that a temporary reduction in the average fundamental frequency significantly correlates with sarcasm expression. \nMore broadly, numerous past studies on prosody have been based on spectral characteristics, e.g. Wang (2015),  Soleymani, et al. (2018), Barry (2018).\nThat being said, we do agree with the reviewer that prosodic variation is often suprasegmental. Therefore, our approach to capturing speaking style can only model those prosodic variations that are characterized by local statistics. We have made this point clear in our paper in Section 3.2.\nCheang, Henry S., and Marc D.

To clarify, we were trying to communicate that when training on purely paired data the network can easily to memorize all the information from the paired audio sample, i.e. both style and content components.\nFor example, given (txt1, aud1), the network memorizes that as long as given a txt1, the result should be aud1. In this case, the style embedding tends to be neglected by the decoder, and the style encoder cannot be optimized easily. During test stage, when given (txt1, aud2), the network still produces an audio sample very similar to aud1, and the \u2018style\u2019 is not learned well. Our experiments on style transfer validate this claim. When comparing with GST, our synthesized audio is closer to the reference style.\n\n2. Through empirical experiments we found that randomly sampling is enough for training.\n\n3. Thanks for your suggestion. When we started this work, that idea was our first basic attempt. But it turns out, by simply adding an adversarial loss on the latent space did not produce good results. The most severe problem is it is not robust to various length reference audio samples. When the reference audio is longer than the input, the synthesized samples tend to have long duplicate tails, or sometime noises. It severely impairs the audio quality. \nWe suspect that, to satisfy the correct classification, the style embedding is squeezed into the same scale, which is not robust to varied length sequential signals. The Fader Network was used for processing images which are a fixed dimension, this method does not seem to work well for audio. Therefore, in our current model, we promote the disentanglement by paire-wise training, which means we do not need to add an adversarial loss directly on the latent space, but on the generated samples. Our results show that this leads to more robust outcomes for sequential signals for different lengths. We will clarify this in the paper.\n\n4. Thanks. It is a good suggestion to replace Tacotron2 with Prosody-Tacrotron. We will modify this in our paper.\n\n5. The hyperparameters for our model can be seen in our implementation details and Appendix.\nThe parameters used for other methods are the same with their original work.\n\n6. As in this experiment, we want to evaluate how well our model can learn the latent space. In other words, are the style embeddings produced by our model effectively representing any desired style. By showing the t-SNE visualization, we can see that, the latent space learned by our model can be well separated into clusters according to the testing data distribution. The same experiment was also done in GST (Wang et al).\n\n7. We appreciate that TTS-GAN is quite general.  We are happy to change the name of the paper.

Typo in p2 l2.\nThanks, we fixed it.\n\n2. Clarification on formulation:\nThank you for pointing out the discrepency. We provide detailed explanation below. In short, there is a subtle yet important distinction: We use '+' samples to regularize within-domain mapping (between (c, x_aud^+) and \\tilde{x}^+), while Taigman et al., (2016) use '-' to promote cross-domain mapping (between (c, x_aud^-) and \\tilde{x}^-)).\n\nTaigman's work use a pretrained function f(.) to extract latent embeddings from both the source and the target domains, i.e., z_s = f(s), z_t = f(t). They then use a decoder to map these to the target distribution, producing s2t and t2t. The s2t drives cross-domain mapping, while the t2t regularizes within-domain mapping. They use a single function f(.) to compute the embeddings from both the source (real human face) and the target (emoji human face) because the two domains share certain structures and properties, e.g., a face has two eyes with eyebrows on top. This makes t2t -- within-domain mapping -- relatively easy compared to ours (see below on why); so they include the target term in the loss (Eqn 3 in [Taigman et al., 2016]) to further promote cross-domain mapping.\n\nIn our work, making the analogy, the source domain is '(content, style+)' and the target is '(content, style-)'. Both domains consist of two input modalities (text and sound) with very different characteristics. So we use two functions to represent each domain: Enc_c and Enc_s. Unfortunately, this makes it difficult to even ensure that within-domain mapping is successful. So, to strengthen within-domain mapping we modify the last term of the tenary discriminator to have x_aud^+ instead of the target x_aud^-. \n\n3. Clarification on reconstruction loss:\nYes, both the content c = f(x_txt) and the style s = g(x_aud^+) embeddings are deterministic. The only stochasticity comes from the data distribution. We revised the notation in the paper; please take a look. \n\n4. Clarification on latent reconstruction loss: \nWe have revised our paper with network architecture details, including a block diagram of the Inference Network 'C' that computes the latent representation 'l'; see Figure 3. The inference network is simply the style encoder (Enc_s) with a new classifier on top (one FC layer followed by softmax); all the weights are shared between C and Enc_s except for the new classifier layer.\n\nWe agree that 'z' is a more commonly used notation to represent latent codes. We have changed the notation in the paper; thanks for the suggestion! \n\n5. Clarification on network architecture\nWe have revised our paper with block diagrams of our network architecture as well as parameter settings used in our implementation (Figure 3 to 5). We have also included an attention plot (Figure 6), showing the robustness of our approach to the length of the reference audio.\n\n6. Clarification on stability/mode collapse:\nIn TTS stylization, when mode collapse happens the synthesized voice samples will exhibit the same acoustic style although different reference audio samples are provided. While it is difficult to entirely prevent the mode collapse from ever happening (as is common in GAN training), we have a number of measurements (i.e., different loss terms in our adversarial & collaborative game) to alleviate the issue and to improve stability during training. Our qualitative results show more diverse synthesized samples than Tacotron-GST when different reference audio samples are given, suggesting our work clearly improves upon the state-of-the-art.  Our learning curve (https://researchdemopage.wixsite.com/tts-gan/image) also suggests that training with our loss formulation is relatively stable, i.e., the three loss values seem to converge to a stable regime.\n\n7. Note on latent representation:\nPerhaps the most important message we want to deliver is: We are improving upon content vs. style disentanglement in acoustic signals by means of adversarial & collaborative learning. Extracting ``acoustic styles'' such as prosody has been an extremely difficult task. The state-of-the-art GST achieves this with an attention mechanism. But, as we argue in our paper, their loss construction makes it difficult to ``wipe out'' content information from acoustic signals; this is also shown in their qualitative results where prosody style transfer fails when the length of the reference audio clip is different from what is appropriate for the content to be synthesized. Our novel loss construction enables careful conditioning of our model so that the two latent representations, content 'c' and style 's' embeddings, become more precise than the previous method could obtain. In particular, our paired and unpaired input forumation, and the adversarial & collaborative game makes our model better condition the latent space so that the content information is effectively ignored in style embedding vectors. \n\n8.
