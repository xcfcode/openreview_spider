I feel strongly about the submission being publication-worthy, and I would like to challenge Reviewer 2\u2019s score.\n\nThere is ample room in a research conference for empirical contributions, provided the experimentation is carried out rigorously. To me, the bar for acceptance for this type of paper is 1) whether or not the results can be expected to generalize outside of the reported experimental setting, 2) whether the proposed approach has the potential to have an impact in the research community, and 3) whether the approach and results are communicated clearly to the target audience. In this instance, criteria 1) and 3) are easily met in my opinion: the breadth of model architectures, regularization techniques, and datasets used for evaluation makes me confident that the observed performance improvements are not a happy accident, and the paper writing was straightforward and easy to follow. For criterion 2), I am of the opinion that although the proposed self-modulation mechanism isn\u2019t likely to drastically change the way we train and think of GANs, it is nevertheless a good addition to the set of architectural features that could facilitate GAN training.\n\nI feel that asking for a fundamental explanation of how self-modulation helps improve performance is an unreasonable bar to set for acceptance. Plenty of architectural features like dropout or batch normalization were poorly understood at the time they were first presented, yet in retrospect had a significant impact in the research community. Likewise, asking for the proposed approach to show an improvement for more than \u201conly\u201d 86% of the evaluation settings is unreasonably strict: I don\u2019t find it surprising that there are instances in which self-modulation does not improve performance, and given these odds I would certainly try the approach on a new dataset and architecture combination."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper828/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper828/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper828/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On Self Modulation for Generative Adversarial Networks", "abstract": "Training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is notoriously challenging.

Our response is given below.\n\n- Interpretation of self-modulation model performs worse in the combination of spectral normalization and the SNDC architecture.\n\nOverall, self-modulation appears to yield the most consistent improvement for the deeper ResNet architecture, than the shallower, more poorly performing, SNDC architecture. Self-modulation doesn\u2019t help in the SNDC/Spectral Norm setting on the Bedroom data, where the SNDC architecture appears to perform very poorly compared to ResNet. For the other three datasets, self-modulation helps in this setting though.\n\n- The ablation study shows that the impact is highest when modulation is applied to the last layer (if only one layer is modulated). It seems modulation on layer 4 comes in as a close second. I am curious about why that might be.\n\nFigure 4 in the Appendix contains the equivalent of Figure 2(c) for all datasets. Considering all datasets: (1) Adding self-modulation to all layers performs best. (2) In terms of median performance, adding it to the layer farthest from the input is the most effective. We believe that the apparent significance of layer 4 in Figure 2(c) is statistical noise.\n\n- I would like to see some more interpretation on why this method works.\n\nWe consider self-modulation as an architectural change in the line of changes such as residual connections or gating: simple, yet widely applicable and robust. As a first step, we provide a careful empirical evaluation of its benefits. While we have provided some diagnostics statistics, understanding deeply why this method helps will fuel interesting future research. Similar to residual connections, gating, dropout, and many other recent advances, more fundamental understanding will happen asynchronously and should not gate its adoption and usefulness for the community.\n\n- Did the authors inspect generated samples of the baseline and the proposed method? Is there a notable qualitative difference?\n\nA 10% change in FID is visually noticeable. However, we note that FID rewards both improvements in sample quality (precision) and mode coverage (recall), as discussed in Sec 5 of [1]. While we can easily assess the former by visual inspection, the latter is extremely challenging. Therefore, an improvement in FID may not always be easily visible, but may indicate a better generative model of the data.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00035\n\n- Overall, the idea is simple, the explanation is clear and experimentation is extensive. I would like to see more commentary on why this method might have long-term impact (or not).\n\nWe view this contribution as a simple yet generic architecture modification which leads to performance improvements. Similarly to residual connections, we would like to see it used in GAN generator architectures, and more generally in decoder architectures in the long term.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper828/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper828/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper828/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On Self Modulation for Generative Adversarial Networks", "abstract": "Training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is notoriously challenging.

Our response is given below.\n\n- Relationship to z-conditioning strategy in BigGAN.\n\nThanks for pointing out the connection to this concurrent submission. We will discuss the connections in the related work section. The main differences are as follows:\n1. BigGAN performs conditional generation, whilst we primarily focus on unconditional generation. BigGAN splits the latent vector z and concatenates it with the label embedding, whereas we transform z using a small MLP per layer, which is arguably more powerful. In the conditional case, we apply both additive and multiplicative interaction between the label and z, instead of concatenation as in BigGAN. \n2. Overall BigGAN focusses on scalability to demonstrate that one can train an impressive model for conditional generation. Instead, we focus on a single idea, and show that it can be applied very broadly. We provide a thorough empirical evaluation across critical design decisions in GANs and demonstrate that it is a robust and practically useful contribution.\n\n- Propagation of signal and ResNets.\n\nIndeed, ResNets provide a skip connection which helps signal propagation. Arguably, self-modulation has a similar effect. However, there are critical differences in these mechanisms which may explain the benefits of self-modulation in a resnet architecture:\n1. Self-modulation applies a channel-wise additive and multiplicative operation to each layer. In contrast, residual connections perform only an element-wise addition in the same spatial locality. As a result, channel-wise modulation allows trainable re-weighting of all feature maps, which is not the case for classic residual connections. \n2. The ResNet skip-connection is either an identity function or a learnable 1x1 convolution, both of which are linear. In self-modulation, the connection from z to each layer is a learnable non-linear function (MLP).\n\n- Reading Figure 2b, one could be tempted to draw a correlation between the complexity of the dataset and the gains achieved by self-modulation over the baseline (e.g., Bedroom shows less difference between the two approaches than ImageNet). Do the authors agree with that?\n\nYes, we notice more improvements on the harder, more diverse datasets. These datasets also have more headroom for improvement.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper828/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper828/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper828/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On Self Modulation for Generative Adversarial Networks", "abstract": "Training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is notoriously challenging.

The self-modulation mechanism itself is implemented via FiLM layers applied to all convolutional blocks in the generator and whose scaling and shifting parameters are predicted as a function of the noise vector z. Performance is measured in terms of Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) for models trained with and without self-modulation on a fairly comprehensive range of model architectures (DCGAN-based, ResNet-based), discriminator regularization techniques (gradient penalty, spectral normalization), and datasets (CIFAR10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom, ImageNet). The takeaway is that self-modulation is an architectural feature that helps improve modeling performance by a significant margin in most settings. An ablation study is also performed on the location where self-modulation is applied, showing that it is beneficial across all locations but has more impact towards the later layers of the generator.\n\nI am overall positive about the paper: the proposed idea is simple, but is well-explained and backed by rigorous evaluation. Here are the questions I would like the authors to discuss further:\n\n- The proposed approach is a fairly specific form of self-modulation. In general, I think of self-modulation as a way for the network to interact with itself, which can be a local interaction, like for squeeze-and-excitation blocks. In the case of this paper, the self-interaction allows the noise vector z to interact with various intermediate features across the generation process, which for me appears to be different than allowing intermediate features to interact with themselves. This form of noise injection at various levels of the generator is also close in spirit to what BigGAN employs, except that in the case of BigGAN different parts of the noise vector are used to influence different parts of the generator. Can you clarify how you view the relationship between the approaches mentioned above?\n- It\u2019s interesting to me that the ResNet architecture performs better with self-modulation in all settings, considering that one possible explanation for why self-modulation is helpful is that it allows the \u201cinformation\u201d contained in the noise vector to better propagate to and influence different parts of the generator. ResNets also have this ability to \u201cpropagate\u201d the noise signal more easily, but it appears that having a self-modulation mechanism on top of that is still beneficial. I\u2019m curious to hear the authors\u2019 thoughts in this.\n- Reading Figure 2b, one could be tempted to draw a correlation between the complexity of the dataset and the gains achieved by self-modulation over the baseline (e.g., Bedroom shows less difference between the two approaches than ImageNet).
