Several experimental results are also reported to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.\n\nThe regret bound in Theorem 4.2. is not quite satisfactory.

However, there is an additional factor of $\\sqrt{d}$ in the regret boun in Theorem 4.2, which is not appealing in high dimensional problems.

Actually, we can only obtain an $O(d\\sqrt{T})$ upper bound for the term $\\sum_{i=1}^d\\left\\|g_{1:T,i}\\right\\|_2$ in all Adam-type optimizers, which is just like Eq.(18) in our paper. With such upper bound, choosing step size as $\\alpha/\\sqrt{t}$ can indeed balance the order of $d$ among different terms in Eq.(9) (the order of $d$ of the first term and the second term in Eq.(9) are both $O(d)$). However, it also makes the regret admit no advantages over the online gradient descent, even for other Adam-type optimizers. Thus, if we choose the step size as $O(\\alpha\\sqrt{d/t})$, we can guarantee the same regret $O(\\sqrt{dT})$ with SGD under the condition $\\sum_{i=1}^d\\left\\|g_{1:T,i}\\right\\|_2\\le O(\\sqrt{T})$. In our opinion, providing the convex regret bound is to qualitatively show that Acutum is convergent. As for the analysis of the convergence rate, we may utilize standard frameworks, say[1] or [2]. As you know, new ideas are required to derive tighter arguments. From a practical perspective, we believe our experiments can clearly show the convergence rate and the potential of Acutum. Besides, we didn't mention that improving the regret bound as our contribution. It's worth to mention that our main contribution is to propose a new insight to explain all the other Adam-type methods, and then demonstrate the improvement by following the novel understanding.\n\nFor your second question, we will add the absolute value sign there in our next revision.

Such improvements can answer your concerns straightforwardly.\u00a0\n\nActually, \"let the search direction opposite to the gradient at the current batch of examples and a bit orthogonal to the previous batch of examples\" is our observation inspired by the sub-problem of Adagrad. Based on such an observation, the intuition of our Acutum is to find a descent direction that can both make an acute angle with both the current batch-gradient and the approximate descent direction of previous batch loss. In practice, choosing the direction as the angle bisector of $g_t$ and $\\hat{m}_t$ on the hyper-plane they form can make the experimental results satisfied.\n\nQ: The regret bound in Theorem 4.2. is not quite satisfactory...\nA: Actually, we find the additional factor of $\\sqrt{d}$ in the regret bound in Theorem 4.2 comes from our setting of step size \u2014 $\\alpha_t = \\alpha\\sqrt{d/t}$. The additional factor of $\\sqrt{d}$ can be removed as long as we set $\\alpha_t = \\alpha/\\sqrt{t}$. We have updated our regret proof in the latest version of our paper and appendix where you can find more details.\n\nQ: I can not follow the last identity of (10)...\nA: For the missing $\\epsilon$ in Eq.(10), we previously thought of it as a small amount that maintains numerical stability (preventing the denominator from being 0). Therefore we ignored the $\\epsilon$ in our analysis. We have taken $\\epsilon$ into account in the latest version of our paper, and we can get the same regret bound with a trivial calculation.\n\nQ: In both eq (14) and (15) ...\nA: Eq.(14) and Eq.(15) are different parts of Eq.(11), we divide the summation into two parts for a more clear statement. We have fixed the typos about $\\sqrt{\\sum_{t=1}^t1/\\sqrt{t}}$ in our latest version.\n\nLastly, please allow us to emphasize the importance of this article. We are the first to explain the effect of second moments through constructing approximate subproblems and point that \"second moments essentially penalize the projection of the current descent direction on the exponential moving average of previous gradients\", which is totally different from most of the previous works. We believe such consideration could be instructive to the design of future optimizers. Furthermore, our Acutum only utilizes ONLY the first moments to achieve a comparable efficiency with Adam-type optimizers and even a better generalization, which illustrates that our intuition is effective from a practice perspective. Theoretically, our Acutum enjoys a regret of $\\tilde{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ which is the same as the best of known bound for general convex online learning problems (Adam, AMSGrad, etc).\n\nWe hope you find your concerns satisfactorily addressed by our response, which has also been reflected in the revised paper.

We address your concerns as follows.\n\nQ: Motivation for removing the second moment...\nA: The motivation for removing the second moment is both to decrease the wall-clock time and to improve the generalization. For the wall-clock time, Acutum finds a better descent direction inspired by the sub-problem of Adagrad. For the generalization, we have the following observation --- The generalization of adaptive methods (with second moments) cannot be as good as SGD with ONLY first moments.\n\nQ: Comparing against Yogi...\nA: We have added extra evaluations of Yogi and Radam in our new version. Theoretically, we have proved that Acutum enjoys a regret of $\\tilde{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ which is the same as the best known bound for convex online learning problems. One of our contributions is to illustrate that a prototype optimizer Acutum is comparable to existing Adam-type optimizers.\n\nQ: The paper is confusing...\nA: The update procedure and alg. are shown in Eq 8 and Alg 1 clearly. We have compared with Acutum, Adagrad, and RMSProp in Section 3. Hence, Acutum is a totally new method, *NOT* a minor increments/variants by removing the second moments.\n\nQ: convergence speed...\nA: We have replaced the \"convergence speed\" with \"wall-clock time\".\n\nQ: The update rule of Adagrad is incorrect...\nA: From Thm 5 of Adagrad, we can obtain that if Adagrad requires an $\\tilde{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ regret convergence in convex settings, it still needs a step size with order $O(1/\\sqrt{t})$. Adagrad accepts a constant step size both in the alg. description and in the practice, though.\n\nQ: No guarantee in Eq 5...\nA: Here, we only utilize Young's inequality to investigate the properties of the optimal solution of the Adagrad sub-problem by constructing an upper bound objective, but not analysis the theory in this part. Furthermore, based on such properties, we introduce the intuition of our Acutum.\n\nQ: Update decreases the loss on the current batch,...\nA: We agree that it is possible to construct a counter-example to prevent us to find a direction that can descent all the batch loss. To prevent the previous batch loss from increasing, the sub-problem of Adagrad introduces a regularization $\\sum\\|(\\theta- \\theta_t)^Tg_\\tau\\|^2$ rather than some strict constraints. It somehow acts like the soft margin SVM.\n\nQ: Computing the gradient for all i is expensive...\nA: Here we want to illustrate that there is a gap between the physical intuition (penalize the projection of current descent direction on previous gradients) and the formulation of Adagrad. What they really want to calculate $\\nabla f_{A_i}(\\theta_t)$ is the expensive and be approximated by $\\nabla f_{A_i}(\\theta_i)$.\u00a0\n\nQ: For variance reduced methods...\nA: We consider the optimization in the online learning setting rather than the stochastic optimization settings. Thus, we neither approximate the full gradient nor have any operation related to variance reduction. As you may know, it is a common setting for the theoretical analysis of Adam-type optimizers (Adam, Adagrad, Amsgrad).\n\nQ: Eq 8 is not clear...\nA: In Section 3, we normalized $\\hat{m}_t$ to make the current descent direction $\\hat{m}_{t+1}$ and current batch gradient $g_t$ an acute angle. One can easily see that it makes $\\hat{m}_{t+1}$ and $\\hat{m}_t$ an acute angle. You can consider\u00a0$\\hat{m}_{t+1}$ as the angle bisector of $g_t$ and $\\hat{m}_t$ on the hyper-plane they form. We strongly believe it is a novel observation and one may improve by following our insight.\n\nQ: Choose the sequence of step-sizes...\nA: As you know, adaptivity means the process of updating parameters also depends on the history and current situation. We utilized the norm of $\\hat{m}_t$ to adaptively adjust the update direction. In practice, we set $\\alpha_t$ as some constant, and $\\beta_t=1$ as shown in the paragraph after the alg. In theory, to guarantee the regret $\\tilde{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$, we set $\\alpha_t=O(1/\\sqrt{t})$ and $\\beta_t=\\beta \\lambda^{t-1}$ where $\\beta, \\lambda \\in (0,1)$, which has been shown in Thm 4.2.\n\nQ: Compare the regret bound to others\nA: To guarantee the regret $\\tilde{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$, most of Adam-type optimizers require an $O(1/\\sqrt{t})$ step size, e.g., Thm 5 of Adagrad, Thm 4.1 of Adam and Thm 4 of AMSGrad. In practice, when we set a proper constant step size, Adagrad, Adam, and AMSGrad can also work. This phenomenon also appears in Acutum.\n\nQ: decay the lr by 0.1...\nA: In the CV community, lr decay is a common trick of getting a better result. To achieve the SOTA testing accuracy, we did such work for all optimizers. Such settings also appear in related work, e.g., Padam.\n\nWe have revised our paper accordingly. Almost all existing adaptive methods require second moments. In a novel point of view, we achieved similar results with ONLY first moments. We also proved our conclusion both theoretically and experimentally in our paper. \nAny further comments on the paper are more than welcome."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1639/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1639/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Acutum: When Generalization Meets Adaptability", "authors": ["Xunpeng Huang", "Zhengyang Liu", "Zhe Wang", "Yue Yu", "Lei Li"], "authorids": ["huangxunpeng@bytedance.com", "liuzhengyang.lozycs@bytedance.com", "wang.10982@osu.edu", "yuyue.elaine@bytedance.com", "lilei.02@bytedance.com"], "keywords": ["optimization", "momentum", "adaptive gradient methods"], "abstract": "In spite of the slow convergence, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is still the most practical optimization method due to its outstanding generalization ability and simplicity.

Besides, SGD momentum also requires the hyper-parameters tuning about $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ which are denoted as the step size and coefficients of momentum, respectively. In general cases, when we consider $\\hat{m}_t$ as the angle bisector of $g_t$ and $\\hat{m}_t$ on the hyperplane they form, we can set $\\beta_{1,t} = 1$ in Acutum. That is to say, the only hyper-parameter we need to adjust is $\\alpha$ \u2014 the step size. Therefore, we think Acutum requires fewer hyper-parameters.\n\nQ: In Theorem 4.2, how to set the parameter...\nA: Actually, we introduce the $\\epsilon$ only for preventing the denominator from being 0. In the latest version of Theorem 4.2, we have illustrated that for any positive $\\epsilon$, we can maintain the convex regret bound. From a practice perspective, we hope the $\\epsilon$ as small as possible because a large $\\epsilon$ will make the angle among $\\hat{m}_t$, $\\hat{m}_{t-1}$ and $g_t$\u00a0unstable.\n\nQ: The authors should provide more comparison of the theoretical results of different SGD algorithms...\nA: Thank you for your suggestion, Acutum enjoys a regret of $\\tilde{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ which is the same as the best of known bound for general convex online learning problems (e.g., Adam, AMSGrad and Adagrad).\u2028\n\nQ: The conditions of the formulation of Eq.

Does it improve the generalization or decrease the runtime substantially?\n- Please clarify how our method compares against Yogi (Adaptive Methods for Nonconvex Optimization, Zaheer' 2018) and the more recent RADAM (ON THE VARIANCE OF THE ADAPTIVE LEARNING\nRATE AND BEYOND, Liu 2019) , both theoretically and empirically. \n- The paper is meandering and confusing. State your update/algorithm and then explain how it compares against the other methods. Besides, there might be technical problems with it. \n\nSee the detailed review below:\n- Section 1: \"the generalization results (of adaptive methods) cannot be as good as SGD\". Please cite the relevant papers, (for example, Wilson. 2017)  that show this empirically. \n-  Section 1: \"the proposed algorithm outperforms Adam in convergence speed\" - Please clarify what \"convergence speed\" refers to. Is it the number of gradient evaluations, the rate of convergence or the wall-clock time. Please state how did you conclude this. \n- Section 2: The update rule of Adagrad is incorrect. The step-size is constant \\alpha and it is decreased over time because of the v_t term. \n- Section 3: There is no guarantee on the approximation in Equation 5. Young's inequality and the resulting upper bound can be quite loose. \n- Section 3: In general, it is not possible to have an update that decreases the loss on the current batch, but does not increase the previous batches loss. It is always possible to construct a counter-example to this. \n- \"In practice, the computational cost of computing\" the gradient for all i is expensive. Indeed, this is batch gradient descent. I am not sure how this is relevant to the discussion in the paper. \n- Cite and compare against the variance reduced methods (Stochastic Average Gradient, Schmidt, 2013; SVRG, Johnson, 2013) as these try to \"approximate\" the full gradient in order to decrease the variance. \n- The derivation/formulation of Equation 8 is not clear to me. Why is the \\hat{m} normalized? \n- In algorithm 1, it seems you need to choose the sequence of step-sizes \\alpha_t and \\beta_t. How is this an adaptive method then? How are these sequences chosen theoretically and practically? Please clarify this. \n- Section 4: Please compare the resulting regret bound to that of Adam, Adagrad and AMSgrad. Why does \\alpha_t = O(1/t)? If we have to decrease the step-size according to a sequence, why should I not use standard SGD?\n- Section 5: \"we decay the learning rate by 0.1 every 50 epochs\" This is not aligned with either the theory or the algorithm you proposed. \n "}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1639/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1639/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Acutum: When Generalization Meets Adaptability", "authors": ["Xunpeng Huang", "Zhengyang Liu", "Zhe Wang", "Yue Yu", "Lei Li"], "authorids": ["huangxunpeng@bytedance.com", "liuzhengyang.lozycs@bytedance.com", "wang.10982@osu.edu", "yuyue.elaine@bytedance.com", "lilei.02@bytedance.com"], "keywords": ["optimization", "momentum", "adaptive gradient methods"], "abstract": "In spite of the slow convergence, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is still the most practical optimization method due to its outstanding generalization ability and simplicity.
