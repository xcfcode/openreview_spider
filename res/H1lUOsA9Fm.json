Our aim is to set a standard for future work on generative models for sequences as we have shown how to measure directly, and to the best of our knowledge this is the first time a generative sequence model is able to generate sequences conditionally with very high fidelity.\n\nStating that the models reproduce a sequence of samples is subjective - we have shown that the validation loss does not increase for SynthNet so it is not simply memorizing the training data. In other words, SynthNet can generalize to other sequences (melodies) and timbres as we have shown for 7 different timbres and 3 different melodies.\n\nThe challenge lies in generating a melody accurately and we have shown that SynthNet can do that very well. The baselines (conditioned WaveNet, DeepVoice) can reproduce timbre, however the generated melody (conditioning signal) is inaccurate even though the timbre is similar.\n\nPerhaps a better way to highlight the main contribution of our work is to make a parallel with other generative models: the baselines are like vanilla GANs - they can generate data from the same distribution, but without much control over what the content is / what gets generated. In contrast, SynthNet is like VAEs where there is an explicit control over what is generated. In summary, the conditioned baslelines can generate sequence data without accurate control of the content (i.e. new melody compositions), while SynthNet can do both.\n\u2028We also wonder why the referred work focuses on generating novel compositions when it claims to briefly show that they can learn synthesisers from MusicNet. Why not perfect that work instead? If it would have been easy to learn synthesisers - why not focus in that direction instead of something subjective / unmeasurable?\n\nFinally, the usefulness of the advertised dataset is debatable for learning synthesisers since the quality of the recordings vary and the recording conditions are inconsistent."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper357/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper357/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper357/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Synthnet: Learning synthesizers end-to-end", "abstract": "Learning synthesizers and generating music in the raw audio domain is a challenging task.

While the idea of end-to-end training of musical synthesizers is interesting and timely, this formulation of the problem limits the benefits that such a system could provide. Specifically, it would be useful for learning expressive performance from real recordings of very expressive instruments. For example, in the provided training data, the trumpet syntheses used to train this wavenet sound quite unconvincing and unexpressive. \nUsing real trumpet performances could potentially learn a mapping from notes to expressive performance, including the details of transitions between notes, articulation, dynamics, breath control, etc. MIDI syntheses have none of these, and so cannot train an expressive model. While the experiments show that the proposed system can achieve high fidelity synthesis, it seems to be on a very limited sub-set of musical material. The model doesn't have to learn monophonic lines, but that seems to be what it is applied on. It is not clear why that is better than training on individual notes, as Engel et al (2017) do. \"\n\nTraining end to end via aligned waveforms and midi brings forward the possibility of learning more expressive variations as opposed to training on individually labelled notes and our work takes the state of the art closer towards increased expressiveness.\nThere are indeed expressive variations such as legato which describe smooth transitions between notes - a dataset of individually labelled notes does not contain such variations. \n\nThus far, we are not aware of any method that can capture the expressiveness level described by the reviewer. With the current work we move a step closer towards increased expressivity by achieving similar synthesiser results as Engel et al (2017) but without using individually labelled notes and using much less data while training faster.\n\nRecording a dataset of individually labelled notes for a real instrument is very laborious, and it limits the expressiveness level. Conversely, our method offers the possibility of creating more expressive synthesisers since the recording process is easier (i.e. record while an artist is playing several musical pieces using the target instrument).\n\nRegarding the trumpet samples, indeed, they do sound artificial, and that is because the training data is based on virtual instruments, which are artificial. However, it does sound like the virtual trumpet instrument so the harmonic component is learned, just like all the other 6 timbres. More importantly, the melody is accurate and this is a more difficult challenge given the minimal training data. \nFurthermore, the hyperparameter setup is identical over all instruments / timbres. With more tuning, the expressiveness can be improved further, for all timbres."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper357/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper357/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper357/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Synthnet: Learning synthesizers end-to-end", "abstract": "Learning synthesizers and generating music in the raw audio domain is a challenging task.

We believe that it is important to validate the work on simpler datasets, in controlled conditions, before proceeding to further expressiveness (i.e. using real annotated music).\nIn their work, Van Den Oord et al. (2016) revolutionized text to speech. However, while the speech waveforms sound identical, they are very different to the actual ground truth speech. SynthNet produces waveforms that are very similar to the ground truth (Fig. 4 and Appendix 1) as demonstrated for 7 virtual instruments. Our method overcomes both challenges of capturing the instrument timbre while accurately reproducing the content \u2013 the latter being more challenging. The near-exact generated waveforms implies that high fidelity series can be very accurately generated.

As it stands, all the model has to do is reproduce a fixed (and fairly small) set of audio samples. This is arguably a much simpler task, which could also explain why reducing the model size (SynthNet's depthwise convolutions have many fewer parameters than the regular convolutions used in WaveNet and DeepVoice) works so well here.\"\n\nWe would respectfully like to argue that learning high fidelity synthesisers is not a simple task. We demonstrate that SynthNet can accurately generate up to 5 seconds of audio from 3 melodies, over 7 timbres. There is no reproduction, the 3 generated melodies are not part of the training set. More critically, the length of the generated audio is not crucial in demonstrating melody accuracy, but the number of notes in the melody (e.g. one could play 3 notes very slowly or very fast - resulting in varying audio lengths).\n\nSynthNet can generate accurately over longer time spans, however we limited the generated audio length to 5 seconds for the MOS listening tests to make it easy for the human evaluators to directly compare the melody against the ground truth. Each subject listens to the ground truth, then a random permutation of the baselines and SynthNet. We also compare generated audio directly based on the raw waveforms which are very similar - unlike previous work in speech. Direct measurements have not been provided before for audio.\n\u2028A thorough evaluation using real instrument recordings implies that the recordings would be made under similar conditions (recording equipment, mastering, acoustics, etc) and the alignment would not contain many errors, if any. Such a dataset is not easy to find, so we resorted to generating our own data. \n\nOf course, a model that can learn synthesisers despite differing recording conditions would be desirable, this however would intuitively require much more data and quality alignment (good labels).

Indeed, there are minute differences. The CQTs are quite similar and very accurate, especially when compared to the baselines, as it can also be seen in Appendix 1. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that such accurate signals are generated and measured directly vs the ground truth.\n\n\n\"- I don't think it is fair to directly compare this setup to Engel et al. (2017) and Mor et al. (2018) as is done in the last paragraph of Section 2, as these are simply different tasks (mapping from audio to audio as opposed to generating audio).\"\n\nThe architectural components in Engel et al. (2017) and Mor et al. (2018) are almost identical to the original work of Van Den Oord et al. (2016) with the difference that a separate simpler residual network is used for the encoder.  In our work, we learn an auxiliary task based on the midi data instead of a separate encoder network and this is how the tasks are different.\n\n\n\"- At the start of Section 3.1 it would be good to explicitly mention whether 8-bit mu-law audio is used, to explain why the waveform is 256-valued.\"\n\n\u2028Thank you for your comment.\n\n\n\"- Why is the conditioning causal? It does not need to be, as the piano roll is fully available in advance of the audio generation. I guess one argument in favour would be to enable real-time generation, but it would still be good to compare causal and non-causal conditioning.\"\n\n\u2028Thank you for your comment. Indeed, it is necessary to restrict to a causal model if we are to synthesise in real time (i.e. use it to generate sound from a midi keyboard). It would be interesting to consider non-causal models but it is somewhat orthogonal to the main aim of our work.\n\n\n\"- Since the piano roll representation is binary, does that mean MIDI velocity is not captured in the conditioning signal? It would probably be useful for the model to provide this information, so it can capture the differences in timbre between different velocities.\"\n\n\u2028Thank you for your comment. Indeed, we do not use velocity information and doing so can improve expressiveness.\n\n\n\"- The use of a MIDI prediction loss to regularise the conditioning part of the model is interesting, but I would have liked to see a comparison experiment (with/without).\"\n\nThank you for your comment. Again, we were limited by the page limit. The additional task helps with learning a joint representation.\n\n\n\" - In Section 4.3, specify the unit, i.e. \"Delta < 1 second\". \"\n\n\u2028Thank you for your comment.\n\n\n\" - For the task of recreating synthetic audio samples, the WaveNet models seem to be quite large. As far as I can tell the size hyperparameters were chosen based on the literature, but the inherited parameters were originally optimised for different tasks. \"\n\nThank you for your comment. The tasks in Engel et al. (2017) and Mor et al. (2018) are similar as mentioned before. Learning the timbre (harmonic series) is correlated with model size. \n\n\n\"- In Section 4.3 under \"global conditioning\", the benchmark is said to be between DeepVoice L26 and SynthNet L24, but Table 4 lists DeepVoice L26 and SynthNet L26, which version was actually used?\"\n\nThank you for your comment.

I would argue that these are not comparable abstractions though, words themselves are composed of a sequence of phonemes, which are probably a better point of comparison (and phonemes, while they don't tend to overlap, can affect neighbouring phonemes in various ways). That said, I appreciate that this is probably quite subjective.\"\n\nThank you for your comment. Phonemes are indeed less complex than the harmonics of any instrument, even synthetic (see overtone series). While phonemes do not overlap, notes do.\n\n\n\"- Overall, the formulation of paragraph 2 of the introduction is a bit unusual, I think the same things are said in a much better way in Section 3.\"\n\nThank you for your comment.\n\n\n\" - \"Conditioning Deep Generative Raw Audio Models for Structured Automatic Music\" by Manzelli et al. (2018) also proposes a MIDI-conditional neural audio generation model, trained on real instrument recordings from the MusicNet dataset. I think this is a very relevant reference.\"\n\nThe authors use subsets (solo performances) of the MusicNet and YouTube dataset to fine tune and generate novel music with a better learned compositional (melodic) structure via LSTMs. In a nutshell, a WaveNet is locally conditioned on LSTM outputs (the latter trained on MIDI data). The WaveNet and LSTMs are trained separately.\n\nWhen it comes to the ability of the WaveNet in the mentioned article to learn synthesisers, the evaluation method in the article is debatable (no MOS tests / measurements are provided) and the ambiguity arises from the objective itself: generating new compositions. \n\nEven with a direct measurement of error (which is not provided), it is not possible to know whether the errors (versus a ground truth) in the generated melodies arise from the WaveNet (undesirable) or whether they are novel compositions / variations based on the LSTM (desirable).\n\nThe authors mention in a paragraph that they were able to generate the C scale (a simple sequence of 16 MIDI notes, 8 of which are unique) and a short part of Happy Birthday (a sequence of 12 MIDI notes, 7 of which are unique) using a locally conditioned WaveNet trained on the solo cello subset of the MusicNet dataset. The quality of the generated samples is poor and by far not comparable with the melodic and harmonic fidelity of SynthNet. Not all notes from the C scale are present, there are broad volume / velocity variations (generation errors). The quality and accuracy is not measured using MOS tests and no direct comparisons are provided either.\nHaving said that, the two samples are comparable to what the baselines in our work can produce on more complex melodies. By induction, this essentially validates the SynthNet architecture (which is proven better than the baselines) for real instrument recordings.\nIn our work, we provide a thorough evaluation of the baselines and SynthNet with far more complex melodies and over 7 timbres.\n\nFurthermore, it is interesting why the next section in the article is focused on novel compositions (subjective) instead of focusing on accurate generation (measureable, via MOS tests and as we show \u2013 via direct comparisons).\n\nMoreover, the usability of MusicNet for learning music synthesisers is debatable. This stems from the varying quality of the audio, the recording conditions / environment and the alignment quality. MusicNet doesn\u2019t contain that many solo recordings (e.g. 15 hours of solo piano, 30 minutes of solo violin and 49 minutes of solo cello). All the latter are not of the same quality / consistency.\n\u2028The varying recording conditions in MusicNet might be desirable for classification, timbre recognition or other tasks, however this is not desirable for learning synthesisers where a dataset containing consistent recordings is a more sensible choice.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper357/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper357/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper357/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Synthnet: Learning synthesizers end-to-end", "abstract": "Learning synthesizers and generating music in the raw audio domain is a challenging task.

My guess is it's a standard pianoroll with 0s for inactive notes and 1s for active notes, where onsets and offsets contain linear fades, but this could be explained more clearly.\"\n\nThank you for your comment. Your understanding is correct. No linear interpolation is needed, rather we forward fill the binary midi data to obtain our temporal grid version at the appropriate sampling rate. During the piano roll data construction, we simply treat the midi note on/offs as points in continuous time and look up whether the note is on at the given grid point, where the grid may be arbitrarily fine grained.

If correcting this is just a matter of shifting the conditioning signal, it seems like an unfair comparison.\"\n\nThank you for your comment. This is not just a matter of shifting the conditional signal. It is possibly due to initialization (zeros, the same across all models) and more importantly due to the autoregressive process at generation time which causes the generated series to diverge abruptly once a major mistake is made. This results in other types of errors / audio artefacts, not only delay but also playing the wrong pitch, sustained pitches or just skipping pitches altogether. Furthermore, the generation process is inherently stochastic so even though the generated signals are very close to the ground truth, they will be different every time even though the same tune is played (the differences can be observed at a \u2018microscopic\u2019 level) but the big picture, overall shape of the waveforms are visibly very close.\nSynthNet learns a mapping from pitch to fundamental frequency in the first layer, unlike the baselines where all dilated layers are conditioned as in Van Den Oord et al. (2016). We also use an auxiliary learning task on the midi component. These two changes result in fewer errors at generation time.\n\n\n\"S1P2 points (2) and (3) arguing why music is more challenging than speech are questionable.  The timbre of a real musical instrument may be more complex than speech, but is this true for SoundFonts where the same samples are used for multiple notes?  It's not clear what the word \"semantically\" even means with regard to music.\"\n\nThank you for your comment. Yes, it is true, and this is also because multiple notes can overlap. Semantically can be understood as the melodic component or the content / song if a parallel is made between music and language.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper357/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper357/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper357/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Synthnet: Learning synthesizers end-to-end", "abstract": "Learning synthesizers and generating music in the raw audio domain is a challenging task.

However, the fact that the model is able to nearly-exactly reproduce CQT is contrary to intuition; given only note on/off times, for most instruments there would be many perceptually-distinct performances of those notes.  This suggests that the task is too heavily restricted.\n\nIt isn't clearly stated until Section 4 that the goal of the work is to model SoundFont-rendered music.  (The title \"SynthNet\" is suggestive but any music generated by such an audio model could be considered \"synthesized\".)  Using a SoundFont instead of \"real\" musical recordings greatly diminishes the usefulness of this work; adding and concatenating outputs from the single-note model of Engel et al. removes any real need to model polyphony, and there's no compelling argument that the proposed architecture changes should help in other domains.\n\nOne change that could potentially increase the paper's impact is to train and evaluate the model on MusicNet (https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~thickstn/musicnet.html), which contains 10+ minutes of recorded audio and aligned note labels for each of ~5 single instruments (as well as many ensembles).  This would provide evidence that the proposed architecture changes improve performance on a more realistic class of polyphonic music.\n\nAnother improvement would be to perform an ablation study over the many architecture changes.  This idea is mentioned in 4.2 but seemingly dismissed due to the impracticality of performing listening studies, which motivates the use of RMSE-CQT.  However, no ablation study is actually performed, so it's not obvious what readers of the paper should learn from the new architecture even restricted to the domain of SoundFont-rendered music generation.\n\n\nMinor points / nitpicks:\n\nOne of the claimed contributions is dithering before quantization to 8-bits.  How does this compare to using mixtures of logistics as in Salimans et al. 2017?\n\nS2P3 claims SynthNet does not use note velocity information; this is stated as an advantage but seems to make the task easier while reducing applicability to \"real\" music.\n\nS4P1 and S4.1P4 state MIDI is upsampled using linear interpolation.  What exactly does this mean?  Also, the representation is pianoroll if I understand correctly, so what does it mean to say that each frame is a 128-valued vector with \"note on-off times\"?  My guess is it's a standard pianoroll with 0s for inactive notes and 1s for active notes, where onsets and offsets contain linear fades, but this could be explained more clearly.\n\nWhat is the explanation of the delay in the DeepVoice samples?  If correcting this is just a matter of shifting the conditioning signal, it seems like an unfair comparison.\n\nS1P2 points (2) and (3) arguing why music is more challenging than speech are questionable.  The timbre of a real musical instrument may be more complex than speech, but is this true for SoundFonts where the same samples are used for multiple notes?  It's not clear what the word \"semantically\" even means with regard to music.\n\nThe definition of timbre in S3.2P2 is incomplete.  Timbre is not just a spectral envelope, but also includes e.g. temporal dynamics like ADSR.\n\nSpelling/grammar:\nS1P3L4 laborius -> laborious\nS1P3L5 bypassses -> bypasses\nS3.2P2L-1 due -> due to\nS4.4P2L1 twice as better than -> twice as good as\nS4.4P2L3 basline -> baseline\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper357/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Synthnet: Learning synthesizers end-to-end", "abstract": "Learning synthesizers and generating music in the raw audio domain is a challenging task.

The system is trained on MIDI syntheses rendered by a traditional synthesizer.\n\nWhile the idea of end-to-end training of musical synthesizers is interesting and timely, this formulation of the problem limits the benefits that such a system could provide.  Specifically, it would be useful for learning expressive performance from real recordings of very expressive instruments.  For example, in the provided training data, the trumpet syntheses used to train this wavenet sound quite unconvincing and unexpressive.  Using real trumpet performances could potentially learn a mapping from notes to expressive performance, including the details of transitions between notes, articulation, dynamics, breath control, etc.  MIDI syntheses have none of these, and so cannot train an expressive model.\n\nWhile the experiments show that the proposed system can achieve high fidelity synthesis, it seems to be on a very limited sub-set of musical material.  The model doesn't have to learn monophonic lines, but that seems to be what it is applied on.  It is not clear why that is better than training on individual notes, as Engel et al (2017) do.  In addition, it is trained on only 9 minutes of audio, but takes 6 days to do so.  This slow processing is somewhat concerning.  In addition, the 9 minutes of audio seems to be the same pieces played by each instrument, so really it is much less than 9 minutes of musical material.  This may have implications for generalization to new musical situations and contexts.\n\nOverall, this is an interesting idea, and potentially an interesting system, but the experiments do not demonstrate its strengths to the extent that they could.\n\n\nMinor comments:\n\n* The related work section repeats a good amount of information from the introduction.

The model generates raw waveforms conditioned on a piano roll representation of aligned MIDI input.\n\nMy biggest gripe with this work is that the model is trained entirely on a synthetic dataset generated from a sample-based synthesizer using a sound font. I feel that this defeats the purpose, as it will never work better than just sampling the original sound library. One potential argument in favour would be to save storage space, but the sound font used for the work is only ~140 MB, which is not prohibitive these days (indeed, many neural models require a comparable amount of storage).\n\nIt would be much more interesting to train the model on real instrument recordings, because then it could capture all the nuances of the instruments that sample-based synthesizers cannot replicate. As it stands, all the model has to do is reproduce a fixed (and fairly small) set of audio samples. This is arguably a much simpler task, which could also explain why reducing the model size (SynthNet's depthwise convolutions have many fewer parameters than the regular convolutions used in WaveNet and DeepVoice) works so well here.\n\nThat said, I think the proposed architectural modifications for raw audio models could be interesting and should be tested for other, more challenging tasks. The proposed RMSE-CQT error measure is potentially quite valuable for music generation research, and its correlation with MOS scores is promising (but this should also be tested on more realistic audio).\n\nThe fact that the models were trained to convergence on only 9 minutes of data per instrument is also impressive, despite the limitations of the dataset. The use of dithering to reduce perceptual noise is also interesting and some comparison experiments there would have been interesting, especially to corroborate the claim that it is critical for the learning process.\n\nI think the paper slightly overstates its contributions in terms of providing insight into the representations that are learned in generative convolutional models. The Gram matrix projections showing that the activations of different layers diverge for different input types as we advance through the model is not particularly surprising, and similar plots could probably be made for almost any residual model.\n\nOverall, I feel the work has some fundamental flaws, mostly stemming from the dataset that was used.\n\n\n\nMiscellany:\n\n- In the abstract: \"is substantially better in quality\", compared to what?\n\n- In the introduction, it is mentioned that words in a speech signal cannot overlap, but notes in a musical signal can. I would argue that these are not comparable abstractions though, words themselves are composed of a sequence of phonemes, which are probably a better point of comparison (and phonemes, while they don't tend to overlap, can affect neighbouring phonemes in various ways). That said, I appreciate that this is probably quite subjective.\n\n- Overall, the formulation of paragraph 2 of the introduction is a bit unusual, I think the same things are said in a much better way in Section 3.\n\n- \"Conditioning Deep Generative Raw Audio Models for Structured Automatic Music\" by Manzelli et al. (2018) also proposes a MIDI-conditional neural audio generation model, trained on real instrument recordings from the MusicNet dataset. I think this is a very relevant reference.\n\n- In the contributions of the paper, it is stated that \"the generated audio is practically identical to ground truth as can be seen in Figure 4\" but the CQTs in this figure are visibly different.\n\n- I don't think it is fair to directly compare this setup to Engel et al. (2017) and Mor et al. (2018) as is done in the last paragraph of Section 2, as these are simply different tasks (mapping from audio to audio as opposed to generating audio).\n\n- At the start of Section 3.1 it would be good to explicitly mention whether 8-bit mu-law audio is used, to explain why the waveform is 256-valued.\n\n- Why is the conditioning causal? It does not need to be, as the piano roll is fully available in advance of the audio generation. I guess one argument in favour would be to enable real-time generation, but it would still be good to compare causal and non-causal conditioning.\n\n- Since the piano roll representation is binary, does that mean MIDI velocity is not captured in the conditioning signal? It would probably be useful for the model to provide this information, so it can capture the differences in timbre between different velocities.\n\n- The use of a MIDI prediction loss to regularise the conditioning part of the model is interesting, but I would have liked to see a comparison experiment (with/without).\n\n- In Section 4.3, specify the unit, i.e. \"Delta < 1 second\".\n\n- For the task of recreating synthetic audio samples, the WaveNet models seem to be quite large. As far as I can tell the size hyperparameters were chosen based on the literature, but the inherited parameters were originally optimised for different tasks.\n\n- In Section 4.3 under \"global conditioning\", the benchmark is said to be between DeepVoice L26 and SynthNet L24, but Table 4 lists DeepVoice L26 and SynthNet L26, which version was actually used?", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper357/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Synthnet: Learning synthesizers end-to-end", "abstract": "Learning synthesizers and generating music in the raw audio domain is a challenging task.

We validate our work using 7 distinct harmonic styles and also provide visualizations and links to all generated audio.", "keywords": ["audio", "synthesizers", "music", "convolutional neural networks", "generative models", "autoregressive models"], "authorids": ["florinsch@student.unimelb.edu.au", "christian.walder@data61.csiro.au", "sarah.erfani@unimelb.edu.au", "baileyj@unimelb.edu.au"], "authors": ["Florin Schimbinschi", "Christian Walder", "Sarah Erfani", "James Bailey"], "TL;DR": "A convolutional autoregressive generative model that generates high fidelity audio, behchmarked on music", "pdf": "/pdf/b1807c2afdc4c7fefda7d69088b9fb18f9e23295.pdf", "paperhash": "schimbinschi|synthnet_learning_synthesizers_endtoend", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nschimbinschi2019synthnet,\ntitle={Synthnet: Learning synthesizers end-to-end},\nauthor={Florin Schimbinschi and Christian Walder and Sarah Erfani and James Bailey},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1lUOsA9Fm},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper357/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234479587, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "H1lUOsA9Fm", "replyto": "H1lUOsA9Fm", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper357/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335706289, "tmdate": 1552335706289, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper357/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 26}
