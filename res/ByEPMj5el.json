It is not clear whether the framework can actually be useful outside the synthetic setup described. Moreover, I worry it encourages unhealthy directions for the field.

Creativity is defined as a model's ability to generate new types of objects unseen during training. The authors argue that likelihood training and evaluation are by construction ill-suited for out-of-class generation and propose a new evaluation framework which relies on the use of held-out classes of objects to measure a model's ability to generate new and interesting object types.\n\nI am not very familiar with the literature on computational creativity research, so I can't judge on how well this work has been put into the context of existing work. From a machine learning perspective, I find the ideas presented in this paper new, interesting and thought-provoking.\n\nAs I understand, the hypothesis is that the ability of a model to generate new and interesting types we *do not* know about correlates with its ability to generate new and interesting types we *do* know about, and the latter is a good proxy for the former. The extent to which this is true depends on the bias introduced by model selection. Just like when measuring generalization performance, one should be careful not to reuse the same held-out classes for model selection and for evaluation.\n\nNevertheless, I appreciate the effort that has been made to formalize the notion of computational creativity within the machine learning framework. I view it as an important first step in that direction, and I think it deserves its place at ICLR, especially given that the paper is well-written and approachable for machine learning researchers.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Out-of-class novelty generation: an experimental foundation", "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning have brought the field closer to computational creativity research.

One should not confuse the objective of this work: \n\nSelecting a good generative model for novelty generation is an open question. Current work on deep generative modeling learns a set of objects (e.g. digits or bedrooms) and generate the same _kinds_ of objects (e.g. digits or bedrooms). \nClearly, when a generative model is used in this way, it is unlikely to generate novelty. Thus, the scientific question here is what setup would enable us to measure the novelty generation capacity of a deep generative model, where novelty is defined as above - generating objects from categories unknown to the machine. \nThis idea is the basis of the setup introduced in the paper: much as we, as humans, know Roman letters, the generative models we train do not. \nAlbeit this fact, some of the 1000 or so models we trained are able to generate objects that a separate letter-discriminator model classifies as letters. This, we believe, is a good proxy for testing the capacity of a generative model to generate unknown categories of objects, much in the same way, held-out data points enabling testing the generalization capacity of a predictive model.\nFurthermore, we would like to highlight the following point: if our objective was to generate art or genuine novelty, we would have used some data sets other than roman letters or digits. \n\nThat's precisely what we _don't_ want to do, since in more complex systems and datasets, it is unclear whether the computer generates art (or novelty) or whether the object generated based on a possibly infinite combinatorics is _perceived_ as such by the humans. \n\nIn such complicated systems, the frontier of what the system creator has put in and what the machine adds is often blurred. To be able to start investigating what the machine can come up with without any value objective imposed by its creator, starting with a simple and controlled setup is only a best practice in science.\n\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Out-of-class novelty generation: an experimental foundation", "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning have brought the field closer to computational creativity research.

What if the model generates Arabic or Indian letters? Can a human who has never seen Arabic handwriting tell it from random doodle? What makes English letters more \"novel\" than random doodle?

This, we believe, is a pre-requisite for using such models in novelty generation tasks.\n\nWe believe this to be a fundamental issue for the usability of machine learning (generative) models in computational creativity - since current metrics in ML for evaluating generative models, such as the likelihood, are not adequate for measuring novelty generation capacity. This issue is discussed lengthily in the paper. \n\nOther criteria, and possibly new experimental settings, need to be developed to test the capacity of a model to generate a broad set of useful objects, outside the scope of what it has seen. \n\nThe current paper makes a step in this direction by adapting the held-out validation set notion to a notion of \u201cout-of-class generation\u201d: we were able to demonstrate that the suggested criteria is able to select _models_ that can generate a wide variety of objects, some of which can \u201cfool\u201d a state-of-the-art classifier trained on letters (a class of objects that the generating models have never seen). \n\nSecond,  this doesn\u2019t preclude the existence of several tasks and domains where machine learning can be useful for artificial creativity tasks. In fact, this is the whole premise of the constructive machine learning approach (https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/Schedule?showEvent=6231): \n\u201cConstructive machine learning describes a class of related machine learning problems where the ultimate goal of learning is not to find a good model of the data but instead to find one or more particular instances of the domain which are likely to exhibit desired properties.\u201d \n\nSeveral such tasks and domains exist. Quoting (http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psztg/cml/): \n\n\u201cInteresting applications are in the domains of chemistry (e.g. de novo drug design), biology (e.g. gene design, metabolic path design, RNA polymer design), computer science (e.g. automatic software generation, resource network allocation), art (e.g. music or poetry composition), gaming (e.g. character or level construction), education (e.g. personalized curricula design), services (e.g. personalized travel itinerary or insurance policy composition), layout design (e.g. urban planning, furniture arrangement, advertisement composition), alimentary (e.g. generation of novel food recipes or cocktails).\u201d\nArguably, these domains and the associated tasks exist for some time - independently of the constructive machine learning approach. But, typically these are the kinds of concrete problems where novelty generation can be put to use (which is an ongoing research program for many).\n\nThird,  novelty generation, beyond any notion of task, is a topic of interest for art, and more generally, for understanding human cognition. It is a legitimate research question to investigate how  machine learning (which is the flagship of AI research) can help. \n\n\nFurther points:\n\n\u201cThe definition of novelty is relative.\u201d\nWe fully acknowledge this fact, in this and previous work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to draw the line between novel and random garbage.\u201d \nDrawing such a line is one of the explicit objectives of our research program. Creativity is not random and measures such as likelihood do not capture its essence. Thus, we believe, developing and testing measures such as the five measures considered in our paper is an important step.\n\n\u201cPractical definition of novelty should be task dependent.\u201d\nWe respectfully disagree. We fully acknowledge that adopting domain-dependent definitions or including domain knowledge in an artificial system have more often than not significant \u201cpractical\u201d utility. However, this fact should not hinder our ability or will to come up with more general and theoretical principles. Otherwise, establishing more general principles, and eventually a more theoretical understanding of (artificial) creativity will be harder. \n\n\u201cIs there a tractable and useful task where novelty is required to achieve the objective?\u201d\nYes. See e.g. the above list of tasks from the last NIPS-CML workshop. Also, see the general research on novelty search (e.g https://goo.gl/fKzL1B, https://goo.gl/yj7Rdb). Note that, the usual novelty search literature is based on (mostly, evolutionary) optimisation models - where knowledge is missing. Since we believe knowledge (and its structure) to be an important part of the generative process, we prefer studying it with machine learning models. A deeper issue here is the following: is there anything beyond combinatorial optimisation (e.g. such as genetic algorithms) that applied mathematics can offer for supporting & modeling creativity. We believe the hierarchical knowledge models to offer an interesting alternative to be studied in this respect.\n\n\u201cHave you tested on any such objectives and measure the end performance?\u201d\nNo. As explained above, the current paper proposes metrics for choosing better generative models for any such creativity task that will be solved later. Although not reported here, we are fully exploring this avenue.\n\nOn the notion of \u201ctask\u201d.\nConsider the following. a) Reducing the temperature of an engine during runtime. b) An artist playing guitar. The first is a clear-cut \u201ctask\u201d with a trivial metric. What would be the metric for the second case? Obviously, such creative and/or open-ended activities elude metrics at this stage.  \nNot only a rigorous effort is needed for developing & testing metrics (as our paper attempts) for a scientific study of the notion, but also we need _new&adapted engineering principles_. \nThe fundamental engineering principle in machine learning (which allowed so far fruitful exploration and systematic study) is the train-test validation setup. Our work suggest a similar setup where the held-out objects are entire classes (instead of data points).\nThis is normal since, we do want to simulate the unknown (by held-out classes) instead of future (data points)."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Out-of-class novelty generation: an experimental foundation", "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning have brought the field closer to computational creativity research.

Through extensive experiments on various types of generative models, we are able to find architectures and hyperparameter combinations which lead to out-of-distribution novelty.\n", "pdf": "/pdf/caeae8b5f18946c9886063a7aad979ad7df862ba.pdf", "paperhash": "cherti|outofclass_novelty_generation_an_experimental_foundation", "conflicts": ["lri.fr"], "keywords": ["Deep learning", "Unsupervised Learning"], "authors": ["Mehdi Cherti", "Bal\u00e1zs K\u00e9gl", "Ak\u0131n Kazak\u00e7\u0131"], "authorids": ["mehdicherti@gmail.com", "balazskegl@gmail.com", "akin.kazakci@mines-paristech.fr"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "duedate": 1480741199000, "tmdate": 1481487887330, "id": "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper536/pre-review/question", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper536/reviewers"], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper536/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper536/AnonReviewer2", "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper536/AnonReviewer3"], "reply": {"forum": "ByEPMj5el", "replyto": "ByEPMj5el", "writers": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper536/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper536/AnonReviewer[0-9]+", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "description": "Brief summary of your question.", "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "question": {"order": 2, "description": "Your question", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}}}, "nonreaders": [], "expdate": 1488517199000, "cdate": 1481487887330}}}], "count": 16}
