Comparisons to the state of the art are appropriate, as is the related work description. the authors perform a sensible error analysis and ablation study. They further show that their suggested model outperforms existing models on three datasets.\nCons: The introduction and abstract over-sell the contribution of the paper. They make it sound like the authors introduce a new task and dataset for evidence scoring, but instead, they merely train on SQuAD with existing annotations. References in the method section could be added to compare how the proposed model relates to existing QA models. The multi-task \"requirement\" is implemented as merely a sharing of QA datasets' vocabularies, where much more involved MTL methods exist. What the authors refer to as \"semi-supervised learning\" is in fact transfer learning, unless I misunderstood something.\n\nClarity:\nApart from the slightly confusing introduction (see above), the paper is written clearly.\n\nOriginality:\nPros: The suggested model outperforms others on three QA datasets.\nCons: The way achievements are achieved is largely by using more data, making the comparison somewhat unfair. None of the suggested models are novel in themselves. The evidence scoring model is a rather straight-forward improvement that others could have come up with as well, but merely haven't tested for this particular task.\n\nSignificance:\nOther researchers within the QA community might cite this paper and build on the results.

Given the significant results, I would vote for its acceptance.\n\nThe contributions of the paper can be summarized into two parts. The first is an efficient base open-domain QA model; and the second includes several denoising methods of passage selection. I hope the authors could address the following issues during rebuttal, which I believe will make the paper stronger.\n\n(1) The proposed base open-domain QA method (+DISTANT) itself improves a lot, which I think is the major contribution of the paper. It will be very helpful if the authors could provide ablation test to the sentence discriminator/reader modules to give better clues about why it works so well. Is it mainly because of the usage of DrQA style encoder?\n\n(2) Although the paper has \"denoising\" emphasized in the title, I actually do not see this holds as a contribution. First, the proposed semantic labeler training strategies only improve significantly on TriviaQA. The improvement on Quasar-T and SearchQA is relatively marginal. I am wondering whether this is because the domain shift between SQuAD and QuasarT and SearchQA.\n\n(3) (Cont'd from point 2) Second, the proposed SSL and CSL are not compared with any decent baselines. It will make more sense if the authors apply the Re-Ranker or S-Norm to the proposed base open-domain QA model, and compare the improvement from different methods (Re-Ranker, S-Norm, SSL, CSL). It is likely that the S-Norm could also improve on TriviaQA and the Re-Ranker could improve over Quasar-T and SearchQA. Therefore without any experimental evidence, again, the \"denoising\" part cannot be regarded as a contribution with positive results.\n\nAdditional question: would the authors release the code for public usage if the paper gets accepted?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper348/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Denoise while Aggregating: Collaborative Learning in Open-Domain Question Answering", "abstract": "The open-domain question answering (OpenQA) task aims to extract answers that match specific questions from a distantly supervised corpus.

First, the authors proposed an aggregation-based openQA model with sentence discriminator and sentence reader. Second, they use a semantic labeler to handle distant supervision problem by utilizing other span supervision tasks, and propose two different denoising methods. They run experiments on 3 open-domain QA datasets and achieve SOTA.\n\n\nStrengths\n\n1) Their semantic labeler and exploration of two different denoising methods are interesting and meaningful.\n2) They conducted experiments on 3 widely-used open-domain datasets, and the performance gain is impressive.\n\n\nWeakness\n\nAlthough there is an impressive performance gain, the contribution of the paper seems to be marginal.\n1) First of all, it is hard to say there is a contribution to the idea of sentence discriminator and sentence reader \u2014 people have used this framework for large-scale QA a lot. Also, the architecture of the models in this paper are almost identical to Chen et al (ACL 2017) and Lin et al (ACL 2018).\n2) Thus, the contribution is more on semantic labeler and denoising method. However, this contribution is marginal as well since its role is almost the same as sentence discriminator plus pretraining methods which have widely used already.\n\n\nQuestions\n\n1) What exactly is the difference between semantic labeler and sentence discriminator? For me, it seems like both of them label each sentence `yes` or `no`. My thought is sentence discriminator is only trained on the target dataset (distant supervision dataset) while semantic labeler is also trained (either jointly or separately) trained on the source dataset (span supervision dataset). (If my thought is wrong, please let me know, I would like to update my score.)\n2) Chen et al (ACL 2017) have shown that pretraining QA model on span supervision dataset (SQuAD) is effective to train the model on distant supervision dataset. Similarly, Min et al (ACL 2018) have pretrained both QA model and sentence selector on SQuAD. While I think pretraining sentence selector on SQuAD is almost identical to sentence labeler with SSL method, could you give exact comparison of these different methods? For example, remove sentence labeler, and pretrain both sentence discriminator and reader on SQuAD, or jointly train them on SQuAD & target dataset.\n\n\nMarginal comments\n\n1) At the beginning of Section 2.4.1, it says the semantic labeler is able to transfer knowledge from the span supervised data \u2014 however, the authors should be careful since people usually refers to `knowledge` as an external knowledge. This method is more like better learning of accurate sentence selection, not transferring knowledge.\n2) Please mention the TriviaQA data you used is Wikipedia domain, since there are two different domains (Wikipedia and Web).\n3) In References section, the conference venues in many papers are omitted.\n\n\nOverall comments\n\nThe paper explored several different methods to deal with distant supervision via sentence labeling, and I really appreciate their efforts. While the result is impressive, the idea in the paper is similar to the methods that have widely used already.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper348/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Denoise while Aggregating: Collaborative Learning in Open-Domain Question Answering", "abstract": "The open-domain question answering (OpenQA) task aims to extract answers that match specific questions from a distantly supervised corpus.

We evaluate our model on several real-world OpenQA datasets, and experimental results show that our collaborative learning methods outperform the existing baselines significantly.", "keywords": ["natural language processing", "open-domain question answering", "semi-supervised learning"], "authorids": ["jihaozhe@gmail.com", "mrlyk423@gmail.com", "liuzy@tsinghua.edu.cn", "sms@tsinghua.edu.cn"], "authors": ["Haozhe Ji", "Yankai Lin", "Zhiyuan Liu", "Maosong Sun"], "TL;DR": "We propose denoising strategies to leverage information from supervised RC datasets to handle the noise issue in the open-domain QA task.", "pdf": "/pdf/331a04b9b54096dd4c9904025a9a3ba2a01c8a18.pdf", "paperhash": "ji|denoise_while_aggregating_collaborative_learning_in_opendomain_question_answering", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nji2019denoise,\ntitle={Denoise while Aggregating: Collaborative Learning in Open-Domain Question Answering},\nauthor={Haozhe Ji and Yankai Lin and Zhiyuan Liu and Maosong Sun},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVVOi0cFX},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper348/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234481694, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "BkVVOi0cFX", "replyto": "BkVVOi0cFX", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper348/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335704245, "tmdate": 1552335704245, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper348/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 5}
