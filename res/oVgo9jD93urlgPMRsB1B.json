Signal processing techniques such as beamforming are widely used to extract a speech signal of interest from background noise. These techniques, however, are highly dependent on prior spatial information about the microphones and the environment in which the system is being used. In this work, we present a neural attention network that directly combines multichannel audio to generate phonetic states without requiring any prior knowledge of the microphone layout or any explicit signal preprocessing for speech enhancement. We embed an attention mechanism within a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based acoustic model to automatically tune its attention to a more reliable input source. Unlike traditional multi-channel preprocessing, our system can be optimized towards the desired output in one step. Although attention-based models have recently achieved impressive results on sequence-to-sequence learning, no attention mechanisms have previously been applied to learn potentially asynchronous and non-stationary multiple inputs. We evaluate our neural attention model on the CHiME-3 challenge task, and show that the model achieves comparable performance to beamforming using a purely data-driven method.", "pdf": "/pdf/oVgo9jD93urlgPMRsB1B.pdf", "paperhash": "kim|recurrent_models_for_auditory_attention_in_multimicrophone_distance_speech_recognition", "conflicts": ["cmu.edu"], "authors": ["Suyoun Kim", "Ian Lane"], "authorids": ["suyoun@cmu.edu", "lane@cmu.edu"]}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "tmdate": null, "cdate": 1454464564200, "ddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "duedate": 1455833700000, "tcdate": 1454464564200, "id": "ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/-/submission", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"pdf": null, "forum": null, "replyto": null, "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*", "description": "Your displayed identity associated with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"pdf": {"order": 4, "description": "Either upload a PDF file or provide a direct link to your PDF on ArXiv.", "value-regex": "upload|http://arxiv.org/pdf/.+"}, "title": {"order": 3, "description": "Title of paper.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "abstract": {"order": 4, "description": "Abstract of paper.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}, "authors": {"order": 1, "description": "Comma separated list of author names, as they appear in the paper.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "author_emails": {"order": 2, "description": "Comma separated list of author email addresses, in the same order as above.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "conflicts": {"order": 100, "description": "Semi-colon separated list of email domains of people who would have a conflict of interest in reviewing this paper, (e.g., cs.umass.edu;google.com, etc.).", "value-regex": "^([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))+(;[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))*$"}, "CMT_id": {"order": 5, "value-regex": ".*", "description": "If the paper is a resubmission from the ICLR 2016 Conference Track, enter its CMT ID; otherwise, leave blank."}}}, "invitees": [], "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "expdate": 1463609700000}}}], "count": 1}
