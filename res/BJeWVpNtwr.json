While it is useful to measure the storage cost for weights. The choices of bit width will likely affect the computing cost in a non-trivial way, depending on the target hardware platform. It is unclear whether equal model size would mean equal inference latency in practice (most likely they would not be).

However, our insights and good results from the model size standpoint set a strong motivation for future study to target a specific application scenario and research on hardware acceleration. We argue that this does not constitute a weakness for our paper since there are scenarios where model sizes is important. From the perspective of information theory and Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle [1,2], our results show that by trading weight precision values with the number of channels, one can achieve a smaller description length for the model with equal accuracy, which is more preferable based on the MDL principle. Moreover, considering edge devices that are deployed for streaming inference scenarios (single image per batch), our analyses in the updated manuscript (Appendix F and Figure 6) show lower memory footprint is needed for the proposed model to achieve equally accurate results compared to the baseline. We argue that for streaming inference applications that run on IoT devices, model size is an important factor due to their limited RAM. \n\nBeyond the above argument for the efficacy of DualPrecision, we would like to re-iterate that our contributions are more than the proposed DualPrecision method. Specifically, the following three contributions are non-trivial, novel, and can be built upon for future study:\n-\tWe are the first to show that lower precision weight values outperform higher precision weight values in a Pareto sense (accuracy vs. model size) for networks with standard convolutions. This is intriguing since it implies that scaling up (in terms of model size) along the channel count dimension is more effective for accuracy than the precision value dimension. This finding can lead to follow-up works trying to understand or exploit this phenomenon.\n\n-\tWe are the first to show that the fan-in channel counts per output filter for a convolution layer determine the effectiveness of accuracy improvement along the weight precision dimension and provide both theoretical and empirical reasoning for this. This finding is useful for future works that are interested in optimizing the neural architecture regarding both channel counts and weight precision as we show what might affect the effectiveness of weight precision scaling.\n\n-\tWe are the first to show that with a simple scaling rule, one can achieve a more accurate model (given the same model size) even compared to mixed-precision prior art that uses DRL to search for layer-wise weight precision values. Moreover, the results are validated on the large-scale dataset, i.e., ImageNet. This is a manifestation of our two previous findings.\n\nWe hope the reviewer can take into account the above-listed contributions and their potential impacts when making the final recommendation.\n\nRegarding the questions, we use floating-point for batch norm. The accumulation of results is done in 32 bits (We simulate the quantization process in PyTorch according to Figure C.4 in [3]).\n\n[1] Blier, L\u00e9onard, and Yann Ollivier. \"The description length of deep learning models.\" NeurIPS 2018.\n[2] Havasi, Marton, Robert Peharz, and Jos\u00e9 Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato. \"Minimal Random Code Learning: Getting Bits Back from Compressed Model Parameters.\" ICLR 2019.\n[3] Benoit Jacob, Skirmantas  Kligys,  Bo  Chen,  Menglong  Zhu,  Matthew  Tang,  Andrew  Howard,Hartwig Adam, and Dmitry Kalenichenko.
