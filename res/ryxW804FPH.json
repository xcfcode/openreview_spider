We clarify some points below, and we will add further discussion to the paper.\nIssue: This proposed model is lack of novelty\n\nOur intention with our method is to have a ready to use, simple, and effective model. While other methods have been suggested to incorporate LSTMs with Transformer-based LMs, they are primarily focused on the pre-training step and have not been applied to long document classification.  This area of long document classification is a practical problem, yet has received relatively little attention by the research community when compared to other NLP tasks. \n\nIssue: the reason of integration those vectors is not explained and no experiment prove the effectiveness of this setting\n\nThe reason of integration for our ATT-LM method is to iteratively expand upon the other combination strategies. We have updated Figure 2 to reflect this more accurately. We have also run additional experiments with the ablated model to provide justification for the vector integration of ATT-LM. The ablated model performs relatively well, but not better than ATT-BERT.\n\n\nIssue: evaluated on two less studied datasets \n\nOther datasets were purposefully ignored for our setting as they do not illuminate the issues present with Transformer-based LMs, as the input typically does not need to be truncated when used with larger LMs [1].  The idea of co-opting traditional datasets for long document classification has been suggested, E.G. separating the examples in a traditional dataset into many shorter segments much smaller than the maximum input size [2]. But it is not clear how this can be done without hampering the power of a Transformer-based LM. We hope that in future work our chosen datasets will be studied more actively, and that new long document datasets will be created.\n\n\nQ: Why do our models only include h2~hm but exclude h1?\n\nIn our initial development, we found that including h1, instead of h2, produced worse results. We believe this is from the forward direction of h1 not providing any contextual information. Comparatively, the backwards direction of h2 provides enough context that when concatenated with z1 achieve the best performance.\n\nQ: \"As the segment is fixed in each model, why not include all the z1~zm but only include z1?\"\n\nEven though our specific implementation uses a fixed segment size, we designed our model to be more general during training and inference. Despite being able to include z1~zm for the CAT-LM models on our datasets, the size of W (the linear classifier's parameters) scales directly with m. If there were a sufficiently long document, the number of parameters could be unreasonably large. More importantly, by directly using the representation for each z, the linear classifier overfits as demonstrated by our results. Lastly, we include z1 as that text sequence contains the most discriminative features and by including it there is a direct path for gradient updates to the LM.\n\n[1] Radford, Alec, et al. \"Language models are unsupervised multitask learners.\" OpenAI Blog 1.8 (2019).\n[2] https://openreview.net/forum?id=SklnVAEFDB"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1128/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1128/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["olsomatt@oregonstate.edu", "lisa.zhang@nokia-bell-labs.com", "cnyu@cs.cornell.edu"], "title": "ADAPTING PRETRAINED LANGUAGE MODELS FOR LONG DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION", "authors": ["Matthew Lyle Olson", "Lisa Zhang", "Chun-Nam Yu"], "pdf": "/pdf/8d9bc39c3bd1f7daaa26b461701474f8c76ff62b.pdf", "TL;DR": "We acheive state of the art results on long document classication by combining pretrained language models representations with attention.", "abstract": "Pretrained language models (LMs) have shown excellent results in achieving human like performance on many language tasks.
