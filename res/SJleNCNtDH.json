We have also explored N=3 agents in this setting. Please see the global comment for more details.\n\n\u201cFrom the description of the random policy, it is stated that a random policy over skills serves as a sanity check to ensure that the skills do not trivialize the task. This seems to suggest that the extrinsic reward only baseline did not use these skills and was disadvantaged. Some clarification is required here - did the extrinsic reward only baseline use the same skills as the proposed method? If it did, it would obviate the need to have a random policy sanity check.\u201d\n- The \u201cextrinsic reward only\u201d baseline does indeed use the same skills as our proposed method. We agree that this obviates the need to have a random policy as a \u201cbaseline\u201d; but it is still useful in providing a general sense of how hard the task is.\n\n\u201cThe paper suggests a baseline for separate arm surprise. In a similar vein, why wasn\u2019t a joint-arm surprise baseline employed, which can basically treat both arms as a single agent?\u201d\n- Joint-arm surprise in combination with extrinsic reward can be found as the fourth baseline (non-synergistic surprise), introduced in Section 4.3. If the reviewer is instead asking about joint-arm surprise without extrinsic reward, then we hope that the ablation curves in Figure 4 (top row) help address this question. There, we can see that across varying amounts of pre-training the joint-arm surprise baseline without extrinsic reward, the performance of the policy at the start (i.e., x=0) is always low, thereby indicating that using only joint-arm surprise does not lead to solving the task.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1063/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1063/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ronuchit@mit.edu", "shubhtuls@fb.com", "saurabhg@illinois.edu", "abhinavg@cs.cmu.edu"], "title": "Intrinsic Motivation for Encouraging Synergistic Behavior", "authors": ["Rohan Chitnis", "Shubham Tulsiani", "Saurabh Gupta", "Abhinav Gupta"], "pdf": "/pdf/1c76c8b597ee076527d77a8b9befd563bdeb5733.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a formulation of intrinsic motivation that is suitable as an exploration bias in synergistic multi-agent tasks, by encouraging agents to affect the world in ways that would not be achieved if they were acting individually.", "abstract": "We study the role of intrinsic motivation as an exploration bias for reinforcement learning in sparse-reward synergistic tasks, which are tasks where multiple agents must work together to achieve a goal they could not individually.

We are glad that you found the paper interesting and easy to read. We are happy to report that we have conducted experiments on a new domain (Ant Push) and also show results in this domain for N=3 agents. In this global post and in individual replies below, we respond in detail to all the reviewers\u2019 comments/questions.\n\nAll reviewers mentioned that it would be interesting to consider extending the work beyond two-agent robotic manipulation. To address this, we developed a new domain, Ant Push, loosely inspired by an experiment in \u201cMulti-Agent Manipulation via Locomotion using Hierarchical Sim2Real.\u201d[1] The results for the two-agent version of this domain can be found in the Experiments section of the updated PDF (Figure 3, rightmost graph), and additional details are in Appendix C. We find that our proposed bias toward synergistic behavior is a useful form of intrinsic motivation for guiding exploration in this environment as well.\n\nWe also experiment with a three-agent version of this Ant Push domain, and find that our approach continues to perform well (Appendix E in updated PDF). Note that our approach extends in the natural way; the only major change is the computation of the composed prediction. It remains to be studied what the upper limit of this N is before performance starts to deteriorate.\n\nIn response to R3: \u201cIt is good to extend to the problem of multiple-agents (>2), while the order of agents who acts is important to compute \u2018the expected outcome with individual agents acting sequentially\u2019 (for now, you only assume that the A will act first then the B acts later).\u201d \n- When conducting these N=3 experiments, we also tried instead computing the composition by taking the average over all 6 possible orderings of the three forward models. We did not find much difference in the results for our experiments. Nevertheless, we agree that finding the right ordering can be very important as N increases. We leave further investigation of this question to future work.\n\nThe N=3 results can be found in Appendix E of the updated PDF.\n\n[1] Nachum, Ofir, et al. \"Multi-agent manipulation via locomotion using hierarchical sim2real.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1908.05224 (2019)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1063/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1063/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ronuchit@mit.edu", "shubhtuls@fb.com", "saurabhg@illinois.edu", "abhinavg@cs.cmu.edu"], "title": "Intrinsic Motivation for Encouraging Synergistic Behavior", "authors": ["Rohan Chitnis", "Shubham Tulsiani", "Saurabh Gupta", "Abhinav Gupta"], "pdf": "/pdf/1c76c8b597ee076527d77a8b9befd563bdeb5733.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a formulation of intrinsic motivation that is suitable as an exploration bias in synergistic multi-agent tasks, by encouraging agents to affect the world in ways that would not be achieved if they were acting individually.", "abstract": "We study the role of intrinsic motivation as an exploration bias for reinforcement learning in sparse-reward synergistic tasks, which are tasks where multiple agents must work together to achieve a goal they could not individually.

The paper focuses on a two-agent environment where an approximate forward dynamics model is learnt for each agent, and can be composed sequentially to predict the next environment state given each agent\u2019s action. However, this prediction will be inaccurate if the agent\u2019s affected the environment state in such a way that individual dynamics model cannot predict i.e. synergistic behavior was produced. This prediction error is used as extrinsic reward by the proposed approach, while also having a variant where the true next state is replaced by another approximation of a joint forward model which allows for differentiability of actions with respect to the intrinsic reward. Empirical analysis shows that this intrinsic reward promotes synergetic behavior on two-agent robotic manipulation tasks and achieves better performance that baselines and ablations.\n\nI vote for weak accept as the paper proposes a novel intrinsic reward for promoting synergetic behavior in multi-agent systems, while also demonstrating that such an intrinsic reward can be differentiable if a joint forward dynamics model is approximated in addition to individual forward dynamics models given each agent\u2019s actions. The paper does not show experiments beyond 2 agents and the four robotic manipulation tasks have been shown to work when provided with generic skills as an action space, which requires hand-defining or learning by demonstration.\n\nFrom the description of the random policy, it is stated that a random policy over skills serves as a sanity check to ensure that the skills do not trivialize the task. This seems to suggest that the extrinsic reward only baseline did not use these skills and was disadvantaged. Some clarification is required here - did the extrinsic reward only baseline use the same skills as the proposed method? If it did, it would obviate the need to have a random policy sanity check. \n\nThe paper suggests a baseline for separate arm surprise. In a similar vein, why wasn\u2019t a joint-arm surprise baseline employed, which can basically treat both arms as a single agent?\n\nSynergistic behavior seems hard to achieve for a large number of agents, but the paper does not give insights into whether such an algorithm will work for more than 2 agents. Typically multi-agent systems in prior work have worked with a large number of agents in environments other than robotic manipulation - such experiments may help in strengthening the proposed method.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1063/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1063/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ronuchit@mit.edu", "shubhtuls@fb.com", "saurabhg@illinois.edu", "abhinavg@cs.cmu.edu"], "title": "Intrinsic Motivation for Encouraging Synergistic Behavior", "authors": ["Rohan Chitnis", "Shubham Tulsiani", "Saurabh Gupta", "Abhinav Gupta"], "pdf": "/pdf/1c76c8b597ee076527d77a8b9befd563bdeb5733.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a formulation of intrinsic motivation that is suitable as an exploration bias in synergistic multi-agent tasks, by encouraging agents to affect the world in ways that would not be achieved if they were acting individually.", "abstract": "We study the role of intrinsic motivation as an exploration bias for reinforcement learning in sparse-reward synergistic tasks, which are tasks where multiple agents must work together to achieve a goal they could not individually. Our key idea is that a good guiding principle for intrinsic motivation in synergistic tasks is to take actions which affect the world in ways that would not be achieved if the agents were acting on their own. Thus, we propose to incentivize agents to take (joint) actions whose effects cannot be predicted via a composition of the predicted effect for each individual agent. We study two instantiations of this idea, one based on the true states encountered, and another based on a dynamics model trained concurrently with the policy. While the former is simpler, the latter has the benefit of being analytically differentiable with respect to the action taken. We validate our approach in robotic bimanual manipulation and multi-agent locomotion tasks with sparse rewards; we find that our approach yields more efficient learning than both 1) training with only the sparse reward and 2) using the typical surprise-based formulation of intrinsic motivation, which does not bias toward synergistic behavior.
