Some practitioners are likely to find this paper useful as an addition to the growing understanding of what works and what doesn't.  On the other hand, the paper is lacking in comparisons and is unclear at times, and some of the results seem questionable.\n\nQuality:\nIt is probably technically correct but I have some reservations -- see below.\n\nClarity:\nCould be much clearer.  For example:\n- What is really meant by end-to-end?\n- The input acoustic features are not totally clear.  Is 20ms the size of the analysis window, the frame skip, or both?  By \"spectrogram\" do you really mean \"spectrum\"?  If \"spectrogram\", then more info is needed on the spectrogram parameters.\n- Fully define batch normalization.  What is the function B(.)?\n\nSignificance:\nSome practitioners are likely to find this paper useful as an addition to the growing understanding of what works and what doesn't.  However, since there is little analysis, this limits the usefulness since it is not clear why certain techniques worked better for the authors than for others in prior work, and vice versa.\n\nPros:\n- It is useful to see how a variety of common techniques are affected by variables such as data set size and noisy vs. clean test data, on a larger scale than is typical in ASR papers.\n- The speed section provides a useful data point as more groups try to scale up their systems.\n\nCons:\n- There are multiple result tables on different data sets that are not comparable to each other.  It would be much more helpful to keep the data sets the same across tables, and to include more of the standard benchmarks, in particular the commonly used Switchboard.\n- The paper needs a clearer presentation of what exactly is novel vs. not (sequence normalization?  SortaGrad?), and which conclusions are similar to vs. different from what's been found before (and, when different, why).\n- The human WERs are surprisingly high; e.g. prior work has reported human WERs of around 1% for WSJ (see Lippmann, Speech Communication 1997).  How many total turkers were used?  How was their quality ensured?  How was the label error measured?\n- The paper describes what worked and what didn't, but the usefulness of the results is limited without a bit more analysis as to why.  For example, the authors report that they did not have success with delaying the output as done in prior work, and it is not clear why.\n- Citations are missing at times.  For example Sec. 3.3 should cite prior work on 2D convolution for speech (e.g. Abdel-hamid et al. Interspeech 2013, Toth ICASSP 2014).\n", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"CMT_id": "", "title": "End to end speech recognition in English and Mandarin", "abstract": "We show that an end-to-end deep learning approach can be used to recognize either English or Mandarin Chinese speech\u2013two vastly different languages.

Sak's Interspeech 2015 paper also does data augmentation and should be cited\n* Many vague points in the paper:\n   a) Notion of end-to-end is unclear? Why is your method end-to-end if you are still using a separate acoustic and language model? To me this paper is just CTC predicting characters\n   b) Given intuition as to why sequence-wise norm is better than regular batch norm\n   c) The tables in the paper cannot be compared because they are all on different train/test sets, making things really confusing. Why are the numbers in Table 1    and 2 on different training sets\n   d) Why was it difficult to introduce a delay in emitting the label your system (like Sak 2015)\n   e) Your Human performance is based on two workers transcribing, this seems extremely biased", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"CMT_id": "", "title": "End to end speech recognition in English and Mandarin", "abstract": "We show that an end-to-end deep learning approach can be used to recognize either English or Mandarin Chinese speech\u2013two vastly different languages.
