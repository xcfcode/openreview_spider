They also find that while dropout increases overall sparsity, it makes a few tokens homogenous. The paper does not give a crisp answer to why such sparsity patterns are observed. \n\nThe paper falls a bit  short both empirically and technically. While their technique is interesting, they do not compare it to the baseline of using convolutions over characters. More empirical evidence is needed for the technique to be adopted by the community.  On the theory side, they should dig deeper into the reasons for sparsity and how it might help to train better models. \n\nIf the papers shows that the approach can work well in machine translation or language modeling of morphologically rich languages, it might encourage practitioners to use the technique.

The starting point of their argument is to include position-specific embeddings of characters rather than just position-independent characters. By adding together position-specific vectors, reasonable results are obtained.\n\nThis is an interesting result, but I have a few recommendations to improve the paper.\n1) It is a bit hard to assess since it is not evaluated on a standard datasets. There are a number standard datasets for open vocabulary language modeling. E.g., the MWC corpus (http://k-kawakami.com/research/mwc), or even the Penn Treebank (although it is conventionally modeled in closed vocabulary form).\n2) There are many existing models for composing characters into words. In addition to those cited in the paper, see the citations listed below. Comparison with those is crucial in a paper like this.\n3) Since the predictions are done at the word type level, it is unclear how vocabulary set of the corpus is determined, and what is done with OOV word types at test time (while it is possible to condition on them using the technique in the paper, it is not possible to use this technique for generation).\n4) The analysis is interesting, but a more intuitive explanation would be to show nearest neighbor plots.\n\nSome missing citations:\n\nComposing characters into words:\n\ndos Santos and Zadrozny.
