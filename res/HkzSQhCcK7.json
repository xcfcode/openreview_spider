The most direct translation of the the STCN architecture into an RNN counterpart has 25 stacked LSTM cells with 256 units each. Similar to STCN, we use 5 stochastic layers. Please note that stacking this many LSTM cells is unusual and resulted in instabilities during training. The performance is similar to vanilla RNNs. Hence, we didn\u2019t observe a pattern of improvement with densely connected latent variables. The second RNNLadder configuration uses 5 stacked LSTM cells with 512 units and a one-to-one mapping with the stochastic layers. \n\nThis experiments show that the modular structure of our latent variable design does allow for the usage of different building blocks. Even when attached to LSTM cells, it boosts the log-likelihood performance (see 5x512-LadderRNN), in particular when used with dense connections. However, the empirical results suggest that the densely connected latent hierarchy interacts particularly well with dilated CNNs. We believe this is due to the hierarchical nature in both sides of the architecture. On both datasets STCN models achieved the best performance and presented significant improvements with the dense connections. This supports our contribution of a latent variable hierarchy, which models different aspects of information from the input time-series. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1356/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1356/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1356/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "STCN: Stochastic Temporal Convolutional Networks", "abstract": "Convolutional architectures have recently been shown to be competitive on many\nsequence modelling tasks when compared to the de-facto standard of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) while providing computational and modelling advantages due to inherent parallelism.

Thank you for the updates and improvements.\n\nHowever, I cannot accept the MNIST STCN-dense number without extraordinary evidence (the level of which is frankly impossible to give in a double blind conference review). It would be a serious issue for any follow-on work, and without extremely strong (to the level of replication / rerunning the code and at least some days of digging) evidence, I cannot update my score due to this point alone.\n\nI *strongly* urge the authors to avoid this particular number (even leaving the pure STCN without dense connections seems fine), as the rest of the results seem quite solid and the contribution of the paper is meaningful - there is no need to have this controversy when the focus of the paper is not really MNIST modeling. Other papers with similarly radical improvements (~62 to far lower) have had to be withdrawn or reworked due to methodology concerns, and I would really not like to see the same thing here, when it isn't necessary for the message or concept of the paper.\n\nAs far as debug strategies if you really, really want to be confident in the result, you can multiply every contribution in the dense connections which is connected to the original input by 0 (this may be tricky), the number should fall back to something reasonable. If it breaks entirely, or if the number stays really low, these are both serious causes for concern. Adding huge amounts of noise on these connections should also force the model to fall back to alternate connections, and shouldn't break things utterly if it is a real scenario - it should fall back to something roughly like the standard STCN.\n\nWithout that particular number as an issue, I would definitely raise my score - the updates address most of my other concerns."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1356/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1356/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1356/AnonReviewer3", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "STCN: Stochastic Temporal Convolutional Networks", "abstract": "Convolutional architectures have recently been shown to be competitive on many\nsequence modelling tasks when compared to the de-facto standard of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) while providing computational and modelling advantages due to inherent parallelism.

Without stronger comparison to other closely related work, and lack of citation to several closely related models, the claim of novelty isn't defined well enough to be useful. Describing what parts of this model are novel compared to e.g. Stochastic WaveNet or the conditional dilated convolutional decoder of \"Improved VAE for Text ...\" (linked below, among many others) would help strengthen the novelty claim, if the claim of novelty is needed or useful at all. Stochastic WaveNet in particular seems very closely related to this work, as does PixelVAE. In addition, use of autoregressive models conditioned on (non-variational, in some sense) latents have been shown in both VQ-VAE and ADA among others, so a discussion would help clarify the novelty claim.\n\nEmpirical results are strong, though (related to the novelty issue) there should be greater comparison both quantitatively and qualitatively to further work. In particular, many of the papers linked below show better empirical results on the same datasets. Though the results are not always directly comparable, a discussion of *why* would be useful - similar to how Z-forcing was included.\n\nIn the qualitative analysis, it would be good to see a more zoomed out view of the text (as in VRNN), since one of the implicit claims of the improvement from dense STCN is improved global coherence by direct connection to the \"global latents\". As it stands now the text samples are a bit too local to really tell.

The model as depicted in figure 2 has a ladder-like sequence of deterministic convolutions bottom-up and stochastic Gaussian units top-down.\n\nI'm afraid I have a handful of questions about aspects of the architecture that I found confusing. I have a difficult time relating my understanding of the architecture described in figure 2 with the architecture shown in figure 1 and the description of the wavenet building blocks. My understanding of wavenet matches what is shown in the left of figure 1: the convolution layers d_t^l depend on the convolutional layers lower-down in the model, thus with each unit d^l having dependence which reaches further and further back in time as l increases. I don't understand how to reconcile this with the computation graph in figure 2, which proposes a model which is Markov! In figure 2, each d_{t-1}^l depends only on on the other d_{t-1} units and the value of x_{t-1}, which then (in the left diagram of figure 2) generate the following x_t, via the z_t^l. Where did the dilated convolutions go\u2026? I thought at first this was just a simplification for the figure, but then in equation (4), there is d_t^l = Conv^{(l)}(d_t^{l-1}). Shouldn't this also depend on d_{t-1}^{l-1}\u2026? or, where does the temporal information otherwise enter at all? The only indication I could find is in equation (13), which has a hidden unit defined as d_t^1 = Conv^{(1)}(x_{1:t}).\n\nAdding to my confusion, perhaps, is the way that the \"inference network\" and \"prior\" are described as separate models, but sharing parameters. It seems that, aside from the initial timesteps, there doesn't need to be any particular prior or inference network at all: there is simply a transition model from x_{t-1} to x_{t}, which would correspond to the Markov operator shown in the left and middle sections of figure 2. Why would you ever need the right third of figure 2? This is a model that estimates z_t given x_t. But, aside from at time 0, we already have a value x_{t-1}, and a model which we can use to estimate z_t  given x_{t-1}\u2026!\n\nWhat are the top-to-bottom functions f^{(l)} and f^{(o)}? Are these MLPs?\n\nI also was confused in the experiments by the >= and <= on the reported numbers. For example, in table 2, the text describes the values displayed as log-likelihoods, in which case the ELBO represents a lower bound. However, in that case, why is the bolded value the *lowest* log-likelihood? That would be the worst model, not the best \u2014 does table 2 actually show negative log-likelihoods, then? In which case, though, the numbers from the ELBO should be upper bounds, and the >= should be <=. Looking at figure 4, it seems like visually the STCN and VRNN have very good reconstructions, but the STCN-dense has visual artifacts; this would correspond with the numbers in table 2 being log-likelihoods (not negative), in which case I am confused only by the choice of which model to bold.\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThanks for the clarifications and edits. FWIW I still find the depiction of the architecture in Figure 2 to be incredibly misleading, as well as the decision to omit dependencies from the distributions p and q at the top of page 5, as well as the use in table 3 of \"ELBO\" to refer to a *negative* log likelihood.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1356/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "STCN: Stochastic Temporal Convolutional Networks", "abstract": "Convolutional architectures have recently been shown to be competitive on many\nsequence modelling tasks when compared to the de-facto standard of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) while providing computational and modelling advantages due to inherent parallelism.

In the revised version, we added a more complete related work section. In particular, we discuss the most closely related Stochastic Wavenet paper in detail. While SWaveNet and ours combine TCNs with stochastic variables there are important differences in how this is achieved. Furthermore, we show that these design choices have implications in terms of modelling power and our architecture outperforms SWaveNet despite not having access to future information. Furthermore, we provide log-likelihood results from Variational Bi-LSTM and Stochastic Wavenet are inserted into the result table. In order to provide more evidence, we also include experiments on the Blizzard dataset. \n\nWe would like to emphasize that the main difference between our model and the models with autoregressive decoders (i.e., PixelVAE, Improved Variational Autoencoders for Text Modeling using Dilated Convolutions) is the sequential structure of our latent space. For every timestep x_t we have a corresponding latent variable z_t, similar to stochastic RNNs, which helps modeling the uncertainty in sequence data. We aim to combine TCNs with a powerful latent variable structure to better model sequence data rather than learning disentangled or interpretable representations. The updated results show that our design successfully preserves the modeling capacity of TCNs and representation power of latent variables.\n\n*** Handwriting sample figure.\nIn order to make a direct comparison, we include a new figure (similar to VRNN) comparing generated handwriting samples of VRNN, Stochastic Wavenet and STCN-dense. The original figure referred to by the reviewer is now in the Appendix.\n\n*** MNIST results\n(Also see the answer to R1) We include a new figure comparing the performance of STCN, STCN-dense and VRNN on single test samples from seq-MNIST. We find that STCN-dense makes very precise probability predictions for the pixel values as opposed to other models, this explains the drastic increase in likelihood performance. \nWe include a table providing KL loss per latent variable across the whole dataset. We also provide a comparison between SKIP-VAE (Avoiding Latent Variable Collapse with Generative Skip Models) and our model.

As the reviewer mentions the dilated convolutional stacks d_t^l has dependency reaching further and further back in time. \nIn the original Fig. 2 we aimed to simplify the model details and show only a graphical model representation. The caption provides an explanation of the (updated) figure in the revised version. Moreover, the \u201cConv\u201d equation (Eq. 2 in the revised version) is now a corrected to be a function of multiple time-steps, explicitly showing the hierarchy across time.\n\n***Details of the inference and generative networks\nThe difference between the prior and the approximate posterior, i.e., inference network are the respective input time-steps. The prior at time-step t is conditioned on all the input sequence until t-1, i.e., x_{1:t-1}. The inference network, on the other hand, is conditioned on the input until step t, i.e., x_{1:t}. \nAt sampling time, we only use the prior. In other words, the prior sample z_t (conditioned on  x_{1:t-1}) is used to predict x_t. Here we follow the dynamic prior concept of Chung et al. (2015). During training of the model, the KL term in the objective encourages the prior to be predictive of the next step. \n\n*** f^{(l)} and f^{(o)} functions.\nf^{(l)} stands for neural network layers consisting of 1d convolution operations with filter size 1: Conv -> ReLu -> Conv -> ReLu which is then used to calculate mu and sigma of a Normal distribution.\n\nf^{(o)} corresponds the output layer of the model. Depending on the task we either use 1d Conv or Wavenet blocks. Network details are provided in the appendix of the revised paper.\n\n*** Clarification on MNIST results.\nThis was indeed a typo. We report negative log-likelihood performance, measured by ELBO. We correct this in the revised version.\nIn Fig. 4 (in the submitted version) we wanted to emphasize that STCN-dense can reconstruct the low-level details such as noisy pixels, which results in large improvement in the likelihood. We agree the STCN and VRNN provide smoothed and perceptually beautiful results. However, such enhancements lower the likelihood performance. Since the figure did not convey this clearly, we updated the figure in the revised version.\f\n\n***References\nJunyoung Chung, Kyle Kastner, Laurent Dinh, Kratarth Goel, Aaron C Courville, and Yoshua Bengio.

In particular, we did not want to modify deterministic TCN layers (as is the case for Stochastic WaveNet, Lai et al., 2016) since this may limit scalability, flexibility and may limit the maximum receptive field size. \nThese goals are motivated by findings from the initial phases of the project:  \n1) Initial attempts involved standard hierarchical latent variable models, none outperformed the VRNN baseline.  \n2) The precision-weighted update of approximate posterior, akin to LadderVAEs, significantly improved experimental results. \n3) As can be seen from our empirical results, the increasing receptive field of TCNs provides different information context to different latent variables. This enables our architectures to more efficiently leverage the latent space and partially prevents latent space collapse issues highlighted in the literature (Dieng et al., 2018,  Zhao et al., 2017). The introduction of skip connections from every latent variable to the output layer directly in the STCN-dense variant seems to afford the network the most flexibility in terms of modelling different datasets (see p.8 & Tbl. 3 in the revised paper).\n\n***  Effectiveness of TCN and densely connected latent variables\nThanks for the interesting question. We agree that using multiple levels of the latent variables directly to make predictions is very effective. As we explain in the revised version of our submission, in STCN and STCN-dense models, the latent variables are provided with a different level of expressiveness. Hence, depending on the task and dataset, the model can focus on intermediate variables which have a different context. We think that this is an important aspect of our work, which can only be achieved by using the dilated CNNs. One can stack RNN cells similar to TCN blocks and use our densely connected latent space concept. In this scenario, the hierarchy would only be implicitly defined by the network architecture. However, since the receptive field size does not change throughout the hierarchy it is unclear whether the same effectiveness would be attained. Moreover, we note that combining our hierarchical stochastic variables with stacked LSTMs would inverse the effect on computational efficiency that we gain from the TCNs.  \n\n***\u201cMNIST performance\nYes, binarization of the MNIST is fixed in advance. We followed the procedure detailed in the Z-forcing paper closely. Naturally, we will release code and pre-processing scripts so that the results can be verified. Here is our experimental protocol:\n1) We used the binarized MNIST dataset of Larochelle and Murray (2011). It was downloaded from http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~larocheh/public/datasets/binarized_mnist/binarized_mnist_train.amat\n2) We trained all models without any further preprocessing or normalization. The first term of the ELBO, i.e., the reconstruction loss, is measured via binary cross-entropy. \nWe provide an in-depth analysis in the revised version, showing that the STCN-dense architecture makes very precise probability predictions, also for pixel values close to character discontinuities. This provides very accurate modeling of edges and in consequence, gives very good likelihood performance. See (new) Figure 4 in the revised version.\n\n*** Clarifications\nWe updated and clarified the Figure in the revised version. The generative model only relies on the prior. At sampling time, samples from the prior latent variables are used both in prediction of the observation and computation of the next layer\u2019s latent variable. Therefore the generative model takes the input sequence until t-1, i.e., x_{1:t-1} in order to predict x_t.\n\u201cThe term \"kla\" appears in table 1, but it seems that it is otherwise not defined. I think this is the same term and meaning that appears in Goyal et al. (2017), but it should obviously be defined here.\u201d\nYes. It stands for annealing of the weight of KL loss term. We now clarified the language in tables and captions. \n\n***References\nLai, G., Li, B., Zheng, G., & Yang, Y. (2018).

(2016) and as was the case at submission time.\n- With this change implemented, we re-ran experiments and updated the tables in the paper. On IAM-OnDB, Deepwriting,    TIMIT and MNIST we now report state-of-the-art log-likelihood results (even compared to additional models listed by R3). We also evaluate our model on the Blizzard dataset where only the Variational Bi-LSTM architecture is marginally better than STCN-dense (i.e., 17319 against 17128) but has access to future information.\n- We include additional results on MNIST and provide insights why STCN-dense gives a large improvement in terms of reconstruction.\n- We updated figures and equations throughout to improve clarity of presentation. \n\n-----\nCasper Kaae S\u00f8nderby, Tapani Raiko, Lars Maal\u00f8e, S\u00f8ren Kaae S\u00f8nderby, and Ole Winther.

While VAE\napproach has previously been applied to sequence modeling (I believe the\nearliest being the VRNN of Chung et al (2015)), the innovation where is the\nintegration of a causal, dilated CNN in place of the more typical recurrent\nneural network. \n\nThe potential advantages of the use of the CNN in place of\nRNN is (1) faster training (through exploitation of parallel computing across\ntime-steps), and (2) potentially (arguably) better model performance. This\nsecond point is argued from the empirical results shown in the\nliterature. The disadvantage of the CNN approach presented here is that\nthese models still need to generate one sample at a time and since they are\ntypically much deeper than the RNNs, sample generation can be quite a bit\nslower.\n\nNovelty / Impact: This paper takes an existing model architecture (the\ncausal, dilated CNN) and applies it in the context of a variational\napproach to sequence modeling. It's not clear to me that there are any\nsignificant challenges that the authors overcame in reaching the proposed\nmethod. That said, it certainly useful for the community to know how the\nmodel performs.\n\nWriting: Overall the writing is fairly good though I felt that the model\ndescription could be made more clear by some streamlining -- with a single\npass through the generative model, inference model and learning. \n\nExperiments: The experiments demonstrate some evidence of the superiority\nof this model structure over existing causal, RNN-based models. One point\nthat can be drawn from the results is that a dense architecture that uses multiple levels of the\nlatent variable hierarchy directly to compute the data likelihood is\nquite effective. This observation doesn't really bear on the central message\nof the paper regarding the use of causal, dilated CNNs. \n\nThe evidence lower-bound of the STCN-dense model on MNIST is so good (low)\nthat it is rather suspicious. There are many ways to get a deceptively good\nresult in this task, and I wonder if all due care what taken. In\nparticular, was the binarization of the MNIST training samples fixed in\nadvance (as is standard) or were they re-binarized throughout training? \n\nDetailed comments:\n- The authors state \"In contrast to related architectures (e.g. (Gulrajani et\nal, 2016; Sonderby et al. 2016)), the latent variables at the upper layers\ncapture information at long-range time scales\" I believe that this is\nincorrect in that the model proposed in at least Gulrajani et al also \n\n- It also seems that there is an error in Figure 1 (left). I don't think\nthere should be an arrow between z^{2}_{t,q} and z^{1}_{t,p}. The presence\nof this link implies that the prior at time t would depend -- through\nhigher layers -- on the observation at t. This would no longer be a prior\nat that point. By extension you would also have a chain of dependencies\nfrom future observations to past observations. It seems like this issue is\nisolated to this figure as the equations and the model descriptions are\nconsistent with an interpretation of the model without this arrow (and\nincluding an arrow between z^{2}_{t,p} and z^{1}_{t,p}.\n\n- The term \"kla\" appears in table 1, but it seems that it is otherwise not\ndefined. I think this is the same term and meaning that appears in Goyal et\nal. (2017), but it should obviously be defined here.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1356/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "STCN: Stochastic Temporal Convolutional Networks", "abstract": "Convolutional architectures have recently been shown to be competitive on many\nsequence modelling tasks when compared to the de-facto standard of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) while providing computational and modelling advantages due to inherent parallelism.

In this work, we propose stochastic temporal convolutional networks (STCNs), a novel architecture that combines the computational advantages of temporal convolutional networks (TCN) with the representational power and robustness of stochastic latent spaces. In particular, we propose a hierarchy of stochastic latent variables that captures temporal dependencies at different time-scales. The architecture is modular and flexible due to the decoupling of the deterministic and stochastic layers.
