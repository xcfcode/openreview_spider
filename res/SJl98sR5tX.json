The method builds on imitation learning (behavioural cloning) to model the agent\u2019s behaviour and reinforcement learning to learn a probing policy to more broadly explore different target agent behaviours. Overall, the approach falls into the field of intrinsic motivation / curiosity-like reward generation procedures but with respect to target agent behaviour instead of the agent\u2019s environment. While learning to model the target agent\u2019s inner state, the RL reward is generated based on the difference of the target agent\u2019s inner state between consecutive time steps.\n\nThe approach is evaluated against a small set of baselines in various toy grid-world scenarios and a sorting task and overall performs commensurate or better than the investigated baselines. Given its limitation to small and low-dimensional environments, it cannot be said how well the approach will scale with respect to these factors and the resulting, more complex agent behaviours. It would be highly beneficial to evaluate these aspects. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to provide more information about the baselines; in particular the type of count-based exploration. For the generated figures, it would be beneficial to include standard deviation and mean over multiple runs to not only evaluate performance but also robustness. \n\nOverall, while the agent behaviour modelling focused on a type of inner state (based on past trajectories) provides benefits in the evaluated examples, it is unsure how well the approach scales to more complex domains based on strong similarity and simplicity of the tested toy scenarios (evaluation on sorting problems is an interesting step towards to address this shortcoming). One additional aspect pointing towards the necessity of further evaluation is the strong dependence of performance on the dimensionality of the latent, internal state (Fig.4). \n\nMinor issues:\n- Reward formulations for the baselines as part of the appendix.\n- Same scale for the y-axes across figures\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper197/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Interactive Agent Modeling by Learning to Probe", "abstract": "The ability of modeling the other agents, such as understanding their intentions and skills, is essential to an agent's interactions with other agents.

This method is composed of a policy that learns to imitate an expert\u2019s action, and a policy that challenges the expert in order to get it to take multiple possible routes to solve a task. The two policies share a \u201cbehavior tracker\u201d that models the expert\u2019s behavior, and communicates it to both policies being learned. The probing policy is optimized using a curiosity-driven reward in order to get the expert take trajectories the probing policy has not seen before. In experiments, the authors perform experiments to show how the learned agent can generalize to unseen configurations in the corresponding environments in which the agents were trained, and also use the proposed technique in a sorting task in which the method generalizes to longer arrays to be sorted.\n\n\n2) Pros:\n+ Neat idea for exploring an experts behavior by changing the environment surrounding it (probing it).\n+ Cool experiments for applicability.\n+ Well written paper and easy to understand.\n\n3 Comments:\n- Equation 1 typo?:\nTo my understanding, in curiosity driven exploration, the exploration is driven based on how well the next state can be predicted by the agent. In equation 1, different time steps are being compared, m^t and m^{t-1}, but the comparison should be between the predicted time step t and real time step t. Can the authors clarify why different time steps are compared in the equation?\n\n- Baseline missing: Random actions from expert\nA simple baseline to compare against could be to simply force the expert to take a few random actions during its trajectory and let the imitator learn from these. Comparing against this baseline could serve as evidence that we need to actually learn the probing agent to acquire a more optimal policy.\n\n- Baseline missing: Simple RNN policies that communicate hidden states.\nAnother baseline could be to simply model the imitator and probing policies as RNNs and let them communicate with each other via the hidden states. While optimizing the curiosity reward the hidden states could be used as well. If successful, this baseline can show that we actually need to model the \u201cbehavior\u201d with a separate network.\n\n- Ablation study for the importance of fusion:\nThe authors have a \u201cfusion\u201d layer within the imitator and probing policies. An ablation study showing that this layer is actually necessary is missing from the paper.\n\n- Generalizability argument\nThe authors claim that they show a single starting configuration for the agents during training, and different starting configurations during testing. While I agree with this to some extent, I also think this argument may not be fully right. When the probing agent is testing the expert, it is essentially showing the imitator many different configurations of the environment. It may not be that it changes in the first time step (for obvious reasons), but it is essentially showing it many configurations of the expert. A more drastic change of the environment could make for a stronger argument. \n\n\n4) Conclusion:\nOverall, I like the idea of having a policy that tries to figure out the general behavior of a demonstrator by probing it. Having said that, I feel this paper needs to improve in the aspects mentioned above. If the authors present more convincing evidence that successfully address the comments above, I am willing to increase my score.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper197/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Interactive Agent Modeling by Learning to Probe", "abstract": "The ability of modeling the other agents, such as understanding their intentions and skills, is essential to an agent's interactions with other agents.

We have added the suggested baselines in the revision. Here are our responses to your questions and comments:\n\n1. Equation 1 typo?\nIt is not a typo. Our reward function is different from existing curiosity reward. We are using the change of the real time m^t and m^{t-1} as the reward for inciting behavioral change from the demonstrator. We have shown more analysis and visualization to explain why this works in the new revision (Appendix B.2 & B.3). Our \u201cself-supervised\u201d baseline is actually using the prediction loss as reward, and it has a worse performance compared to ours.\n\n2. Baseline missing: Random actions from expert\nFigure 5 shows the results where 10% actions from the demonstrator are purely random. With the randomness, our approach is still be able to find meaningful probing policy. We have also evaluated the success rate when we use the policy learned from the suboptimal demonstration (10% random actions). As reported in the updated Table 1, this policy is comparable to the one learned from optimal demonstrations, and it still outperforms baselines which are all trained from optimal demonstrations.\n\n3. Baseline missing: Simple RNN policies that communicate hidden states\nWe have evaluated this baseline in the revision (i.e., the \u201c2-LSTM\u201d baseline). The network architecture is illustrated in Figure 16. It indeed performs much worse than our full model.\n\n4. Ablation study for the importance of fusion\nWe have added the result of this baseline (i.e., the \u201cours w/o fusion\u201d baseline), where we concatenate the state feature and the latent vector m^t together. The results have validated the importance of using the attention-based fusion layer.\n\n5. Generalizability argument\nOur main idea is to show as many configurations as possible to the learner by learning a good probing policy. Since the probing always starts from a single setting, there is indeed a limit in terms of how different the new settings could be. E.g., in Maze Navigation, it is impossible for the learner to change the room layout drastically in the time limit, so the learned policy won\u2019t make sense in a very different room layout (e.g., 8 rooms instead of 4 rooms). To obtain a better generalization, we may need to use a better imitation learning approach to replace the current one (behavioral cloning), and possibly using multiple starting configurations. But we think that it is somewhat orthogonal to our main contribution. The objective of our approach is to discover more diverse settings/configurations and consequently improve whatever imitation learning approach we actually use."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper197/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper197/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper197/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Interactive Agent Modeling by Learning to Probe", "abstract": "The ability of modeling the other agents, such as understanding their intentions and skills, is essential to an agent's interactions with other agents.

Here are our responses to your questions and concerns.\n\n1. The authors should provide more details on how the hand-crafted demonstrator agents were made.\nWe have added more details, and plan to release the code. We indeed implemented search algorithm with simple heuristics for acceleration for all grid-world tasks. In Maze Navigation, the state space is extended to the combination of map status and the agent's inventory. By this definition of states, an efficiency search can still be achieved.  \n\n2. Scalability?\nWe focus on simpler domains to provide proof-of-concept results as the first step on this direction. We are definitely interested in studying how our approach can be applied to more complex tasks as future work.\n\n3. A deeper dive into examining those latent representations and potentially visualizing those distances and how they correspond to different policy behaviors. \nThanks for the suggestion. We have included a more detailed analysis with new visualizations in the updated paper. i) We visualize the latent vectors obtained from demonstrations with probing and without probing. It indeed shows that with probing, we are able to find new behaviors that correspond to the new latent vectors. ii) We also show the correlation between the distance of two consecutive latent vectors m^{t-1} and m^t and, the KL divergence between the two corresponding policies KL(\\pi(a|s^{t+1},m^t) || \\pi(a|s^{t+1},m^{t-1})), i.e., how different the policy would have been if m^t didn\u2019t change. The correlation is significant, and thus validates the idea.\n\n4. 1) how well will this method work with a human acting as the demonstrator? and 2) how can this method work if you are not able to have access to a demonstrator long periods of time (or even at all)?\nWe focus on improving modeling machine agents, and applying the improved agent models for multi-agent tasks. The current form of our approach is not designed for learning from human demonstrations. However, there are ways to modify our approach towards that direction: i) learning probing policy with model-based RL; ii) incorporating inductive bias from humans (e.g., the learner knows a specific set of possible goals of the demonstrator and probes the demonstrator to test which goal it has). This seems to be a good direction for future work, but we also think that the current research has provided promising results in simpler domains, and hopefully incites more research where human demonstrators are also involved by introducing this problem to the community.\n\n5. I think this method demonstrates a method for improved collaborative and/or competitive performances given the fact that you already have a single agent with a learned policy. \nYes, in our experiment, we do assume that the opponent has a learned policy which is unknown to us. We think that this is a quite general setting where multiple machine agents are interacting with each other but do not know each other\u2019s true policies and intentions.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper197/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper197/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper197/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Interactive Agent Modeling by Learning to Probe", "abstract": "The ability of modeling the other agents, such as understanding their intentions and skills, is essential to an agent's interactions with other agents.

The approximated demonstrator agent is trained through standard imitation learning techniques and the learning or probing agent is trained using reinforcement learning. The mind of the demonstrating agent is modeled as a latent space representation from a neural net. This latent space representation is used as the reinforcement learning signal for the learner (probing) agent similar to the curiosity driven techniques where larger changes in the representation of mind are sought out since they should lead to larger differences in demonstrator agent behavior. The authors test this in several gridworld environments as well as a sorting task and show that their method achieves superior performance and generalizes better to unseen states and task variations compared to several baseline methods. \n\nGeneral comments, in no particular order:\n\n1. The authors should provide more details on how the hand-crafted demonstrator agents were made. I assume something similar to an a* algorithm was probably used for the passing task, but what about the maze navigation task? \n\n2. The demonstrated tasks are (gridworld and algorithmic) which are very simple RL taks with low-dimensional (non-visual) state-spaces.  It's unclear how this would scale to more complex tasks with higher-dimensional state spaces such as Atari, Starcraft II or if this would work with tasks with continuous state and action spaces such as mujoco. \n\n3. The core premise behind training the learner agent with RL is using a curiosity driven approach to train a probing policy to incite new demonstrator behaviors by maximizing the differences between the latent vectors of the behavior trackers at different time steps. Because the latent vector is modeled as a non-linear function, distances between latent vector representations do not necessarily correspond to similar distances between behavior policies (for example, KL distances between two policy distributions). Since this is for ILCR, I think the authors should have taken a deeper dive into examining those latent representations and potentially visualizing those distances and how they correspond to different policy behaviors. \n\n4. The biggest flaw that I see in this method is the practicality of it's use. This method relies on the ability to obtain or gain access to a demonstration agent to learn from. In very simple tasks, such as the one presented here, the authors were able to hard-code their own demonstration agent. However, in harder tasks, this will not be feasible. If you are able to obtain or code your own agent, then you've already solved the task and there is no need to do any sort of imitation learning in the first place.  In reality, for sufficiently difficult tasks, a human would be the demonstration agent (as is done in most robotics tasks). In practice, imitation learning from a human works well since the learning can be done offline (i.e., post-hoc after a set of demonstrations are collected from the human). However, this task requires the learning to be interactive and thus the demonstrator needs to be present during the learning.  Interactively learning from a human becomes a problem if the learning takes tens of thousands of episodes of training since a human cannot reasonably be expected to be present for that amount of time. Thus, the question is 1) how well will this method work with a human acting as the demonstrator? and 2) how can this method work if you are not able to have access to a demonstrator long periods of time (or even at all)?\n\n5. My previous comment relates mainly to the application of improved imitation learning. However, I do think this is still very useful in the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning for collaborative and competitive tasks (sections 4.6 and 4.7). I think this method demonstrates a method for improved collaborative and/or competitive performances given the fact that you already have a single agent with a learned policy. \n\nOverall, I think the paper presents a really nice idea of how to improve modeling of agents. essentially, a learner agent learns how to probe a demonstrator agent to provide more information about what's being demonstrated and prevent over-fitting to a set of fixed demonstrations.   This work sounds novel to me from a reinforcement learning perspective, however, I'm not well versed on theory of mind research. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper197/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Interactive Agent Modeling by Learning to Probe", "abstract": "The ability of modeling the other agents, such as understanding their intentions and skills, is essential to an agent's interactions with other agents.
