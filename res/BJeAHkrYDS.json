After this initial phase, the agent can again interact with the environment while having access to the reward function. To address this specific setting, the authors propose to use the successor feature representation of policies and combine it with methods that estimate policies in the unsupervised setting (without a reward function) by maximizing the mutual information of a policy-conditioning variable and the agent behaviour. The result is a method called Variational Intrinsic Successor Features (VISF) which obtains significant performance gains on the full Atari task suite in a setting of few-step RL with unsupervised pre-training. The main contribution seems to parameterize the successor features in terms of a variable specifying the policy. This variable will be the same as the linear weights in the linear model for the reward assume by the successor features representation. Finally, a discriminator aims to predict the linear weights of the policy from the observed state-feature representation.\n\nClarity:\n\nI think this is one of the weaknesses of the paper. The writing and clarity could be significantly improved. How do you go from equation 8 to equation 9? How does q lower boun p? In the paragraph after equation 9 the authors mention the score function estimator. But very few details are given. After reading the paper, my impression is that the reproducibility of the results could be very hard, because of the lack of details of the specific implementation. The authors also do not mention that the code will be publicly available after acceptance.\n\nI feel that, to better understand the method, the authors should include experiments in simple and easy to understand synthetic environments which can be more illustrative than ATARI.\n\nWhat is the difference between the policy parameters theta and the conditioning variable z?\n\nNovelty:\n\nThe proposed approach is novel up to my knowledge. I find the idea of parameterizing the successor features in terms of the policy parameters very innovative. \n\nQuality:\n\nThe proposed approach seems well justified and the experiments performed indicate that the method can be useful in practice. However, I think it would be very useful to have results on other environments besides ATARI. For example,  DIAYN contains experiments on a wide range of tasks, including gridworld style tabular experiments to illustrate what their method does. This work would benefit from similar simpler and easier to understand synthetic environments (unlike ATARI).\n\nSignificance:\n\nThe proposed contribution seems significant as illustrated by the experimental results and the novel methodological contributions. However, the lack of clarity and the difficulty in the reproduction of the results limit this.\n\nSome minor comments:\n\nI recommend the authors to remove references in the abstract.\n\nUpdate after the authors' rebuttal:\n\nAfter looking at the response from the authors, I believe that they have successfully addressed my concerns. \nTherefore, I have decided to update my rating and vote for acceptance. I am looking forward to seeing the python notebook with the implementation of the VISR algorithm.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1711/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1711/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["stevenhansen@google.com", "wdabney@google.com", "andrebarreto@google.com", "dwf@google.com", "tvdwiele@gmail.com", "vmnih@google.com"], "title": "Fast Task Inference with Variational Intrinsic Successor Features", "authors": ["Steven Hansen", "Will Dabney", "Andre Barreto", "David Warde-Farley", "Tom Van de Wiele", "Volodymyr Mnih"], "pdf": "/pdf/16e17334730743e99b581dffa985e2cc2b2e8603.pdf", "TL;DR": "We introduce Variational Intrinsic Successor FeatuRes (VISR), a novel algorithm which learns controllable features that can be leveraged to provide fast task inference through the successor features framework.", "abstract": "It has been established that diverse behaviors spanning the controllable subspace of a Markov decision process can be trained by rewarding a policy for being distinguishable from other policies.

We agree that clarity was a weak point for this work, so we have updated both the main text and the appendix to rectify this. Additionally, we\u2019ve created a self-contained python notebook that implements the full VISR algorithm in a simplified setting. We are currently cleaning up that code with an eye on didactic utility, and promise to release it as soon as possible, and well before publication of the work.\n\nQ: How do you go from equation 8 to equation 9? and how does q lower bound p? \nA: Lower bounding q has the effect of going from equation 8 to equation 9. The derivation was initially omitted since it is merely a special case of prior work, but in hindsight this unduly hinders clarity. As such, we\u2019ve added it to the appendix (with references to the work it\u2019s based on), and referenced it near equations 8 and 9.\n\nQ: Where does the score function estimator come from?\nA: The score function estimator is a straightforward application of the log-ratio or REINFORCE trick to the loss function in equation 9 with respect to the policy parameters, and this derivation has been added to the appendix. We\u2019ve also added this alternative (equivalent) terminology to the main body of the text, as REINFORCE is the more common touchstone for parts of the community.\n\nQ: What is the difference between the policy parameters theta and the conditioning variable z?\nFor context, the conditioning variable z describes the task that the policy should strive to achieve, the semantics of which grounded in each particular task being distinguishable on the basis of the state visits (this is effectively what the loss function specifies).\n\nNow to your question, the conditioning variable z is drawn from a fixed distribution (uniform on the 5-sphere) that remains constant throughout training, whereas the policy parameters theta are updated to minimize the loss function in equation 9 (through an application of the REINFORCE trick described above). That said, there are a second set of parameters, those of the variational approximation phi, that also try and minimize the same loss function, but are able to do so directly through back-propagation (the unknown environmental dynamics prevent this for the policy parameters).\n\nQ: include experiments in simple and easy to understand synthetic environments\nA: We\u2019ve included additional qualitative results in the appendix that train VISR on a simple grid-world environment. These include new figures that illustrate the features learned by VISR, as well as a representative sample of learned reward functions and the corresponding value functions. We will release a python notebook implementing the VISR algorithm and replicating this grid-world experiments upon publication."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1711/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1711/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["stevenhansen@google.com", "wdabney@google.com", "andrebarreto@google.com", "dwf@google.com", "tvdwiele@gmail.com", "vmnih@google.com"], "title": "Fast Task Inference with Variational Intrinsic Successor Features", "authors": ["Steven Hansen", "Will Dabney", "Andre Barreto", "David Warde-Farley", "Tom Van de Wiele", "Volodymyr Mnih"], "pdf": "/pdf/16e17334730743e99b581dffa985e2cc2b2e8603.pdf", "TL;DR": "We introduce Variational Intrinsic Successor FeatuRes (VISR), a novel algorithm which learns controllable features that can be leveraged to provide fast task inference through the successor features framework.", "abstract": "It has been established that diverse behaviors spanning the controllable subspace of a Markov decision process can be trained by rewarding a policy for being distinguishable from other policies.

We have done our best to address all your concerns in the revised version of the paper. One of the main concerns in the reviews was the clarity of the paper. To address this issue, we have carefully revised the paper and added more detailed explanations to several passages of the text, with particular emphasis on the mathematical derivations (see detailed comments to reviewer number 1, referred to as R1). In addition, as suggested by R1, we included in the appendix a simple experiment to provide intuition on the mechanics of the proposed method. Finally, we have tried to clarify diction and also made all the corrections suggested by the reviewers.\n\nAdditionally, (as mentioned in the previous version of our appendix) two of our random-feature baselines (RF-VISR and GPI-RF-VISR) had their performance metric calculated incorrectly, using on-policy data rather than the fixed data collection regime used on the other task-inference baselines. This has now been corrected, with all affected results updated. We emphasize that this has had no impact on any of the conclusions of the paper; we fixed it in the name of experimental rigor. \n\nLastly, we will be open-sourcing a self-contained implementation of the VISR algorithm in a python notebook in time for publication.

While unsupervised skill/option discovery algorithms employ mutual information maximization of visited states and the latent variables corresponding to options (typically discrete), this paper adds a restriction that this latent variable (now continuous) should be the task vector specified by some learnt successor features.\n\nWith such a restriction, the algorithm can now be used in an unsupervised pre-training stage to learn conditional policies corresponding to several different task vectors and can be used to directly infer (without training or fine-tuning) a good policy for a supervised phase where external reward is present (i.e. via GPI from Barreto et. al., 2018) by simply regressing to the best task vector.\n\nSuch unsupervised pre-training is shown to outperform DIAYN (Eysenbach et. al., 2018) in 3 different Atari suites (including the full 57 game suite) and also ablations to the proposed model where GPI and SFs are excluded individually.\n\nDecision:\nI vote for accept as this paper proposes a novel technique to combine mutual information based intrinsic control objectives with successor features, which allow for combining the benefits of both in a complementary way. An unsupervised phase can now discover good conditional policies with successor features which can be used to infer a good policy to solve an external reward task in a supervised phase, with such a policy capable of attaining human level performance in several Atari games and outperforming several baselines such as DQNs in limited data regimes.\n\nOther comments:\n- The technique for enforcing the restriction in Eq. 10, as well as being able to use it with generalized policy improvement is a good novel contribution in the paper.\n\n- The detailed comparison with baselines on the full Atari suite is sufficient to back the claims in the paper that the strengths of BMI and SFs do complement each other.\n\n- The fact that fast task inference is sufficient to get good performance is impressive i.e. without the need to fine-tune the best inferred policy.\n\n\nMinor typos:\n- In section 5 para 5, \u201cUFVA\u201d -> \u201cUVFA\u201d, \u201cUFSA\u201d -> \u201cUSFA\u201d.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1711/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1711/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["stevenhansen@google.com", "wdabney@google.com", "andrebarreto@google.com", "dwf@google.com", "tvdwiele@gmail.com", "vmnih@google.com"], "title": "Fast Task Inference with Variational Intrinsic Successor Features", "authors": ["Steven Hansen", "Will Dabney", "Andre Barreto", "David Warde-Farley", "Tom Van de Wiele", "Volodymyr Mnih"], "pdf": "/pdf/16e17334730743e99b581dffa985e2cc2b2e8603.pdf", "TL;DR": "We introduce Variational Intrinsic Successor FeatuRes (VISR), a novel algorithm which learns controllable features that can be leveraged to provide fast task inference through the successor features framework.", "abstract": "It has been established that diverse behaviors spanning the controllable subspace of a Markov decision process can be trained by rewarding a policy for being distinguishable from other policies. However, one limitation of this formulation is the difficulty to generalize beyond the finite set of behaviors being explicitly learned, as may be needed in subsequent tasks. Successor features provide an appealing solution to this generalization problem, but require defining the reward function as linear in some grounded feature space. In this paper, we show that these two techniques can be combined, and that each method solves the other's primary limitation. To do so we introduce Variational Intrinsic Successor FeatuRes (VISR), a novel algorithm which learns controllable features that can be leveraged to provide enhanced generalization and fast task inference through the successor features framework. We empirically validate VISR on the full Atari suite, in a novel setup wherein the rewards are only exposed briefly after a long unsupervised phase. Achieving human-level performance on 12 games and beating all baselines, we believe VISR represents a step towards agents that rapidly learn from limited feedback.", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Variational Intrinsic Control", "Successor Features"], "paperhash": "hansen|fast_task_inference_with_variational_intrinsic_successor_features", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nHansen2020Fast,\ntitle={Fast Task Inference with Variational Intrinsic Successor Features},\nauthor={Steven Hansen and Will Dabney and Andre Barreto and David Warde-Farley and Tom Van de Wiele and Volodymyr Mnih},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJeAHkrYDS}\n}", "full_presentation_video": "", "original_pdf": "/attachment/e3295f4268387bd664c3adc067c77b1932246411.pdf", "appendix": "", "poster": "", "spotlight_video": "", "slides": ""}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
