Ablation study shows that the proposed algorithm has marginal improvement over the baseline. The authors also provide some theoretical justifications to how the proposed idea works.\nThe proposed idea is straightforward and intuitive. Weight sharing has been used in previous works, and what\u2019s new in this paper is to unshare the weights in the middle (with a heuristic rule). The hope is that by doing so, one can achieve a better tradeoff between speedup and accuracy. However the experimental supports are somehow weak and incomplete. For example, in order to show the real speedup, one should provide the full training curve (until convergence) under different settings, instead of just showing one data point (at 500K). It is very common that one can get some speedup at 500K, but the speedup totally disappears after another 500K steps. \nFurthermore, the theoretical analysis is conducted in a simplified setting, and it is not very clear whether it can be used to explain what really happened during BERT training.\nThe reviewers conducted some lengthy discussions after the author rebuttal was available. As a final consensus, we think that there are still concerns on the paper, which makes us hesitate to give an ACCEPT recommendation.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Speeding up Deep Learning Training by Sharing Weights and Then Unsharing", "authorids": ["~Shuo_Yang6", "~Le_Hou1", "~Xiaodan_Song1", "~qiang_liu4", "~Denny_Zhou1"], "authors": ["Shuo Yang", "Le Hou", "Xiaodan Song", "qiang liu", "Denny Zhou"], "keywords": ["fast training", "BERT", "transformer", "weight sharing", "deep learning"], "abstract": "It has been widely observed that increasing deep learning model sizes often leads to significant performance improvements on a variety of natural language processing and computer vision tasks.

I can understand that by just training for 0.5M steps, SWE can achieve better performance than the normal training pipeline. However, I'd like to also see whether SWE can still be better than BERT when trained for 1M steps. In fact, by looking at the MLM acc, the 0.5M + SWE still underperforms the 1.0M + normal training. In ALBERT, the author has compared the model trained for 1M and 1.5M steps and showed that the 1.5M-step model outperforms the 1M-step model. Long-time pretraining has shown to lead better models so I will need to see whether SWE can outperform BERT when trained for a longer time.\n\nMoreover, it is possible that the current learning rate choices: 3\u00d710^\u22124 and 2x10^-4, are not optimal for BERT if it is just trained for 0.5M steps. Because the number of training steps also impact the overall learning rate schedule, I'll need to see results with more peak learning rates. This will help the reader understand the improvement brought by SWE.\n\nIn addition, two-stage training (first train with sequence length equals to 128 and then switch to 512) can also improve the training speed. Given that there are other ways to reduce the training time and the author just conducted experiments on one hyper-parameter combination: fixed peak learning rate + 0.5M training iterations, I will be hesitant in trying out the method. By reading the paper and the experimental results, I'm not confident about whether SWE can be generalized to other training hyper-parameters (lr + #iter)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2680/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2680/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Speeding up Deep Learning Training by Sharing Weights and Then Unsharing", "authorids": ["~Shuo_Yang6", "~Le_Hou1", "~Xiaodan_Song1", "~qiang_liu4", "~Denny_Zhou1"], "authors": ["Shuo Yang", "Le Hou", "Xiaodan Song", "qiang liu", "Denny Zhou"], "keywords": ["fast training", "BERT", "transformer", "weight sharing", "deep learning"], "abstract": "It has been widely observed that increasing deep learning model sizes often leads to significant performance improvements on a variety of natural language processing and computer vision tasks.

Our goal in this paper is to provide a practically useful algorithm for training BERT like models. The analysis of the deep linear models is served as a motivation for both weight sharing and using gradient correlation as the untying rule. Theoretic analysis of BERT models is not our goal here.  We didn't attempt to establish or claim such a result. \n\n--- The key contribution of our work \n\nThe key contribution here  is the \"adaptive weight untying\"  algorithm (see algorithm 2). A random chosen untying point will NOT speed up training. \n\n--- The setting of a unified threshold\n\nWe used the same threshold (=0.5) across all layers and all experiments. Experiments show that this threshold works fairly  well. Moreover, we observed that the gradients correlations all start from almost 1 and all gradually drop to 0. So, eventually all layers are untied. Layer dependent thresholds might work better but we have no idea on how to predefine them. If you have concrete ideas here, we are happy to know. \n\n--- About \\tau \n\nPlease note that our adaptive untying algorithm (algorithm 2)  does not need \\tau. The fixed point untying method (algorithm 1) with \\tau is used as a baseline of its adaptive version. Experiments show that the adaptive method can match (even outperform) the performance of the best manually chosen untying point (ran experiments with different untying points and then chose the best one to compare. See also our ablation study section). This shows our adaptive weight sharing method is effective.\n\n--- Thanks for pointing out the relevant paper. We will cite it and add discussions.\n\n--- Please see the updated version for complete experimental results. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2680/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2680/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Speeding up Deep Learning Training by Sharing Weights and Then Unsharing", "authorids": ["~Shuo_Yang6", "~Le_Hou1", "~Xiaodan_Song1", "~qiang_liu4", "~Denny_Zhou1"], "authors": ["Shuo Yang", "Le Hou", "Xiaodan Song", "qiang liu", "Denny Zhou"], "keywords": ["fast training", "BERT", "transformer", "weight sharing", "deep learning"], "abstract": "It has been widely observed that increasing deep learning model sizes often leads to significant performance improvements on a variety of natural language processing and computer vision tasks.

That will be most helpful for us to improve this work. \n\n-- The theoretic analysis on deep linear networks is used to *motivate and derive* the adaptive untying criterion used in our training algorithm.   The adaptive untying criterion plays the most fundamental role in the success of our method.  A random chosen untying point has no way to speed up training. The fixed point untying method (Algorithm 1) is used to serve as a baseline for its adaptive version (Algorithm 2). Experiments show that the adaptive method can match (even outperform) the performance of the best manually chosen untying point (ran experiments with different untying points and then chose the best one to compare). This shows our adaptive weight sharing method is effective. \n\n-- Revised the 4th paragraph in the introduction to present a high-level illustration on the connection between the theory and algorithm.  Also Revised the algorithm section to make the connection between the theory and algorithm clearer. \n\n-- Revised the title of the theory section from \"theoretic analysis\"  to \u201ctheoretic motivation\u201d  to avoid potential confusion (e.g. thinks of our paper as an attempt to build theoretic analysis for BERT/transformer). Also revised the first paragraph of the theory section to highlight the goal of our theory.

The key idea is to start training with shared weights and unroll the shared weights in the middle of the training. The authors report that this strategy accelerates the convergence speed. The paper introduces heuristics on when to stop weight sharing and how many layers to share weights. It further provides an analysis via the view of deep linear models on why weight sharing helps improve the convergence speed. In the evaluation, the paper evaluates their approach against the training of BERT, and shows that their method can obtain comparable and sometimes even better accuracy on downstream tasks while with 50% faster training speed.\n \nStrengths:\n+ The paper aims to address an important problem in large model training: slow training speed.\n+ The paper proposes an easy-to-implement approach to accelerate the convergence speed of BERT-like models. \n \nWeakness:\n- The technical contribution seems rather incremental. The main difference between this work and the prior work [1], which also train Transformers via shared weights,  seems to be switching from sharing weights to unsharring weights in the middle of the training.\n- Important references are missing, making it not clear the advantage of this work as compared with existing approaches that accelerate the training of Transformer networks. \nThe comparison with existing work is inadequate. Important ablation studies are needed. \n \nComments:\n \nPrior work [1] uses weight sharing to train a smaller Transformer model to obtain similar accuracy.  However, weight sharing does not improve training speed per batch, because the training still needs to perform the same amount of forward and backward computation for each batch. Training may actually be slowed down, since the model may need to train with more batches to reach the same accuracy. This paper aims to speed up the training process by switching from shared to unshared weights in the middle of the training, and it observes faster convergence -- achieving similar downstream accuracy with less number of pretraining samples. This is an interesting empirical observation and can potentially become useful in practice. However, there are some major concerns about the paper.\n \nIt is still unclear whether this faster convergence comes from switching from sharing to unsharring weights or is an effect of the model or hyperparameter changes. First, the stop condition (e.g., the switching threshold) cannot be known as a prior. Therefore, it is controlled with an additional hyperparameter. From the text, it is unclear how this hyperparameter has been chosen or will be chosen when training a new model. It would be better to test the sensitivity of the hyperparameter on another model such as GPT-2 to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n \nSecond, the paper adopts Pre-LN in its evaluation (as briefly mentioned in Section 5.1). However, from the text description, it seems it employs the original BERT as the baseline (\"We first show experiment results English Wikipedia and BookCorpus for pretraining as in the original BERT paper\"). As Pre-LN has been studied in several prior work [2,3] and has been demonstrated to also have the effect of accelerating the convergence speed, it is unclear whether the observed speedup in this paper is an effect of PreLN or weight sharing/unsharing. An ablation study with BERT-PreLN is needed if not already included.\n \nThird, the analysis on deep linear models appears to be over-simplified, where important characteristics of the DNNs such as non-linear activations and residual branches are not represented, making it difficult to connect it with the actual observations in practice.\n \nFinally, importance reference [4] is missing. [4] starts with a shallow BERT and progressively stacks Transformer blocks to accelerate training speed, which is in some sense similar to the proposed technique, which starts with shallow BERT with shared weights and switches to full-length BERT in the middle of the training. The paper might need to highlight the difference between this work and [4]. \n \nSeveral places in the paper are vague or inconsistent: \n\n1. The paper claims that it uses the same BERT implementation and training procedure as the one used by Devlin et. al.. However, the accuracy reported in Table 2 seems to be consistently lower than what was reported in the original BERT paper. For example, QQP in the original paper reaches 72.1, whereas this paper reports 71.4, QNLI was 92.7 in the BERT paper and 91.7 in this paper. If we use the original BERT reported results, the proposed technique seems to incur low accuracy on most tested datasets. Some clarification on the accuracy results is needed. \n\n2. The paper claims that \"it sounds natural for us to expect that ALBERT's performance will be improved if we stop its weight sharing at some point of training. The optimal models are supposed to not be far from weight sharing.\" However, this explanation actually creates some confusion. First, the paper does not provide an analysis of how the weight distribution between the weights trained with and without weight sharing, so it is unclear what \"not be far\" means. Second, what does it mean by \"optimal model\"?  Does it refer to models trained not through weight sharing?

My concern has largely been addressed, and I increased my score. In practice, one observation is that the unstable training with a larger learning rate can be avoided by tuning the warmup ratio or using optimizers (e.g., RADAM [1]) that reduces the noise in gradients, both may lead to faster convergence speed. The proposed technique accelerates training speed by introducing an additional decision point (switching from weight sharing to unsharing), its impact on the convergence speed is unknown beyond the tested model and datasets.

Can you provide more details on how you compare with PreLN than just saying \"updated the submission with PreLN in all experiments\"? For example:\n- From the updated results, it seems by using Pre-LN, the gap between the baseline and the proposed technique already becomes smaller. Xiaong et al. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04745.pdf) find that using PreLN allows one to train BERT with larger learning rates, accelerating the training convergence speed. It appears that you also choose different learning rates for different datasets (3e-4 for wiki + bookcorpus, but 2e-4 for XLNet datasets), but it is unclear why you choose these learning rates and whether you have done some experiments to see if larger learning rates helps further improve the baseline results. Is it possible that the PreLN baseline results are sub-optimal as a result of the smaller learning rates used in the experiments? To be more convincing, it would be better to at least conduct some tuning of the learning rates of Pre-LN to see if the improvement is real or just a use of a weak baseline. \n- After the revision, it appears that both the baseline and SWE results have improved. For example, in Table 1, the SWE-F, SWE-A, SWE-M results are different from the original version. However, this is a bit confusing, as my understanding was the SWE results already included PreLN and only the baseline results need to include PreLN. Can you explain what changes you did that make the results different? \n- \"Note that we the correct implementation of Pre-LN contains a final layer-norm right before the final classification/masked language modeling layer. \" This sentence has a grammatical error."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2680/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2680/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Speeding up Deep Learning Training by Sharing Weights and Then Unsharing", "authorids": ["~Shuo_Yang6", "~Le_Hou1", "~Xiaodan_Song1", "~qiang_liu4", "~Denny_Zhou1"], "authors": ["Shuo Yang", "Le Hou", "Xiaodan Song", "qiang liu", "Denny Zhou"], "keywords": ["fast training", "BERT", "transformer", "weight sharing", "deep learning"], "abstract": "It has been widely observed that increasing deep learning model sizes often leads to significant performance improvements on a variety of natural language processing and computer vision tasks.

Our goal here is to provide a motivation for training with weight sharing and using the gradient correlation as the untying criterion. We don\u2019t attempt to provide convergence analysis for BERT-like models. \n\n- On related work \n\nUnlike progressive stacking [4], our approach does not involve any operation that changes the network structure. It achieves acceleration by using a few lines of code for modifying the gradients.\n\nMoreover, progressive stacking [4] requires to predefine when to stack to achieve acceleration. The paper doesn\u2019t provide any guidance on this. Instead, our proposed algorithm can automatically decide when to unshare the weights.\n\n- On the experiment results\n\n  1. Concerns on Table 2 being worse than the original BERT. Results in Table 2 are obtained using the XLNet dataset which is different from the dataset used in the original BERT paper.

Weight sharing idea is not new, it has been investigated in ALBERT as mentioned in the paper and CV areas (see refs [1],[2]).  Though novelty of this paper is not strong enough, their experimental results are adequate to show the effectiveness of proposed method.  The writing and description are quite clear, but you need to clarify the definition of 'iters' you used in  SWE exps, does it mean iters_of_weight_share + iters_of_wight_unshare?\n\nTo show the advantage of weight sharing, the authors take deep linear model as an example to show that with weight sharing, layers far away from output will not suffer from gradient vanishing or explosion, which is true for deep LINEAR models. But for deep learning based models, non-linear operations is required, which still leads to gradient vanishing or explosion even with weight sharing. For example, recurrent neural network is a typical kind of weight-sharing network and its weight is shared through time. Even with single hidden layer, RNN still suffers from gradient vanishing or explosion, and that is why LSTM is proposed in 1990s. So in my opinion, you'd better take a TRUE deep learning model as an example to analyze the effectiveness of weight sharing during training. For example, you can try to analyze deep feed forward neural networks with ReLU activation, which can be treated as a deep piece-wise linear model.\n\n[1] J. Wang and X.

Three methods are shown to stop weight sharing: 1) stop weight sharing at a predefined point; 2) stop weight sharing at a point using an adaptive way, in which unsharing will be triggered when the majority of the gradient correlations between layers is below a threshold; 3) gradually untie weights between layers by splitting groups based on the gradient correlations. The authors did experiments on BERT large for SQuAD and the GLUE benchmark, and showed that their approach outperform the baseline at the same iteration of 500k, and is on par w/ the baseline training at 1M iterations.\n\nBasically I think this approach could be a practical way to train deep networks w/ repeated layers. It's like between BERT large and ALBERT, the results are not that surprising. The main contribution of this work is that it provides the empirical results of this training method on several tasks.\n\nMy questions regarding to this paper are:\n\n1. In Section 3, the authors provide analysis of weighting sharing can achieve better convergence rate and for good weight sharing each layer's update needs to well correlate with its gradients for deep linear network. How about any theoretical insights for networks w/ activation functions? And How could different activation functions matter (ReLU, Swish et al)? And will these activation functions affect the parameters of when to stop weight sharing?\n\n2. For untie weights between adjacent layers, SWE-A and SWE-M, what's the motivation of setting a unified threshold for all layers? Basically I'm wondering what's the gradient correlation between adjacent layers of top layers and bottom layers, are the correlations on the same level? Will we get better accuracy if we do not limit to a unified threshold? Say, for the top 12 layers, we set the threshold to X and for the bottom 12 layers we set the threshold to Y. Need further information on this.\n\n3. In Table 2, why is SWE-A missing?\n\n4. For Table 3, I think the authors need to add the experiments when \\tau is smaller than 50k. Basically the experiments will show that \\tau should be carefully designed, an arbitrary number may not work, we still need to train some iterations w/ weight sharing for the good model performance.\n\n5.

The author tried to provide theoretical insights on why it can be better. Also, ablation study shows that the proposed algorithm has marginal improvement over the baseline.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nReasons for score: \n\n\nThe improvement over the baseline method, which just trains BERT for more steps, is quite marginal. In addition, after the weights are untied, the training process becomes exactly the same as that in BERT. It's highly likely that both methods can have similar performance after being trained for a large number of steps. Also, I do not think the theoretical results on a deep linear network can help explain the  phenomena we see in BERT training. BERT uses a much more complicated building block that involves layer normalization, attention and non-linearity. Due to these reasons, I vote for rejection.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nPros: \n \n\n1. The idea of first train the model with shared weights and then untie the weights is interesting.\n \n\n##########################################################################\n\nCons: \n \n\n1. The improvement over the baseline method is not very substantial. Basically, it is possible that both methods perform similarly after being trained for a longer number of steps (e.g., 1M, 1.5M).\n\n2. I'm not convinced by the theoretical analysis. Building block in BERT is much more complicated that the building block discussed in Section 3.\n\n3. The criteria of changing from sharing to unsharing is largely heuristic.\n\n\n##########################################################################\n\nQuestions during rebuttal period: \n \n\nPlease address and clarify the cons above \n \n\n#########################################################################\n\nTypos: \n\n(1) Page 3, \"To be best of\" should be \"To the best of\"\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2680/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2680/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Speeding up Deep Learning Training by Sharing Weights and Then Unsharing", "authorids": ["~Shuo_Yang6", "~Le_Hou1", "~Xiaodan_Song1", "~qiang_liu4", "~Denny_Zhou1"], "authors": ["Shuo Yang", "Le Hou", "Xiaodan Song", "qiang liu", "Denny Zhou"], "keywords": ["fast training", "BERT", "transformer", "weight sharing", "deep learning"], "abstract": "It has been widely observed that increasing deep learning model sizes often leads to significant performance improvements on a variety of natural language processing and computer vision tasks.
