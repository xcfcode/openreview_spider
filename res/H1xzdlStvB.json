Towards this, we demonstrate that MuPPET leads to identification of points for precision switching that can enable the inclusion of extreme precision regimes for training that were not considered before that  lead to its acceleration with no loss in the final accuracy. The manuscript has been revised in points to better reflect the above. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the framework is agnostic to network and dataset which allows for a single generalisable approach. \n\nSection 4.4 has been updated with Fig. 3 which is an accuracy-time trade-off plot. Fig. 3 shows that, for a given time-budget, MuPPET outperforms runs that have 1) randomly chosen switching points or 2) switching points borrowed between networks and datasets, thus justifying a need for a framework that adapts at run-time to both network and dataset. \n\nSimilar to the tuning of hyperparameters for training CNNs in general, the hyperparameters for MuPPET (threshold parameters) were explored in an empirical manner. In the revised manuscript, the choice of p is addressed in the paragraph beginning  \u201cAs long as the gradients \u2026\u201d in Section 3.3 which discusses how these choices make p and hence MuPPET agnostic to dataset and networks. Furthermore, the paragraph beginning \u201cThe likelihood of observing r gradients\u2026\u201d in Section 3.3 discusses the reasoning behind using gradient diversity as part of the metric. Nonetheless, the key point to take away here is that the further tuning of the hyperparameters for p is not crucial for the performance of MuPPET as it\u2019s generalisability across datasets and networks has been demonstrated through our results. \n\nSection 3.2.1 has been updated with Eq. (4), (5) and (6) to make the quantisation strategy more explicitly defined. Furthermore, following your suggestion, the introduction has been made more concise and further emphasis has been put on describing the novel contributions of MuPPET.  \n\nMinor Points: \nEquation 3 has been made more explicit in terms of what the representable range of q^i means. \nAll figures have been additionally added to Appendix B at a larger scale to make them more readable. \nThis was a typo and has now been fixed. \n\u201cDistribution approach\u201d referred to how the framework distributed the computations across GPUs, but has now been removed due to space considerations as this detail was not essential to the underlying principles of MuPPET. \nTable 1 has been replaced with the new discussion in Section 4.4. It was originally there to motivate the need for precision switching. \nWe used the standard process described in each model's implementation for data augmentation and preprocessing, such as scaling and cropping the input image, horizontal flipping with a probability of 50% and normalisation by subtracting each channel mean and dividing by the standard deviation.\nClarification of \u201ctheoretical limit\u201d has been addressed in Section 4.3.

The reasoning behind this is that we want to increase the utilised word length as little as possible in order to gain the most performance (runtime) from the computation platform, but moving too little will not result in \u201cenough\u201d information gain and will force the system to switch regimes too often leading to the waste of computational resources.\n\nRegarding point 3), Section 3.3 has been updated to address all the mentioned points. \n\nRegarding point 4), this never occurs, however, Fig. 2 will be updated to highlight the exact points at which the threshold is violated. A short discussion has also been added in Sec.4.1 to clearly indicate switching points. \n\nRegarding point 5), we feel that a difference of < 1% in Top-1 Validation Accuracy on ImageNet is not considered \u201cmuch lower\u201d and fluctuations at these levels can be seen between identical training runs. Furthermore, with respect to GoogLeNet, for the exact same hyperparameters, we achieve a +4.55% improvement in validation accuracy which is significant. Compared to [2], as has been added to the discussion in Section 4.3, this work pushes this boundary even further and opens the possibility for performing computations at wordlengths much lower than 16-bit, and at fixed-point instead of floating-point. With the availability of native hardware (e.g. 8-bit fixed-point computations in NVIDIA\u2019s Turing GPUs), being able to perform training at these precisions without compromising accuracy (as shown in this paper) carries significant advantages. \n\nRegarding point 6), we have added these graphs to Appendix A with a short description of what they show.

This strategy aims to reduce training time by low-precision data representation and computations during the training stage. According to the gradient diversity, the authors introduce a precision-switching mechanism which chooses the best epoch to increase the precision. The validation accuracy and training time across several networks and datasets are shown in the experiments. However, the results are not superior enough compared with the state-of-the-art.\n\nMy detailed comments are as follows.\n\n\nPositive points: \n\n1. This paper proposes a new reduced-precision training scheme to speed up training by progressively increasing the precision of computations from 8-bit fixed-point to 32-bit floating-point. This scheme moves to reduced-precision fixed-point computations while updating an FP32 model in order to push the boundaries of reduced-precision training. \n\n2. The authors propose a metric to decide when to switch the precision inspired by gradient diversity introduced by [1]. In this paper, the gradient diversity is enhanced by considering gradients across epochs instead of mini-batches. The proposed metric can be seen as a proxy for the amount of new information gained in each training step. Therefore, the metric can decide the most appropriate epoch at run time to increase the precision.\n \n3. The proposed low-precision CNN training scheme is orthogonal and complementary to existing low-precision training techniques.\n\n\n\n\nNegative points:\n\n1. The proposed approach does not match the description in this paper. The authors describe \u201cThis approach enables the design of a policy that can decide at run time the most appropriate quantization level for the training process\u201d. In fact, this approach just decides which epoch to increase the quantization level while the levels of quantized precisions are fixed, rather than deciding the most appropriate quantization level. \n\n2. The setting of quantized precision levels (8-, 12-, 14- and 16-bit precisions) is confusing. Please illustrate how to choose the number of quantized bit and the number of quantized precision levels.\n\n3. The presentation of the precision switching policy is confusing and the notations are unclear. For example, in section 3.3, the ratio \u201cp\u201d needs more description because it is a key value in the policy, but lacks an explanation in this section. So please explain more about the motivation of ratio \u201cp\u201d in this section. \tIn section 3.3, in step 5 of the proposed precision switching policy, the authors do not explain the meaning of \u201cy\u201d.\n\n4. In figure 2, the precision switch is not triggered even though the value of p violates the threshold more than 2 times, which mismatches the description in section 3.3.\n\n5. The proposed strategy has no obvious advantages. There are some scenes that the proposed strategy does not perform well. For example, the Top-1 validation accuracy on ImageNet of AlexNet and ResNet with MuPPET strategy is much lower than FP32 baseline. Compared with [2], the proposed method is more complex but not superior enough.\n\n6. The authors do not show the training and validation curves. However, the training and validation curves are common used to show more details of the training process, such as in [2] and [3]. Please show and analyze the training and validation curves of the proposed scheme and the baseline.\n\n\nMinor issues:\nSome spelling and grammar mistakes.\n\n\nReference\uff1a\n[1] Dong Yin, Ashwin Pananjady, Max Lam, Dimitris Papailiopoulos, Kannan Ramchandran, and Peter Bartlett.

Intuitively if the gradients would go to 0 or become very small maybe you would want to increase precision. Or if you have high variance you could argue that the expected gradient would be 0 and hence you are not really making progress, i.e. you are just moving left-right. But if all gradients agree on a moving direction, why is that a bad thing? I know the heuristic is borrowed from a different work, but since it feels as such an integral part of MuPPET I think you should explain it better. \n\nI guess a few details about the algorithm as well. When you say you look at the diversity of the gradients over the epochs, is this the batch gradient !? \n\nThere are some small typos (e.g. FP23 instead FP32). \n\nI find the justification for AlexNet to be adhoc (it switched at the wrong time, but that allowed to take more advantage of computation in the low precision hence it was faster). The switching mechanism should only care of when the gradients are not informative anymore, not how much compute you are wasting ."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2389/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2389/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["aditya.rajagopal14@imperial.ac.uk", "diederik.vink14@imperial.ac.uk", "stelios.ven10@gmail.com", "christos-savvas.bouganis@imperial.ac.uk"], "title": "Multi-Precision Policy Enforced Training (MuPPET) : A precision-switching strategy for quantised fixed-point training of CNNs", "authors": ["Aditya Rajagopal", "Diederik A.

As networks grow in size and complexity one approach  of  reducing  training  time  is  the  use  of  low-precision  data  representation and computations during the training stage.  However, in doing so the final accuracy suffers due to the problem of vanishing gradients.  Existing state-of-the-art methods combat this issue by means of a mixed-precision approach employing two different precision levels, FP32 (32-bit floating-point precision) and FP16/FP8 (16-/8-bit floating-point precision), leveraging the hardware support of recent GPU architectures for FP16 operations to obtaining performance gains. This work pushes the boundary of quantised training by employing a multilevel optimisation approach that utilises multiple precisions including low-precision fixed-point representations.  The training strategy, named MuPPET, combines the use of  multiple  number  representation regimes  together  with  a  precision-switching mechanism that decides at run time the transition between different precisions. Overall, the proposed strategy tailors the training process to the hardware-level capabilities of the utilised hardware architecture and yields improvements in training time and energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Applying MuPPET on the training of AlexNet, ResNet18 and GoogLeNet on ImageNet (ILSVRC12) and targeting an NVIDIA Turing GPU, the proposed method achieves the same accuracy as the standard full-precision training with an average training-time speedup of 1.28\u00d7 across the networks.", "keywords": [], "paperhash": "rajagopal|multiprecision_policy_enforced_training_muppet_a_precisionswitching_strategy_for_quantised_fixedpoint_training_of_cnns", "original_pdf": "/attachment/02c81ab82a4cebd28bd48b186b0c29d8a4c17f63.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nrajagopal2020multiprecision,\ntitle={Multi-Precision Policy Enforced Training (Mu{\\{}PPET{\\}}) : A precision-switching strategy for quantised fixed-point training of {\\{}CNN{\\}}s},\nauthor={Aditya Rajagopal and Diederik A.
