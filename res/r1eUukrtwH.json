This scheme is tailored for addressing the well-known disentanglement problem of VAEs where an over-capacity encoder sometimes manages to both maximize data fit and shrink the KL divergence between the approximate posterior and prior to zero. Consequently, the latent representations of the observations become independent, making them unusable for any downstream task.\n\nThe method developed in Section 3 and proposed explicitly in Eqs 7 to 11 is novel per se, though not groundbreaking.\n\nFigs 2 and 3 are only few examples manually chosen from rather simple tasks. In the absence of a quantitative evaluation metric, they are not informative. In the outcomes of the same runs, there might exist counterexamples where the vanilla VAE generate perceptively more appealing reconstructions than VIMAE.\n\nAs a minor comment, I think the paper unnecessarily complicates the presentation of the idea. The development of notions such as f-Divergence, links to MMD, the constrained optimization setting in Eq 5 etc., do not serve to the main story line, but only distracts a mind. I would prefer a brief intro on VAEs and directly jumping into the proposed method. Last but not least, the statement of technical novelty in Section 3 is extremely encrypted. What exactly is \"absolutely\" novel there and what is prior art? Can the authors give a to-the-point answer to this question during the rebuttal?\n\nThe paper has two fundamental weaknesses:\ni) The paper misses a key reference, which addresses the same representation disentanglement problem using the same information-theoretic approach, only with some minor technical divergences:\n\nAlemi et al., Fixing a Broken ELBO, ICML, 2018. \n\nThis paper is a must-cite, plus a key baseline. This submission cannot be treated as a contribution without showing an improvement on top of this extremely closely related work. The problem is the same, the solution is almost the same, and the theoretical implications of the solution are also the same.\n\nii) The paper builds the entire story line around the statement that the representation disentanglement problem is caused by the properties of the ELBO formula and attempts to fix it by developing a new inference technique. This is attitude largely overlooks simpler explanations. For instance, the vanilla VAE assumes a mean field q(z|x) across the z dimensions. This makes q(z|x) fall largely apart from p(x) which definitely does not factorize that way. Earlier work has shown substantial improvements on the quality of q(z|x) when structured variational inference techniques are used, such as normalizing flows. Furthermore, there has also emerged techniques that can very tightly approximate p(x) in closed-form using the change of variables formula without performing any variational inference at all. No need to say, a tight approximation on p(x) means the same for p(z|x) simply using the Bayes rule. This leaves no room for further improvements by information-theoretic inference alternatives. For instance see:\n\nDinh et al., Density Estimation Using Real NVP, ICLR, 2017\n\nThe presence of such two strong alternative remedies to the problem addressed by this work makes its fundamentals shaky. The only way to get over this situation is to provide a thorough comparison against these methods, which is obviously missing.\n\n---\nPost-rebuttal: Thanks to authors for all the effort they put on the updated version. I appreciate that the paper now provides a quantitative comparison. However, my point (ii) remains fully unaddressed and I fully share the theoretical concerns raised by Reviewer 1.

We observed also that the main difference between the two approaches is in the ratio decoding information/capacity, in VIMAE is one for any p(z), in the Alemi model is in general less than one, that means, according to theory of separability described in (Mathieu et al., 2019) and confirmed by the experiments, that the learned representation is not in general robust and clustered. \nWe observe moreover that the model as described in (Alemi et al, 2017) is not in general feasible to compute and it is necessary to consider a $\\beta$-VAE with $\\beta<1$.\n\nIn the related work section we underlined that  in order to avoid the uninformative issue is possible to consider a family of models learning a flexible prior $p(z)$.

The core idea behind VIMAE is that the encoding information is not bounded while network capacity is. The issue that VIMAE can handle, and where VAE fails, is that representations are not informative of input data, due to the information bottleneck idea that VAE is built upon. The authors describe InfoVAE and \u03b2-VAE, which both attempt to solve this problem. The theory behind VIMAE is then described and tested against VAE and \u03b2-VAE, in their abilities to evaluate the entropy of Z, in reconstruction and generative performance, and in robustness to noise and generalization. \n\nContributions: The authors clearly state the contributions of the paper themselves, but in a summary: a derivation of a variational lower bound for the max mutual info of a generative model, definitions and bounds estimation for a VAE, associations for generative quality and disentanglement representation to mutual information and network capacity, and finally proposing the Capacity-Constrained InfoMax.\n\nComments:\nPage 1: \u201cOur derivation allows us to define\u2026\u201d -> this sentence is a bit long and took me a few reads to understand, reword this please.\n\u201cDerivation of a variational lower bound for ...a geneaive* model belonging..\u201d -> \u201cgenerative\u201d\nPage 2: \u201cWe conclude the paper with experimental results and conclusions.\u201d You already said conclude twice in this sentence, I feel like this could be better worded to avoid that.\nPage 5: \u201cIn order to test the assumption that it is sufficient..\u201d -> This wording is also hard to wrap my head around. Too many commas.\nPage 6: \u201cIn figure 1 are plotted the 2d\u2026\u201d -> This sentence could be reworded\n\nMy main complaint with the paper is that there are quite a few places that could be reworded better in addition to these. Please fix this.\n\nYou mention both InfoVAE and \u03b2-VAE yet only test your models against a \u03b2-VAE model. What was your reasoning for this?\n\nThe semi-supervised learning experiment is interesting (the one based on Zhao et al.) VMAE models are able to classify better regardless of noise or sampling procedure, especially the smaller capacity model VMAE-1. I\u2019d like to hear a discussion in the paper about future work and how the authors believe this could be applied elsewhere.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1806/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1806/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Variational InfoMax AutoEncoder", "authors": ["Vinenzo Crescimanna", "Bruce Graham"], "authorids": ["vincenzo.crescimanna1@stir.ac.uk", "bruce.graham@stir.ac.uk"], "keywords": ["autoencoder", "information theory", "infomax", "vae"], "TL;DR": "We propose a VIMAE, a variational autoencoder learning both a good generative model and disentangled representations", "abstract": "We propose the Variational InfoMax AutoEncoder (VIMAE), an autoencoder based on a new learning principle for unsupervised models: the Capacity-Constrained InfoMax, which allows the learning of a disentangled representation while maintaining optimal generative performance.
