An additional contribution is the problem reformulation with a pre-stabilizing controller and the support of state constraints throughout the learning process.  The method is tested on a damped-spring system and a vehicle platooning problem.\n\nThe reviewers and the author response covered several topics. The reviewers appreciated the research direction and theoretical contributions of this work.  The reviewers main concern was the experimental evaluation, which was originally limited to a damped spring system.  The authors added another experiment for a substantially more complex continuous control domain.  In response to the reviewers, the authors also described how this work relates to non-linear control problems.  The authors also clarified the ability of the proposed method to handle state-based constraints that are not handled by earlier methods.  The reviewers were largely satisfied with these changes.\n\nThis paper should be accepted as the reviewers are satisfied that the paper has useful contributions.", "title": "Paper Decision"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["sebastian.east@bath.edu", "marco@nnaisense.com", "jonathan@nnaisense.com", "jan@nnaisense.com", "mark.cannon@eng.ox.ac.uk"], "title": "Infinite-Horizon Differentiable Model Predictive Control", "authors": ["Sebastian East", "Marco Gallieri", "Jonathan Masci", "Jan Koutnik", "Mark Cannon"], "pdf": "/pdf/2143d86b80f501eb62418b2b12ec31c9893aec77.pdf", "abstract": "This paper proposes a differentiable linear quadratic Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for safe imitation learning.

Thanks for your response. To clarify, in Lemma 1 we claim that the MPC problem is infinite horizon optimal for a large enough N given the P from the Riccati equation for a bounded set of initial conditions. In the proof, in appendix, we refer to the original result in the paper \u201cconstrained linear quadratic regulator\u201d, where this claim is demonstrated under the assumption that the state and input constraints are convex compact sets with the origin in their interior. Hence for a sufficient N there is no sub-optimality. This is a known result in the control literature. We are sorry if this was not made clear and hope that the reviewer could still change their mind about our score in light of the updates in our revised paper. Thanks again for the constructive contribution.

I apologize for responding so late in the discussion period -- but the clarification that I *meant* to ask for in my original review is that you use the DARE of the unconstrained problem to get the terminal control cost Q_N=P (in the text following Eq. (8)) that is used in the constrained problem, not as part of the stabilization. Using this still seems sub-optimal as there could be some other terminal cost that is optimal for the constrained problem that is different from the unconstrained DARE solution. I could imagine a system with very extreme bounds where there is a final cost for the constrained system is extremely different than the final cost for the unconstrained system.

In direct response to Reviewer 4\u2019s suggestion to investigate a nonlinear system that has been successively linearised, the DARE cannot be used for non-linear systems, unless in cases where the non-linearities are quite limited. This is also discussed in Appendix E of our paper. Extensions to some interesting non-linear cases are going to be the subject of a follow-up study. In direct response to Reviewer 3\u2019s comment \u2018can one construct scenarios where the baseline approach (Amos et al., 2018) fails?\u2019 \u2013 one of the significant limitations of (Amos et al., 2018) is that state constraints are not included in their differentiable MPC formulation (see equation (10) in their paper). As a consequence, their approach very quickly fails in general for even the simple LTI case presented here when state constraints are included because the MPC optimization has become infeasible in the forwards pass, and so one of the major contributions of this paper is ensuring feasibility in the presence of state constraints. We therefore believe that the numerical demonstration with an LTI system is necessary to provide credibility for when the approach is extended to non-linear systems, but agree that a 2DOF system is insufficient. We propose to investigate a second LTI system with a larger amount of states and inputs, inspired by a real-world application. Would the reviewers be satisfied with this additional experiment? \n\nComments specific to Reviewer 3:\n\n\u2022\tBy \u2018the same class\u2019 we mean that the expert and learner are both 2DOF LTI systems controlled with Quadratic box-constrained MPC controllers. This comment has been removed in the updated paper to improve clarity.\n\n\u2022\tWe thank the reviewer for the suggested references, which are both are of interest\n\n\u2022\tIn the first suggested paper (Y. Pan et al.) the \u2018expert\u2019 controller takes the form of a model predictive controller where the model is a gaussian process and the solution is provided using differential dynamic programming. The \u2018learner\u2019 however, is simply a deep neural network, for which it is generally impossible to determine whether the learned controller will satisfy hard constraints on the system state a-priori, or whether it will be stabilizing. The entire purpose of the work presented in this paper is to provide interpretable structure to a neural network when used for imitation learning, for which hard constraint satisfaction and stability can be guaranteed a-priori, provided that the prediction error of the MPC model is limited. Ultimately, our study, as well as the previous ones on differentiable MPC, aims towards future integration of more complex sensory (e.g. visual) information as done in Y. Pan et al. However, in this work we decided  to focus on improving one part of the stack, i.e. on establishing conditions for having a more stable and optimal method to imitate controllers from given state-action measurements. The integration of visual data and of convolutional networks is of great interest and will be addressed in future work.    \n\n\u2022\tThe second paper (R. Cheng et al.) deals with reinforcement learning, where a prior policy is introduced to reduce variance and, in the case of H-infinity robust control, to provide stability with respect to the \u201cuncertainty\u201d resulting in the use of an RL policy. The two policies are weighted and it is shown that this results in a regularization of the original loss. This is clearly inspired by robust control, and in the general case adding stability or robustness will lead to an inevitable level of conservatism or sub optimality with respect to the original reward or loss. In this paper the re-parameterisation does not lead to sub-optimality and does not alter the MPC problem.  \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2006/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2006/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["sebastian.east@bath.edu", "marco@nnaisense.com", "jonathan@nnaisense.com", "jan@nnaisense.com", "mark.cannon@eng.ox.ac.uk"], "title": "Infinite-Horizon Differentiable Model Predictive Control", "authors": ["Sebastian East", "Marco Gallieri", "Jonathan Masci", "Jan Koutnik", "Mark Cannon"], "pdf": "/pdf/2143d86b80f501eb62418b2b12ec31c9893aec77.pdf", "abstract": "This paper proposes a differentiable linear quadratic Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for safe imitation learning.

The paper has some nice contributions and I find this research direction to be very exciting, which is why I think it merits acceptance, however I find the experiments (Section 4) could be greatly improved.\n\nThe main contribution of the paper are the analytical derivative of the solution to the DARE. The pre-stabilising controller reformulation is a neat trick. \n\nThe main issue I have with this paper is that the experiments are performed only on a toy 2D problem. Even an LTI system can be interesting! Of course it is important to start with a toy problem, but once positive results have been shown, it would be much more convincing if the paper showed some more complicated system, possibly an iteratively linearised non-linear system. My feeling (and possibly many others') is that these type on differentiable controllers can be extremely powerful, however this power is sadly not demonstrated here.\n\nerrata:\nbefore eq (3): dt is not a pertubation to the feedback control\neq (4) argmin over \\delta u rather than \\delta, presumably\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2006/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2006/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["sebastian.east@bath.edu", "marco@nnaisense.com", "jonathan@nnaisense.com", "jan@nnaisense.com", "mark.cannon@eng.ox.ac.uk"], "title": "Infinite-Horizon Differentiable Model Predictive Control", "authors": ["Sebastian East", "Marco Gallieri", "Jonathan Masci", "Jan Koutnik", "Mark Cannon"], "pdf": "/pdf/2143d86b80f501eb62418b2b12ec31c9893aec77.pdf", "abstract": "This paper proposes a differentiable linear quadratic Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for safe imitation learning.
