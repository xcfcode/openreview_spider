Our method outperforms existing Deep Learning techniques as well as the state-of-the-art and does so without re-training. Would you mind referencing the papers on feature learning techniques for domain adaptation that require no joint training so that we can compare against them, as we are not sure to which you are referring?\n\nre 1: That is a good point. The combination schemes in equations (3) and (5) are indeed equivalent. We uploaded the derivation here (https://postimg.org/image/shwj3x0zj/) for ease of use. We will update equation (5) in the paper with the scheme of equation (3) for better readability.\n\nre 2: We can extend MCD to the multi-class setting using pair-wise cluster differences as follows: For $n$ classes, we compute $n$ cluster centroids for the clusters whose members have been assigned the same class by our model. We then create a set containing all $n(n-1)/2$ unique pairs of cluster centroids. Finally, we compute the sum of pair-wise differences of the model's representations with regard to the cluster centroid pairs: $MCD_{multi} = \\sum_{c_1, c_2 \\in \\text{c_pairs}} | cos(c_1, h) - cos(c_2, h) |$."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Knowledge Adaptation: Teaching to Adapt", "abstract": "Domain adaptation is crucial in many real-world applications where the distribution of the training data differs from the distribution of the test data.

We really appreciate it. \n\nTo elaborate, in most scenarios, source and target domain vocabularies are not exactly matched. If the student were using the same vocabulary as the teacher (the source domain vocabulary), it would be restricted to learning a distribution only over the subset of words shared between domains and thus unable to transfer knowledge to the new domain. Using the target domain vocabulary allows the student to learn positive and negative words that are shared across domains and to transfer this knowledge to positive and negative words that only occur in the new domain. As our model is discriminative, we do not need to renormalise the student distribution. Did this help to clarify this issue? If not, would you mind to elaborate briefly why the student distribution should be renormalised in the case of mismatched vocabularies and how you would perform this renormalisation?

We are using a one hidden layer-MLP in our experiments to ensure comparability to previous work (cf. [1]). For a deeper model, we would likely prefer to use intermediate ones in line with previous work. We will evaluate this in a future experiment. \n\nre scope of approach: We are not sure we fully understand your comment. We do not assume that the source and target vocabularies are exactly the same, but we assume some overlap in words is present (as do most approaches to domain adaptation in NLP). As we only require the models' output probabilities for training, the student and teacher are free to create different representations from the inputs. This might be a problem if we chose to constrain intermediate layers as in [2]. In our experiments, teacher and student models use different vocabularies (as the teacher has not seen some target domain words during training) and the student achieves state-of-the-art in this scenario. Please clarify if you are referring to a different setting.\n\nre related work: Thanks a lot for pointing us to the very relevant references.

We kept this part succinct to stay within the page limitation, but will extend it in an updated version.\nJensen-Shannon divergence and Renyi divergence are both based on Kullback-Leibler divergence. Jensen-Shannon divergence is a smoothed, symmetric variant of KL divergence. The Jensen-Shannon divergence between two different probability distributions $P$ and $Q$ can be written as $D_{JS}(P||Q) = 1/2 [D_{KL}(P||M) + D_{KL}(Q||M)]$ where $D_{KL}$ is the KL divergence and $M = 1/2 (P + Q)$, i.e. the average distribution of $P$ and $Q$.\nRenyi divergence similarly generalizes KL divergence by assigning different weights to the probability distributions of the source and target domain. Renyi divergence is defined as: $D_R(P||Q) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha-1} log(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{p_i^\\alpha}{q_i^{\\alpha-1}})$. If $\\alpha=1$, Renyi divergence reduces to KL divergence, i.e. $D_{KL} = \\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \\frac{p_i}{q_i}$. We set $\\alpha=0.99$ as in [1].\nWe utilised these two domain similarity information exemplarily as they have been successfully used in previous research. In particular, Asch and Daelemans [1] compare six different domain similarity measures and find Renyi divergence to yield the best results, while recent work [2] employs Jensen-Shannon divergence.\nThese domain similarity measures are typically based on the term distributions of the source and target domains, i.e. the probability distribution $P$ of a domain is the term distribution $t \\in \\mathcal{R}^{|V| \\times 1}$ where $t_i$ is the relative probability of word $w_i$ appearing in the domain and $|V|$ is the size of the vocabulary of the domain. The intuition behind using term distributions is that similar domains usually have more terms in common than dissimilar domains.\nAs term distributions only capture shallow occurrence statistics, we reasoned that using hidden representations that capture semantic meaning as the foundation for a domain similarity measure might yield better results. For this reason, we use Maximum Mean Discrepany (MMD), which measures the distance between a source and target distribution with respect to a particular representation $\\phi$. We can define MMD between the source data $X_S$ and the target data $X_T$ as follows: $MMD(X_S, X_T) = \\| \\frac{1}{ |X_S| } \\sum\\_{x_S \\in X_S} \\phi(x_S) - \\frac{1}{ |X_T| } \\sum\\_{x_T \\in X_T} \\phi(x_T) \\| $.\nThe representation $\\phi$ is usually obtained by embedding the source data and target data in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space via a specifically chosen kernel. We could have done this and used e.g. a linear combination of RBF kernels as in [3], but we were interested in how well the learned representation of our teacher is able to capture difference in domain. For this reason, we follow [4] and use a hidden representation of the neural network as basis for $\\phi$, in our case the hidden representation of the teacher model.\nIn our experiments, MMD based on deep representations does not outperform the more traditional term distribution-based domain similarity measure. We attribute this to two reasons: 1) Due to the limited amount of data, our teacher model might not be deep enough to capture the difference in domain in its single hidden layer; compare this to [4], where the authors identify the fully-connected layer fc7 in the AlexNet architecture as the layer minimizing MMD; 2) In contrast to other deep learning-based approaches, our teacher is only trained on the source domain data. Its representation is thus not sensitive to detect the domain shift to the target domain.\nTo mitigate this, we could have trained a separate network that minimizes MMD between source and target domain and used its representation for measuring domain similarity. However, this would have incurred additional computational costs compared to the easy-to-compute term distribution-based domain similarity measures and -- more importantly -- would have required training on the source data during adaptation, which we set out to avoid to enable efficient adaptation. We intend to explore the utility of deep representations for measuring domain similarity more thoroughly in subsequent work.\nFor similar reasons, we decided to follow earlier work in foregoing the use of A-distance as a measure of domain similarity. Ben-David et al. [7] show that computing the A-distance between two domains reduces to minimizing the empirical risk of a classifier that tries to discriminate between the examples in those domains. Previous work [6] uses the Huber loss and a linear classifier for computing the A-distance. We initially tried using A-distance as a domain similarity measure but found that it didn't outperform Jensen-Shannon divergence. Furthermore, its reliance on training a classifier is a downside in our scenario with multiple and/or changing target domains, where we would prefer more efficient measures of domain similarity.\nWe hope these insights were helpful. They will be added to the updated version. Please let us know if you have any further/follow-up questions.\n\n[1] Van Asch, V., & Daelemans, W. (2010).

Previous Deep Learning-based approaches to domain adaptation need to be trained jointly on source and target domain data and are therefore unappealing in scenarios where models need to be adapted to a large number of domains or where a domain is evolving, e.g. spam detection where attackers continuously change their tactics.\n\nTo fill this gap, we propose Knowledge Adaptation, an extension of Knowledge Distillation (Bucilua et al., 2006; Hinton et al., 2015) to the domain adaptation scenario. We show how a student model achieves state-of-the-art results on unsupervised domain adaptation from multiple sources on a standard sentiment analysis benchmark by taking into account the domain-specific expertise of multiple teachers and the similarities between their domains.\n\nWhen learning from a single teacher, using domain similarity to gauge trustworthiness is inadequate.
