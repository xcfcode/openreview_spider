We have run a significant amount of additional experiments and our proposed method demonstrates a consistent improvement over the baseline method. We agree that comparing with other defense methods would improve the experiment section, but we think that the performance comparison with Madry et al. (2017) is the most important for this work. Our feature prioritization and regularization techniques are used as an improvement over the baseline adversarial training approach. Adversarial training with PGD adversary is the state of art method which is validated in various papers and shows superior performance over other defense methods. Since we show that our methods work better than Madry et al. (2017) in various settings, the advantages transfer to other defense models.\n\n2. With the results from extended experiments, we summarize the two contributions as follows: feature regularization significantly improves the white box robustness at the cost of a decline in standard accuracy, and a slight decline in black box accuracy; Attention improves both the white box and black box robustness, and at the same time also increases standard accuracy of a model.\n\n3. The gradient maps are direct indicators on how the input features are utilized by a model to produce a final prediction. A large magnitude of the gradient on an input feature signifies a heavy dependence the model has. Human vision is robust against small input perturbations and the perception of an image reflects which input features contribute to the vision robustness. At the same time, the gradient maps of a model also highlight the input features which affect the loss most strongly, therefore more robust models depend on robust features and will be better aligned with human vision. So the alignment of gradient maps with the image can be used to evaluate the robustness a model. Next, the purpose of classifying gradient maps is to provide a comparable quantitative measure of the relative alignment between the two sets of gradient maps and the original images. A standard neural net extracts relevant features from the inputs and makes predictions based on the features. When a gradient map is highly aligned with the original image, the neural net is able to identify more relevant features and thus the classification accuracy will be higher. We agree that the robustness questions arise regarding the meaningfulness and interpretability of the accuracies, but we think this method works for comparison purposes."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper934/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper934/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper934/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Feature prioritization and regularization improve standard accuracy and adversarial robustness", "abstract": "Adversarial training has been successfully applied to build robust models at a certain cost.

The intuition behind using attention is to effectively assign weights to features depending on their robustness. Robust features are highly correlated with the class labels and invariant to input perturbations. Since the global features are directly used to produce class label prediction, we can use them as a query to assign attention weights. In this way, robust features that have higher correlations with class labels will be assigned larger weights which in turn contribute to the model's robustness. In order to validate this intuition, we conduct an additional experiment in Section 4.3 to examine the relationship between the robustness of a feature and its assigned attention weight. Figure 2 shows that more robust features are actually assigned larger weights by the attention module while the attention weights of non-robust features are small. In such a way, a model with attention has improved robustness.\n\n2. We added the missing citations to our paper. For ALP, we agree that it is similar to our feature regularization approach. However, we argue that feature regularization is more intuitive than ALP. While the logits represent the prediction confidence of a model and pairing the logits prevents a model from being over-confident when making predictions, it's not entirely clear why this would lead to a more robust model. On the other hand, feature regularization motivates a model to learn very similar features for the clean and adversarial inputs. The learned features are invariant to input perturbations thus robust features. From another point of view, a model trained with feature regularization maps clean and adversarial examples from nearby points in the image space to nearby points in the high-dimensional manifold. We updated the related work section. The ImageNet results in ALP paper are still under development. Engstrom et al. (2018) invalidate their claims and the ALP paper was retracted from NIPS 2018 by the authors.\n\nEngstrom, Logan, Andrew Ilyas, and Anish Athalye. \"Evaluating and understanding the robustness of adversarial logit pairing.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1807.10272 (2018).\n\n3. We have run the additional tests against the following adversaries: PGD 20+2, PGD 100+2, PGD 200+2, CW 30+2, CW 100+2 and updated our paper with the corresponding results in Section 4.2, Table 2. The results show that our proposed model is more robust than the baseline model against all adversaries in both white box and black box settings.\n\n4. As suggested by the reviewer, we run the additional experiments with a wider ResNet to test our method. Due to time and resources constraints, we choose a 3-times wide ResNet with [16, 48, 96, 192] filters instead of the 10-times wide network in Madry et al. (2017). We believe experiments using a 3-times wide ResNet is able to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with larger capacity networks and nevertheless, our method is independent of the model size. We present the results for this wide model on CIFAR-10 in Section 4.2, Table 3. From Table 3 we note that our method shows better performances against a wide range of adversaries than the baseline method.\n\n5. We have run the experiments on CIFAR-100 and updated our paper with the corresponding results in Section 4.5, Table 5.

Additionally, the authors claim that by introducing an\nattention model which focuses the model training on more robust\nfeatures they can further improve performance. Some experiments are\nprovided.\n\nFeedback: My main concerns with the paper are:\n\n* The experimental section is fairly thin. There are at this point a\n  large number of defense methods, of which Madry et al. is only one. In\n  light of these, the experimental section should be expanded. The\n  results should ideally be reported with error bars, which would help\n  in gauging significance of the results.\n\n* The differential impact of the two contributions is not entirely\n  clear. The results in Table 1 suggest that implicit denoising can\n  help, yet at the same time, Table 2 suggests that Black-box\n  performance is better if we just use the attention model. Overall,\n  this conflates the contributions unnecessarily and makes it hard to\n  distingish their individual impact.\n\n* The section on gradient maps is not clear. The authors argue that if\n  the gradient map aligns with the image the model depends solely on\n  the robust features. While this may be (somewhat more) intuitive in\n  the context of simple GLMs, it's not clear why it should carry over\n  to DNNs. I think it would help to make these intuitions much more\n  precise. Secondly, even if this were the case, the methodology of\n  using a neural net to classify gradient maps and from this derive a\n  robustness metric raises precisely the kinds of robustness questions\n  that the paper tries to answer. I.e.: how robust is the neural net\n  classifying the gradient images, and how meaningful are it's\n  predictions when gradient maps deviate from \"clean\" images.\n\nOverall, I feel this paper has some potentially interesting ideas, but\nneeds additional work before it is ready for publication.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper934/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Feature prioritization and regularization improve standard accuracy and adversarial robustness", "abstract": "Adversarial training has been successfully applied to build robust models at a certain cost.

Additional experimental results illustrate the power of our model relative to the state of the art methods.", "keywords": ["adversarial robustness", "feature prioritization", "regularization"], "authorids": ["chliu@umd.edu", "joseph@umiacs.umd.edu"], "authors": ["Chihuang Liu", "Joseph JaJa"], "TL;DR": "We propose a model that employs feature prioritization and regularization to improve the adversarial robustness and the standard accuracy.", "pdf": "/pdf/2a81a97d4a42f03de1ea413ffb65e90940e6854a.pdf", "paperhash": "liu|feature_prioritization_and_regularization_improve_standard_accuracy_and_adversarial_robustness", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nliu2019feature,\ntitle={Feature prioritization and regularization improve standard accuracy and adversarial robustness},\nauthor={Chihuang Liu and Joseph JaJa},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryG2Cs09Y7},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper934/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234343470, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "ryG2Cs09Y7", "replyto": "ryG2Cs09Y7", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper934/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335836493, "tmdate": 1552335836493, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper934/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 9}
