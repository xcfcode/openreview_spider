More information on the statistical properties of error exponents can be found in Chapters 12.7-12.9 of the book, Elements of Information Theory (Cover & Thomas 1991).  \n\nAnother major concern is about HGR maximal correlation and the ACE algorithm. We added the definition of the HGR maximal correlation problem in Section 2.2. More background information on HGR as a dependence metric is discussed in Appendix B. The ACE algorithm for solving the HGR problem is listed in appendix B with a brief discussion on its convergence property.   In Section 4.2 (Efficient computation of transferability), we added more details on how to compute the optimal features that maximize H-score with respect to the target task. In particular, we make reference to the soft HGR problem (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08979 and further discussion below), which is theoretically equivalent to the original HGR problem, but without the covariance constraint. The algorithm for the soft HGR problem eliminates the normalization step from the original ACE, so that we can utilize a neural network to learn the optimal features. \n\nFor other questions, we will give individual replies below each review.\n "}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper224/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper224/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper224/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "An Information-Theoretic Metric of Transferability for Task Transfer Learning", "abstract": "An important question in task transfer learning is to determine task transferability, i.e. given a common input domain, estimating to what extent representations learned from a source task can help in learning a target task.

We realized the confusion and explained it with more details in the revised paper (see the latest reply).  \n\nFeature concatenation is a common and efficient way to incorporate information from multiple models, especially in a neural network setting.  From a practical point of view, we assume the feature functions of individual source tasks are already computed (i.e. implemented as frozen encoder layers), before knowing about the target task. When learning the target task, concatenating different source features is the most practical thing to do to avoid information loss, with the drawback of slower speed due to increased feature dimension. Unfortunately, there is no optimality guarantee on such concatenation for a particular task. \n\nTherefore, we defined our high order task transfer learning based on this design. We treat the concatenation of n k-dimensional features as a single kn-dimensional feature f_c, and compute its H-score H(f_c) by its definition.  The transferability is computed as H(f_c)/H(f_opt) where f_opt is the optimal feature obtained by solving the HGR or Soft-HGR problem with dimension kn. This allows us to at least know how effective is feature concatenation on a standardized scale. \n\nRegarding the relationship between H-score and test accuracy in transfer learning, in this work we have not yet considered domain differences between the source and the target tasks. As stated in our definition of task transfer learning, we assume X_S and X_T are drawn from the same distribution P_X, while the joint distributions  P(X_S,Y_S) and P(X_T, Y_T) are different. In the future, we indeed plan to study domain transferability for domain adaptation problems. The reference you mentioned will be a good comparison in that study.

We added more details on the ACE algorithm and its alternative in Appendix B and Section 4.2. In Appendix B, we also presented its sampling complexity.  The only trade-off parameter in ACE is the feature dimension k. A larger k generally extracts more information from the data but also increases computation cost. In practice, we choose the feature dimension based on input dimension and the constraint of computing resources.\n\nThe derivation of (2) can be found in a recent paper \u201cAn Efficient Approach to Informative Feature Extraction\u201d by Wang et al. (See https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08979) This paper shows an alternative formulation to the ACE algorithm for computing the HGR maximal correlation. This new formulation, called soft HGR, is based on a low rank approximation of the DTM matrix B. The optimal solution then leads to Equation (2). \n\nRegarding the relationship between H-score and mutual information, we made some revision in the paper to clarify our statement. Basically, we do not attempt to replace mutual information as the golden standard for measuring the association between two random variables. Instead, we point out some practical advantage of H-score over mutual information, such as its ease of computation. This is especially the case when X is continuous, as in the image classification task. Mutual information is often computed based on binning, which has extra bias due to bin size. Other approaches either require estimating the joint distribution through kernel density estimation or using nearest neighbor approaches (Kraskov et al. 2004). On the other hand, the H-score only needs the estimation of conditional expectations, which requires less samples. And this process only takes about 10 lines of Python code. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper224/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper224/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper224/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "An Information-Theoretic Metric of Transferability for Task Transfer Learning", "abstract": "An important question in task transfer learning is to determine task transferability, i.e. given a common input domain, estimating to what extent representations learned from a source task can help in learning a target task.

This is a timely topic and being able to compute such as metric between tasks upfront would be of great interest.\n\nWhile the motivation and contributions of the paper are clearly stated, a number of questions remain. Central concepts like error exponent or maximal HGR correlation are mentioned in passing. The former is important to understand whether (1) makes sense and the latter is a fundamental quantity for this work. The surprising fact is that HGR is not discussed at all, nor is there any intuition provided of what this quantity represents.\n\nWhile the proposed H-score is attractive when a source task has to be selected, as the denominator of the task transferability itself does not need to be computed, it is not straightforward to compute this quantity in general. The authors suggest to use the alternative conditional expectation (ACE) algorithm in order to optimize (2). ACE is not discussed in any detail (e.g., how accurate is this procedure; what are the choices and/or trade-offs if any?) and (2) is not justified. Overall, I felt section 4.2 was relatively inaccessible, but important as it indicates whether the proposed metric is of any use in practice.\n\nFinally, I did not understand the argument that says the H-score is to be prepared over the mutual information.

Given a feature representation function f, the H-score is defined as the normalized correlation between the output f(X) and the label Y. The transferability is then measured by the ratio of H-score on the target domain and the optimal one. The authors introduced the information-theoretic and statistical meaning of the H-score. Validation of H-score was confirmed by numerical experimenters with image data. \n\n\ncomments:\nApplication of H-score to transfer learning interesting. Numerical experiments using relatively large dataset were convincing to show the validity of the proposed method. The following is some minor comments. \n\n* Some notations and terms in section 2.1 were a bit hard to understand. e.g. what does \"the error exponent corresponding to f(x)\" mean? In particular, \"corresponding to f(x)\" was not clear for me. \n\n* The authors showed some relationship between H-score and error of the statistical test. It would be nice to show a more direct relation between H-score and test accuracy in transfer learning. Typically, the risk in the target domain (T) is bounded above by the risk in the source domain (S) plus some dispersion between T and S as shown in the following paper: \nShen, et al., Wasserstein Distance Guided Representation Learning for Domain Adaptation, AAAI (2018). \n\n* In the higher order transfer of numerical experiments, the concatenated features are employed. Showing a theoretical justification of such a concatenation would be nice. \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper224/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "An Information-Theoretic Metric of Transferability for Task Transfer Learning", "abstract": "An important question in task transfer learning is to determine task transferability, i.e. given a common input domain, estimating to what extent representations learned from a source task can help in learning a target task. Typically, transferability is either measured experimentally or inferred through task relatedness, which is often defined without a clear operational meaning. In this paper, we present a novel metric, H-score, an easily-computable evaluation function that estimates the performance of transferred representations from one task to another in classification problems. Inspired by a principled information theoretic approach, H-score has a direct connection to the asymptotic error probability of the decision function based on the transferred feature. This formulation of transferability can further be used to select a suitable set of source tasks in task transfer learning problems or to devise efficient transfer learning policies. Experiments using both synthetic and real image data show that not only our formulation of transferability is meaningful in practice, but also it can generalize to inference problems beyond classification, such as recognition tasks for 3D indoor-scene understanding.", "keywords": ["transfer learning", "task transfer learning", "H-score", "transferability"], "authorids": ["byjem123@163.com", "tori2011@gmail.com", "shaolun.huang@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn", "linzhang@tsinghua.edu.cn", "zamir@cs.stanford.edu", "guibas@cs.stanford.edu"], "authors": ["Yajie Bao", "Yang Li", "Shao-Lun Huang", "Lin Zhang", "Amir R.
