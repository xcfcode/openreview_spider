In contrast to most machine predictors, we exhibit an impressive ability to generalize to unseen scenarios and reason intelligently in these settings.  One important aspect of this ability is physical intuition(Lake et al., 2016). In this work, we explore the potential of unsupervised learning to find features that promote better generalization to settings outside the supervised training distribution.  Our task is predicting the stability of towers of square blocks. We demonstrate that an unsupervised model, trained to predict future frames of a video sequence of stable and unstable block configurations, can yield features that support extrapolating stability prediction to blocks configurations outside the training set distribution", "pdf": "/pdf/7ddaf1990fb801d067609d8ebaef438e0d400529.pdf", "TL;DR": "Using generated data from a next frame predictor model to make a supervised model generalize better to unseen distributions.
