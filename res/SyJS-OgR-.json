This is a very well written paper, the authors propose a method for speeding up the training time of Residual Networks based on the dynamical system view interpretation of ResNets. In general I have a positive opinion about the paper, however, I\u2019d like to ask for some clarifications.\n\nI\u2019m not fully convinced by the interpretation of Eq. 5: \u201c\u2026 d is inversely proportional to the norm of the residual modules G(Yj)\u201d. Since F(Yj) is not a constant, I think that d is inversely proportional to ||G(Yj)||/||F(Yj)||, however, in the interpretation the dependence on ||F(Yj)|| is ignored. Could the authors comment on that?\n\nSection 4. 1 \u201c Each cycle itself can be regarded as a training process, thus we need to reset the learning rate value at the beginning of each training cycle and anneal the learning rate during that cycle.\u201d Is there any empirical evidence for this? What would happen if the learning rate is not reset at the beginning of each cycle? \n\nQuestions with respect to dynamical systems point of view: Eq. 4 assumes small value of h. However, for ResNet there is no guarantee that the h would be small (e. g. in Appendix C the values between 0.25 and 1 are used). Would the authors be willing to comment on the importance of the value of h? In figure 1, pooling (strided convolutions) are not depicted between network stages. I have one question w.r.t. feature maps dimensionality changes inside a CNN: how does pooling (or strided convolution) fit into dynamical systems view?\n\nTable 3 and 4. I assume that the training time unit is a minute, I couldn\u2019t find this information in the paper. Is the batch size the same for all models (100 for CIFAR and 32 for STL-10)? I understand that the models with different #Blocks have different capacity, for clarity, would it be possible to add # of parameters to each model? For multilevel method, would it be possible to show intermediate results in Table 3 and 4, e. g. at the end of cycle 1 and 2?

The authors relate this idea to a recent dynamical systems view of ResNets in which residual blocks are viewed as taking steps in an Euler discretization of a certain differential equation.  This interpretation plays a role in the proposed training method by informing how the \u201cstep sizes\u201d in the Euler discretization should change when doubling the depth of the network.  The punchline of the paper is that the authors are able to achieve similar performance as \u201cfull ResNet training\u201d but with significantly reduced training time.\n\nOverall, the proposed method is novel \u2014 even though this idea of going from shallow to deep is natural for residual networks, tying the idea to the dynamical systems perspective is elegant.  Moreover the paper is clearly written.  Experimental results are decent \u2014 there are clear speedups to be had based on the authors' experiments.  However it is unclear if these gains in training speed are significant enough for people to flock to using this (more complicated) method of training.\n\nI only have a few small questions/comments:\n* A more naive way to do multi-level training would be to again iteratively double the depth, but perhaps not halve the step size.  This might be a good baseline to compare against to demonstrate the value of the dynamical systems viewpoint.\n* One thing I\u2019m unclear on is how convergence was assessed\u2026 my understanding is that the training proceeds for a fixed number of epochs (?) - but shouldn\u2019t this also depend on the depth in some way? \n* Would the speedups be more dramatic for a larger dataset like Imagenet?\n* Finally, not being very familiar with multigrid methods from the numerical methods literature \u2014 I would have liked to hear about whether there are deeper connections to these methods.\n\n\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-level Residual Networks from Dynamical Systems View", "abstract": "Deep residual networks (ResNets) and their variants are widely used in many computer vision applications and natural language processing tasks.

Section 3.2 and Appendix C validate this interpretation empirically. In practice, the step size h will be absorbed by the convolution kernels over the course of normal backpropagation if it is not properly halved during multi-level training.\n\n(2) Yes, we used a fixed number of epochs for different models. You are right that technically the training steps should be dependent on the depth in some way. However, in the literature, researchers commonly use fixed number of epochs to compare models with varying depths or size. For example in [1], training terminates at 64k iterations on CIFAR-10 for all models with number of layers ranging from 20 to 1202.\n\n(3) We are currently working on the experiments of ImageNet, and we are trying our best to include the results in the final version.\n\n(4) Our methods are closely linked to grid continuation techniques. These techniques are commonly used in optimal control problems in the context of fluid flow and path planning. The basic idea is to use the continuous underlying structure (the pde or ode) in order to gradually discretize the problem on a increasingly finer mesh.
