The reason we did not do that in the first version is that our main focus was the formulation of an optimisation problem that unifies some existing saliency methods. We thus expect our method to be more amenable to interpretation and analysis, but not to give better scores in existing saliency metrics.\n\n> it would be also important to emphasise the novelty\n\nOur main point is not to provide a new saliency method, but rather to give a rigorous ground, and to unify, some of the existing saliency methods. By doing that, we indeed also propose a new saliency method. We argue that this method is easier to diagnose and interpret, due to its geometrical interpretation. The existing saliency method we cite in the related work section can be seen as approximate solutions to the optimisation problem we formulate.\n\n> It is also said in the paper: \"We performed a small, non-rigorous statistical study [...]\n\nWe will add some details on that in the appendix.\n  \n  \n> In a light of the following description and the given details of the optimisation method [...] How do we know that the proposed artificial saturation could be generalised to other samples of data, beyond the use cases?\n\nThe artificial saturation will work in all other use cases where the input to the classifier is any tensor (images, sound, text with word embedding, etc.).\n\nYou are right about the theoretical justifications of the artificial saturation algorithm, they are missing and we have now added some clarifications in the paper. In short: first, towards the end of the optimisation, the influence of the artificial saturation becomes negligible; second, in the beginning, it speeds up the training: the effect is similar to an increased learning rate, but without the undesirable effect dealing with projections of gradients which are too big. \n\n\n> Would It still work if we use something different from [Inception pretrained on ImageNet]?\n\nWe can't see any reason why it should not work in other contexts, so our method should work regardless of the network or dataset. We will provide such examples in the revision.\n\n> Is it possible to add a comparison with other methods, e.g. Fong&Vedaldi[1] which is mentioned throughout the text as a closely related method?\n\nYes, we are going to submit such a study in the revision.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3375/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3375/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Ablation Path Saliency", "authorids": ["~Olivier_Verdier1", "~Justus_Sagem\u00fcller1"], "authors": ["Olivier Verdier", "Justus Sagem\u00fcller"], "keywords": ["image classification", "interpretability", "feature attribution", "saliency", "ablation"], "abstract": "We consider the saliency problem for black-box classification.

First, our method actually works well with neutral baselines, for instance with blurred baselines. However, in the rare cases where the results are not as expected, we found it easier to diagnose the problem when the baseline is another image. The reason is that blurred images, or other such neutral baselines are in fact not neutral from the  network's point of view: these neutral images will be classified in some arbitrary class, with some corresponding, rather arbitrary, saliency. We are working on a multi-baseline method which would make the method baseline independent on average.

The idea has certain novelty, but the reviewer cannot see that it is backed by the evidence. The following comments are describing the reasons for the current paper rating and must be addressed for the rating to be improved:\n1. The main concern of the reviewer about the paper is the lack of experimental evidence: it only provides the results for use cases and no quantitative assessment over the larger dataset.  For example, Fong&Vedaldi [1] assessed the method of 50K ImageNet validation images. As far as the reviewer can see, there is no qualitative assessment on a sufficient number of samples which would prove the efficiency and compare the method against the alternatives. This concern is critical for the given score of the paper.  \n2. Besides of that, it would be also important to emphasise the novelty: why do we need to have another saliency method, does it give any new insights other than the existing ones mentioned in the related work section? \n3. It is also said in the paper: \"We performed a small, non-rigorous statistical study suggesting that scores > 0.9 are p < 0.01 significant against a null hypothesis of smoothly random masks, and extremely unlikely with pixelwise-random masks.\u201d It would be beneficial to see some further details of it as it could improve the analysis\n4. In a light of the following description and the  given details of the optimisation method : \u201cSince the optimisation problem is constrained (since \u03c6 is constrained by the requirements in Definition 3.1), following the gradient direction will lead us to violate the constraints. Since the constraints are convex, it is straightforward enough to project each gradient-updated version back to something that does fulfill them, and indeed that is the idea behind our algorithm, however in practice it does by itself not yield convergence without impractically many iterations\u201d it is not clear, what the theoretical justification of it is. How do we know that the proposed artificial saturation could be generalised to other samples of data, beyond the use cases? \n5. Further to that, the paper claims black box optimisation approach but the tests have only been reported for  Inception v4 pretrained on ImageNet. Would It still work if we use something different from it? \n6. In a few qualitative examples given, the method is compared only to Integrated gradients. Is it possible to add a comparison with other methods,  e.g. Fong&Vedaldi[1] which is mentioned throughout the text as a closely related method?\n \n[1] Fong&Vedaldi (2018) Interpretable Explanations of Black Boxes by Meaningful Perturbation", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3375/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3375/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Ablation Path Saliency", "authorids": ["~Olivier_Verdier1", "~Justus_Sagem\u00fcller1"], "authors": ["Olivier Verdier", "Justus Sagem\u00fcller"], "keywords": ["image classification", "interpretability", "feature attribution", "saliency", "ablation"], "abstract": "We consider the saliency problem for black-box classification.

Authors propose to find an optimal ablation path between two images to get such saliency maps. The finding in this paper suggest a new view based on ablation path optimization. Several examples are presented to show the behavior of the proposed method for one image classification model.  \n\nPro:\n+ Treating the saliency problem as finding an optimal ablation path between two images is interesting. Formulating the saliency problem as an optimization problem on paths is a kind of new. \n+ Reasonable results can be obtained on several example images to show the decision of the model.\n\nConcerns:\n- The proposed ablation path saliency method requires the existence of example pairs, which limits the application of the method. It seems cannot handle the case if we are only interested in the saliency map for one single image without any support images (baseline image). \n- It is also not clear how to select baseline images from a large image dataset (e.g. ImageNet) to get the optimal saliency map for one target image.\n- There is a lack of quantitative evaluations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Only showing several examples based on fixed image pairs is not that convincing. Why not follow some existing evaluation tools to conduct quantitative evaluations and compare with existing saliency methods? Evaluations could be Pointing Game or weakly-supervised localization/segmentation as in Grad-CAM (Selvaraju et al. 2016) as well as the sensitivity-n property proposed in (Ancona et al. 2017).\n- Only examples for image classification models are presented.
