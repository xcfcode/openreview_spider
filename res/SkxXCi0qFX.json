For a subset of the environments we have results have results for LCV-TRPO. While LVC-TRPO seems to be better in in the FwdBack environments, it performs slightly worse than MAML-TRPO in the AntRandDir environment. \nFrom a mathematical standpoint, MAML is more biased than LVC, because the H_1 RL-hessian term is missing in MAML when compared to the hessian estimates of LCV. We believe that one the following may explain the findings.\n\nHypothesis 1: Since MAML doesn\u2019t do any pre-adaptation credit assignment, i.e. the \\nabla J_pre term is 0, the MAML meta-gradients are easier to estimate and might exhibit less variance. In meta-environments where task identification is trivial, pre-adaptation credit assignment plays a minor role and the higher variance of LVC might make it less sample-efficient compared to MAML. However, this hypothesis can hardly explain fact that LCV consistently outperforms MAML with VPG as outer optimizer.\n\nHypothesis 2: As the monotonic policy improvement theory theory suggest, we must 1) account for changes in the pre-update action distribution and 2) bound changes in the pre-update state visitation distribution. Based on this, TRPO makes the maximally large step while fulfilling these conditions / constraints. However, as we point out in section 6, in Meta-RL, we have to fulfill the conditions for both the pre-adaptation and post-adaptation policy. If we just use TRPO as the outer optimizer, it will just fulfill 1) and 2) for the post-adaptation policy. As a result, the step and direction may be too large in order to suffice the conditions for the pre-adaptation policy. Since MAML ignores the pre-adaptation sampling distribution anyway, this would not be too problematic for MAML. But in case of LVC, this might hurt performance and outwage the benefits of LVC.\n\nIn environments where task-identification is non-trivial (i.e. when we have non-dense rewards) such as in Fig. 5, pre-adaptation credit assignment plays a major role. In such environments, the average performance of MAML is far behind LVC. In general, the Meta-RL benchmarks we have right now in Fig. 3 are still pretty naive. It would be nice to see some more results in this direction with harder Meta-RL tasks etc. Please let us know if you have any experiment results in this direction and what you think about the hypotheses. As we have a proper way of interpreting the LCV-TRPO results, we are happy to include corresponding results in the paper. Thanks a lot for your support.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper882/Authors"], "readers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper882/Authors", "everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper882/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper882/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ProMP: Proximal Meta-Policy Search", "abstract": "Credit assignment in Meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) is still poorly understood.

The reason ProMP has a better performance is probably because of the advantage of PPO over TRPO.\n\nI know you reported VPG based comparison, but VPG is well know for its instability, thus not a good testbed here.\nEven if so, it's hard to see LVC+VPG is better than MAML+VPG.\n\nI suggest you to report TRPO based results if you did experiments on it.

Then we average over all sampled tasks, trajectories and seeds.\n\nRegarding meta-testing, gradient-based meta-learning methods just provide guarantees of adaptation after one gradient step (or a few if you meta-trained for it). This is exactly what we measure our our benchmarks on throughout the meta-training process. Nevertheless, we agree that it is important and interesting to evaluate how the method performs after more than one adaptation step is performed, and how it behaves in out-of-distribution tasks. These results will be added in the camera ready, and we can clarify any questions regarding these experiments.\n\nThe FwdBackw environments have been used as benchmark for meta-learning papers [1, 2]. To ensure that the reader is familiar with at least some of the meta-environments, we included the in our benchmarks. The task distribution in the FwdBackw environments just has two tasks in its support, the tasks drawn during meta-training and meta-testing are identical. We fully agree, this is far away from optimal for evaluating the meta-generalization capabilities of the algorithms. Hence, we can only draw conclusions w.r.t. the meta-training performance in case of the FwdBackw environments. Finally, we emphasize the importance of better meta-RL benchmark environments and would highly welcome any work in this direction.\n\n[1] Chelsea Finn, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine.

We have added some further explanations in section 5 to further clarify this. \nOverall, here is a legend for what each name refers to: :\nMAML: no pre-adaptation credit assignment, i.e.  \\nabla J = \\nabla J_post, i.e. how MAML was implemented for the original MAML paper (but this actually doesn\u2019t follow the math correctly)\nE-MAML: naive pre-adaptation credit assignment as in Eq. 3\nDiCE: (unbiased but high variance) credit assignment as in Eq. 4\nLVC: (slightly biased but low variance) credit assignment as in Eq. 4\nProMP: our final method (described in section 6)\n\nWith the nomenclature clarified, let us highlight how our experiments showcase the difference w.r.t the credit assignment.\n\nFirst, we have added a plot showing the effect of each formulation when the same optimizer is used (see Figure 3). We performed this experiment as an ablation study in order eliminate possible influences of the outer optimizer, i.e. PPO and TRPO. These results consistently show the superior performance of the low variance version of Eq. 4 (LVC-VPG) when compared with Eq. 3 (E-MAML-VPG). Due to the high variance nature of Eq. 4 (DiCE-VPG) its performance saturates below the other formulations. This effect is discussed in section 7.2.\n\nSecond, the experiment in Fig. 5 illustrates the differences w.r.t. the meta-learned pre-adaptation policy behavior. Since MAML does not assign any credit to the pre-adaptation policy, it fails so solve the task. Though, E-MAML (Eq. 3) is able to solve the task, it does not learn an effective task identification policy since it can only assign credit to batches of pre-adaptation trajectories. In contrast, LVC (Eq. 4) can assign credit to individual pre-adaptation trajectories which is reflected by its superior task identification behavior.\n\nThird, the fact that the results of MAML and E-MAML in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 are comparable underpins the ineffectiveness of the naive credit assignment: there is little difference between zero pre-adaptation credit assignment and the credit assignment of E-MAML (discussed in section 4).\n\nFinally, the experiment in Fig. 6 depicts computed gradients and convergence properties corresponding to Eq. 3 and Eq. 4 in a simple toy environment. Once more, this experiment shows the advantage of formulation I over formulation II. \n\nWe have clarified this in the experiment sections of the paper, and will be happy to add further \nclarifications if the reviewer requests it."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper882/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper882/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper882/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ProMP: Proximal Meta-Policy Search", "abstract": "Credit assignment in Meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) is still poorly understood.

By comparing the differences in the gradients of these two algorithms, the authors demonstrate the advantages of the original MAML in taking the casual dependence into account. To obtain the correct estimation of the gradient through auto-differentiation, the authors exploit the DiCE formulation. Considering the variance in the DiCE objective formulation, the authors finally propose an objective which leads to low-variance but biased gradient. The authors verify the proposed methods in meta-RL tasks and achieves comparable performances to MAML and E-MAML. \n\n\nAlthough the ultimate algorithm proposed by this paper is not far away from MAML and E-MAML, they did a quite good job in clarify the differences in the existing variants of MAML from the gradient computation perspective and reveal the potential error due to the auto-differentiation. The proposed new objective and the surrogate is well-motivated from such observation and the trade-off between variance and bias. \n\n\nMy major concern is how big the effect is if we use (3) comparing to (4) in calculate the gradient. As the authors showed, the only difference between (3) and (4) is the weights in front of the term \\nabla_\\theta\\log\\pi_\\theta: the E-MAML is a fixed weight and the MAML is using a adaptive through the inner product. Whether the final difference in Figure 4 between MAML and E-MAML is all caused by such difference in gradient estimation is not clearly. In fact, based on the other large-scale high-dimension empirical experiments in Figure 2, it seems the difference in gradient estimator (3) and (4) does not induced too much difference in final performances between MAML and E-MAML. Based on such observation, I was wondering the consistent better performance of the proposed algorithm might not because the corrected gradient computation from the proposed objective. It might because the clip operation or other components in the algorithm. To make a more convincing argument, it will be better if the authors can evaluate different gradient within the same updates.\n\nI am willing to raise my score if the author can address the question. \n\nminor:\n\nThe gradients calculation in Eq (2) and (3) are not consistent with the Algorithm and the appendix.\n\nThe notation is not consistent with common usage: \\nabla^2 is actually used for denoting the Laplace operator, i.e., \\nabla^2 = \\nabla \\cdot \\nable, which is a scalar.

The author also compared with unbiased higher order gradient estimation method-DiCE in terms of gradient variance and average return. \n\nThe work is essentially important due to the need for second-order gradient estimation for meta-learning (Finn et al., 2017) and other related work such as multi-agent RL. The results look promising and the method is easy to implement.

It is necessary to examine the MSE, Bias, Variance of the gradient estimatorsquantitatively  for the proposed and related baseline methods (including MAML, E-MAML-TRPO, LVC-VPG, etc). If the bias is not a big issue empirically, the proposed method is good to use in practice.\n\n2)  The author should add DiCE in the benchmark in section 7.1, which will verify its advantage over DiCE thoroughly.\n\nOverall this is a good paper and I vote for acceptance.\n\n\nFinn, Chelsea, et al. \"Model-agnostic meta-learning for fast adaptation of deep networks.\" ICML 2017.\n\nFoerster, Jakob, et al. \"DiCE: The Infinitely Differentiable Monte-Carlo Estimator.\" ICML 2018.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper882/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ProMP: Proximal Meta-Policy Search", "abstract": "Credit assignment in Meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) is still poorly understood.

The results show different exploration patterns used by different method and is quite aligned with the theory.  \nCons:\n- It would be nice to add more comparison and analysis on the variance. Since LVC is claimed to reduce variance of the gradient, it would be nice to show more empirical evidences that supports this.

In order to estimate the variance of the meta-policy gradients, we must compute the meta-policy gradients across many batches of tasks and trajectories. Computing the data for the plot takes 10 - 20 time (and compute expenses) than running DiCE MAML or LVC normally.\nSince the performance gap between DiCE and LVC is so substantial we were confident that one plot suffices to convince the readers of this arguments, which is also backed by the theoretical elaborations.\n\nWe suspect that the increasing variance for LVC is mainly due to the fact that the meta-policy search steers the policy faster towards a parameter configuration where the trace of the Fisher Information Matrix is large, i.e. a small change in parameters causes a large change in the policy distribution which allows good adaptation. However, in regions where the policy distribution is more sensible the parameters, monte-carlo gradient estimates naturally exhibit a larger variance. Throughout the meta-training we observe that the KL-divergence between pre- and pos-update policy grows, indicating increasing adaptability of the policy.  For tasks such as HalfCheetahRandomDirection a high adaptability of the policy is necessary to be able to shift the policy distribution with one gradient step between running forward and backward. In conclusion, our intuition is that the faster increase in meta-gradient variance in case of LVC is mainly due to the fact that LVC learns faster. When you look at the plots, there seems to be a positive correlation between the slope of learning curve and the meta-gradient variance increase. \n\nWe also got in contact with the authors of the DiCE paper which told us that they\u2019d have the same problems with the high variance of the DiCE gradients. \nIn our experiments with DiCE-MAML we observed that it performs substantially worse than LVC across different environments. All in all, we a highly confident that the LVC leads to superior performance over DiCE.
