The authors argue that MRT doesn't optimize the expected reward. Moreover, they show that using REINFORCE, with either realistic or dummy constant rewards, may lead to a peakier distribution. Similar BLEU scores are obtained with either type of rewards, which is an interesting and perplexing result (in my opinion). For both REINFORCE and MRT, the paper shows that unless the gold token was already amongst the most probable after pre-training, it takes many samples for it to become the most likely output, which limits the usefulness of on-policy RL approaches.\n\nI lean slightly towards rejection because the scope of the paper is somewhat too limited. The experimental section mostly covers REINFORCE without a baseline (except for validation in section 4.2, but no results are shown varying the baseline), as well as MRT in a restricted scenario. However, the analysis may still be beneficial to the community.\n\nEstablishing that minimum risk training doesn't optimize the expected reward is a valuable observation. Can the optimized and expected rewards be arbitrarily far?\n\nThe experiments demonstrating the sample inefficiency of REINFORCE (without baseline) and MRT when the best tokens have low initial probability (relative to other tokens) raise important questions about the effectiveness of these approaches.\n\nThe analysis of REINFORCE assumes non-negative rewards, which likely contributes to the peakiness effect (PKE). I would assume the peakiness effect to be mostly neutral with normalized rewards, or diminish with negative rewards (on average). It is unclear how different baselines would affect the results.\n\nFor MRT, only synthetic experiments are run. Given that the peakiness effect is much weaker than for REINFORCE, it would be useful to know results (BLEU) on the same MT task.\n\nOther questions and remarks:\n\nIn appendix A.1, the parameter value is bounded (to maintain a valid probability distribution), which is generally not the case within a neural network. Does this distinction matter?\n\nDo you have the RL learning curves? What could we learn from them?\n\nIt is unclear how much the claims generalize to other methods such as actor-critic (Bahdanau et al. An Actor-Critic Algorithm for Sequence Prediction). \n\nIn appendix A.1, some values are wrong. Do these affect the final result?\nFor example, P({a,c}) should be $2 \\theta (1-\\theta-2 \\theta^2)$.\nFor S={a,c}, \\nabla \\tilde{R} should be $\\frac{1+2 \\theta^2}{2(1-2 \\theta^2)^2}$.\nFor S={b,c} \\nabla \\tilde{R} should be $\\frac{\\theta (\\theta-2)}{(1-\\theta)^2}$.\n\n-----\nUpdate to Review 2\n\nI appreciate that the authors corrected appendix A.1. As a nitpick, for the gradient of the reward of {a, c}, there is a x that should be replaced by \\theta.\n\nWhile the scope of the paper is somewhat limited, the theoretical contributions about MRT are valuable. The experiments would be more convincing with stronger baselines, but the current paper may already generate useful discussions within the community. As such, I updated my score to \"Weak accept\", although I won't fight for acceptance.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper24/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper24/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On the Weaknesses of Reinforcement Learning for Neural Machine Translation", "authors": ["Leshem Choshen", "Lior Fox", "Zohar Aizenbud", "Omri Abend"], "authorids": ["leshem.choshen@mail.huji.ac.il", "lior.fox@mail.huji.ac.il", "zohar.aizenbud@mail.huji.ac.il", "oabend@cs.huji.ac.il"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement learning", "MRT", "minimum risk training", "reinforce", "machine translation", "peakkiness", "generation"], "TL;DR": "Reinforcment practices for machine translation performance gains might not come from better predictions.", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is frequently used to increase performance in text generation tasks,\nincluding machine translation (MT), \nnotably through the use of Minimum Risk Training (MRT) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). \nHowever, little is known about what and how these methods learn in the context of MT. \nWe prove that one of the most common RL methods for MT does not optimize the \nexpected reward, as well as show that other methods take an infeasibly long time to converge.\nIn fact, our results suggest that RL practices in MT are likely to improve performance\nonly where the pre-trained parameters are already close to yielding the correct translation.\nOur findings further suggest that observed gains may be due to effects unrelated to the training signal, concretely, changes in the shape of the distribution curve.", "pdf": "/pdf/05e6f95de9f8eb952e3cbd7f1c21ac9a755cf9d6.pdf", "paperhash": "choshen|on_the_weaknesses_of_reinforcement_learning_for_neural_machine_translation", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nChoshen2020On,\ntitle={On the Weaknesses of Reinforcement Learning for Neural Machine Translation},\nauthor={Leshem Choshen and Lior Fox and Zohar Aizenbud and Omri Abend},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eCw3EKvH}\n}", "full_presentation_video": "", "original_pdf": "/attachment/a0cef5410d8cb5d9ef42d81f4e0cd41f77273d46.pdf", "appendix": "", "poster": "", "spotlight_video": "", "slides": ""}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).

Do you refer to the fact that REINFORCE only estimates a gradient? But so is SGD. The problem with MRT is that following the (stochastic) gradient of \\tilde{R} may converge to a point which is not a stationary point of R, and so cannot be claimed to be maximizing R (unlike REINFORCE, under broad conditions).\n\nOr are you referring to the choice of function approximation? If so, the framing is, of course, a maximum with respect to the available parameter search space. If this is not what you were referring to, could you elaborate a bit more on this?\n\nAs we have mentioned in our response to R2, and as we wrote in the paper, the model\u2019s failing to learn with a baseline surprised us as well and is not the common case. It is not, however, unimaginable. Variance reduction results in less exploration, which we know is needed in this case. This may, or may not be the reason that baseline methods did not improve in any way over the pretrained model. We will make sure to elaborate on this point in the paper.\n\nLastly, regarding which tokens are learnt in the simulation scenario, we can recalculate and count the numbers of changed ones.

A special thanks for noting the mistake in the derivation, we corrected it and it was checked and rechecked, the correction does not affect the main result and conclusion (the corrected version was uploaded).\n\nRegarding the explored settings being limited: our paper was to a large extent meant to address the current practices of applying policy gradient methods in NMT, and the explored settings were selected accordingly. There are certainly other tools in the RL toolbox to handle some of the encountered issues, and part of the claim of this paper is to indeed encourage the community to take a more sophisticated approach to this problem (as we discuss in section 8).\n\nRegarding the relation between the values that MRT and REINFORCE optimize: they can indeed be arbitrarily distant. If we take the example in Appendix A, and now write theta=g(lambda) where g is a smooth function from (-inf,inf) to (0,0.5) where g\u2019(lambda)>0 for all values of lambda. Now assume we optimize for lambda instead. The lambda that optimizes R is just g^{-1}(theta*), but E[\\nabla\\tilde{R}] is positive for (-inf,g^{-1}(gamma)) and negative for (g^{-1}(gamma),inf), and so CMRT will converge to g^{-1}(gamma). For suitable choices of g, g^{-1}(gamma) and gamma(theta*) can be arbitrarily apart. \n\nThe above explanation also addresses your question of whether theta being bounded in our  example makes any difference. The same argument shows that the result still holds for an unbounded parameter range.\n\nWe trained NMT with a constant baseline equal to the pretrained average BLEU score over a random batch from the training set (the average does not differ too much between batches). When training with RL the score began to drop from the first epoch and when the early stopping took place, the original network without any RL training was selected as the best model. This (as you noted, and as we also noted in the paper) was surprising, and we were left to speculate why it was so. Some explanations are discussed in the paper (e.g. that the increased peakiness, coming with positive reward is a crucial part of the observed improvement, and not the reward function; see section 7, 2nd paragraph), and some are more standard conclusions (sometimes variance is a desired feature for exploration, perhaps also here). Other reasons, if exist, are left for future investigation. To conclude, other baselines (including actor-critic which may be seen as a baseline generalization) might perform better, but reducing the variance does not seem like a crucial drawback of this investigation.\n\nWe don\u2019t have the learning curves of the MT experiments, only the per-iteration scores, and these do not seem to be enlightening in any way. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper24/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper24/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On the Weaknesses of Reinforcement Learning for Neural Machine Translation", "authors": ["Leshem Choshen", "Lior Fox", "Zohar Aizenbud", "Omri Abend"], "authorids": ["leshem.choshen@mail.huji.ac.il", "lior.fox@mail.huji.ac.il", "zohar.aizenbud@mail.huji.ac.il", "oabend@cs.huji.ac.il"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement learning", "MRT", "minimum risk training", "reinforce", "machine translation", "peakkiness", "generation"], "TL;DR": "Reinforcment practices for machine translation performance gains might not come from better predictions.", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is frequently used to increase performance in text generation tasks,\nincluding machine translation (MT), \nnotably through the use of Minimum Risk Training (MRT) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). \nHowever, little is known about what and how these methods learn in the context of MT. \nWe prove that one of the most common RL methods for MT does not optimize the \nexpected reward, as well as show that other methods take an infeasibly long time to converge.\nIn fact, our results suggest that RL practices in MT are likely to improve performance\nonly where the pre-trained parameters are already close to yielding the correct translation.\nOur findings further suggest that observed gains may be due to effects unrelated to the training signal, concretely, changes in the shape of the distribution curve.", "pdf": "/pdf/05e6f95de9f8eb952e3cbd7f1c21ac9a755cf9d6.pdf", "paperhash": "choshen|on_the_weaknesses_of_reinforcement_learning_for_neural_machine_translation", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nChoshen2020On,\ntitle={On the Weaknesses of Reinforcement Learning for Neural Machine Translation},\nauthor={Leshem Choshen and Lior Fox and Zohar Aizenbud and Omri Abend},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eCw3EKvH}\n}", "full_presentation_video": "", "original_pdf": "/attachment/a0cef5410d8cb5d9ef42d81f4e0cd41f77273d46.pdf", "appendix": "", "poster": "", "spotlight_video": "", "slides": ""}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"required": true, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).

The paper then empirically demonstrates that the REINFORCE algorithm, while not subject to the same theoretical flaws as CMRT, in practice fails to improve NMT models unless the baseline model is already \"nearly correct\" (i.e. the correct tokens were already within the few most probable tokens before the fine-tuning steps with REINFORCE). In fact, some of the performance gains of using REINFORCE/CMRT can be attributed to making the model's output probability distribution more peaked, and not necessarily from making the target tokens more probable as commonly assumed.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent paper that offers significant contributions for the field. I have summarised the key strengths of the paper below, along with several suggestions and questions that I hope will be addressed by the authors. Based on my assessment, I am recommending a rating of \"Accept\" for this paper.\n\nStrengths:\n1. The paper is very well-written and well-structured. It starts off by pointing out the theoretical limitations of CMRT (and concisely recaps the key differences between CMRT and REINFORCE), and continues with an extensive set of experiments that clearly illustrates the limitations of REINFORCE in practice. \n\n2. I also like the use of both controlled simulations (including one where the reward is constant) and NMT experiments with real data. The controlled simulations are useful to abstract away from the full complexity of the model and investigate what happens under various control scenarios, while the NMT experiments demonstrate that the findings still hold under the realistic setup.\n\n3. The findings are really interesting and clearly illustrate the limitations of existing REINFORCE/CMRT methods for neural sequence-to-sequence models. It is very interesting to see that REINFORCE fails to make the target token most probable when the initial model ranks the target token as the third or more probable tokens under the model (Figure 2), even under the simple controlled simulations, which highlights the prohibitively high sample complexity of the model. \n\n4. The peakiness effect hypothesis (i.e. attributing the gains of REINFORCE to making the output distribution more peaked, and not necessarily by making the target tokens more probable) is well-supported by the paper's empirical evidence. It is really illuminating that using a constant reward of 1 leads to the same BLEU score as actually optimising for BLEU in NMT (Section 5.2).\n\nSuggestions and questions:\n1. Section 4.2 (NMT Experiments) indicates that REINFORCE fine-tuning is done for 10 epochs, with 5,000 sentences per epoch, and k=1. Considering the enormous discrete sample space, one could expect that using multi-sample REINFORCE (i.e. k > 1) and training the model for many more epochs might mitigate the identified problems to some extent, and thus change the findings. Training for 5,000 sentences * 10 epochs may just not be enough for the RL fine-tuning to make a big difference.\n\n2. In Figure 1, the x-axis is the \"Update Size\" with a scale between -1.0 and 1.0. This \"Update Size\" variable is not really explained in the paper, and why the scale is between -1.0 and 1.0.\n\n3. In my understanding, the controlled simulations (Section 4.1) is done at the word-level (including word-level rewards, as opposed to the NMT experiments which are done at the sequence-level with sentence-level rewards). If this is the case, this should be made clearer.\n\n4. To make Figure 3 easier to understand, the caption should indicate that a lower cumulative percentage means a more peaked output distribution.\n\n5. Rather than breaking down the analysis by where the target token is ranked by the initial, pre-RL model (e.g. the target token is ranked second/third best in Figures 2 and 5), perhaps what really matters is the probability assigned to the target token. For instance, even if the target token is ranked third best by the initial model, there will be a big difference whether it is assigned a probability of 0.1 or 0.01 (i.e. the latter case is much less likely to be sampled, which would exacerbate the problem). Including this analysis might help strengthen the paper further.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper24/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper24/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On the Weaknesses of Reinforcement Learning for Neural Machine Translation", "authors": ["Leshem Choshen", "Lior Fox", "Zohar Aizenbud", "Omri Abend"], "authorids": ["leshem.choshen@mail.huji.ac.il", "lior.fox@mail.huji.ac.il", "zohar.aizenbud@mail.huji.ac.il", "oabend@cs.huji.ac.il"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement learning", "MRT", "minimum risk training", "reinforce", "machine translation", "peakkiness", "generation"], "TL;DR": "Reinforcment practices for machine translation performance gains might not come from better predictions.", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is frequently used to increase performance in text generation tasks,\nincluding machine translation (MT), \nnotably through the use of Minimum Risk Training (MRT) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). \nHowever, little is known about what and how these methods learn in the context of MT. \nWe prove that one of the most common RL methods for MT does not optimize the \nexpected reward, as well as show that other methods take an infeasibly long time to converge.\nIn fact, our results suggest that RL practices in MT are likely to improve performance\nonly where the pre-trained parameters are already close to yielding the correct translation.\nOur findings further suggest that observed gains may be due to effects unrelated to the training signal, concretely, changes in the shape of the distribution curve.", "pdf": "/pdf/05e6f95de9f8eb952e3cbd7f1c21ac9a755cf9d6.pdf", "paperhash": "choshen|on_the_weaknesses_of_reinforcement_learning_for_neural_machine_translation", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nChoshen2020On,\ntitle={On the Weaknesses of Reinforcement Learning for Neural Machine Translation},\nauthor={Leshem Choshen and Lior Fox and Zohar Aizenbud and Omri Abend},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eCw3EKvH}\n}", "full_presentation_video": "", "original_pdf": "/attachment/a0cef5410d8cb5d9ef42d81f4e0cd41f77273d46.pdf", "appendix": "", "poster": "", "spotlight_video": "", "slides": ""}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
