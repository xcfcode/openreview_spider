The main idea is to split the scale and quantized values. Both scales and weights are updated with backprop and SGD. The paper presents excellent experimental results on ImageNet. \n\nThe paper is generally well written and easy to follow. However, there does exist quite some grammar errors, especially in abstract, which could be improved. \n\nMoreover, I would like the authors to clarify some technical details. Are the scales s, so called step size in the paper, for every weight, every convolutional kernel, or very layer? How do you deal with BatchNorm?\n\nWhat is the main benefits of the proposed quantization method in general? Is it for fast inference, fast training, or just memory compression? Do the authors see the real benefits in practice besides claiming the accuracy does not drop?\n\nI would suggest the authors discuss and compare with XNOR network in detail. The proposed method looks similar. \n\nI am wondering how the baseline methods are tuned. There are quite a few \u201ctricks\u201d like learning rate scheduler and weight decay, which I do consider them as contributions of the paper. But would baseline methods also benefit from more hyper-parameter tuning?\n\nMinor issue, I donot get the explanation of eq (4), and it looks rather unnecessary. It sounds to me starting from a trained network and then train 90 epochs is a rather long time. Could the authors convince me this is a standard setting by providing some reference?\n\n\n================ after rebuttal=========================\nThank the authors for reply. My rating does not change. The proposed does look similar to XNOR, and the only difference seems to be how the scales are updated. Since there is only one scale per layer, I will be quite surprised if the proposed method can be much better than XNOR. Moreover, since BatchNorm is not quantized and it is everywhere in a ResNet-like architecture, it surprises me how much the scale helps. Finally, I am worried about practical benefits towards the authors' claim because the networks are not fully quantized. \n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper824/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper824/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "LEARNED STEP SIZE QUANTIZATION", "authors": ["Steven K.

We also expect that as the number of quantized states increases, the step size itself should decrease, so that the data can be quantized more finely (captured by \"1/sqrt(Q)\").  The particular heuristic we chose worked well in practice to give a reasonably good initial quantization that could then be further improved through training.\n\n\nQuestion 2:\nKnowledge distillation for quantized networks is certainly an interesting area for research, but we didn't want to expand the focus of our manuscript too far beyond the quantizer training method proposed, particularly as Polino et al. and Mishra and Marr already have provided a good overview of knowledge distillation in this domain.  Thus, we chose to show only the simplest knowledge distillation setup we are are aware of, distilling from a full precision teacher to a low precision student network with the same architecture.  This approach offers has the benefit that the same trained high precision network used for weight initialization also serves as our teacher, and thus no additional networks are required, whereas distilling from a larger architecture would require training (or otherwise having access to) an additional network.  However, we have since run an experiment to look at different weights on the distillation loss, and now note in section 3.7: \"we used the distillation loss function of Hinton with temperature of 1 and equal weight given to the standard loss and the distillation loss (we found this gave comparable results to weighting the the distillation loss two times more or less than the standard loss on 2-bit ResNet-18).\"\n\n\nQuestion 3:\nTo show the reduction in model size offered by lower precision models, we have modified Figure 3 to include full precision model sizes.\n\nWe did not measure latency or related performance metrics on actual hardware, as our approach was developed in advance of commercially available inference hardware optimized for low precision operations.  Since algorithms are much cheaper to develop than new hardware, we believe it is the correct first step to demonstrate the ability of deep networks to achieve high accuracy at these extremely low precisions before hardware is created to optimize for these precisions.  As new low precision inference chips become available, we look forward to benchmarking these low precision networks against full precision alternatives.  \n\n\nQuestion 4:\nWhile we have not done so yet due to time constraints, we anticipate evaluating this approach for domains beyond vision as a next step in our research.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper824/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper824/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "LEARNED STEP SIZE QUANTIZATION", "authors": ["Steven K.

If the reviewer points out any specific issues that remain, we will be happy to fix them to improve the manuscript.\n\nThere is one step size for each layer of weights (that is, for each weight tensor) and one step size for each layer of activations.  This is noted in section 2.1 with the line \"each layer of weights and each layer of activations has a distinct step size\".  BatchNorm is handled using full precision operations.  We have updated the text in section 2.3 to clarify this point.\n\nThe proposed method offers 2 main benefits.  First, it allows for a reduction in model size, facilitating the deployment deep networks operating on the edge (for example, in mobile phones).  Second, it points to the value of developing next generation inference hardware optimized for low precision operations to improve throughput and energy efficiency, while reducing latency.  As we also note in our response to Review #2, we believe it is the correct first step to demonstrate the ability of deep networks to achieve high accuracy at these extremely low precisions before inference chips optimized for these precisions is commercially available.  As such hardware becomes available, we look forward to benchmarking these low precision networks against full precision alternatives.  \n\nWe now highlight the importance of XNOR in the introduction by noting it provided the first demonstration of tuned quantization.  XNOR differs from our approach in that the former employs a quantizer tuned based on data statistics, in approach later taken by techniques such as TWN, Dorefa, FAQ, and Half-wave gaussian quantization, while the latter learns the quantization through backpropagation, which is noted in the introduction.\n\nProviding a comparison between various quantization methods using exactly the same weight decay or learning rate schedule is difficult, as there is no standardization across prior papers on settings.  Properly re-implementing and re-running methods from prior papers can be challenging if even trivial details (for example, initial values) are missing from the original publications, and even if done properly, it is possible that different weight decay values or schedulers are optimal for different methods.  However, we have sought to address this as best we can by showing our results at different weight decay values and showing the simple power of 2 search that was employed to find the weight decays chosen (Table 2).  Notably, our approach still out performs the next best method even when using a weight decay of 10^-4, which is fairly standard for a full precision ResNet-18.  We also ran an experiment using a more traditional step-based weight decay (Section 3.5), and found that again our approach still out performs that next best method (with only 90 epochs of fine-tuning, compared to a total of 360 epochs of fine-tuning for the next best method).\n\nIf of interest, Table 3 explores the value of the gradient adjustment derived from Equation 4, and shows that it is important for achieving high accuracy.\n\nRelatively long fine-tuning in the quantized space after initializing from a full precision trained network is fairly common when targeting networks with less than 8-bits of precision, and in fact the 90 epochs we employ is on the short side.  For example  Choi et al. (\"Learning low precision deep neural networks through regularization\") fine-tuned for 100 epochs, McKinstry et al. (\"Discovering low-precision networks close to full- precision networks for efficient embedded inference\") fine-tuned for 110 epochs, Baskin et al. (\"Nice: Noise injection and clamping estimation for neural network quantization\") fine-tuned for 120 epochs, and Jung et al., (\"Joint training of low-precision neural network with quantization interval parameters\") used a progressive quantization approach that amounted to a total of 360 additional epochs of fine-tuning for 2-bit models."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper824/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper824/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "LEARNED STEP SIZE QUANTIZATION", "authors": ["Steven K.

While closer reading makes it clear what is meant is the number of weights per layer, a definition closer to their first usage would be good. This goes in particular for N_W which comes in several versions (N_W, N, nweights).\n\nIn section 3.7, the sentence starting with \u201cWe found that using this approach to distill\u201d does not seem to fit within its context for this reader, as it describes \u201cfull-to-full\u201d distillation. Perhaps it is meant to read \u201clow precision student network\u201d?"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper824/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper824/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "LEARNED STEP SIZE QUANTIZATION", "authors": ["Steven K.

Quantization is a useful tool in model compression, and doing it well for very low-precision models (2-3 bit precision specifically), is challenging.\n\nThe main contribution of the paper comes from:\na) Step Size Gradient: They propose a gradient which is sensitive to the distance between the value and the transition point. This is different from other methods which have gradients dependent only on the clip point.\nb) Step Size Gradient Scale: This is an interesting contribution, where they try to match the ratio of average update of the step size \u2018s\u2019 and average magnitude of \u2018s\u2019, with that of the network weights. This leads them to scale the gradient according to the precision and number of parameters. They demonstrate that this scaling actually helps improve the accuracy.\n\nThe results for 8-bit precision are not new. Several results (Quantization and Training of Neural Networks for Efficient\nInteger-Arithmetic-Only Inference, Jacob et al., Quantizing deep convolutional networks for\nefficient inference: A whitepaper, Krishnamoorthi et al.), show 8-bit quantization results where the accuracy matches floating point accuracy, and in some case exceeds it (low precision quantization acting as a regularizer). However, the results for lower precision are impressive.\n\nThere are a few questions:\n1. In sec 2.1, you mention that \u2018each layer of weights and activations has a distinct step size, represented as an fp32 value, initialized to \u2026\u2019. Can you explain the intuition behind the initial value of the step size, and how is it a function of v?\n2. \u2018Model Compression via Distillation and Quantization\u2019 (Polino et al.) shows distillation actually helps significantly improve accuracy. I wonder if the authors have tried different weight combinations for the distillation loss, and using bigger models as teacher models.\n3. I would like to get more details of the inference setup, specifically the size and inference latency improvements over full-precision networks. The practical applicability of low-precision networks, specifically 2-bit and 3-bit networks, equally depends on the inference infrastructure, as it does on the training improvements.\n4. Have you evaluated your method for a non-Vision usecase?\n\nOverall this is a good work, I would tend towards accepting this.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper824/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper824/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "LEARNED STEP SIZE QUANTIZATION", "authors": ["Steven K.
