The purpose of estimating the conditional variance is precisely to get *good estimates of the variance*.  \n\nThe superiority (in this respect) of the predictions of the heteroscedastic models is born out by figures 1 and 2 which show just how strongly the predicted standard deviations correlate with observed errors. \n\nWe realize that some amount of the confusion owes to a bug in our initial reporting. The initial table 1 had a scaling bug in calculating NLL numbers. This reporting bug came to light when we were adding late-breaking results on a gamma predictive distribution.  Thus the original table 1 didn't make it clear just how much the heteroscedastic models improve over their homoscedastic counterparts.\n\nWe've updated the draft with the fixed numbers and it's obvious that the heteroscedastic modeling fits the observed errors dramatically better.\n\nWe also added a line to the results table 1 showing results using a gamma predictive distribution, which slightly outperforms even the best heteroscedastic laplacian regression model. We hope you'll take the chance to re-assess the review.

We'd like to offer the following responses and clarifications:\n\nGood catch that we didn't define \"current method\" in the extended abstract. The current method is the ad-hoc times that are currently entered into the system to reserve the rooms. These are the actual \"human-expert\" times predicted by the surgeons and administrators.\n\nWe'd like to point out that this work is more novel than the reviewer acknowledges. While several papers have proposed neural heteroscedastic regression, we are to our knowledge one of only two papers to revisit the idea in the context of modern deep learning (multiple hidden layers, rectifier activations, dropout regularization). Moreover, our paper is the only one, to our knowledge, to demonstrate the efficacy of neural heteroscedastic regression on a dataset of real-world importance. The other paper only tested the idea on generic UCI dataset and the classic papers address synthetic & toy problems.\n\nWe'd also like to let the reviewer know that we've gone a step further and improved the results by using gamma distributions. These are especially suited to our problem because the distribution of surgery durations can only be long-tailed on only one side (no surgery can take less than 0 minutes). The gamma predictive distribution indeed gives lower NLL than both Gaussian and Laplace. We plan to update the draft with these numbers and the relevant empirical analysis in the next week. \n\n"}, "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Predicting Surgery Duration with  Neural Heteroscedastic Regression", "abstract": "Scheduling surgeries is a challenging task due to the fundamental uncertainty of the clinical environment, as well as the risks and costs associated with under- and over-booking.
