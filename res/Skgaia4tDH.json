It is not easy to understand the linkage between a task and a neighbourhood being advocated without re-reading the paper for a few times.\n\nAlthough the idea of \u200b\u200bexecuting MAML by considering each neighborhood as a task is an original part of this study, there was not enough explanation, as you pointed out. We will reconstruct the introduction to make this part much more clear.\n\nMoreover, we introduced LLE in Sect. 2.1 to describe the interpretation that our Local VAE with Gaussian decoder can be regarded as an extension of the LLE as we discussed in p.4, last paragraph. It will help to find how our proposed model relates to the conventional local learning approach. On the other hand, multiple concepts make the manuscript hard to follow. We would like to move the Sect. 2.1 before the Sect. 4 or to the Appendix.\n\n> The introduction section should be carefully rewritten to explain clearly the notions of locality and structural relationship. As far as I can see in the subsequent sections, the locality/structural relationship seems to be referring to the neighbourhood either in the input space or the latent space. Also, the way of discussing local learning should be elaborated a bit to make it clear what exact notion of local learning  is being presented.\n\nWe assumed the dataset that we are interested in often has the local structure which changes on location in observation space. We referred to this property as \u201clocality\u201d and also assumed these local structures are similar to each other. This assumption corresponds to the \u201cstructural similarity.\u201d These assumptions mean that two-scale structures appear in the dataset: the local structure inside each neighborhood and the global relationship between each neighborhood. Figure 1 in our manuscript is the schematic diagram visualizing these two scales.\n\nHowever, as you pointed out, the description in the manuscript seems to be a little bit confusing. We will organize the usage of \"locality\" and \"structural relationship\" and clearly state the relation to the \u201cneighborhood.\u201d This study proposed the learning algorithm for the dataset with a local structure on some distance. We described the actual realization of this distance in Sect. 3.1 because it is independent of the main claim. We will clearly state this hierarchy of concepts in the introduction.\n\n> Page 5, Line 4: Equation 3 seems not related to meta-learning\n\nThe MAML minimizes the normal objective function in the inner-loop.

We would like to address your concerns one by one. Please see below for the details.\n\n> 1. In section 2, authors discussed LLE. It is unclear the purpose of the section 2.1?\n\nWe introduced LLE in Sect. 2.1 to describe the interpretation that our Local VAE with Gaussian decoder can be regarded as an extension of the LLE as we discussed in p.4, last paragraph. It will help to find how our proposed model relates to the conventional local learning approach. On the other hand, as R3 and you pointed out, the multiple concepts make the manuscript hard to follow. We would like to move the Sect. 2.1 before the Sect. 4 or to the Appendix.\n\n> 2. LLE does not require W is nonnegative only, and $\\sum_j W_{i,j}=0$ is also contradictory with the nonnegative assumption.\n\nWe intended to write as \"The element W_ij of W is nonzero only when x^j belongs to ...\" but accidentally wrote as \"nonnegative.\" Thank you for pointed out. We will replace the text.\n\n> 3. Authors claimed that Local VAE algorithm corresponds to the assumption that the dataset approximately lies on multiple subsets and each subset is generated from different parameters. It is unclear what is the connection of the Local VAE to multi-scale structures of the datasets.\n\nThe main claim of our manuscript is that when the dataset has the locality and each neighborhood shares structural similarity, we can efficiently (in the sense of the size of the dataset and the training time) train the deep neural networks in a local learning manner. It is reasonable to assume that such a dataset has two scales of structures: the local structure inside each neighborhood and the global relationship between each neighborhood. Figure 1 in our manuscript is the schematic diagram visualizing these two scales. Based on this context, we called the dataset as \"multi-scale structured.\" However, this phrase itself is a little bit vague; we might be able to recall another meaning. We will replace the phrase \"multi-scale structure\" to \"locality and/or structural similarity\" because the phrase itself is not essential to our claim.\n\n> 4. Authors evaluated neighbors by sampling and k-nearest neighbors on latent space. It is unclear why not use the common k-nearest neighbors on the input data. K-nearest search should not be a computational problem for large datasets by using fast approach.\n\nIn the experiment of the Shapes3D dataset, we employed the synthetic neighbors by sampling because it was much faster and simpler to implement than the original k-neighbor on the input space. The main claim of our study is independent of the actual realization of the neighborhood, and numerical experiments show that our model already obtained superior performance compared to methods that do not use the local information (the Vanilla VAE and beta-VAE). Based on this fact, we believe that we showed the effectiveness of our approach, even the neighborhood construction is synthetic. Of course, we can expect further improvement in performance by adopting a more appropriate neighborhood.\n\nAlso, in the experiment of the CarsNORB dataset, we employed k-neighbors in the latent space because the latent space of the NN will have a more \"natural\" (which close to our intuition) distance than the input space [e.g. Caron+, ICCV 2019].\n\nSince there is no reason not to use the input space actively, it is possible to add a performance comparison of the method to calculate the neighborhood.\n\n> 5. As the motivations of this paper, existing methods require massive amount of data and extended training time. However, authors did not demonstrate these points by comparing the proposed method with existing methods.\n\nWe did not demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed model, because we think that it is obvious by the construction of the method. As we mentioned in Sect. 2.1, when we apply the conventional local learning approach to the nonlinear embedding model, we need to train the embedding model from scratch for each i-th neighborhood N(x^i). For example, in the case of the Shapes3D dataset, the number of data points is 480,000, which means that the conventional approach needs to train neural networks with different parameters 480,000 times. Furthermore, because local learning uses only a little data for each neighborhood in general, it is hard to train a deep neural network in such a situation.

The overall model performs probabilistic inference via the conditional distribution from the meta parameters. There are several concerns:\n1. In section 2, authors discussed LLE. It is unclear the purpose of the section 2.1? \n2. LLE does not require W is nonnegative only, and \\sum_j W_{i,j}=0 is also contradictory with the nonnegative assumption. \n3. Authors claimed that Local VAE algorithm corresponds to the assumption that the dataset approximately lies on multiple subsets and each subset is generated from different parameters. It is unclear what is the connection of the Local VAE to multi-scale structures of the datasets.\n4.  Authors evaluated neighbors by sampling and k-nearest neighbors on latent space. It is unclear why not use the common k-nearest neighbors on the input data. K-nearest search should not be a computational problem for large datasets by using fast approach.\n\nAs the motivations of this paper, existing methods require massive amount of data and extended training time. However, authors did not demonstrate these points by comparing the proposed method with existing methods.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper761/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper761/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Localized Generations with Deep Neural Networks for Multi-Scale Structured Datasets", "authors": ["Yoshihiro Nagano", "Shiro Takagi", "Yuki Yoshida", "Masato Okada"], "authorids": ["nagano@mns.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp", "takagi@mns.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp", "yoshida@mns.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp", "okada@edu.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp"], "keywords": ["Variational autoencoder", "Local learning", "Model-agnostic meta-learning", "Disentangled representation"], "TL;DR": "Generalized Variational Autoencoder to be applicable to the dataset with local structure while keeping to avoid a heavy computation by the meta-learning with structural similarity assumption.", "abstract": "Extracting the hidden structure of the external environment is an essential component of intelligent agents and human learning.

However, the local learning approach is limited to using only a simple model, because complex models require a large amount of data and extended training time. This paper overcomes this trade-off based on the insight that the real-world dataset often shares some structural similarities between each neighborhood.\n\nPros:\nThe paper is well-written. It is easy for the reader to understand. The derivations in the paper are correct.\n\n\nThe motivation is plausible. It is reasonable to expect that each local subspace of the dataset shares some structure since most dataset tends to be governed by the consistent rules of the real world.\n\n\nThe numerical experiments show that the locality enables the model to achieve the disentangled representation for each subspace without any label information.\n\nCons:\nThe novelty seems a little straight-forward. The paper just extends the objective function of the VAE to have different parameters for each local subset.\n\nIn consideration of extended training time in the complex model, the paper doesn't provide an evaluation of the efficiency of their proposed model.\n\nThe paper isn't very polished yet. There were more than a few spelling and grammatical errors, please proofread the work and improve the writing.\n\nThis paper in its current form is already fairly good.
