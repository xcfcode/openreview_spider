In particular, the authors propose to use Dijkstra's algorithm to choose the best combination of size K among n models.\n\nReasons for the score:\nOverall, I vote for reject. There are several reasons that will be detailed a bit in the next. Roughly, I think the paper requires a huge effort of rewriting before being published. Beyond that, I'm not fully convinced by the technical novelty or difficulty of this paper.\n\nPros:\n- The idea of collecting sub-optimal configuration to boost the performance has not been considered in the context of HPO (to the best of my knowledge).\n- The experiments in Table 1 and Table show that the workflow do improve the final performance.\n\nCons:\n- My  first major concern is on the writing:\n  - There is no clear problem formulation of HPO.\n  - Personally, I'm not very comfortable with the authors not presenting formally what is Hyperband, what is Dijkstra's algorithm, and also how is the problem of finding the best ensemble modeled as a knapsack problem. I think these details can at least be provided in the appendices. I don't think it's appropriate to assume that readers are all familiar with every notion presented in the paper. Especially the main purpose of this work is to propose a new workflow that combines existing techniques, providing enough detail on how each component works and how they are connected in a precise way seems essential to me.\n- Now regarding the experiments:\n  - First of all, a general question, how many trials have you run for each experiment?\n  - Also, I don't see error bars on figure 6, 7, 9, 10.\n  - Could you explain a bit more why are you interested in the experiments of Table 2? I don't understand very well why it is useful to support the purpose of this work.\n  - Could you please more precise on when do you stop the experiments? It looks like for some experiments, a fixed time horizon is given. I guess it's the same for others, but again, some precise and formal descriptions are more than welcomed.\n\nGeneral questions and remarks:\n- Do you have any intuition on why you use averaging other than other ensemble strategies?\n- Although ensemble has not been considered in the context of HPO, I'm not sure that the scientific contributions in this paper is significant enough. Could the authors highlight a bit more the technical difficulties if I have missed anything?\n- In general, I feel like the paper is more like an engineering trick than a scientific discovery, which could be a nice contribution of course. But then in that case, I think more solid experiments should be provided. For example, in the context of HPO, we often want to see the evolution of performance over time, not only the final performance.\n\nMinor comments and grammar issues (non-exhaustive):\n- In general, I would suggest the authors to review a bit the writing style of the paper. Sometimes I feel like the authors have personal claims regarding some previous work without any support (which can be citations or even some intuitions). To cite one of them as example, in Section 3.2: Its pure-exploration nature combined with conservative resource allocation strategies can sweep better the hyperparameter space than other strategies like blackbox bayesian optimization. Maybe, but how is it compared to evolutionary algorithms for example? My point is that we should be careful about this kind of claims.\n- The citation style is weird, authors can refer to Section 4.1 of the template file of ICLR.\n- In the abstract: capable of doing sth. instead of capable to do sth.\n- Section 2, paragraph Multi-objective goal, I don't really understand the sentence: Literature lets us imagine that the hyper-parameter function topology has two plateaus.\n- Section 3.2: bayesian -> Bayesian.\n- Section 3.3.3: hyperband -> Hyperband.\n- Section 4.1: It shows very effective to detect... <- this is not correct grammatically.\n- Section 4.3: Different combinations algorithms -> Different combinations of algorithms.\n- Section 4.3: SP-MCTS do not falls into -> SP-MCTS does not fall into.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3071/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3071/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Recycling sub-optimial Hyperparameter Optimization models to generate efficient Ensemble Deep Learning", "authorids": ["~Pierrick_Pochelu1", "bruno.conche@total.com", "serge.petiton@univ-lille.fr"], "authors": ["Pierrick Pochelu", "Bruno Conche", "Serge G.

The correct reference for this is [1], and this is just what people do when they create ensembles. The paper also misses a number of relevant recent work to build ensembles of deep models, at least [2, 3].

Authors show that the performance of the constructed ensembles improves upon the performance of a single classifier. \n\nStrong points:\n\n- Novel and interesting idea\n\nWeak points:\n\n- The paper would benefit significantly from proofreading and copyediting.  \n- The choice of the Dijkstra algorithm is poorly justified and might be incorrect\n- More baselines for comparison are required\n\nRecommendation:\n\nI strongly recommend that this paper be rejected. While the idea of using Dijkstra for post hoc ensemble construction is interesting, I don't think it is justified and I am not convinced that it is a correct choice. Furthermore, the paper is riddled with mistakes, unneeded details and bad explanations. This paper needs to be entirely rewritten and the experiments require proper baselines for post hoc ensemble construction. \n\nExtra comments:\n\nThere is no justification provided for using Dijkstra. The context is different from shortest path searching, as multiple classifiers in an ensemble have complex interactions that are lost via the majority voting and empirical risk estimation. In other words, the \"weight\" of the edge from one node to another will vary depending on the nodes visited beforehand, which is not a condition normally present for shortest path estimation. I think it means that it's incorrect to apply Dijkstra here, or at least that Dijkstra offers no guarantees. The same goes for the parallel with the Knapsack problem (i.e. I don't think this is an instance of the Knapsack problem).\n\nOther baselines should be added, some simple ones would be forward/backward greedy search, stacking and genetic algorithms. \n\nSection 3.3.1: showing with a single example that combining three models with a majority vote does not lead to optimal performance is hardly evidence that \"smart algorithms are needed\".\n\nThe related works section is needlessly long.

Furthermore they apply this algorithm on the models produced by Hyperband (HB) and also show that it performs well on other hyperparameter tuning methods, such as random search and Bayesian optimization.\n\nGiven that the latter is just an application of the algorithm, the former will have to be the main contribution of the paper.\n\nWhat is unfortunately lacking is a comparison with other ensemble techniques including simpler ones. I am not an expert, but I know that simple greedy methods perform quite well, see for example [1]. So it it not clear the algorithm is any better than previous techniques. One advantage is that the proposed technique naturally incorporates a inference time constraint, but then it should be discussed.\n\nWithout a discussion and comparison to other widely using ensemble techniques this paper is incomplete and should not be accepted. The application alone on HPO technique is a fairly straightforward one, even if effective, and does alone not warrant a paper, with the decent but limited results presented. A stronger case could be made if for example the results allowed to reach top rank in many kaggle competitions, or in some existing AutoML competition.\n\n#### Pros\n* The paper is well written, polished, and easy to understand\n* Combining hyperparameter tuning and ensembling is a good idea. Although already routinely done, for example in Kaggle competitions and in AutoML competitions, it deserves more attention and analysis.\n* The results although limiting (only 2 datasets are used, ensemble baselines are missing) are promising.\n* Incorporating the cost constraint is an important contribution, and should perhaps be discussed in more detail.\n\n\n#### Cons\n* There exist many ensemble selection techniques in the literature, that are simple and known to work well, for example greedily selecting the next method that performs best if combined with the currently selected ensembles. In some sense the proposed algorithm can be considered the obvious extension of this idea if presented with a cost constraint. But it would be good to better discuss how a cost constraint changes the situation.\n* Too much focus on Hyperband, presented as part of the main contribution, I think the paper should focus more on their ensemble technique as it can be combined effectively with any method, as the results show, and just not that Hyperband seems to work best on the two datasets selected. Part of this seems to stem from Hyperband also working best when no ensembling is used, which is not necessarily in agreement with other HPO literature.\n* The paper would be stronger if results were presented on more datasets.\n\n[1] G Tsoumakas, I Partalas, I Vlahavas - A taxonomy and short review of ensemble selection\n\n\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3071/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3071/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Recycling sub-optimial Hyperparameter Optimization models to generate efficient Ensemble Deep Learning", "authorids": ["~Pierrick_Pochelu1", "bruno.conche@total.com", "serge.petiton@univ-lille.fr"], "authors": ["Pierrick Pochelu", "Bruno Conche", "Serge G.
