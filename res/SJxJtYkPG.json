The current paper describes the operator (e.g. the \"*\") as a sequence of calculations; generating the object representing the return value, invoking the continuation k, and performing the gradient propagation respectively. These are all necessary to realize the correct calculation, but are still not essential for (only looking at the perspective of) constructing the neural networks. It might be better to further separate the actual forward/backward operations from the \"common procedure\" of each operator.\n\nIn most cases, the majority of actual time consumption of neural networks is usually caused by functions with a large time complexity (e.g., matrix multiplication and convolution). Although the better compiler/runtime pipelines may generate/run more efficient programs than the naive calculation, I have no idea that \"how much efficiently\" these processes work.
