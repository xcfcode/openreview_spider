This is done by making the variance in a probit model depend on the observations (x) and appealing to results on kernels methods for CRFs by Lafferty et al. The authors also introduce what they call dynamic ranks, but it is impossible to understand, from this write-up, how these relate to the model. No intuition is provide either. What is the equal sign doing in the definition of dynamic ranks?\r\n\r\nRegarding section 2, it is too short and impossible to follow. The authors should rewrite it making sure the mathematical models are specified properly and in full mathematical detail. All the variables and symbols should be defined. I know there are space constraints, but I also believe a better presentation is possible.\r\n\r\nThe experiments claim great improvements over techniques that do not exploit structure or techniques that exploit structure but which are not suitable for ordinal regression. As it is, it would be impossible to reproduce the results in this abstract. However, it seems that great effort was put into the empirical part of the work.\r\n\r\nSome typos:\r\n\r\nAbstract: Add space after labels. Also, a novel should be simply novel.\r\nIntroduction: in the recent should be in recent. Also, drop the a in a novel dynamic features.\r\nSection 2: Add space after McCullagh. What is standard CRF form? Please be precise as there are many ways of parameterizing and structuring CRFs.\r\nReferences: laplacian should be Laplacian"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"decision": "reject", "title": "Heteroscedastic Conditional Ordinal Random Fields for Pain Intensity\r\n    Estimation from Facial Images", "abstract": "We propose a novel method for automatic pain intensity estimation from facial images based on the framework of kernel Conditional Ordinal Random Fields (KCORF).

The paper discusses a new variation of a conditional\r\nrandom field in which the produced labels are ordinal values.  The\r\npaper's main claim to novelty is the idea of 'dynamic ranks', but it\r\nis unclear what these are.\r\n\r\nThis paper does not convey its ideas clearly.  It is not immediately\r\nobvious why an ordinal regression problem demands a CRF, much less a\r\nkernelized heteroscedastic CRF.  Since I assume that each frame has a\r\nsingle label, is the function of the CRF simply to impose temporal\r\nsmoothness constraints?  I don't understand the motivation for the\r\nadditional aspects of this.  The idea of 'dynamic ranks' is not\r\nexplained, beyond Equation (2), which is itself confusing.  For\r\nexample, what does the equal sign inside the parentheses mean on the\r\nleft side of Equation 2?  It took me quite a while of looking at the\r\nright-hand side of this equation to realize that it was defining a\r\nset, but I don't understand how this relates to ranking or dynamics.\r\nSection 3 seems to imply that the kernel is between the features of\r\n6x6 patches, but this doesn't make sense to me if the objective is to\r\nhave temporal smoothing.\r\n\r\nI found this paper very confusing.  It does not provide many details\r\nor intuition.  In trying to resolve this confusion, I examined the\r\nauthors' previous work, cited as [14] and [15].  These other papers\r\nappear to contain most of the crucial details and assumptions that sit\r\nbehind the present paper.  I appreciate that this is a very short\r\npaper, but for it to be a useful contribution it must be at least\r\nsomewhat self contained.
