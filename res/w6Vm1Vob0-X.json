The reviewer claiming rejection questioned the novelty of the paper and the complexity of the global attention mentioned in the paper. Even through the authors' responses and subsequent private discussions, concerns about complexity and novelty were not completely resolved.\n\n\nConsidering the authors' claim that the core contribution of this paper is to design fully learnable spectral filters without compromising computational efficiency, it is necessary to consider why it is meaningful to perform global attention based on graph wavelet transform in the first place. In terms of complexity, although the wavelet coefficient can be efficiently calculated using the Chebyshev polynomials mentioned by the authors, in the attention sparsification part, n log n is required **for each node** in sorting, resulting in complexity of n^2 or more. There may still be an advantage of complexity over using global attention in a message-passing architecture, but it will be necessary to clarify and verify that, given that the proposed method uses an approximation that limits global attention within K hops.\n\nAlso, this paper modifies the graph wavelet transform in graph theory, which requires a deeper discussion. For example, as the authors mentioned, the original wavelet coefficient psi_uv can be interpreted as the amount of energy that node v has received from node u in its local neighborhood. The psi_uv defined by the learnable filter as shown in Equation 3 has a different meaning from the original wavelet coefficient. There is insufficient insight as to whether it is justifiable to use this value as an attention coefficient.\n\nOverall, the paper proposes potentially interesting ideas, but it seems to require further development for publication."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Global Node Attentions via Adaptive Spectral Filters", "authorids": ["~Shouheng_Li1", "~Dongwoo_Kim1", "qing.wang@anu.edu.au"], "authors": ["Shouheng Li", "Dongwoo Kim", "Qing Wang"], "keywords": ["Graph Representation learning", "Graph Convolutional Network", "Graph Fourier transform"], "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been extensively studied for prediction tasks on graphs.

The technical is to use introduce graph global attention. \n\nI think the paper is written okay. The motivation is clear. The solution is reasonable. However, I have following criticisms:\n1. This work has limited novelty. Observing that GCN cannot work well over heterophilic networks is not a new idea and observation. Using attention to capture the features from far-away nodes is natural but not novel. I do not think that it is reasonable to argue against other works, e.g. [1] that adopts the above idea by saying they are not expressive enough. Expressiveness sometimes may lead to model overfitting. Actually, ChevNet [2] can also capture far-aways nodes and be expressive enough. Why does it not work well? I guess that it is due to some overfitting issue. Moreover, if I understand it correctly, the limited difference between this work and [3] is most likely the global attention, which has very limited contribution. \n\n2. Although the work claims everywhere to tend to decrease the complexity, when computing the global attention, one still needs to do computation for every pair of nodes, which is of course not scalable for even medium-sized graphs. \n\n3. The heterophilic networks used for evaluation are very small with only several hundred nodes. Why not try larger ones, say actor, Cham. in [4]?

However, I still think the complexity is a concern of this work. I do not think that Eq. (3) can be implemented within the complexity that the authors claimed. Moreover, if the authors use another way to compute the attention scores, that way should be very clearly stated instead of written in a different form. Given the high complexity, I cannot clearly see the advantage of this work in comparison to [1], as the non-local attention has been proposed in [1] already.\n\n[1] Non-Local Graph Neural Networks.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3425/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3425/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Global Node Attentions via Adaptive Spectral Filters", "authorids": ["~Shouheng_Li1", "~Dongwoo_Kim1", "qing.wang@anu.edu.au"], "authors": ["Shouheng Li", "Dongwoo Kim", "Qing Wang"], "keywords": ["Graph Representation learning", "Graph Convolutional Network", "Graph Fourier transform"], "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been extensively studied for prediction tasks on graphs.

We are happy to discuss the questions further.\n\n### Novelty\n\nWe agree with you that, when K is large enough, ChevNet is able to incorporate the entire graph. However, as reported by Kipf and Welling in their work for GCN [5], simplified Chebyshev filters by restricting to 1-hop neighborhood (K=1) often provide better performance on graphs than the cases with larger K. Further, we believe ChevNet remains to be a localized method that resembles a low-pass diffusion filter in practice. A graph laplaian $L$ is closely related to random walks, and its power $L^k$ can be seen as a form of the stationary probabilistic state of step-$k$ random walks. A Chebyshev polynomial filter $g_\\theta(L)=\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\\theta_kL^k$ is essentially a sum of weighted random walk states where the step $k\\in \\{0, ..., K-1\\}$. Thus, the embedding of a node is a sum of features from its K-hop neighbours multiplied by a $k$-step random-walk probability matrix, and weighted by $\\theta_k$. Therefore, Chebyshev polynomial filters work similarly as pagerank kernels as shown by [6] which has also been shown to be closely related to heat kernels[7]. In fact, a recent work has shown Chebyshev polynomial filters are equivalent to graph diffusion (GDC)[8] which is based on the assumption of homophily, i.e. 'birds of a feather flock together', as reported by the authors.\n\nIn comparison, our method uses MLP which is not restricted by the aforementioned constraints, and thus is more adaptive. On one hand, we observed MLP converges to similar shapes of a heat kernel, with attentions being allocated to structurally similar nodes in a very similar way as reported by [9] on barbell graphs. On the other hand, on heterophilic networks, MLP emphasizes on mid-high frequency range which contributes the most to performance, which would not be able to achieve using heat or pagerank kernels. We agree with you that the ChebNet can approximate high-frequency filter in some cases. However, there resides two key differences between these two models: \n* ChevNet aggregates (or normalizes) node features via a spectral filter, whereas our model uses wavelet basis to measure the similarity between nodes via attention (normalization/aggregation follows after this). \n* Our model uses adaptive filters via multi-head attention, where each head learns attention weights from a different spectral filter, whereas ChevNet uses the `same polynomial filter` over the entire network. Therefore, ChebNet can only use overfitted (if it happens - ChevNet has a very small number of parameters so it is unlikely) filters whereas our model can use appropriate filters, through the standard training-validation process. \n\n### Complexity\nIn our work, Eq.(3) is computed via Chebyshev polynomials, which means $\\psi_{u,v}$ for a pair of nodes $(u,v)$ is only computed when they are linked within $p$-hop neighborhood. Combining this with sparse-matrix structure, we can achieve complexity $O(p\\times|E|)$ for the attention part. \n\nGiven the confusion, we have added some details of the Chebyshev polynomial approximation in Appendix A.

This learning ability on spectral filters empowers our model to adaptively discover a combination of low-frequency filters and high-frequency filters for learning meaningful node representations, without making any prior assumption on local homophily. This is also our key observation in this work that leads to overcoming the issue that existing GNNs cannot work well over heterophilic networks. In this regard, we do not claim that the novelty of our work is to observe this issue or use attention; instead, the novelty of our work is to solve this issue by designing fully learnable spectral filters without compromising computational efficiency. This is how our work differs from the existing work, including the work in [3] which pre-defines wavelet filters heuristically.\n\nSimilarly, for ChevNet [2], it is designed to localize within local node neighbourhoods, where the range of node neighbourhoods is determined by a hyper-parameter that is usually small. While ChevNet can reach far-away nodes using a large $K$, all nodes within the $K$ hop are also captured, resulting in degraded performance on heterophilic networks. Thus, this design restricts the generalizability of ChevNet on graphs when the assumption of local homophily does not hold.\n\nIn addition, we would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out the misuse of expressiveness. We have fixed the related sentence in Section 1.\n\n\n### (2) Complexity\n\nOur work does not require computation for each node pairs. This is because we compute attention weights based on graph wavelet transform, which is approximated using Chebyshev polynomials (same trick used in [3]). Thus, our model has the complexity $O(m\\times |E|)$, where $|E|$ is the number of edges and $m$ is the order of Chebyshev polynomials. For comparison with the other methods targeting heterophilic networks, the complexity of the method in [4] is $O(N^2)$ and in [1] is $O(Nlog(N))$ where $N$ is the number of nodes. For real-world graphs, $|E|$ is often much smaller than $N^2$.\n\nRegarding attention sparsification, our model has introduced two sparsification techniques (please refer to the revised paper for technical details in Section 3 and related discussions on experiments in Section 4.2). Nonetheless, attention sparsification does not change the computational complexity of our model since the computational complexity measures the worst-case computational cost, not the actual computational cost. The purpose of sparsifying attentions in our work is to reduce the actual computational cost using a sparse attention matrix. We have added Figure 3 in the revised paper to illustrate how attention sparsification can help reduce the computational cost and thus improve runtime efficiency in our model. \n\n\n### (3) Datasets\n\nWe have added experimental results for Chameleon (2,277 nodes and 36,101 edges) in our revised paper. We are also running experiments on another two datasets Actor (7,600 nodes and 33,544 edges) and Squirrel (5,201 nodes and 217,073 edges) from [4] and will report the results once they are available. Also, it might be worth mentioning that, among all the datasets in our experiments including Chameleon, Actor and Squirrel, PubMed is the largest dataset with 19,717 nodes and 44,338 edges from a computational perspective.\n\n\\\nWe hope our responses have resolved your questions.

We have revised our paper accordingly. Please find below our responses.\n\n### (1) Attention sparsification\n\nFollowing your feedback, we have added further technical details (Section 3) and new experimental results (Section 4.2) in our revised paper. To gain a better understanding on how attention sparsity can affect efficiency, we have included two sparsification techniques in our experiments: (a) one is based on a threshold; and (b) the other is based on top-k sorting. As depicted in Figure 3 in the revised paper, both sparsification techniques can significantly improve runtime efficiency.\n\n### (2) Datasets\n\nIn the revised paper, we have added another larger disassortative network, Chameleon, which has 2,277 nodes and 36,101 edges. \nOur method GNAN performs the best across all the baselines on this dataset. We are also doing further experiments on other disassortative networks, and will report the results once they are available. \n\nConducting experiments on synthetic graphs with a controllable $\\beta$ is a great idea. We will look into how such graphs can be constructed and add experimental results later on. In the meantime, if you are aware of any existing work that generates such graphs, please let us know.\n\n\n### (3) Evaluation tasks\n\nNode classification is commonly used to evaluate the model performance by state-of-the-art GNN methods. To have a fair and comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art GNN methods, we thus benchmark our model against these methods on node classification in this work. We appreciate your suggestions to benchmark on other evaluation tasks such as graph reconstruction and link predication, as well as graph classification, and will  work on these tasks as a next step.

I have a few further questions. \n## Novelty\nRegarding the issue of ChevNet, I do not agree with the authors. By setting a large K (actually K does not need to be very large due to the small world property of networks, K:10~20), ChevNet is able to incorporate the entire graph. However, I do not think the argument \"all nodes within the  hop are also captured, resulting in degraded performance on heterophilic networks\" is correct. If it may indeed learn a high pass filter, ChevNet will not perform only smoothing the local nodes and can also emphasize nodes that are far away. The failure of ChevNet is actually over-overparameterization and overfitting. Regarding this point, I still cannot see the clear contribution from non-local attention. \n\n## Complexity\nI do not think the argument of authors is correct. Before the model performs top-K or any other attention sparsification, the model first needs to compute the entire \\phi matrix. I did not see any way to make it linear in O(V). Eq.(3) needs to first compute full matrix eigen decomposition, which is with complexity already more than w(|V|^2) itself. Actually, the essence of non-local attention also makes the model unable to leverage efficient matrix eigen decomposition because the non locality means the entire range of eigenvalues are needed. \n\n## Datasets\nI also agree with AC1. The full comparison of the algorithmic complexity should be provided. The complexity of Eq.3 should also be provided. \n\nRegarding this, I still do not think the paper achieves the bar of ICLR. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3425/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3425/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Global Node Attentions via Adaptive Spectral Filters", "authorids": ["~Shouheng_Li1", "~Dongwoo_Kim1", "qing.wang@anu.edu.au"], "authors": ["Shouheng Li", "Dongwoo Kim", "Qing Wang"], "keywords": ["Graph Representation learning", "Graph Convolutional Network", "Graph Fourier transform"], "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been extensively studied for prediction tasks on graphs.

The authors proposed the GNAN method to allow attention on distant nodes indeed of limiting to local neighbors. The authors generalized the idea of graph wavelet with MLP to generate the attention score and utilized it to generate multiple attention heads. The authors carried out experiments on several real-world networks (4 assortative and 3 disassortative) with comparison to several state-of-art GCN methods.\n\nStrength:\nThe authors study a very interesting problem of GCN/graph embedding or disassortative graphs.\nThe proposed method is well motivated with solid theoretical motivation from graph wavelets. The proposed model is very intuitive generalization of graph wavelet methods.\nThe empirical evaluation is very thorough on seven networks with comparison to about 10 baselines of different kinds.\n\nWeakness:\nThough the authors mentioned the use of sparsification of attention for speed-up, however, it mentioned that t is set to zero. It is interesting to see how scalable the proposed method is as it needs to have global attention to possibly all nodes. An empirical comparison of running time would be very helpful.\n The authors only carry out experiments on three disassortative which are all very small. It would be interesting to see more experiments on disassortative graphs. Alternatively, it would be interesting to have an experiment on synthetic graphs where the \\beta can be controlled and varied smoothly to see how it affects the performance of different algorithms.\nThe authors picked only node classification of evaluation tasks. It is interesting to see how the disassortative could impact other tasks like graph reconstruction and link prediction. \n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3425/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3425/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Global Node Attentions via Adaptive Spectral Filters", "authorids": ["~Shouheng_Li1", "~Dongwoo_Kim1", "qing.wang@anu.edu.au"], "authors": ["Shouheng Li", "Dongwoo Kim", "Qing Wang"], "keywords": ["Graph Representation learning", "Graph Convolutional Network", "Graph Fourier transform"], "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been extensively studied for prediction tasks on graphs.
