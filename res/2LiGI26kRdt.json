It contains some interesting points on the technical side, e.g, freezing the bottom layers when training newly added layers, but there are several concerns:  (1) This proposed method is called progressive stacking 2.0 but there is no comparison against the original progressive stacking in experiments. We had to check the empirical results in the original paper of progressive stacking, and did not notice any performance improvement of this new method over the original one; (2) The proposed method even introduced one more hyperparameter to tune: the number of top layers to copy.  This hyperparameter seems hard to choose. Different choices of this hyperparameter may dramatically impact the performance of this new method.  An ablation study on this should be conducted, e.g.,  what will the results look like if we only copy the last layer?  (3) The original progressive stacking method does not provide any practical guidance on how to determine the time to stack when the training goes. This severely limits the practical value of progressive stacking. If one stacks layers too early or too late, the stacking method may have no advantage at all. Unfortunately, this method called 2.0 still leaves this most critical issue away.

Generally, ELECTRA is a much more powerful model compared with BERT and ALBERT. ELECTRA introduces an effective task named replaced token detection (RTD) for pretraining, which can significantly improve the performance. However, if training with the same training steps, according to the ELECTRA paper, we can see that ELECTRA even requires more training time than BERT, with the same  hyperparameters.  ELECTRA does not make each step training more faster. It generates more effective samples to make the model stronger. Indeed, to some extent, improving the performance is to improve the speed. For example, using the sentence-order prediction (SOP) loss instead of the NSP loss, the performance of the model can also be improved. However, the goal of this paper is to provide a general efficient training strategy, and our method is orthogonal to other methods, namely it can be used in conjunction with the other techniques, including adopting more effective pretraining tasks like ELECTRA.  We choose the BERT model as the representative in this paper because it is the most popular in recent years and it is the basic of the later proposed models. However, our method can also be used to speed up the training of the other BERT based models. In the revised version, we have shown that the proposed method can also speed up the training of ALBERT.  We believe that the proposed method can also be combined with ELECTRA. However, we do not have enough time to perform new experiment and we also do not have more space to show more results in the paper currently.\n\n2. The results on SQuAD tasks are added in the revised version.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1143/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1143/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Progressively Stacking 2.0: A Multi-stage Layerwise Training Method for BERT Training Speedup", "authorids": ["~Cheng_Yang3", "~Shengnan_Wang2", "~Chao_Yang7", "~Yuechuan_Li1", "~Ru_He1", "~Jingqiao_Zhang1"], "authors": ["Cheng Yang", "Shengnan Wang", "Chao Yang", "Yuechuan Li", "Ru He", "Jingqiao Zhang"], "keywords": ["BERT", "Training speedup", "Multi-stage training", "Natural language processing"], "abstract": "Pre-trained language models, such as BERT, have achieved significant accuracy gain in many natural language processing tasks.

Thus, it is better to give more comparisons and discussions in the Experiment, so that the author can know the advantages of MSLT compared with [2].\n\nResponse: Thank you for your advice. We have compared the proposed method with the progressively stacking method [2] in the revised version\n\n2. From Figure 4, it seems that BERT-base (baseline) needs to train around 80 hours. If training with MSLT using the same time as baselines (like train 2M steps), how about the performance compared with baseline? [3] shows that training with more steps can help improve performance. Does this phenomenon still remain in your method\n\nResponse: Thank you for you advice. We have compared our method with the baseline using the same training time.  However, we control each method uses 40 hours in total. We showd that in the same (limited) time, our method can achieve much better performance.  However, if we want to see the performance of the models trained using 2M steps, we need to train the model from scratch. Because we need to allocate suitable ratio of steps for each stage. So the existing checkpoint can not be used.  It is too expensive for us to retrain a BERT-Base and BERT-Large model with 2M steps and it is difficult for us to finish this task in this short period of the rebuttal time, since we need to do some other experiments to evaluate our method. \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1143/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1143/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Progressively Stacking 2.0: A Multi-stage Layerwise Training Method for BERT Training Speedup", "authorids": ["~Cheng_Yang3", "~Shengnan_Wang2", "~Chao_Yang7", "~Yuechuan_Li1", "~Ru_He1", "~Jingqiao_Zhang1"], "authors": ["Cheng Yang", "Shengnan Wang", "Chao Yang", "Yuechuan Li", "Ru He", "Jingqiao Zhang"], "keywords": ["BERT", "Training speedup", "Multi-stage training", "Natural language processing"], "abstract": "Pre-trained language models, such as BERT, have achieved significant accuracy gain in many natural language processing tasks.

I would argue that this is a great investigation and experimentation but it does not meet the criteria of acceptance. In section 3.1, the author has used the attention distribution (before and after) to motivate the work in this paper. However, if the author could discuss/explains why this change affects the convergence speed in analytical/mathematical solution, that would definitely gives more credit to originality and significance. I would be more than willing to re-evaluate my ratings if that happens\n\nResponse: In the revised version, we have added a discussion setion (section 5) to explain why the proposed method can speed up the training of BERT. The main reason is that we adopt the alternating optimization technique in our training strategy. The alternating optimization method is very suitable for dealing with the multi-variable optimization problem in which updating a part of variables is much easier than updating all variables. While the network training problem just fits such a case. \n\n2. abstract: \"have has achieved\" -> \"have achieved\".\n\nResponse: Thank you for pointing out this.

In other words, ALBERT reduces about 42% training time and our method reduces about 55% training time. In addition, from Table 2 in ALBERT, we can see that, though 1.7x speedup is achieved, the performance of ALBERT-large is much worse than that of BERT-large (83.5 vs 86.6 in MNLI). The performance of ALBERT-xlarge  is similar to that of BERT-large (86.4 vs 86.6 in MNLI), but training ALBERT-xlarge requires even more time than training BERT-large.  In contrast, our method can achieve 2.1x speedup without significant performance degradation (86.2 vs 86.5 in MNLI).  Hence, our method is much more time efficient than ALBERT.

Specifically, the authors progressively stack layers. The bottom layers are fixed and only the new added top layers are trained. The proposed method can achieve more than 110% training speedup and achieve comparable (slightly worse) performance. Although compared with other speedup training methods like ELECTRA [1], the idea of this paper is not novel. However, the proposed method is simple and effective to some extend. Thus, I give a marginal score to this paper.\n\n### Strengths\n* The proposed training method is simple and easy to implement. \n* It can achieve 110% training speedup without significant performance degradation.\n\n### Weaknesses and Questions\n* The most related method to this paper is [2]. Thus, it is better to give more comparisons and discussions in the Experiment, so that the author can know the advantages of MSLT compared with [2].\n* From Figure 4, it seems that BERT-base (baseline) needs to train around 80 hours. If training with MSLT using the same time as baselines (like train 2M steps), how about the performance compared with baseline? [3] shows that training with more steps can help improve performance.
