To solve this problem, we would need to develop a ranking function or -- our favoured solution -- a data generation process that generates training programs according to an intelligent prior distribution over programs. After training the neural net on programs generated from this prior, there will be a natural bias towards searching over program space in best-first order. In this case, the method presented in the paper can be used un-modified. Because of this, we felt it was reasonable to leave the ranking problem for future work.\n \nIn the second experiment we considered showing the speedups for solving a given proportion of test problems (e.g. the chosen 20%) more informative than showing the speedup for solving all problems. The reason for this is that the latter metric would only compare the running times of the most difficult problem for the baseline and for DeepCoder respectively, ignoring the speedups achieved on all other (perhaps more typical) problems.\n \nIn the 3rd revision we have added an analysis of failure modes in a new Appendix G. We have looked at a generalisation of confusion matrices to the multilabel classification setting: for each attribute in a ground truth program (rows) measure how often each other attribute (columns) is chosen as a false positive. We then re-ordered the confusion matrix to try to expose block structure in the false positives. This reveals groups of instructions that tend to be difficult to distinguish. While the results are somewhat noisy, we observe a few general things:\n- There is increased confusion amongst instructions that select out a single element from an array: HEAD, LAST, ACCESS, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM.\n- FILTER and ZIPWITH are predicted more often regardless of the ground truth and most of the lambdas associated with them are also predicted often.\n- There are some groups of lambdas that are more difficult for the network to distinguish within: + vs -; +1 vs -1; /2 vs /3 vs /4.\n- When a program uses **2, the network often thinks it's using *, presumably because both can lead to large values in the output.\nThe NNet is never making hard decisions, so there isn't a clear concept of it being wrong. It can only rank the needed operations far down in its ordering, which causes the search to take longer. However, in the Sort and add enumeration experiment reported in Section 5.1, it only happened in 3 instances that the neural network slowed down the search: the respective slowdowns were by factors of 3.1x, 1.5x and 1.3x.\n \nRegarding your question on pooling information from individual I/O examples, we have chosen arithmetic averaging as it is one of the simplest operations that combines information from all the examples and is independent of their order. Other pooling operations could be tried, and whether they are better would be an empirical question. We thought that having each I/O example predict the output independently and then combine the predicted attributes would be inferior, because then there is no opportunity for the model to integrate different pieces of evidence from different I/O examples in a non-trivial way."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "DeepCoder: Learning to Write Programs", "abstract": "We develop a first line of attack for solving programming competition-style problems from input-output examples using deep learning.

To summarize, the reviews say this is an interesting and well-written paper. The biggest issue raised in the reviews is that the scale of programs is said to be small (we disagree), and there are questions about how the approach will scale to more complicated programs (this is a big open problem, which--as discussed in Sec 7--we agree we don't solve, but we believe that DeepCoder lays a solid foundation upon which to scale up from.)\n\nWe would like to respond to these issues in a bit more detail:\n\n1. DeepCoder is solving problems that are significantly more complex than those tackled in machine learning research (e.g., as can be found in [1-6]), and it can significantly speed up strong methods from the programming languages community. DeepCoder scales up better than any method we are aware of for solving simple programming competition style problems from I/O examples.\n\n2. Inducing large programs from weak supervision (in this case input-output examples) is a major open problem in computer science. We don't claim to solve this problem, and it would be a major breakthrough if we did. There clearly need to be many significant research contributions to get there. DeepCoder develops two ideas that are generally useful: 1. learning bottom-up cues to guide search over program space, and 2. building a system that sits on top of and improves the strongest search-based techniques. The benefit is that as new search techniques are developed, the DeepCoder framework can be added on top, and it will likely provide significant additional improvements (we have now shown large improvements over 3 different search techniques: 2 from the original paper plus the \\lambda^2 system requested in reviewer comments).\n\n3. There is a question of whether there is enough information in input-output examples to induce large programs, and we agree that there is probably not enough information using strictly the formulation in this paper (see Discussion). However, it is straightforward to extend DeepCoder: First, by using natural language as an additional input to the encoder, we can learn to extract more information about what the program is expected to do, and how it is expected to do it. Second, generating data from a trained generative model of source code will cause the system to favor generating programs that are likely under the trained model, which will help with the ranking problem. Third, the definition of attributes can be expanded to be richer (e.g., ranking the different instructions per position in the program, or combinations of instructions), to enable the neural network component to solve more of the problem (and thus rely less on the search). Together, we believe these directions represent a clear path towards scaling up program synthesis even further by leveraging the key ideas in DeepCoder.\n\n\n[1] Graves, A., Wayne, G. and Danihelka, I., 2014.

The employed test set of 100 programs seems rather small. in addition the authors ensure that the test set programs are semantically disjoint from the training set programs. Could the authors provide additional details about the small size of the test set and how to the disjoint property is enforced?\n\n2. The length of the programs is rather small at this point in time.

I have several questions that would like the authors to address", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "review": "This paper presents an approach to learn to generate programs. Instead of directly trying to generate the program, the authors propose to train a neural net to estimate a fix set of attributes, which then condition a search procedure. This is an interesting approach, which make sense, as building a generative model of programs is a very complex task.\n\nFaster computation times are shown in the experimental section with respect to baselines including DFS, Enumeration, etc. in a setup with very small programs of length up to 5 instructions have to be found. \nIt is not clear to me how the proposed approach scales to larger programs, where perhaps many attributes will be on. Is there still an advantage?\n\nThe authors use as metric the time to find a single program, whose execution will result in the set of 5 input-output pairs given as input. However, as mentioned in the paper, one is not after a generic program but after the best program, or a rank list of all programs (or top-k programs) that result in a correct execution.\nCould the authors show experiments in this setting? would still be useful to have the proposed approach? what would the challenges be in this more realistic scenario?\n\nIn the second experiment the authors show results where the length of the program at training time is different than the length at test time. However, the results are shown when only 20% of the programs are finished. Could you show results for finding all programs? \n\nThe paper is missing an analysis of the results. What type of programs are difficult? how often is the NNet wrong? how does this affect speed? what are the failure modes of the proposed method?\n\nThe authors proposed to have a fix-length representation of the each input-output pair, and then use average pooling to get the final representation. However, why would average pooling make sense here? would it make more sense to combine the predictions at the decoder, not the encoder?\n\nLearning from only 5 executions seems very difficult to me. For programs so small it might be ok, but going to more difficult and longer programs this setting does not seem reasonable. \n\nIn summary an interesting paper. This paper tackles a problem that is outside my area of expertise so I might have miss something important. \n", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "DeepCoder: Learning to Write Programs", "abstract": "We develop a first line of attack for solving programming competition-style problems from input-output examples using deep learning.

We experimented a bit with different integer ranges. The general trend seems to be that larger integer ranges cause the neural network to yield more of a win, because there is more information in the input-output examples. We did not try longer programs, as the runtime was growing large at T=5. However, we would expect to see similar qualitative behavior as in Figure 6 (Appendix), where some problems are solved very quickly and others take much longer.\n2. Exploring partial conditioning might be a good direction for future work.\n3.
