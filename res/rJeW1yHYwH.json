The added/modified contents are marked by RED fonts so that other reviewers are also aware of the changes we made.\n\nTo Question \u201cIn the ablation study, what exactly is the original positional encoding? Are they learned embedding vectors?\u201d\nThe results we reported in the original submission are the learnt positional embedding vectors, where they are jointly optimized as free model parameters. In the revised paper, we also add the fixed position encoding suggested by Vaswani et al. (2017) in the ablation study (the green bar in Figure 3). We see that the fixed positional encoding is slightly outperformed by learnt positional encoding. \n\nTo Question \u201cSince the authors consider continuous time rather than discrete time, how many embedding vectors are there?\u201d\nThe time encoding approach proposed in our paper is entirely functional, which means it is a vector function of time. So the functional time encoding $\\Phi(.)$ takes any time value (timespan) as input and outputs a $d_T$-dimensional vector as the representation of the time value (timespan). The functional form is presented in Eq5. The ability to handle continuous variable is a major advance of our approach compared with the vast majority of prior work on representation learning with discrete variables. \n\nDiscussions on the concerns in the limitation of the stationarity assumption induced by using Fourier features. \nThe reviewer raises a very good point, which touches on the implicit assumption made by our approach that we model the relative temporal information (timespan) instead of the absolute time. We agree that the absolute time can contain useful non-stationary temporal signals, such as the seasonality. Our approach does not take such perspective into consideration. The solution provided by the reviewer points out one possible direction, or we could treat the absolute time information as covariates and directly include them into the model, which we shall leave to future work. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1457/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1457/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Inductive representation learning on temporal graphs", "authors": ["da Xu", "chuanwei ruan", "evren korpeoglu", "sushant kumar", "kannan achan"], "authorids": ["da.xu@walmartlabs.com", "ruanchuanwei@gmail.com", "ekorpeoglu@walmart.com", "skumar4@walmartlabs.com", "kachan@walmartlabs.com"], "keywords": ["temporal graph", "inductive representation learning", "functional time encoding", "self-attention"], "abstract": "Inductive representation learning on temporal graphs is an important step toward salable machine learning on real-world dynamic networks.

First of all, we apologize the typos, grammar mistakes and unclear notations. We will correct them in the final version. According to the feedback, we added several additional experiments and explanations in the revised version of our paper. The added/modified contents are marked by RED fonts so that other reviewers are also aware of the changes we made.\n\nOur response to the cons and questions are listed as below.\n\nTo Q1: \nThe attention mechanism employed by GAT is very different from our approach. And it is due to the different formulations that our approach works better than GAT as well as the enhanced version of GAT (GAT+T in Table 1,2,3) which operates by concatenating our time encoding to the node features. The detailed comparisons between the attention mechanism of our approach and the GAT are provided in Appendix A.2. Therefore, the major contribution of our work is the functional time encoding as well as the graph neural network architecture.\n\nTo Q2: \nThis is a great series of questions. Model interpretation remains to be a key challenge for deep learning models. We decide to look into the \u201cblack box\u201d by ad-hoc model analysis on the attention weights. We refer the reviewer to the new Section 4.6 (Attention Analysis) in the revised paper for the detailed results and analysis.  \n\nTo Q3: \nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out the improper use of \u201carchitect\u201d. We have replaced \u201carchitect\u201d with \u201carchitecture\u201d in the revised version.\n\nTo Q4.1: \nIt is true that the introduction on self-attention in Section 2 is not self-contained since we have assumed certain background knowledge from readers. In the revised version, we provide some additional introductions in Section 2 to build more connections between prior work and our approach.\n\nTo Q4.2: \nWe have mentioned in the first sentence of Section 3.1 that $d_T$ is the dimension of the time encoding functional space. And since we are using time encoding to replace the positional encoding in Eq1, we have implicitly assumed that $d_T=d_{pos}$. In the revised paper, we provide additional explanations in the beginning of Section 3.1 for better clarifications.\n\nTo Q4.3: \nWe agree that the statement original statement on \u2018reparameterization trick\u2019 is not rigorous, and we thank the reviewer for pointing this out. In the revised paper, we replace the statement with:\n\u201cHowever, the reparameterization trick is often limited to certain distributions such as the \u2019local-scale\u2019 family, which may not be rich enough for our purpose. For instance, when $p(\\omega)$ is multimodal it is difficult to construct the underlying distribution via direct reparameterizations.\u201d\nIndeed, the underlying distribution of $\\omega$ is unknown, so there is no way to justify if it is truly out of the range of direct reparameterization. Therefore, when selecting the appropriate distribution learning approach, we prefer models with higher complexity (larger parameter space in this case).  \n\nTo Q4.4:\nIn Eq6, the time $t$ is the target time at which we wish to obtain the embedding, and $t_i$ is the time when the target node interacts with its neighboring node $v_i$. Therefore, $t \u2013 t_i$ is the timespan between the target time and the prior interaction time of $v_0$ (target node) and $v_i$. \n\nFinally, we once again thank the reviewer for the time and efforts in reviewing our paper. Your feedbacks are very important for us improving our work. We look forward to further comments and discussions.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1457/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1457/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Inductive representation learning on temporal graphs", "authors": ["da Xu", "chuanwei ruan", "evren korpeoglu", "sushant kumar", "kannan achan"], "authorids": ["da.xu@walmartlabs.com", "ruanchuanwei@gmail.com", "ekorpeoglu@walmart.com", "skumar4@walmartlabs.com", "kachan@walmartlabs.com"], "keywords": ["temporal graph", "inductive representation learning", "functional time encoding", "self-attention"], "abstract": "Inductive representation learning on temporal graphs is an important step toward salable machine learning on real-world dynamic networks.

According to the feedback, we added several additional experiments and explanations in the revised version of our paper. The added/modified contents are marked by RED fonts so that other reviewers are also aware of the changes we made. \n\nThe additional experiments we conducted are:\n1.\tGraphSAGE-mean + time encoding (GraphSAGE+T) by concatenating time embedding with node features for all three tasks on all datasets (Table 1,2,3 in Page 8,9);\n2.\tGAT + time encoding (GAT+T) by concatenating time embedding with node features for all three tasks on all datasets (Table 1,2,3 in Page 8,9);\n3.\tSensitivity analysis on the number of heads and number of layers of the proposed TGAT (Figure 7c in Page 18).\n\nThe relevant explanation we added according to the feedback is:\n1.\tA detailed comparison between the attention mechanism of our approach and the GAT (Appendix A.2).\n\nOur analysis on the additional experiments are provided in Section 4.3 and 4.5 in the revised paper. In general, equipping GraphSAGE and GAT with our time encoding does lead to slightly improved performances uniformly across all tasks and datasets. However, the proposed TGAT still surpass the enhanced baselines with significant margins in most cases. On one hand, the results suggest that the time encoding have potential to help extend non-temporal graph representation learning methods to temporal settings. On the other, we see that the time encoding still works the best with our network architecture which is designed for temporal graphs.\n\nThe additional sensitivity analysis in Figure 7c suggests that using three attention heads with two layers gives the best performances. Using only a single head may suffer from under-fitting issues on the dataset we experimented on, since we observe increased metrics with using two and three heads. In all our experiments, we treat the number of heads as a tuning parameter, since its behavior may vary on different datasets\n\nFinally, we point out that there are significant differences between the attention mechanism employed by our approach and the GAT. The side-by-side comparisons between the two attention formulations as well as the justifications are provided in Appendix A.2. \n\nAgain, we express our gratitude to the reviewer for the time and effort in reviewing our paper. Your feedbacks are very important for us improving our work. We look forward to further comments and discussions.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1457/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1457/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Inductive representation learning on temporal graphs", "authors": ["da Xu", "chuanwei ruan", "evren korpeoglu", "sushant kumar", "kannan achan"], "authorids": ["da.xu@walmartlabs.com", "ruanchuanwei@gmail.com", "ekorpeoglu@walmart.com", "skumar4@walmartlabs.com", "kachan@walmartlabs.com"], "keywords": ["temporal graph", "inductive representation learning", "functional time encoding", "self-attention"], "abstract": "Inductive representation learning on temporal graphs is an important step toward salable machine learning on real-world dynamic networks.

Thus, it may be less applicable to nonstationary structural changes. To cope with nonstationarity, a straightforward idea is to parameterize the temporal encoding by using neural networks rather than RFF. In the authors' approach, the RFF is in a sense parameterized, because the frequencies omega are learned. Nevertheless, the stationarity limitation persists.\n\nQuestion: In the ablation study, what exactly is \"the original positional encoding\"? Are they learned embedding vectors?

That is, graphs where the topology can evolve over time. The contribution is a temporal graph attention (TGAT) layer aims to exploit learned temporal dynamics of graph evolution in tasks such as node classification and link prediction. This TGAT layer can work in an inductive manner unlike much prior work which is restricted to the transduction setting. Specifically, a temporal-kernel is introduced to generate time-related features, and incorporated into the self-attention mechanism. The results on some standard and new graph-structured benchmarks show improved performance vs a variety of baselines in both transduction and inductive settings. \n\nPros: \n+ Dynamic graphs are an important but challenging data structure for many problems. Improved methods in this area are welcome. \n+ Dealing with the inductive setting is an important advantage. \n+ Clear performance improvements on prior state of the art is visible in both transductive+inductive settings and node+edge related tasks.\n\nCons+Questions:\n1. Technical significance: Some theory is presented to underpin the approach, but in practice it seems to involve concatenating or adding temporal kernels element-wise to the features already used by GAT. In terms of implementation the concatenation in Eq 6 seems to be the only major change to GAT. I\u2019m not sure if this is a major advance.  \n2. Insight. The presented method apparently improves on prior work by learning something about temporal evolution and exploiting it in graph-prediction tasks. But it's currently rather black-box. It would be better if some insight could be extracted about *what* this actually learns. What kind of temporal trends exist in the data that this method has learned? And how are they exploited in by the prediction tasks?\n3. Writing. The English is rather flaky throughout. One particular recurring frustration is the use of the term \u201carchitect\u201d which seems wrong. Probably \u201carchitecture\u201d is the correct alternative. \n4. Clarity of explanation. The paper is rather hard to follow and ambiguous. A few specific things that are not explained so well: \n4.1. Eq 1+2 is not a sufficiently clear and self-contained recap of prior work. \n4.2. Symbol d_T used at the start of Sec 3.1 seems to be used without prior definition making it hard to connect to previous Eq1+2. \n4.3 The claim made about alternative approaches (Pg4) \u201cReparameterization is only applicable to local-scale distribution family, which is not rich enough\u201d. Seems both too vague and unjustified. \n4.4 The relationship between $t_i$ and the neighbours of the target node in Eq. 6 is not very clear.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1457/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1457/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Inductive representation learning on temporal graphs", "authors": ["da Xu", "chuanwei ruan", "evren korpeoglu", "sushant kumar", "kannan achan"], "authorids": ["da.xu@walmartlabs.com", "ruanchuanwei@gmail.com", "ekorpeoglu@walmart.com", "skumar4@walmartlabs.com", "kachan@walmartlabs.com"], "keywords": ["temporal graph", "inductive representation learning", "functional time encoding", "self-attention"], "abstract": "Inductive representation learning on temporal graphs is an important step toward salable machine learning on real-world dynamic networks.

We would like to point out several fundamental differences between our proposed functional time encoding and Time2Vec. \n\nFirstly, our time encoding is motivated by the harmonic analysis and comes with solid theoretical justifications and guarantees, where Time2Vec is more heuristic-driven. For learning the functional representation of time, we refer to the classical harmonic analysis to convert the challenge of learning functional time encoding to the kernel and distributional learning problems that have been established in machine learning literature. We then prove the stochastic uniform convergence property for our proposed approach. \n\nSecondly, by couping with self-attention, we propose a whole network architecture to effectively apply the functional time encoding to learn representations on temporal graphs. By the time of our submission, there is no evidence that Time2Vec can be adapted to learn representations for temporal graphs.\n\nWe want to thank the commentator for mentioning the recent survey on dynamic graphs.
