The fact that they are not great is not so bad by itself, and as the authors mention, it would be interesting to understand why this happens. But the fact that these results  were not in the paper (and in fact still are not there) is disturbing. Moreover, some claims in the paper look wrong in the light of these results, for example:\n- \"This suggests that our gains stem from the CC-GAN method rather than the use of a better architecture.\"\n- \"Since discrimination of real/fake in-paintings is more closely related to the target task of object classification than extracting a feature representation suitable for in-filling, it is not surprising that we are able to exceed the performance of Pathak et al. (2016) on PASCAL classification.\"\n\nThese statements, and possibly other parts of the paper, have to be updated. I think the paper cannot be published in its current form. Perhaps after a revision.\n\n--------\nInitial review:\n\nThe paper demonstrates an application of generative adversarial networks (GAN) to unsupervised feature learning. The authors show that the representation learned by the discriminator of a conditional GAN trained for image inpainting performs well on image classification. As a side-effect, fairly convincing inpaintings are produced.\n\nThe proposed method combines two existing ideas: using the discriminator of a GAN as a feature learner [Radford et al. 2015] and performing unsupervised feature learning with image inpainting [Pathak et al. 2016]. Therefore conceptual novelty of the paper is limited. On the plus side, the authors implement their idea well and demonstrate state-of-the-art results on STL-10 and good results on Pascal VOC (although Pascal experiments are incomplete, see below). Overall, I am in the borderline mode, and I will gladly raise the score if the authors address my concerns regarding the experiments.\n\n1) Experimental evaluation on Pascal VOC is not quite satisfactory. Comparison with prior work is unfair because the network architecture used by the authors (VGG) is different from the architecture used by all existing methods (AlexNet). It is great that the authors do not try to hide this fact in the paper, but I do not understand why the authors are not willing to simply run their method with AlexNet architecture, although two commenters asked them to do so. Such an experiment would strongly support authors\u2019 claims. Current reasoning that \u201cwe thought it reasonable to use more current models while making the difference clear\u201d is not convincing. It is great that better architectures lead to better results, but it is also very important to properly compare to prior work. On a related topic, Doersch et al. also tried using VGG architecture, would it be possible to compare to that? Yet another question: why are you not comparing to [Noroozi&Favaro, ECCV 2016] ? I would also like the authors to address the comment by Richard Zhang.\n\n2) Qualitative inpainting results are incomplete: comparison with previous methods (for instance, [Pathak et al 2016]) is missing, and it is impossible to compare different versions of the proposed method because different images are used for different variants. I realize there may be too little space in the main paper to show all the results, but many more results should be shown in the supplementary material. Quantitative results are missing. Currently the inpainting results are just interesting pictures to look at, but they do not add as much to the paper as they could.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Semi-Supervised Learning with Context-Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks", "abstract": "We introduce a simple semi-supervised learning approach for images based on in-painting using an adversarial loss.

This gap is much smaller that we saw with VGG architecture, and the absolute numbers are not competitive with other approaches. We still need to investigate why the AlexNet architecture didn't see as much of an improvement as the VGG architecture. The GAN training seemed to be stable, and the in-paintings suggest training didn't collapse, but they aren't visually as good as the VGG net ones (though we shouldn't read to much into this assessment). \n\nRegarding comparison with Noroozi&Favaro, ECCV 2016, this was an oversight on our part and we will include these results. We didn't realize they had applied their approach to pascal. Thanks for pointing this out.\n\nRegarding qualitative in-painting results, we didn't show comparisons with Pathak 2016 or others because our goal is not to do image in-painting. We apologize if this was unclear. Our in-painting results could possibly be improved by added a L1 or L2 loss in pixel space of feature space, but our goal is not in-painting so we didn't consider this. Rather, we only showed in-painting results as a way of better understanding our model and whether it was learning semantically meaningful in-paintings.

I can't see why the SSL-GAN can not be applied to the 64*64 and 96*96 version of the Pascal dataset (Table 3). If they have trouble training the vanilla GAN on Pascal even on the 64*64 image size, this should be mentioned in the paper and be explained. I am concerned about this specially because CC-GAN almost matches the SSL-GAN baseline on STL-10, and CC-GAN2, to me, seems like a hacky way to improve upon the core CC-GAN idea.

We haven't done a full comparison of our model with an alexnet architecture. Since this is an outdated architecture, we thought it reasonable to use more current models while making the difference clear. I do agree with that direct alexnet numbers would be more compelling, though we did try as much as possible to tease apart the differences stemming from method vs. architecture. \n\n2. We have not evaluated the performance of the encoder features in our model. Thanks for this suggestion, it would be a useful comparison. I can say that the encoder features would almost certainly be worse than the discriminator features just as a result of the architecture differences. The encoder model we used is based on the dcgan architecture which performs far below vgg-style nets on classification. Also, it is worth mentioning that Pathak et al (context-encoder work) tried to use an alexnet architecture as the encoder but were unable to successfully train the model with an adversarial loss (when using the adversarial loss -- for inpainting -- they used a different model and when using the alexnet model -- for representation learning -- they didn't use an adversarial lose). \n\n3. If we were to pass in the context and patch as two separate inputs then the network would be able to trivially find the points where they should match (by looking for the zero-ed out edges) making the problem much easier than if the completed image is passed in. Also, since we want the discriminator model to classify images there is an additional incentive to keep the input type as it would be for classification.

It is quite difficult to scale GAN training to larger images, particularly when the data distribution is diverse and labels are not available. For example, LSUN bedrooms and church datasets have been used to train GANs and the samples are of high quality. However, these models were trained on millions of images from the same class. More recently some methods have scaled GAN training to imagenet (eg. the work of Odena et al. submitted also to ICLR) and achieved impressive results. These results stem largely form their clever exploitation of label information. All of this is to say that, to the best of my knowledge, we still don't know how to generate large images with GANs in cases of diverse data and few labels. So, the context conditioning we propose in this paper is a way of changing the problem the discriminator is faced with in a simple way that facilitates training on larger images. \n\nI would actually disagree with your claim that \"Also CC-GAN2 only marginally improves upon the baseline.\"..STL-10 is a pretty over-worked dataset for semi-supervised learning , so I think a 2.39% improvement over the previous sota, and an even bigger gain over the ssl-GAN method (suggesting the context conditioning is important), is actually compelling.  \n\nRegarding SSL-GAN on PASCAL, at the time we had trouble training a vanilla GAN on PASCAL since the images were quite large. It's possible we could try again by introducing some of the more recent tricks for training GANs that have been proposed since we did this work. (Many of these tricks could of course also be combined with the CC-GAN method too). \n\nFigures 1 and 2 illustrate the model architectures which might elucidate the semi-supervised training. Apologies if this isn't wasn't clear initially. The discriminator has two 'heads', as you describe above: a sigmoid output indicating the probability an image is real of fake and another that is a K dimensional softmax over classes. You are correct in your understanding of the training: we train both jointly with a weighting between them (we weight them evenly, but this is of course a hyperparameter). We then continue to finetune the classifier head, which is what is being described by \"100 fine-tuned epochs and then fine-tune the discriminator on the 96x96 labeled images\". I hope this is now clear!\n\nAnd, finally, sorry for the empty link, it'll have the code soon!

We just wanted to clarify some of the numbers on Table 2 PASCAL VOC classification transfer tests.\n\nTable 4 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09842v1.pdf (column with \"frozen: none, fine-tuned: all\") shows a collection of previous methods. For many methods, two values are shown: with and without the Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl et al. ICLR 2016 rescaling method. In short, the method rescales the weights so that each layer \"learns\" at approximately the same rate, and in some cases, has been shown to improve fine-tuning performance. The method takes negligible time to run (a few minutes). The current literature understandably leads to some confusion, as some works concurrent to ICLR 2016 (e.g., Pathak et al. CVPR 16 and Noroozi&Favaro ECCV 16) did not quote the higher, rescaled value. However, we believe that from this point forward, for each previous method, either both numbers should be quoted, or just the higher, rescaled, value.\n\nOf these, the methods & PASCAL classification values for Agrawal et al. ICCV 15, Wang&Gupta ICCV 15, Doersch et al. ICCV 15, Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl et al. ICLR 2016, Pathak et al. CVPR 16, and Zhang et al.

I have a few questions from the authors: \n\nI am trying to understand the main contribution of this paper. The usefulness of the GAN discriminative features for semi-supervised learning is already established in previous works such as CatGAN, DCGAN and Salimans et al. This paper claims that the proposed super-resolution approach improves upon the naive way of using the GAN discriminator for semi-supervised learning (SSL-GAN). There are two sets of experiments on STL-10 and PASCAL. The paper mentions \"The SSL-GAN [baseline] performs almost as well as the CC-GAN\" on STL-10. Also CC-GAN2 only marginally improves upon the baseline. So I am not really convinced that the STL-10 experiment supports the main claim of the paper.\nRegarding the PASCAL dataset, I couldn't find the result of the SSL-GAN baseline on this dataset.\n\nAlso could you provide more details on how the training of semi-supervised objective is done? Suppose we have K classes. Is the output of discriminator a softmax over K classes and a sigmoid for the real/fake images? The cost function is the weighted average of semi-supervised and unsupervised costs and it seems like both costs are trained jointly from equation 8, but in the experiment section, it is mentioned \"We trained for 100 fine-tuned epochs and then fine-tune the discriminator on the 96x96 labeled images\".
