In this work the Hamiltonian dynamics has been used only for drawing samples to estimate the expectation of $Q$ values associated with next states. The Hamiltonian dynamics is completely decoupled from the $Q$ function iteration over time. \n\nThe Hamiltonian dynamics depend only on the state transition probability distribution - they have no dependency on the policy or the reward function. For a given transition probability kernel, we first define a target distribution function by multiplying the kernel with a smooth cut-off function (Please refer Eqn. 8). Then we define the \u201cPotential Energy\u201d of the Hamiltonian as\n\\begin{equation} U(s)  =  -\\log(\\mathcal{P}(s)) = \\frac{1}{2}(s-\\mu)^T\\Sigma^{-1}(s-\\mu) - \\frac{1}{2}\\log\\Big((2\\pi)^{D_s}\\det(\\Sigma)\\Big) - \\sum_{i=1}^{D_s}\\left[\\log\\Big(1+\\exp(-\\kappa (d^+_i-s^i))\\Big) + \\log\\Big(1+\\exp(-\\kappa (s^i-d^-_i))\\Big)\\right]\\end{equation}\n\nwhere, $\\mu$ and $\\Sigma$ correspond to the mean and variance of the transition probability kernel.  In the context of HMC $s$ is referred to as the position variable. The corresponding \u201cKinetic Energy\u201d is then defined as \n\n\\begin{equation} K(v)  =  -\\log(\\mathcal{P}(v|s))=\\frac{1}{2}v^TM^{-1} v = \\frac{1}{2}v^T\\Sigma v. \\end{equation}\n\nwhere $v$ is the momentum variable and $M=\\Sigma^{-1}$ corresponds to the mass/inertia matrix associated with the Hamiltonian. As the Hamiltonian is the sum of the kinetic and the potential energy, i.e. $H(s,v) = U(s) + K(v)$, the Hamiltonian dynamics can be expressed as\n\n\\begin{equation} \\dot{s} = \\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial v} = \\Sigma v \\end{equation}\n\nand\n\n\\begin{equation} \\dot{v} = - \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial s} = -\\Sigma^{-1}(s -\\mu) + \\kappa\\left[ S(-\\kappa(d^+-s)) - S(-\\kappa(s-d^-))\\right], \\end{equation}\n\nwhere $S(\\xi_1,\\cdots,\\xi_{D_s}) = \\big[S(\\xi_1),\\cdots,S(\\xi_{D_s})\\big]^T$ denotes element wise sigmoid function of the vector $\\xi$.\n\nWe initialize HMC sampling by drawing a random sample $s$ from the transition probability distribution and a new momentum variable $v$ from the multivariate Gaussian $ \\mathcal{N}(0, \\Sigma^{-1})$.\n\nWe integrate the Hamiltonian dynamics for $L$ steps with step size $\\Delta l$ to generate the trajectory from $(s,v)$ to $(s^{\\prime},v^{\\prime})$. To ensure that the Hamiltonian is conserved along the trajectory, we use a volume preserving symplectic integrator, in particular a leapfrog integrator which uses the following update rule to go from step $l$ to $l+\\Delta l$:\n\n$\\displaystyle v_{l+\\frac{\\Delta l}{2}}=v_l-0.5\\Delta l \\left.\\frac{\\partial U(s)}{\\partial s} \\right|_l,$\n\n$\\displaystyle s_{l+\\Delta l}=s_l+\\Delta l \\Sigma v_{l+\\frac{\\Delta l}{2}}$, and\n\n$\\displaystyle v_{l+{\\Delta l}}=v_l-0.5\\Delta l \\left.\\frac{\\partial U(s)}{\\partial s} \\right|_{l+\\Delta l}.$\n\nThen, following the Metropolis\u2013Hastings acceptance/rejection rule, this new proposal $(s^{\\prime}, v^{\\prime})$ is accepted with probability \n\n$\\min\\Big(1, \\exp\\left(H(s,v)-H(s^{\\prime},-v^{\\prime})\\right)\\Big)$. \n\nLet $\\mathcal{H}_t$ be the set of next states obtained via HMC sampling, i.e., position variables from the accepted set of proposals. Then we update $Q(s_t,a_t)$ using Eqn. 9.\n\nWe hope this answers your concern. If you think that this discussion would improve the clarity of our paper we can include in the next revision of our paper.\n\n**Update** We have added this discussion in Appendix E."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1987/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1987/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Hamiltonian Q-Learning: Leveraging Importance-sampling for Data Efficient RL", "authorids": ["~Udari_Madhushani1", "~Biswadip_Dey2", "~Naomi_Leonard1", "~Amit_Chakraborty2"], "authors": ["Udari Madhushani", "Biswadip Dey", "Naomi Leonard", "Amit Chakraborty"], "keywords": ["Data efficient RL", "$Q$-Learning", "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo"], "abstract": "Model-free reinforcement learning (RL), in particular $Q$-learning is widely used to learn optimal policies for a variety of planning and control problems.

It proposes to use Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo (HMC) to sample the next states (instead of IID samples) and matrix completion to learn a low-rank Q matrix. It shows theoretical convergence. Experiments on discretized problems (CartPole and an ocean sampling problem) show that HMC and low-rank learning can behave more benignly compared to IID samples.\n\nThere are several issues with the current manuscript.\n\n1. It can be applied to only tabular problems with known dynamics, which is restricted as many control problems are continuous, and their underlying dynamics are unknown. Q-learning can be applied in the RL setting, but not the method proposed in this paper.\n\n2. Some technical details are not clearly described:\n- What is the distribution used for Fig.1?\n- Why is the \\euler{P} in Eq.(5) necessary? Why not directly use \\mathbb{P} as in Eq.(7) and (8)?\n\n3. Experiments:\n- It seems that the covariance matrices are defined arbitrarily for both CartPole and Ocean experiments.\n- Do Fig.2(a) to (c) correspond to the same (optimal) actions? Or the optimal actions wrt their own Q values?\n- Fig.2(d) is not very informative as we can have zero consecutive difference yet the Q function is far from the true optimal Q. Showing distance to the optimal Q values would be more meaningful.\n- For the Ocean experiment, it is not clear how the action will affect the dynamic. More specifically, it is clear in Eq.(16) that the action $a$ will affect the state dynamic, but not for the ocean experiment equations on page 14.\n- More descriptions about the ocean sampling problem would be helpful for the readers to understand the task. It seems that only the first term of the reward function on page 8 depends on the state (not sure where the action fits in this equation).\n\n4. Paper organization.

The Hamiltonian sampling approach requires knowing the distribution in advance. How is this possible in our setting? If we are estimating this distribution, then since it is high dimensional, we still need large amount of data. This is the most confusing point from my point of view.\n2. As for the matrix completion approach: why is this reasonable? Why does the Q-table have low-rank property?

For classical control tasks, stochasticity in the state transition arises from parameter uncertainties, measurement noise and external disturbances - thus it is reasonable to assume that we know the state transition probability distribution up to a constant. \n\n--- **Assumption on Low-rank Structure of the $Q$ matrix:** This assumption exploits the fact that the underlying state transition and reward function are endowed with some structure in a large class of problems. Prior work on value function approximation based approaches for reinforcement learning also leveraged a similar assumption implicitly while using various basis functions (e.g. CMAC, radial basis functions, diffusion wavelets etc.).  More recently, Yang et. al. (\"Harnessing Structures for Value-Based Planning and Reinforcement Learning\", ICLR 2020) have empirically shown that the $Q$-matrices for benchmark Atari games and classical control tasks exhibit low-rank structure. We have included a brief description of the rationale behind this assumption in Section 2.3 (Low-rank Structure in $Q$-learning and Matrix Completion) of our revised manuscript. Furthermore, the definition of the low rank structure does not depend on the policy; we can use exhaustive sampling to calculate optimal $Q^*$ and examine the low rank structure of that matrix.

We have added theoretical and experimental results on sampling complexity.", "comment": "Thank you for your feedback and insightful comments! In the following, we address your concerns individually.\n\n--- **Preliminaries Section:** We have made significant changes in Section 2 to improve its readability as well as to connect it with the subsequent sections. After providing a brief discussion on MDP and $Q$ learning, we first identify the need for an efficient algorithm before introducing the concept of HMC sampling in this revised version. We have also reorganized Section 2.2 to keep the discussion on HMC more focussed and connected with the rest of the paper. In Section 2.3, we have also added a short discussion to highlight the motivation behind assuming the low-rank structure; we expect that this discussion would be helpful in emphasizing the relevance of matrix completion techniques in this context.\n\n--- **Reasoning related to IID Sampling:** We assume that the distribution is known only upto a constant. Drawing IID samples from such distributions, especially when they are high-dimensional, is computationally very expensive. This motivates the use of HMC sampling for estimating the expected $Q$-value associated with the next states. In this revised version, we have edited and rephrased the reasoning in the paragraph before Section 3.1 to make this aspect less ambiguous. \n\n--- **Theoretical Results and their Novelty:** In addition to our initial theoretical results on convergence guarantees under HMC sampling and boundedness guarantees under matrix completion with HMC sampling, we have incorporated an theoretical result (Theorem 3) on sampling complexity of our algorithm in the revised version. We show that sampling complexity of our algorithm matches the lower bound of min-max sampling complexity. Also, to improve the flow of Section 3.3 and clarity of the contribution of this work, we have added brief descriptions to complement the mathematical details in Theorem 1, 2, and 3. Please see Section 3.3 and Appendix B for the related changes. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work to show convergence of $Q$ function under Hamiltonian sampling. This is the first work to analyze the sampling complexity under HMC sampling with matrix completion.\n\n--- **Connection with Proximal Methods:** We apologize for not addressing the connection of our method to proximal methods in this revision. We will add this discussion in the 2nd revision that we will upload within the next two days.\n\n--- **Minor Comments:** We have added the missing references in the related work section of the revised paper.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1987/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1987/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Hamiltonian Q-Learning: Leveraging Importance-sampling for Data Efficient RL", "authorids": ["~Udari_Madhushani1", "~Biswadip_Dey2", "~Naomi_Leonard1", "~Amit_Chakraborty2"], "authors": ["Udari Madhushani", "Biswadip Dey", "Naomi Leonard", "Amit Chakraborty"], "keywords": ["Data efficient RL", "$Q$-Learning", "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo"], "abstract": "Model-free reinforcement learning (RL), in particular $Q$-learning is widely used to learn optimal policies for a variety of planning and control problems.

We have shown that Hamiltonian $Q$-Learning can be incorporated with DDPG, highlighting its scope beyond tabular problems.", "comment": "Thank you for the constructive feedback! In the following, we address your concerns individually.\n\n--- **Applicable to only tabular problems with known dynamics:** Although we have used a finite MDP and a tabular $Q$ function, there is an underlying continuous dynamics. The discrete transition probability distribution that has been used for HMC sampling is also obtained by discretizing an underlying continuous transition distribution. Furthermore, our new experiments on sampling complexity highlights that Hamiltonian $Q$-Learning can be seamlessly incorporated with DDPG to improve its data efficiency (please refer Fig 3 and 4); it shows that our approach can be used for problems with continuous actions. In addition, we do not assume an explicit knowledge about the state transition dynamics; we only need access to a simulator that can generate next states from a given state-action pair. \n\n--- **Distribution used for Fig 1:** We used a Half normal distribution for the illustration in Fig 1.\n\n--- **Use of \u201c\\euler{p}\u201d in Eqn 5:** In this work we assume that the finite MDP corresponds to an underlying continuous dynamics that have been discretized to define the finite MDP. Therefore we generate a discrete transition probability distribution from the corresponding continuous transition distribution.\n\n--- **Choice of Covariance Matrices for Numerical Experiments:** In our simulation results, we chose variance $\\sigma$ in each dimension such that the range of the state space along the corresponding dimension is $3\\sigma$ in each direction. Thus our results illustrate that Hamiltonain $Q$-Learning converges to $\\epsilon$-optimal policies with significantly less number of samples even under high uncertainty in state transition. In our numerical experiments, uncertainty in state transition (covariance) corresponds to parameter variations, measurement noise and external disturbances. Thus we show that Hamiltonain $Q$-Learning archives desired control objective even under high variations, noise and disturbances. \n\n--- **Fig 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c):** Yes, all three figures correspond to the same (optimal) action.\n\n--- **Fig 2(d):** Figure 2(d) shows convergence of the $Q$ function. We agree with the reviewer that it does not show the accuracy of the converged $Q$ function. However, as explained in the previous comment since heat maps provided in figures (a) (c) have the same (optimal) action this shows the accuracy of the converged $Q$ function. As per reviewer\u2019s suggestion we will replace figure (d) with a figure showing the error between $Q^t$ and optimal $Q^*$ in the 2nd revision that we are planning to upload within the next two days.\n\n---  **For the ocean experiment it is not clear how the action affects the dynamic:** We apologize for the confusion. Action appears in the dynamic equations of the glider given in Appendix D. Last row of the matrix \\tau contains the action $a$. We had accidentally written that as $u$ in the previous version. We have corrected that in the revised version. Please refer to the work of Rafael & Degani (\u201cA Single-Actuated Swimming Robot: Design, Modelling, and Experiments\u201d, Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems 2019) for more details.\n\n--- **More details would be helpful for ocean sampling example:** We apologize for not adding more details for the ocean sampling in this version. We will add it to the revised version we are planning to post within the next two days.\n\n--- **Paper organization in experimental results:** As per your suggestion we have included all the simulation results in Section 4 of this revised version.\n\n--- We have addressed your minor comments in our revised manuscript."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1987/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1987/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Hamiltonian Q-Learning: Leveraging Importance-sampling for Data Efficient RL", "authorids": ["~Udari_Madhushani1", "~Biswadip_Dey2", "~Naomi_Leonard1", "~Amit_Chakraborty2"], "authors": ["Udari Madhushani", "Biswadip Dey", "Naomi Leonard", "Amit Chakraborty"], "keywords": ["Data efficient RL", "$Q$-Learning", "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo"], "abstract": "Model-free reinforcement learning (RL), in particular $Q$-learning is widely used to learn optimal policies for a variety of planning and control problems.

In the following, we address your concerns individually.\n\n--- **Ambiguity about equation (3)(9):** In fact, the Hamiltonian introduced in Section 2.2 is not related to the Q-value iteration over time steps governed by the Bellman equation (3)(9). The Hamiltonian dynamics is instead used for drawing samples from the distribution of future states for a given state-action pair. In this formulation, the \"potential energy\" is defined as the negative logarithm of the distribution of future states and the \"kinetic energy\" is defined as the quadratic function of an auxiliary variable which is drawn from a multivariate Gaussian distribution.\n\n--- **Experiments:** We have included additional experimental results in the revised version of our manuscript. We have carried out additional experiments to highlight the impact of using HMC sampling (instead of evaluating all possible next states) when DQN, Dueling DQN or DDPG is used for learning the optimal policy. Our results show that Hamiltonian $Q$-Learning needs a significantly smaller number of samples to converge to an $\\epsilon$-optimal $Q$ function. In addition, we have also included results for the Acrobot stabilization task. Please see Section 4.1 and 4.2 for these changes.\n\n--- **Assumption on Low-rank Structure of the $Q$ matrix:** This assumption exploits the fact that the underlying state transition and reward function are endowed with some structure in a large class of problems. Prior work on value function approximation based approaches for reinforcement learning also leveraged a similar assumption implicitly while using various basis functions (e.g. CMAC, radial basis functions, diffusion wavelets etc.).  More recently, Yang et. al. (\"Harnessing Structures for Value-Based Planning and Reinforcement Learning\", ICLR 2020) have empirically shown that the $Q$-matrices for benchmark Atari games and classical control tasks exhibit low-rank structure. We have included a brief description of the rationale behind this assumption in Section 2.3 (Low-rank Structure in $Q$-learning and Matrix Completion) of our revised manuscript.\n\n--- **Analysis in Section 3.3:** In addition to our initial theoretical results on convergence guarantees under HMC sampling and boundedness guarantees under matrix completion with HMC sampling, we have incorporated an theoretical result (Theorem 3) on sampling complexity of our algorithm in the revised version.  We show that sampling complexity of our algorithm matches the lower bound of min-max sampling complexity. Also, to improve the flow of Section 3.3 and clarity of the contribution of this work, we have added brief descriptions to complement the mathematical details in Theorem 1, 2, and 3.

", "review": "\nStrengths:\n\n1) To my knowledge, this is the first credible effort to apply Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to Q learning in order to avoid some degree of the random sampling required for its almost sure convergence. At least the algorithm novelty is apparent.\n\n2) The experiments clearly demonstrate the merits of the proposed importance sampling scheme for obtaining improved convergence of Q learning, and for yielding coverage of the space comparable to exhaustive sampling. \n\n3) The idea of using importance sampling *during* training is a key distinguishing feature from a majority of other works which use it for, upon the basis of a fixed prior policy, improving the current policy.\n\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n\n1) The preliminaries section is disjoint/fragmented. The limitations of Q learning (equation (1)) should directly motivate use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) in Section 2.2, but instead the manner in which HMC is presented is as additional preliminary material. This is not inherently disqualifying, but a number of exotic terms are introduced in the ``preliminaries\" Section 2.2 without explanation or otherwise connection to the RL problem, such as momentum variable, leapfrog integrator, Hamiltonian, etc. Why are these entities pertinent to MDPs and Q learning? This needs to be more carefully and conscientiously connected. A similar comment is true for Section 2.3 -- matrix completion or the need for addressing matrix estimation problems is nowhere to be found in 2.1 and 2.2, which leaves the reader confused as to why matrix completion is being discussed. This overall disjointedness then makes the conceptual innovation of this work more mysterious to understand, which is a concern. \n\n2) The reasoning in the paragraph before Section 3.1 seems incorrect. The fact that samples in a limited pool of IID samples concentrate around the region with high\nprobability density is not evidence that this is a poor estimate for the expected value, but rather that the expected value is not representative of a uniform distribution across  the space. Thus, I think the authors might have intended to  be talking about higher-order moments of this conditional distribution, such as the skewness, kurtosis, etc. or otherwise risk measures such as CVaR.\n\n3) The main convergence theory (Theorems 1-2) do not exhibit any discernible complexity or sample efficiency gains over vanilla Q learning. Moreover, a coherent discussion of the technical innovations required to establish these theorems is absent from the manuscript. These limitations alone are very concerning.\n\n4) The matrix completion step (equations (9)-(10) is playing the role of a proximal operator on the Q learning update, or otherwise some projection of the Bellman error onto a low-dimensional subspace of features. Therefore, the steps conducted in Section 3.2 are very similar mathematically to entropic regularization, which may also be seen as a special case of a proximal operator on the space of Q functions. This connection is not made in the paper, as well as the more computational/statistical motivation for where the matrix competition step comes from. I strongly suggest the authors consider better explaining the links between step (4) of Algorithm 1 and proximal methods in any revision of this work.\n\n5) Proofs seem fairly routine in my reading. What is new or innovative here? Again, this is not explained anywhere.\n\n\nMinor Comments:\n\n\n1) References missing on distributional/representational aspects of Q learning:\n\nDearden, R., Friedman, N., & Russell, S.
