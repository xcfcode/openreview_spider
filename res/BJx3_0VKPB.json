I am inclined to reject this paper. \n\nSupporting argument:\n1. The authors use quite small dataset (also non-standard) for evaluation. It might be better to evaluate on some standard large-scale language model datasets. \n2. As mentioned in  Section 5.5, the proposed approach is not generalized to other countries. \n3. Since the task is language generation, the use of bias-amplification in embedding space is not well justified. \n4. What are the words used in the Fair Region?\n5. In section 3, the V, G of memory are not used. What's the output of FairRegion function?\n\nAdditional feedback:\n1. The usage of notation, citation is quite poor. \n- The usage of \\citep and \\cite are different.\n- In Table 1, what are PERU-MEXICO, MEXICO-PERU models?\n- Section2 -> Section 2"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1225/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1225/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On the Unintended Social Bias of Training Language Generation Models with News Articles", "authors": ["Omar U.

The automatic text generation is done by a sequence-to-sequence-model using word embeddings. The pattern of these embeddings in an multi-dimensional space can be associated with the stereotypes found in the corpora the models are trained on. To mitigate this bias the authors combine the network with a memory module storing additional gender information. This approach is inspired by the memory module used by Kaiser et al. (2017) to remember rare events, replacing the vector to track the age of items with a key representing the gender. \nThe proposed network architecture (\"Seq2Seq+FairRegion\") is evaluated using the bias score presented by Zhao et al. (2017) and compared to the sequence-to-sequende-models \"Seq2Seq2\" by Sutskever, Vinyals and Lee (2014) and \"Seq2Seq+Attention\" by Bahdanau, Cho and Bengio (2015).\n\nBesides some typographical errors (\"work embedding\") the paper is overall well written but unfortunately the flow of the text could be improved to make it easier to follow. The authors should perhaps consider to explain the structure of the paper in the introduction. There are some errors according the brackets of the in-text citations which should be corrected. \nThe two figures both illustrate the memory module and could be easily combined to one because the second figure just adds the encoding stage of the architecture. The caption of figure 1 could be used to further explain the \"Fair Region\" in the text (section 2). In section 4 the authors explain how to compute the bias score. Because these calculations are used to evaluate their methods, this section should perhaps be a subsection to section 5 (\"experiments\").\nTo evaluate the proposed method the authors use newspaper articles from Chile, Peru and Mexiko and compare the bias amplification metric for the trained models. The results are shown for the datasets from Peru and Mexico (Chile is missing) with a larger bias amplification for the Peru dataset. It could be justified more clearly why the experiments compare the bias amplification scores of different countries while the main focus of the paper is to mitigate gender bias in general.\n\nWhile this is an important topic, the contribution is rather minor and not well presented. Specifically the experiements should be extended."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1225/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1225/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On the Unintended Social Bias of Training Language Generation Models with News Articles", "authors": ["Omar U.
