Each transaction is fully described by a representation of the customer, product, price, and date that are involved.\n\nThe paper is interesting and I recommend acceptance. I also have some questions:\n\n+ Why is the representation of the product chosen as an average of the word embeddings of the product name? Would it be possible to learn the embedding vector of each product? Also, is this a pre-fitted word embedding?\n\n+ I didn't understand why you need to add a reconstruction loss in the ec2GAN. Can you give some motivation?\n\n+ The comment about the ecGAN ignoring outliers (Fig. 1c) seems a bit fishy to me. If it learns the true data density, then the area of outliers should have small but positive probability, such that on average we should expect as many \"outliers\" in that area as the proportion in the original dataset.\n\n+ I didn't understand how the ec2GAN can be used to predict the purchase volume of a new product. I see it is straightforward to characterize the customers from generated data, but how can it be used to determine the demand?\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "eCommerceGAN: A Generative Adversarial Network for e-commerce", "abstract": "E-commerce companies such as Amazon, Alibaba, and Flipkart process billions of orders every year.
