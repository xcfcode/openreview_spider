We would like to emphasize that the main goal of our paper is to introduce the use of Bayesian inference framework aiming a novel robust deep metric learning against noisy labels. As mentioned in the paper, our main contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\n Represent a triplet-based deep metric learning using Bayesian inference to introduce more robust feature spaces for several learning tasks (including classification, retrieval).\n\nEmploy the variational inference framework (Blundell et al., 2015) to efficiently sample from a Bayesian neural network using backpropagation technique. \n\nProvide theoretical as well as empirical guarantees for the robustness training under label noise of the proposed method.\n\nR4: (label information was not considered) \n\nResponse: In our model, the label information is actually used to form the triplet, to define a noisy label triplet, and then triplet loss (Sec. 3.1). In particular, a triplet consists of an anchor, a positive sample (that has the same label), and a negative sample (that has a different label).\n\nR4: (Lack of sufficient analysis to show that your method is robust to label noise)\n\nResponse: The theoretical results in Theorem 1 indicate that our proposed method is robust against label noise given a particular noise level (presented by the number of noisy label triplets in the problem setup) in the sense of the Bayesian inference framework. Without those results, we can not guarantee that the learning performance won\u2019t be significantly affected, even with a small noise level -- this is crucial due to the sensitivity of deep models under noisy labels.\n\nR4: (Experimental results are not satisfying)\n\nResponse: The experimental results in our paper consistently show that our proposed method provides better classification and retrieval performances with respect to several types of noisy labels compared to the baselines, especially when the noise level increases. We believe that those results convincingly support  the main claims of our paper,  \n\n[1] Robustness and Generalization for Metric Learning\n\n[2] Deep Metric Learning: The Generalization Analysis and an Adaptive Algorithm. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1811/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1811/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Bayesian Metric Learning for Robust Training of Deep Models under Noisy Labels", "authorids": ["~Toan_Tran1", "v.hieuvt11@vinai.io", "~Gustavo_Carneiro1", "~Hung_Bui1"], "authors": ["Toan Tran", "Hieu Vu", "Gustavo Carneiro", "Hung Bui"], "keywords": ["Noisy labels", "Deep metric learning", "Bayesian inference", "Variational inference"], "abstract": "Label noise is a natural event of data collection and annotation and has been shown to have significant impact on the performance of deep learning models regarding accuracy reduction and sample complexity increase.

Wang & Tan only focus on a simple linear Mahalanobis distance that can not capture the nonlinear relationship of data points in deep metric learning. Moreover, directly applying the idea of Wang & Tan for deep metric learning is challenging due to the complexity of the sampling task in the parameter space. We, therefore, adapt the Bayesian linear metric learning to propose the Bayesian deep metric learning that is robust against noisy labels. The variational inference (Blundell et al. 2015) is employed in our framework targeting an effective parameter sampling procedure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretically sound Bayesian deep metric learning that is robust against noisy labels. \n\nR2: (Role of the results of Theorem 1) \n\nResponse: The theoretical results in Theorem 1 indicate that our proposed method is robust against label noise given a particular noise level (presented by the number of noisy label triplets in the problem setup) in the sense of the Bayesian inference framework. Without those results, we can not guarantee that the learning performance won\u2019t be significantly affected, even with a small noise level -- this is crucial due to the sensitivity of deep models under noisy labels.\n\nR2: (Robustness in [1] and [2]) \n\nResponse: First, we would like to emphasize that the main idea of our paper is to introduce the use of Bayesian inference targeting a robust deep metric learning under noisy labels, while both [1] & [2] do not take the robustness against noisy labels into account. \n\nWe agree with the reviewer that the definition of the robustness of metric learning in those papers is interesting since they can provide an explicit generalization bound. However, they are not associated with the robustness under noisy labels considered in our paper. We, therefore,  plan to work on a more concrete definition/verification robustness based on those papers, e.g., to provide an upper bound for the generalization error when training with noisy labels. \nWe will add that to the revised version of our paper with the clarification above.\n\n[1] Robustness and Generalization for Metric Learning\n\n[2] Deep Metric Learning: The Generalization Analysis and an Adaptive Algorithm. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1811/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1811/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Bayesian Metric Learning for Robust Training of Deep Models under Noisy Labels", "authorids": ["~Toan_Tran1", "v.hieuvt11@vinai.io", "~Gustavo_Carneiro1", "~Hung_Bui1"], "authors": ["Toan Tran", "Hieu Vu", "Gustavo Carneiro", "Hung Bui"], "keywords": ["Noisy labels", "Deep metric learning", "Bayesian inference", "Variational inference"], "abstract": "Label noise is a natural event of data collection and annotation and has been shown to have significant impact on the performance of deep learning models regarding accuracy reduction and sample complexity increase.

This is a significant extension to existing Bayesian deep learning approaches, which have focused on regression and classification approaches with vanilla L2 and cross entropy losses.\n\n# pros:\n\n- The proposed method appears to be first to soundly combine deep metric learning with a Bayesian approach (Bayes by Backprop) to estimate parameter uncertainties. \n\n- In an extensive evaluation, the method is shown to deal well with highly noisy labels (up to 50%) in classification tasks like MNIST and CIFAR-10. In high noise setups, the method is shown to outperform linear Bayesian metric learning, as well as deep point estimate metric learning.\n\n- The paper is clearly written\n\n# cons:\n\n- The method is not evaluated against the state of the art on the evaluated datasets, albeit the authors give a convincing reason for this, namely that the methodological novelty of the proposed approach warrants proof-of-concept results with a relatively simple neural network architecture\n\n# comments:\n\n- It would be interesting to hear in more detail what motivated the authors' choice of Blundell's approach to uncertainty estimation as compared to e.g. the Dropout- / Deep Gaussian Process-based works by Yarin Gal et al. \n\n- The abstract mentions \"simulated label noise\" as something the authors have considered, whereas the experiments mention \"synthetic\" and \"realistic label noise\", and conclusion refers to \"simulated label noise\" in the context of future work. Could the authors please clarify, and add a more thorough description of the respective types of noise?\n\n- I wasn't able to fully follow the theoretical derivation of the authors on how the approach of Blundell et al.

Different from BLMNN that only considers a linear metric learning, the authors\u2019 framework can handle non-linear deep metric learning, which is useful for many real-life applications.

Instead, The author adapt the variational inference by Blundell et al. (Blundell et al., 2015), which allows to efficiently sample the parameters of a Bayes neural networks by using a backpropagation-compatible algorithm. They also theoretically show the robustness of the proposed method when working with label noise. The experimental results on several noisy data sets show that their novel proposed method can generalize better compared to the linear BLMNN (Wang & Tan, 2018) and the point estimation-based deep metric learning (Hoffer & Ailon, 2015; Lu et al., 2017), especially when the noise level increases.

Directly applying the variational Bayes learning (Wang & Tan, 2018) in deep learning is challenging since it requires sampling from a distribution of the neural network parameters. Instead, this paper adapts the variational inference by Blundell et al. (Blundell et al., 2015), which allows to efficiently sample the parameters of a Bayes neural networks by using a backpropagation-compatible algorithm. The experimental results on several noisy data sets show that our novel proposed method can generalize better compared to the linear BLMNN (Wang & Tan, 2018) and the point estimation-based deep metric learning (Hoffer & Ailon,\n2015; Lu et al., 2017), especially when the noise level increases.\n\nPros:\n1.  This paper is well-organized and well-written.\n2.  Adapting the variational inference by Blundell et al. (Blundell et al., 2015) for Bayesian DML sounds good.\n3.  The theoretical analysis is completed (though meaningless)\n\nCons:\n1.\tThe novelty is limited (just using sliding window to instead growing window). It is more like a combination of variational inference (Blundell et al., 2015) and DML.\n2.\tThe results of Theorem 1 are meaningless. Some papers [1] Robustness and Generalization for Metric Learning. and [2] Deep Metric Learning: The Generalization Analysis and an Adaptive Algorithm. may help you to understand this point.
