We especially appreciate that all reviewers find that the problem being investigated is interesting. \nWe summarize our main contributions to address common concerns in this post, and provide more details in the responses to each reviewer.\n\nTo avoid clutter, we use the following abbreviated phrases:\n\"sensitivity\" means \"the sensitivity of adversarial robustness to input data distributions\".\n\"clean accuracy\" means \"prediction accuracy of the standardly trained model on natural examples\".\n\"robust accuracy\" means \"prediction accuracy of the adversarially trained model on adversarial examples\".\n\nOur main contribution is the discovery that the robust accuracy of adversarially trained models is very sensitive to input data distributions, which is previously unnoticed in the literature and in sharp contrast to the steady clean accuracy in the standard learning setting. In theory, we show regular Bayes error's invariance and robust error's sensitivity to input distribution shift. We also show that if the data is uniformly distributed in a unit cube, then the perfect decision boundary cannot be robust. On the other hand, for the binary MNIST dataset, we found a provably robust classifier, using the algorithm by Kolter and Wong (2017), which guarantees 97% robust accuracy under 0.3 \\ell_infty perturbation. Such contrast motivates us to design systematic experiments (smoothed MNIST and saturated CIFAR in the paper) to investigate the dependence of adversarial robustness on the input data distributions, which empirically demonstrates the sensitivity. \n\nWe admit (also in the paper) that we don't have a definitive explanation or remedy for such sensitivity. Section 5 is only an initial attempt, and we do not consider it as the main contribution of the paper. We examined some natural hypotheses. We found highly correlated factors, but they don't fully explain the phenomenon, which suggests the absence of obvious solutions. We report these results not to make conclusive claims, but to hope to inspire future research in this direction. \n\nWe believe that solely by itself our discovery of the sensitivity is a significant contribution, and it has an important implication in both practice and theory. In practice, our finding raises questions on how to properly evaluate the adversarial robustness of different learning algorithms. Benchmarking adversarial robustness on only a few datasets may not be reliable due to such sensitivity. In theory, our finding opens a new angle for understanding the cause of \"lack of robustness\". More specifically, Schmidt et al. (2018) show that different data distributions could have drastically different properties of adversarially robust generalization. Our finding indicates that gradual semantics-preserving transformations of data distribution can also cause large changes to datasets' achievable robustness. Tsipras et al. (2018) hypothesize the existence of the intrinsic tradeoff between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. Our work complements this result, by showing different levels of tradeoffs for different input data distributions.\n\nIn summary, we would like to emphasize that the main contribution of this paper is discovering and firmly demonstrating the existence of the sensitivity both in theory and in experiments, which we believe solely by itself is important in practice and understanding the phenomenon of adversarial examples. Although we don't have a definitive explanation or remedy for it, our paper is a starting point for future lines of research around this topic.\nWe have improved the introduction of the paper to make this message more direct.

Just to avoid possible misunderstanding, let us first clarify our finding in this paper: the sensitivity of adversarial robustness to the input data distribution D. Assume that R is the adversarial robustness of the method of adversarial training on D. Now consider a semantic-lossless shift of D, say D'. Again we train a model on the training data sampled from D', and test its adversarial robustness R' on the test set again sampled from D' too. We find that R' can be significantly different from R. We have improved the introduction to make this point more clear.\n\nSo, in our terminology, there is no adversarial input presentation. D' is just a common 'semantic-lossless' shift of D in the paper, without being against adversarial training.\n\n\n--------\n>> \"Unfortunately, the empirical part of the paper is weakened by an over-reliance of (custom perturbations of ) the popular MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets (which are themselves based on larger sets). Furthermore, the basic conclusion as to causes and remedies of lack of robustness is not evident, and it is not evident that it has been sufficiently investigated. Shape yes, differences in perturbable volume not (how does that concur with Section 2?), and inter-class distance also not. Are we to base these conclusions on 2 perturbed datasets? \"\n\nWe have two sets of experiments in this paper, one in Section 3 and one in Section 5. We are not sure which one this review corresponds to.\n\nAs mentioned above, the purpose of Section 3 is to demonstrate the existence of the sensitivity. The transformations (semantic-lossless shifts) in this section are common and are not designed to overthrow the adversarial robustness. We believe our experimental results in this section is sufficiently significant to prove the existence of such sensitivity. Furthermore, the gamma correction in Section 4 is a common transformation in image processing, which also demonstrates the sensitivity.\n \nOn the other hand, we agree with the reviewer that results in Section 5 are not evident enough to conclude about the causes and remedies. In fact, it is exactly because of this that we only make conservative claims in this section. As mentioned above, Section 5 is an initial attempt, and we do not consider it as the main contribution of this paper. Although we don't have a definitive answer for the problem, we believe that our findings in this paper should be noticed by the adversarial example community and it is already sufficiently significant and important for a publication.\n\nLastly, let us also clarify our statements on perturbable volume and inter-class distance in Section 5. We found that they are both correlated with robust accuracy. However, when we examine whether they are decisive factors for robustness, counterexamples exist for both of them. We therefore made inconclusive statements highlighting the complexity of the problem. We faithfully report our investigations in this section, and we hope that they can inspire future research around this topic. \n\nIn case our responses above do not address your concerns, it would be nice if you can clarify them further. \n\n\n--------\n>> \"How are readers to synthesize the final conclusion that robustness is a 'complex interaction of tasks and data', other than what they would already expect?\" \n\nWe do not intend to make this a \"final conclusion\". By \"complex interaction of tasks and data\", we only want to make a remark on the sample complexity difference between binarized MNIST and binarized CIFAR10. Our intention is to truthfully report to the readers that although binarization largely affects robustness, it does not decide every aspect of it.

The theoretical parts of the paper, assigning lack of adversarial robustness to the shape of the input distribution (Section 2) is the strongest part of the paper, adding some simple and important insights.

Furthermore, the basic conclusion as to causes and remedies of lack of robustness is not evident, and it is not evident that it has been sufficiently investigated.
