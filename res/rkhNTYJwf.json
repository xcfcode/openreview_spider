This paper aggregates embeddings for different hop neighbourhoods for a node by using an LSTM. Though the idea is interesting, there is no intuition why using an LSTM is a good idea. Please better explain this. \n2. The authors claim that \"the propagation from nodes at higher-depth proximity gets averaged-out multiple times before reaching the centre node\". Although, there is no evidence that this indeed is the reason for poor performance when using larger neighbourhoods. Please give either some intuition or empirical proof for this. \nThere are other unsubstantiated claims below:\n3. \"To boost training we apply this loss function at each time step of the LSTM instead of only the last layer.\" Please explain this. What is the performance if you do not do this. In short, please do an ablation study disentangling the improvement in performance by using an LSTM and this trick. \n4. \"We vary the number of nodes to be sampled for each level of proximity from 5 to 50 depending on the network\u2019s density\". This seems to be quite low for a size-k neighbourhood (for k >= 2). Please justify this choice. Is this because of computation reasons? What is the effect in performance if you further increase this?\nIn summary, although, the basic idea is interesting, it is not very innovative. Further, the lack of ablation studies and justification for some design choices puts this paper below the borderline.
