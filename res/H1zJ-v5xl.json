In particular, the authors still do not compare their model to the related and very recent ByteNet model. The link in the discussion in insufficient. Without this comparison and addressing the remaining minor comments, I am against acceptance of the manuscript.\n\nMajor comment\n=============\nQRNNs are closely related to PixelCNNs, which leverage masked dilated convolutional layers to speed-up computations. However, the authors cite ByteNet, which builds upon PixelCNN, only at the end of their manuscript and do not include it in the evaluation. The authors should cite PixelCNN already when introducing QRNN in the methods sections, and include it in the evaluation. At the very least, QRNN should be compared with ByteNet for language translation. How well does a fully convolutional model without intermediate pooling layers perform, i.e. what is the effect to the introduced pooling layers? Are their performance difference between f, fo, and ifo pooling? Did the authors investigate dilated convolutional layers?\n\n> You can find a ByteNet comparison, using results Nal Kalchbrenner provided during NIPS, above in our response to the official reviews. A fully convolutional model without pooling would not be able to solve the sentiment and translation tasks because it would have a short, fixed context length (i.e., it would be an n-gram model). We did not investigate dilated convolutions, likely the most important single component of the ByteNet model, but they are definitely a good area for future QRNN research.\n\n>> QRNNs should be compared in the manuscript to ByteNet. I disagree that a convolutional model is unsuited for sentiment classification of translation: by stacking multiple masked (dilated) convolutional layers, it will have a large receptive field and hence be able to efficiently take larger sequence context into account. This is the very idea of the ByteNet model.\n\n\nMinor comments\n==============\n1. How does a model without dense connections perform, i.e. what is the effect of dense connections? To illustrate dense connections, the authors might draw them in figure 1 and refer to it in section 2.1. \n\n> The main use for dense connections is to enable training of deeper QRNN models. Performance with and without dense connections was similar for three-layer networks, but a four-layer network without dense connections was significantly worse than a three-layer one while a four-layer network with dense connections was better. A three-layer QRNN has results comparable to a two-layer LSTM, while a two-layer QRNN is slightly worse. But these differences are on the order of small fractions of a percentage point, and are difficult to distinguish from random initialization effects, while the four-layer densely-connected QRNN was consistently better than any LSTM-based model we tried.\n\n>> I suggest to insert a table for figure in the appendix, which shows to which extent performance gains are accounted by either the new pooling layers, dense connections, or zone-out regularization. Otherwise it is unclear which components are actually relevant and if the new pooling layers help.\n\n\n2. The run-time results shown in figure 4 are very helpful, but as far as I understood, the breakdown shown on the left side was measured for language modeling (referred in 3.2), whereas the dependency on batch- and sequence size shown on the right side for sentiment classification (referred in 3.1). I suggest to consistently show the results for either sentiment classification or language modeling, or both. At the very least, the figure caption should describe the task explicitly. Labeling the left and right figure by a) and b) would further improve readability. \n\n> The left-hand part of the speed figure displays results for the forward and backward pass of all parts of a QRNN language model. The right-hand part reports speed ratios for the forward pass of the QRNN layer alone, compared to an equal-sized LSTM layer. This will be clarified in the text.\n\n>> Since each figure should stand on its own, this should be clarified in the figure caption. I also cannot see any changes in the text.\n\n\n3. Section 3.1 describes a high speed-up for long sequences and small batch sizes. I suggest motivating why this is the case. While computations can be parallelized along the sequence length, it is less obvious why smaller batch sizes speed-up computations.\n\n> It is not so much that smaller batch sizes speed up QRNN computations as that they slow down LSTM ones, even the fairly well optimized NVIDIA CUDNN LSTM kernels, largely because the recurrent weight matrix must be reloaded from memory between timesteps. (Baidu has released kernels for simple (non-LSTM) RNNs that work around this problem for small hidden sizes and specific models of GPU by caching the weight matrix on individual compute cores). This reloading wastes compute cycles, and the wasted cycles represent a larger fraction of total cycles when the batch size is relatively low or the sequence length is relatively high.\n\n>> This should be described in the text\n\n\n4. The proposed encoder-decoder attention is different from traditional attention in that attention vectors are not computed and used as input to the decoder sequentially, but on top of decoder output states in parallel. This should be described and motivated in the text.\n\n> There are a wide variety of attentional architectures in use for machine translation, with no one architecture holding a clear advantage over others. The architecture we chose for the QRNN MT experiment is most similar to Minh-Thang Luong's late-fusion dot product attention without \"input-feeding,\" as described in Luong et al. (2015). The motivation is to allow the QRNN layers to run in a fully timestep-parallel way during training, even if they can't during inference; any kind of input feeding would make this impossible, although it would likely result in slightly better performance.\n\n>> This should be motivated in the text and Luong et al. (2015) be cited.\n\n\nSentiment classification\n------------------------\n\n5. What was the size of the hold-out development set and how was it created? The text describes that data were split equally into training and test set, without describing the hold-out set.\n\n> We used a randomly selected 20% of the training set as a held-out development set to select hyperparameters, then set those hyperparameters in stone and retrained using the entire training set to compute test accuracy.\n\n>> Okay.\n\n\n6. What was the convolutional filter size?\n\n> We report results for filters of size two and size four, and didn't find any advantage to larger filters for word-level tasks.\n\n>> The filter size should be stated in the text.\n\n\n7. What is the speed-up for the best hyper-parameters (batch size 24, sequence length 231)?\n\n> The speedup for sentiment was about a factor of three, and this differs from the factor of about five shown in figure 4 because the dense connections between layers provide slightly more built-in parallelism (compared to the situation without dense connections, a larger fraction of the overall LSTM computation depends only on the input to each layer and can be run in parallel).\n\n>> The expected factor of ~3x should be mentioned in the figure caption and the text. I also suggest surrounding it in Figure 4.\n\n\n8. Figure 3 would be easier to interpret by actually showing the text on the y-axis. For the sake of space, one might use a smaller text passage, plot it along the x-axis, and show the activations of fewer neurons along the y-axis. Showing more examples in the appendix would make the authors\u2019 claim that neurons are interpretable even more convincing.\n\n> We tried a few different ways of presenting Figure 3 with corresponding text in the paper without much success, but an interactive version of the figure with text that shows up on hover is available on our blog at http://metamind.io/research/new-neural-network-building-block-allows-faster-and-more-accurate-text-understanding/.\n\n>> The linked interactive visualized does not show the text either and only a single example. More examples along with the text on the x-axis are needed to show that neurons learn interpretable patterns.\n\n\nLanguage modeling\n-----------------\n9. What was the size of the training, test, and validation set?\n\n> The training set of the Penn Treebank consists of 887521 words of running text, the validation set of 70390, and the test set of 78669.\n\n>> Okay.\n\n\n10. What was the convolutional filter size, denoted as \u2018k\u2019?\n\n> The convolutional filter size was two, and we didn't find any advantage to larger filters for word-level tasks.\n\n>> The filter size should be stated in the text, e.g. via \u2018k=2\u2019.\n\n\n11. Is it correct that a very high learning rate of 1 was used for six epochs at the beginning?\n\n> Yes, that is fairly standard in the language modeling literature and seems to work better than smaller learning rates.\n\n>> Okay.\n\n\n12.

However, the authors cite ByteNet, which builds upon PixelCNN, only at the end of their manuscript and do not include it in the evaluation. The authors should cite PixelCNN already when introducing QRNN in the methods sections, and include it in the evaluation. At the very least, QRNN should be compared with ByteNet for language translation.

The run-time results shown in figure 4 are very helpful, but as far as I understood, the breakdown shown on the left side was measured for language modeling (referred in 3.2), whereas the dependency on batch- and sequence size shown on the right side for sentiment classification (referred in 3.1). I suggest to consistently show the results for either sentiment classification or language modeling, or both. At the very least, the figure caption should describe the task explicitly. Labeling the left and right figure by a) and b) would further improve readability. \n\n3. Section 3.1 describes a high speed-up for long sequences and small batch sizes. I suggest motivating why this is the case. While computations can be parallelized along the sequence length, it is less obvious why smaller batch sizes speed-up computations.\n\n4.

How well does a fully convolutional model without intermediate pooling layers perform, i.e. what is the effect to the introduced pooling layers? Are their performance difference between f, fo, and ifo pooling? Did the authors investigate dilated convolutional layers?\nYou can find a ByteNet comparison, using results Nal Kalchbrenner provided during NIPS, above in our response to the official reviews.\nA fully convolutional model without pooling would not be able to solve the sentiment and translation tasks because it would have a short, fixed context length (i.e., it would be an n-gram model). We did not investigate dilated convolutions, likely the most important single component of the ByteNet model, but they are definitely a good area for future QRNN research.\n\n>>> 1. How does a model without dense connections perform?\nThe main use for dense connections is to enable training of deeper QRNN models. Performance with and without dense connections was similar for three-layer networks, but a four-layer network without dense connections was significantly worse than a three-layer one while a four-layer network with dense connections was better. A three-layer QRNN has results comparable to a two-layer LSTM, while a two-layer QRNN is slightly worse. But these differences are on the order of small fractions of a percentage point, and are difficult to distinguish from random initialization effects, while the four-layer densely-connected QRNN was consistently better than any LSTM-based model we tried.\n\n>>> 2. At the very least, the (speed) figure caption should describe the task explicitly. Labeling the left and right figure by a) and b) would further improve readability. \nThe left-hand part of the speed figure displays results for the forward and backward pass of all parts of a QRNN language model. The right-hand part reports speed ratios for the forward pass of the QRNN layer alone, compared to an equal-sized LSTM layer. This will be clarified in the text.\n\n>>> 3. Section 3.1 describes a high speed-up for long sequences and small batch sizes. I suggest motivating why this is the case. While computations can be parallelized along the sequence length, it is less obvious why smaller batch sizes speed-up computations.\nIt is not so much that smaller batch sizes speed up QRNN computations as that they slow down LSTM ones, even the fairly well optimized NVIDIA CUDNN LSTM kernels, largely because the recurrent weight matrix must be reloaded from memory between timesteps. (Baidu has released kernels for simple (non-LSTM) RNNs that work around this problem for small hidden sizes and specific models of GPU by caching the weight matrix on individual compute cores). This reloading wastes compute cycles, and the wasted cycles represent a larger fraction of total cycles when the batch size is relatively low or the sequence length is relatively high.\n\n>>> 4. The proposed encoder-decoder attention is different from traditional attention in that attention vectors are not computed and used as input to the decoder sequentially, but on top of decoder output states in parallel. This should be described and motivated in the text.\nThere are a wide variety of attentional architectures in use for machine translation, with no one architecture holding a clear advantage over others. The architecture we chose for the QRNN MT experiment is most similar to Minh-Thang Luong's late-fusion dot product attention without \"input-feeding,\" as described in Luong et al. (2015). The motivation is to allow the QRNN layers to run in a fully timestep-parallel way during training, even if they can't during inference; any kind of input feeding would make this impossible, although it would likely result in slightly better performance.\n\n>>> 5. What was the size of the hold-out development set for sentiment and how was it created? The text describes that data were split equally into training and test set, without describing the hold-out set.\nWe used a randomly selected 20% of the training set as a held-out development set to select hyperparameters, then set those hyperparameters in stone and retrained using the entire training set to compute test accuracy.\n\n>>> 6. What was the convolutional filter size?\nWe report results for filters of size two and size four, and didn't find any advantage to larger filters for word-level tasks.\n\n>>> 7. What is the speed-up for the best hyper-parameters (batch size 24, sequence length 231)?\nThe speedup for sentiment was about a factor of three, and this differs from the factor of about five shown in figure 4 because the dense connections between layers provide slightly more built-in parallelism (compared to the situation without dense connections, a larger fraction of the overall LSTM computation depends only on the input to each layer and can be run in parallel).\n\n>>> 8. Figure 3 would be easier to interpret by actually showing the text on the y-axis. For the sake of space, one might use a smaller text passage, plot it along the x-axis, and show the activations of fewer neurons along the y-axis. Showing more examples in the appendix would make the authors\u2019 claim that neurons are interpretable even more convincing.\nWe tried a few different ways of presenting Figure 3 with corresponding text in the paper without much success, but an interactive version of the figure with text that shows up on hover is available on our blog at http://metamind.io/research/new-neural-network-building-block-allows-faster-and-more-accurate-text-understanding/.\n\n>>>9. What was the size of the training, test, and validation set?\nThe training set of the Penn Treebank consists of 887521 words of running text, the validation set of 70390, and the test set of 78669.\n\n>>>10. What was the convolutional filter size, denoted as \u2018k\u2019?\nThe convolutional filter size was two, and we didn't find any advantage to larger filters for word-level tasks.\n\n>>>11.

How does it compare from a computational perspective?\"\n\nYes. Nal Kalchbrenner released results for the ByteNet on the same IWSLT dataset we used in this paper in his slides for NIPS https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7jhGCaUwDJeZWZWUXJ4cktxVU0/view. He obtained BLEU of 24.7, or about five points higher than the QRNN, using the full size architecture used on larger datasets in the original paper. We don't know how much of this difference can be attributed to the overall ByteNet model architecture, as opposed to separate contributions of that paper like residual multiplicative blocks or sub-batch normalization. Computationally, the QRNN shares many of the computational advantages of the ByteNet architecture, including the use of operations that run in parallel along the sequence length (one of their desiderata) and the relatively short paths traversed by gradients from the target to the source sentence. While the QRNN does not have linear-time attention, the (quadratic-complexity) computation of attention weights is a small fraction of overall training time. As implemented for the MT experiment in our paper, the QRNN encoder-decoder architecture is likely several times faster for training and inference than ByteNet, but that is not so much an inherent fact about the two architectures as it is the result of different layer counts and the complexity of the ByteNet residual block/residual multiplicative block.\n\nReviewers 1 and 2 had similar questions about QRNN performance on common toy sequence tasks. Reviewer 1 asks, \"What kind of task will the QRNN struggle with? More specifically, of the standard RNN/LSTM tasks, are there any for which the QRNN is ill-suited? For example, would the depth need to grow linearly for the COPY task?\"\nThese are questions we've been very curious about too. While we used the copy and addition tasks to help with early debugging of the QRNN code and the sequence to sequence architecture, we hadn't yet run a more systematic investigation of QRNN performance on those tasks. On the addition task, the QRNN does in fact generalize to long sequences less well than LSTMs; on the copy task, it generalizes as well or better. We will add a brief appendix to the paper describing the following experimental results:\nWe take the addition task to mean sequence-to-sequence decimal addition of unaligned, variable-length numbers (the hardest of several versions). An example of this task for maximum length 5 digits is \"73952+9462\"-->\"83414\". We train on n_train randomly generated examples for up to 100 epochs with early stopping, and report the smallest model setup that achieves >99% character-level validation accuracy, or the best validation accuracy achieved by any model setup if none achieve 99%.\nFor n_digits=5 and n_train=100000, the QRNN converges with models larger than 3 layers of 256 units, while in our experiments LSTMs require only 2 layers of 128 units. For n_digits=10 and n_train=100000, an LSTM reaches 98.5% with 3 layers of 1024 units, while the best QRNN model (4 layers of 512 units) reaches only 95.0%.\nThe copy task is similarly implemented as sequence-to-sequence reconstruction of variable-length decimal numbers. For 5 digits, an example is \"23532\"-->\"23532\". We train on 10000 randomly generated examples for up to 100 epochs. For n_digits=5, the QRNN converges with models larger than 2 layers of 32 units or 1 layer of 256 units, while the LSTM requires only 1 layer of 32 units. For n_digits=10, the QRNN requires a model larger than 2 layers of 128 units while the LSTM requires a model of at least 2 layers of 64 units or 1 layer of 256 units. For n_digits=40, a QRNN with 5 layers of 512 units reaches 98.0% while the best LSTM model, with 3 layers of 512 units, only reaches 95.5%. A deeper LSTM would likely need some kind of residual or highway connections to converge on this task, while the deep QRNN converges relatively well despite our earlier experiences with 4-layer QRNNs without dense connections not converging successfully on the sentiment task.\n\nReviewer 2 asks, \"Are densely connected layers necessary to obtain good results on the IMDB task? How does a simple 2-layer QRNN compare with 2-layer LSTM?\"\nThe main use for dense connections is to enable training of deeper QRNN models. Performance with and without dense connections was similar for three-layer networks, but a four-layer network without dense connections was significantly worse than a three-layer one while a four-layer network with dense connections was better. A three-layer QRNN has results comparable to a two-layer LSTM, while a two-layer QRNN is slightly worse. But these differences are on the order of small fractions of a percentage point, and are difficult to distinguish from random initialization effects, while the four-layer densely-connected QRNN was consistently better than any LSTM-based model we tried.\n\nReviewer 2 asks, \"How does the f-fo-ifo pooling perform comparatively?\"\nOur early experiments with language modeling and toy sequence tasks, along with the results from Balduzzi and Ghifary (2016) suggested to us that fo-pooling consistently outperforms f-pooling and ifo-pooling. We wanted to demonstrate that the various different elementwise building blocks found in traditional recurrent networks can all be adapted to the quasi-recurrent context. The QRNN can use any kind of elementwise gating function, but we haven't found one that performs better than fo-pooling.\n\nReviewer 3 asks to clarify the speed comparison, perhaps invoking big-O descriptions. We agree with the reviewer's summation that the speed improvements of the QRNN exist because \"you're moving compute from a serial stream to a parallel stream and also making the serial stream more parallel.\" There is no asymptotic difference in computational complexity of a QRNN versus a traditional recurrent model, but the dependency structure of the computation (what needs to be computed before each operation can take place) makes it significantly better suited to the kinds of parallel computing architectures that are widely used today. It's likely that this advantage can be formalized (for instance, in terms of longest computational dependency path or average dependency branching factor) but not in terms of big-O notation.\n\nReviewer 3 also asks about replication. We're excited about the interest we've seen in replicating the QRNN model; one team that we've heard from has successfully replicated the language modeling results from the paper; another has in-progress work with QRNN results on a non-sentiment classification task that significantly outperform that task's published LSTM numbers."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks are a powerful tool for modeling sequential data, but the dependence of each timestep\u2019s computation on the previous timestep\u2019s output limits parallelism and makes RNNs unwieldy for very long sequences.

QRNNs are neural network layers composed of a one-dimensional convolution followed by an LSTM-inspired gating function that performs dynamic average pooling across time.\n\n2. QRNNs are gated recurrent networks similar to LSTMs or GRUs, except that their gates and state updates do not include a dependence on the previous timestep's state, instead depending only on recent values of the input. Since the dependence of each state update on the previous state value is what makes an RNN \"recurrent,\" and our model lacks that, we call it \"quasi-recurrent.\"\n\n3. QRNNs are a way of generalizing strongly-typed recurrent neural networks (Balduzzi and Ghifary, 2016) such that they can take into account more input timesteps at once, and except that they use a different set of nonlinearities and are implemented with an emphasis on performance.\n\n4.
