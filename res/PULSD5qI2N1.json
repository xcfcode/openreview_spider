I recommend acceptation. Moreover, Proposition A, which is fundamental in the approach, should be stated in the main paper for a better understanding.**\n\nAlthough it is somewhat difficult to summarize existing results mathematically because they consider slightly different assumptions and problem settings each other, there is a common thought that neural networks under a certain setting (i.e., NTK regime) can behave similarly to the kernel method with NTKs. \nThe idea behind this is the positive NTK leads to a rapid decay of the training loss and an NTK is almost fixed by overparameterization, hence learning dynamics can be localized around the initial point, resulting in the equivalence between neural networks and kernel methods through a linear approximation of neural networks. This story is simply stated in the introduction. \n\nHowever, in previous studies, such connections were provided regarding on training dataset or sample-wise high probability. Hence, we cannot fully utilize the beneficial property of kernel methods, and we overcome this issue in this study by providing a new connection between neural networks and NTKs.  The key is Proposition A and we have added its informal version to Section 1.2 to highlight the difference from the previous result. (Please see also comment to Reviewer 1).\n\n**For instance, why considering the NTK regime? What is the intuition behind that? How would you define mathematically \"the NTK regime\"? I would also like to understand better the relaxation of the positivity of the NTK. Does it have to do with the assumption that the norm of the integral operator is greater than $\\lambda$?**\n\nBy convention, the NTK regime means the setting of neural networks where the above connection can be established with overparameterization. A typical setup is two-layer neural networks of width $M$ with the output scale $1/\\sqrt{M}$. \n    \nThe idea behind the relaxation of the positivity of the NTK is that we relax the requirement of localization. Indeed, Proposition A says that the overparameterization increase time stayed in the NTK regime. And we acquire a more useful connection to show a faster convergence rate. \n    \nThe assumption on $\\lambda$ is due to a technical reason for bounding the variance caused by the sampling of initial parameters. (See Proposition 10 in [A. Rudi and L. Rosasco (2017)]). In addition, this assumption is essentially considered as a lower bound on the number of iteration (i.e., number of samples) because $\\lambda$ is chosen as $\\lambda \\sim T^{-p}$ (where $p$ is an appropriate value). Such a restriction on the number of samples is rather common in the literature of random feature approximation (e.g., [A. Rudi, L. Carratino, and L. Rosasco (2017)] and [A. Rudi and L. Rosasco (2017)]). We note that the norm of the integral operator depends only on the data distribution and activation function.\n\n[A. Rudi and L.

This proposition, and the full sketch of the proof should be emphasized as they consist on the true novelty of the work.**\n\nAs you said, the key in our theory is Proposition A which provides a new connection between a neural network and NTK. Remarkable points of Proposition A are providing a connection with respect to the uniform norm and not relying on the positivity of NTK, unlike existing studies. Instead of the positivity, we show that the overparameterization increases time stayed in the NTK regime. To emphasize our contribution, we have added this argument with a simplified version of Proposition A to Section 1.2.\n\n**I do not really see how exactly the discussion of the experimental part illustrates really the result. The discussion is fairly interesting, but I really would like to see a theoretical proposition showing that taking the two layers is better for learning.**\n\nWe would like to explain the idea behind the experiment. We note that eigenvalues of NTK of the two-layer network are roughly expressed as follows (see equation (44) in which $R$ is set to $1$):\n\n$\\lambda_{k}^{(1)}+ R^2(\\gamma^2\\lambda_{k}^{(2)} + \\lambda_{k+1}^{(2)} + \\lambda_{k-1}^{(2)}).$\n\nHere, $\\lambda_k^{(1)}$ and $\\lambda_k^{(2)}$ are eigenvalues of NTKs of output layer and input layer, respectively. Interestingly, both layers share the same eigenfunctions and they are complementary: $\\lambda_k^{(1)}=0$ when $k$ is odd and $\\lambda_k^{(2)}=0$ when $k$ is even except for $k=1,2$ under the setting of Section 3.3. This means these two NTKs are almost orthogonal to each other when taking $R \\sim 1/\\gamma$ and $\\gamma \\rightarrow \\infty$. This is the reason why we set $R=1/(20\\sqrt{2})$ and $\\gamma=10\\sqrt{2}$ and misspecification happened in single-layer learning.

We have revised our paper by taking into account your suggestions (about the description of algorithm and assumptions with subsequent remark), which have further improved the quality of the paper. \n  \n**In Theorem 1, what is $M_0$? Is that over-parameterization size? Is that polynomial in parameters or exponentially in parameters? (This is not major point of the paper, I am just curious about the bound)**\n\n$M_0$ is a bound on overparameterization, which can exponentially increase depending on the number of examples (i.e., iterations of ASGD). Please see also comment to Reviewer 3.\n\n**In page 4, Eq. (2), is it possible to consider a simple model where $\\gamma = 0$? This is quite common in previous work.**\n\nThank you for raising this point. The reason why we assume $\\gamma > 0$ is to keep the minimax optimality of the convergence rate under a specific setting in Section 3.3 where the target function is specified by ReLU-NTK. The condition $\\gamma > 0$ is closely related to Assumption (A4): $\\lambda_i = \\Theta(i^{-\\beta})$ for this setting. We first note that the convergence rate of $O(T^{-2r\\beta/(2r\\beta+1)})$ in Theorem 1 and Corollary 1, 2 always holds even though (A4) is relaxed to $\\lambda_i = O(i^{-\\beta} )$ and $\\gamma = 0$ as long as the other conditions hold. However, to make the rate of $O(T^{-2r\\beta/(2r\\beta+1)})$ minimax optimal, the lower bound on $\\lambda_i$: $\\lambda_i=\\Omega(i^{-\\beta})$ is also needed.  Under the setting in Section 3.3, this lower bound does not hold if we set $\\gamma=0$, hence the obtained rate is no longer minimax optimal. \n\nWe think the above argument is quite informative to the readers, so we have made the following small changes in the paper:\n- In (A2): $\\gamma \\in (0,1]$ -> $\\gamma \\in [0,1]$. \n- We have added a comment to the remark on (A4): ``Theorem 1 and Corollary 1, 2 hold even though the condition in (A4)  is relaxed to $\\lambda_i = O(i^{-\\beta})$ and the lower bound $\\lambda_i=\\Omega(i^{-\\beta})$ is necessary only for making obtained rates minimax optimal.\u201d\n    \n**In appendix, e.g. page 30, the last step of many equations use $\\rightarrow 0$. I don\u2019t follow the meaning of this notation. Is that possible to avoid it?**\n\nSince we have to show the convergence of several quantities (kernel, covariance operator, and minimizers) with respect to $s \\rightarrow \\infty$ and $M\\rightarrow \\infty$, these equations are probably inevitable. Note that notations plim and $\\xrightarrow{p}$ mean the convergence in probability and we used the uniform law of large number and Bernstein\u2019s inequality to random operators for showing this convergence. We have made the proof of this proposition E a little more detailed.\n    \n**This paper is focusing on average SGD, is there any intuition why non-average SGD won\u2019t give the similar result?**\n\nThe key to improving the performance of the vanilla SGD is to combine variance reduction methods with them because SGD usually suffers from the variance of stochastic gradient. Hence there are many studies analyzing variance reduction methods and showing their superiority. An averaging method is also one of such methods, which works very effectively especially for strongly convex problems. Indeed, most studies that show the optimality of optimization methods for nonparametric regression focus on variants of average SGD (e.g., [Dieuleveut and Bach (2016)], [Pillaud-VIvien et al. (2018a,2018b)], [M\u00fccke et al. (2019)], etc.).\n    \n**Additional related papers.**\n\nThank you for bringing up several related papers. We have cited them according to your suggestion.

The meaning of $\\rho_X$ was commented in Section 1.2 and the first paragraph of Section 2. We have added more comments and definitions where these notations first appeared. \n\n**The practical choice of M in their experiment is 2e4, which is impractical in NN tasks. My major concern is about the practical influence of this paper to the theory of deep learning training, as the width of the output layer is required to be large.**\n\nWe would like to emphasize that an arbitrarily large network width $M$ can be required to achieve an arbitrarily small excess risk in terms of population risk because the target function (Bayes rule) exists in an infinite-dimensional RKHS associated with the NTK. In other words, the divergence of $M$ as $T\\rightarrow \\infty$ (which means the convergence of the excess risk) is inevitable for the regression problem under this setting. That is why we used a large network in experiments to verify our theory. \nAlthough there is a possibility to improve the dependency of $M$ on the number of samples which corresponds to $T$, it is not the main focus of this study. In addition, we note that for the binary classification problem under the low noise settings (see the last section in Appendix), the size of $M$ can be significantly reduced to achieve the desired classification error because the classification error converges at an exponential rate by averaged SGD (ASGD), which means the required order of $T$ is logarithmic with respect to a required error.\n\n**In Assumption A3, why the parameter r has to be in the range [1/2, 1].**\n\nOn one hand the condition $r < 1/2$ means that the target function (Bayes rule) lies outside an RKHS associated with NTK (i.e., misspecification of the target), on the other hand, the condition $r>1$ means that the target function is very smooth. Interestingly, learning in both settings is known to be difficult and ASGD is suboptimal for the kernel method. Recently, there are several attempts ([Pillaud-Vivien et al. (2018b)] and [M\u00fccke et al. (2019)]) to overcome this limitation under a certain setting but they require modifications of ASGD, hence we focus on the condition $r\\in [1/2,1]$ in this study.\n\n**Is the averaging mechanism at the output of the algorithm beneficial to the rate in Theorem 1?**\n\nIn general, for learning problems in an RKHS, the convergence rate of ASGD is known to be faster than that for SGD. Moreover, the practical performance of ASGD is certainly better because of the variance reduction of the noise of stochastic gradients while SGD usually suffers from them.

In Particular, the authors derive minimax-optimal learning rates of the averaged stochastic gradient descent method for over-parametrized two-layer neural networks with smooth activation functions. The results are novel and offer insights into the connections between deep learning methods and kernel methods. One difference of this paper from other studies is that the positivity of NTK is not required in the error analysis. Numerical experiments are also illustrated to confirm the theoretical results. The paper is well written and interesting to read. Overall, I vote for accepting.\n\n\nConcerns:\n1. Although the paper considers smooth approximations of the ReLU and also shows the explicit optimal rate, its analysis does not apply to ReLU networks which may be of greater interest to researchers. \n\n2. It looks a little bit strange to me that the regularization is conducted around the initial values. Will this lead to a big difference in the numerical experiments?\n\n3.

The authors consider the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime. The NTK is a kernel defined using the activation function and the initial distribution of the parameters of the input layer. The RKHS H associated to this NTK is assumed to contain the Bayes predictor. Based on this, the authors derive a convergence rate for the predictor constructed from the T-th iterate of averaged SGD and the Bayes predictor in terms of the L2 distance wrt the distribution of the features. By specifying this bound in terms of the decay of the eigenvalues of the integral operator in H, they obtain an explicit generalization error bound, which is optimal for the class of problems considered in the paper.\n\nIt seems that the paper solves an important problem related to the training of neural nets. The paper is rather well written even if some paragraph are hard to understand for a non expert. \nFor example, several paragraphs of the paper are dedicated to compare the obtained results with those of concurrent work. The level of technicality of these discussions makes the reading experience difficult (e.g. last paragraph of Page 6), often because the discussion happens at a step where the reader is not familiar with the results (e.g. Section 1.2). These paragraphs seem like a discussion with the authors of these concurrent works. I would suggest to gather these discussions at the end of the paper, once the reader understands the results. Moreover, a better approach in my opinion would be to explicitly state the results (mathematically) of these concurrent work. This way, the comparison will be easier.\n\nAs a non expert, I believe that the results are new but I cannot be sure because I cannot compare with existing works (see my comment above). I recommend acceptation.\n\n\nOverall, the paper shows an important result: optimal rate for generalization bounds for 2 layers NN in the NTK regime. The result is well explained but some precision could make the paper even more insightful. For instance, why considering the NTK regime? What is the intuition behind that? How would you define mathematically \"the NTK regime\" ? I would also like to understand better the relaxation of the positivity of the NTK. Does it have to do with the assumption that the norm of the integral operator is greater than lambda?\n\n\nMoreover, Proposition A, which is fundamental in the approach, should be stated in the main paper for a better understanding. I think that the authors can move the numerical experiments to the appendix to win some space.\n\n\n\n\nMINOR:\n\nCheck the def of excess risk, last equation of Page 3\n\"negative dependence on\" should be \"inverse dependence on\"\n\", That is, \"\nWhy is Figure 1 in Section 1?

Note that this result is not a *plug and play* based on the current kernelized-SGD litterature: the difficulty the authors achieve to overcome is the fact that they could bound the difference between the dynamics of SGD on the neural networks and on the neural tangent kernel. This is stated in Proposition A and it represents the novelty of the article\n\nMoreover, they give an explicit representation of the capacity condition (decrease rate of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix) in the cases where they have a smooth approximation of the ReLu.\n\n**Clarity**\n\nThe paper is outstandly clear. Indeed, despite the fact that optimality in RKHS can be technical to introduce, I found the paper very clearly presented and well motivated. It was very pleasant and smooth to read. The references are also both precise and sufficient to understand well the problem.\n\nThe only default of the paper is that, in my opinion, the authors do not stress enough their contribution and their novelty. Indeed, despite Proposition A and the sketch of the proof, the article consists in a *plug and play* result on averaged SGD. The authors should then stress the outline of the proof (going to a M-approximation of the Neural Tangent RKHS) and comparing the dynamics on these.\n\n**Quality and Originality**\n\nThe paper is not super original, and as accustomed to this literature, there is no surprise seeing this result. However, the quality of the paper is undeniable and fills the gap between optimality of kernel methods and the NTK literature. I thank the authors to have done it very clearly.\n\n\n\n**Comments**\n\n-My main comment is about the fact that except from Proposition A, this article is a *plug and play* one. This proposition, and the full sketch of the proof should be emphasized as they consist on the true novelty of the work.\n\n-Three remarks concerning the plots :\n\n1-*Minor comment.* They should be bigger.\n2-*Minor comment.* Figure 1 should illustrate the fact that $\\beta = 1 + \\frac{1}{d-1}$. I suggest a log-log plot.\n3-*Intermediate comment.* I do not really see how exactly the discussion of the experimental part illustrates really the result. The discussion is fairly interesting, but I really would like to see a theoretical proposition showing that taking the two layers is better for learning.\n\n\n*** Conclusion***\n\nYet the fact remains that, I would really like this article to be published when the commentaries of the reviewers will be taken into accounts.

To achieve, they propose a new parameter which captures the ``complexities\u2019\u2019 of the target function and the RKHS associated with the NTK.\n\nThe paper is well-written, and the result looks very interesting. I am tending to accept the paper. This paper is a theory, so experiments are a plus. If the authors can address some of my comments, I am tending to increase the score of the paper.\n\n\n\nHere are some comments about writing.\n\nI believe Assumption 1 and 2 are reasonable. But each statement is just math, it is good to write a 2~4 words to summarize each A1, A2 .. Also several math statements highly replied on the definitions, and it is hard to find them in the paper.\n\nAfter Assumption 1, in the next page, page 5, there is a Remark that has 4 bullets, maybe write Ai at the beginning of each bullet.\n\nAlgorithm 1 requires more words and explanation, it is hard to understand this algorithm in the following sense : the size of each matrix/vector is not mentioned and hard to find them in the paper.\n\nIn page 6, is it possible to simplify the statement of Theorem 1 a bit? e.g. write a simplified version here, and put the full version in appendix.\n\nIn Theorem 1, what is M_0? Is that over-parameterization size? Is that polynomial in parameters or exponentially in parameters? (This is not major point of the paper, I am just curious about the bound) \n\nIn page 4, Eq. (2), is it possible to consider a simple model where gamma = 0? This is quite common in previous work.\n\nIn appendix, e.g. page 30, the last step of many equations use ->0. I don\u2019t follow the meaning of this notation. Is that possible to avoid it?\n\nThis paper is focusing on average SGD, is there any intuition why non-average SGD won\u2019t give the similar result?\n\nI felt the following paper is highly close to this work, and should be cited and discussed more deeply. Usually optimization has two parts, one is the number of iterations, and the other is cost per iteration. This paper focused on improving the number of iterations. The following paper improved the cost per iteration, in the NTK overparameterized regime. \nTraining (Overparametrized) Neural Networks in Near-Linear Time\nJan van den Brand, Binghui Peng, Zhao Song, Omri Weinstein\n\n\nMinor comments\n\nIn page 1, second paragraph, the place cited Du et al. 2019b, Allen-Zhu et al. 2019 and Du et al. 2019a.\n\nThe following two papers should also be cited\n\nZeyuan Allen-Zhu, Yuanzhi Li, and Zhao Song.

It was recently found that a neural tangent kernel (NTK) plays an important role in showing the global convergence of gradient-based methods under the NTK regime, where the learning dynamics for overparameterized neural networks can be almost characterized by that for the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). However, there is still room for a convergence rate analysis in the NTK regime. In this study, we show that the averaged stochastic gradient descent can achieve the minimax optimal convergence rate, with the global convergence guarantee, by exploiting the complexities of the target function and the RKHS associated with the NTK.
