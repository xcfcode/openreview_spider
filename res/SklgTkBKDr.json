Unfortunately, the problems in the DeepSets paper do not have the properties we are mainly interested in, namely problems that have redundancy and synergy effects. The reason for this situation is the generality of DeepSets: DeepSets is a general architecture that models permutation invariant sets of objects for arbitrary problems. We do not claim that our architectures are as general as DeepSets or that our architecture can compete with DeepSets on a wide range of datasets, because, as stated above, we are mainly interested in a specific type of problems that have said redundancy and/or synergy effects. Hence, using our architectures on the datasets used in the DeepSets paper is not what we want to focus on in this work.\n\nFurthermore, please note that we did not spend a lot of effort to fine-tune the results of our work. All hyper-parameters such as learning rate, optimizer, early stopping, random weight initialization, etc. are simple default choices that have not been optimized in a sophisticated way, and more importantly, the same for all models and all experiments. We report this information in Section 3.3. We will add more experimental results for different hyper-parameter settings to the appendix to show that our approaches perform consistently better than the reference systems."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1976/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1976/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["mzopf@ke.tu-darmstadt.de"], "title": "Neural Non-additive Utility Aggregation", "authors": ["Markus Zopf"], "pdf": "/pdf/04651b1b4f111f9ca9ebed7fce05c021fea048fc.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose two new neural architectures that explicitly model latent intermediate element utilities for non-additive set utility estimation.", "abstract": "Neural architectures for set regression problems aim at learning representations such that good predictions can be made based on the learned representations.

The referenced paper mimics the Choquet integral to fuse different neural networks such as CaffeNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet50 that have been pre-trained for classification problems and can be viewed as ensemble method for multiple noisy classifiers. Contrary, we are interested in regression problems that have inherent non-additive effect such as automatic summarization. Furthermore, the referenced paper is much closer to the Choquet as we intent to be. As we describe in the paper, the proposed architectures are only inspired by the Choquet integral. This idea can be found in both of our architectures. In Figure 1c, u_i and in Figure 1d g_i * u_i model these meaningful intermediate values. We do not claim that we obtain any theoretical guarantees or properties of the Choquet integral.\n\n\"How do you guarantee that the representation learned by the neural network still obeys the property of Choquet integral?\"\nAs described above, the proposed approaches are inspired by the way Choquet integrals handle non-additive utility aggregations. We do not claim that we obtain any theoretical guarantees or properties of the Choquet integral. Furthermore, the main idea of this work is to not learn a representation. Instead, we propose to predict many meaningful intermediate values that can simply be summed to obtain a set utility.\n\n\"What is your loss or your algorithm?\"\nWe describe in Section 3.3 that we use mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) in our experiments. We use MSE because it is usually used in regression problems. We were also interested in the mean absolute error because minimizing this loss might be more appropriate in a task such as automatic summarization, in which we don't want to punish a model strong if it makes a few severe mistakes compared to making many small mistakes. We also describe in Section 3.3. that we use Adam as optimizer.\n\n\"According to the illustration, it seems that you first obtain \u201cfeatures/representations\u201d. Then the representations are fed to the four architectures you listed in figure one.\"\nThis is correct.\n\n\"RNN-based approaches are with better \u201ccomplexity\u201d comparing to your sum baseline and \u201cDeepset\u201d approach.\"\nWe also compare against an RNN-based approach (abbreviated with \"RNN\" in the paper). The RCN approach is the smallest modification one can make to implement our idea into a standard RNN. Hence, we think that the comparison is fair and meaningful. Furthermore, we demonstrate in the extrapolation experiments that standard RNNs tend to overfit. The simple sum baselines and deepsets perform better in this experiments. Hence, a \"better\" complexity turns out to be prone to overfitting, which shows that larger models are not necessarily better."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1976/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1976/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["mzopf@ke.tu-darmstadt.de"], "title": "Neural Non-additive Utility Aggregation", "authors": ["Markus Zopf"], "pdf": "/pdf/04651b1b4f111f9ca9ebed7fce05c021fea048fc.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose two new neural architectures that explicitly model latent intermediate element utilities for non-additive set utility estimation.", "abstract": "Neural architectures for set regression problems aim at learning representations such that good predictions can be made based on the learned representations.

Producing such intermediate results, which model the nature of the problem much better than previous approaches, is the key idea presented in this paper and a major benefit of the proposed architectures. This also follows the idea of the Choquet integral.\n\n\"Additionally, I believe the experimental tasks are new, and as a result all implementations of competing techniques are by the paper authors. This makes it difficult to have confidence in the higher reported performance of the proposed techniques.\"\nTo improve reproducibility, we published the data and the code.

We would like to address your remarks below:\n\n\"the authors propose two RNN-based models\"\nWhile the proposed architectures have a recurrent structure, they are fundamentally different to RNNs that used to day. RNNs such as basic RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs learn one representation of the input on which the final prediction (in our case: the set utility) is based on. No meaningful intermediate results are generated. Contrary, the proposed architectures produce meaningful intermediate results in every step and model the task at hand much better. We illustrate this fundamental difference in Figure 1. Our experiments validate that the proposed architectures perform better than standard RNNs.\n\n\"The proposed models seem very basic [...]\"\nWe focus in this paper on the most basic versions of our idea to communicate our idea as clear as possible. We describe that multiple extensions of the idea can be investigated in future work. However, all further extensions such as more complex memory cells, which can enhance the proposed architectures, would distract from our core idea: to generate and aggregate meaningful intermediate results for set utility estimation in a non-additive way. Hence, we think the simplicity of the presented architectures is a desirable property in this work.\n\n\"The proposed models [...] do not have much novelty.\"\nWe disagree with this statement. The idea implemented in the proposed architectures has never been proposed before. We discuss [1] in our work, which is the work that is most similar to ours. Even though [1] is the most similar work, it is substantially different from ours since [1] does not use neural networks but only shallow learning. Our paper is the first that demonstrates that the idea in [1] can successfully be used with deep learning. Furthermore, the potential impact of our work is large. The problem setting we address in this paper appears in many situations. For example, a recent work [2] in automatic summarization uses the prior strategy, which we use as reference in our work. This work can potentially be improved by using non-additive utility aggregation as proposed by our work.\n\n\"The tasks in the experimental study seem overly simple.\"\nThe purpose of the experiments is to demonstrate the differences between the proposed approaches based on non-additive utility aggregation and prior ideas such as deep sets and RNNs. We show that our approaches perform substantially better than the reference approaches in computer vision and a natural language processing problems. The computer vision problem has also been used in well-known recent works [3,4]. Estimating redundancy and synergy effects of multiple sentences for automatic summarization is a well-known, hard, and unsolved problem. Hence, we think the problems used in our experiments are not overly simple but actually very hard.\n\n\"The authors might want to consider other tasks, for example, Point Cloud Classification in [1].\"\nPoint Cloud Classification is a classification problem. However, we focus on regression problems in our work. More importantly, Point Cloud Classification is not a problem in which synergy or redundancy effects are important. Dealing with these effects is the main motivation of our work. Hence, we think that performing experiments on Point Cloud Classification is not appropriate for this work.\n\n\"For RCN and DCR, how to decide the ordering of phi_i, given that they are the objects of an unordered set?\"\nTraining, validation, and testing examples are generated randomly and do not have a specific order. We feed all input elements, i.e. all phi_is, in the order in which they have been generated during the randomized data generation process. Hence, we use for all models the very same order. No model includes a re-ordering step. We will clarify this in the paper.\n\n\"It would be helpful it the authors can also provide the number of parameters of the baseline models in Tables 1, 2, and 3.\"\nThank you for the recommendation, we will add the number of model parameters to the paper.

The problem is very interesting. Choquet Integral is used to deal with set input. The authors propose two architectures. The two architectures, though not novel enough, are towards representing \u201cnon-additive utility\u201d.\nHowever, the experimental comparison is not fair, the description of the model (e.g. how Choquet is integrated into the model and help to learn \u201cintermediate meaningful results\u201d) is not clear, some claims are not true.\n\nFirst, the authors claim that they are the first to combine Choquet integral with deep learning. However, there are a few, though not many, works in the literature trying to combine Choquet integral with deep learning. For example, \u201cFuzzy Choquet Integration of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Remote Sensing\u201d by Derek T. Anderson et al. \n\nSecond, the authors claim they are using/motivated by Choquet integral, but do not have any (appendix) sections to explain how this mathematical tool is really integrated into their models. How do you guarantee that the representation learned by the neural network still obeys the property of Choquet integral? What is your loss or your algorithm? These need to be further clarified.\n\nThird, the comparison to baseline and \u201cDeepSet\u201d is not fair. According to the illustration, it seems that you first obtain \u201cfeatures/representations\u201d. Then the representations are fed to the four architectures you listed in figure one.

We find that the new architectures perform substantially better in this setup.", "code": "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X3bN3yxHew4XmhUryqLetpNxhFBH2FqI?usp=sharing", "keywords": [], "paperhash": "zopf|neural_nonadditive_utility_aggregation", "original_pdf": "/attachment/04651b1b4f111f9ca9ebed7fce05c021fea048fc.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nzopf2020neural,\ntitle={Neural Non-additive Utility Aggregation},\nauthor={Markus Zopf},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SklgTkBKDr}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
