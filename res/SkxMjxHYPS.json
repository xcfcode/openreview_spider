Testing is conducting from the viewpoint of balancing accuracy with various resource metrics such as number of parameters, memory footprint, etc.\n\nIn the end, reviewer scores were partitioned as two accepts and two rejects.  However, the actual comments indicate that both nominal accept reviewers expressed borderline opinions regarding this work (e.g., one preferred a score of 4 or 5 if available, while the other explicitly stated that the paper was borderline acceptance-worthy).  Consequently in aggregate there was no strong support for acceptance and non-dismissable sentiment towards rejection.\n\nFor example, consistent with reviewer comments, a primary concern with this paper is that the novelty and technical contribution is rather limited, and hence, to warrant acceptance the empirical component should be especially compelling.  However, all the experiments are limited to cifar10/cifar100 data, with the exception of a couple extra tests on tiny ImageNet added after the rebuttal.  But these latter experiments are not so convincing since the base architecture has the best accuracy on VGG, and only on a single MobileNet test do we actually see clear-cut improvement.  Moreover, these new results appear to be based on just a single trial per data set (this important detail is unclear), and judging from Figure 2 of the revision, MobileNet results on cifar data can have very high variance blurring the distinction between methods.  It is therefore hard to draw firm conclusions at this point, and these two additional tiny ImageNet tests notwithstanding, we don't really know how to differentiate phenomena that are intrinsic to cifar data from other potentially relevant factors.\n\nOverall then, my view is that far more testing with different data types is warranted to strengthen the conclusions of this paper and compensate for the modest technical contribution.  Note also that training with all of these different filter templates is likely no less computationally expensive than some state-of-the-art pruning or related compression methods, and therefore it would be worth comparing head-to-head with such approaches.  This is especially true given that in many scenarios, test-time computational resources are more critical than marginal differences in training time, etc.", "title": "Paper Decision"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ri16164@bristol.ac.uk", "walterio.mayol-cuevas@bristol.ac.uk"], "title": "Filter redistribution templates for iteration-lessconvolutional model reduction", "authors": ["Ramon Izquierdo Cordova", "Walterio Mayol Cuevas"], "abstract": "Automatic neural network discovery methods face an enormous challenge caused for the size of the search space.

It is not justified at all and the empirical result is also mixed (See Table 1). This brings about the question mark of the motivation of this paper from the first place. In contrast, empirically people have observed that a model with more parameters (and/or more FLOPs) within the same architecture family gives better performance. This is not directly related to the total number of filters, which the main topic in the paper. \n\nAs a result, it is not clear whether a gain of the performance is simply due to the change of #parameters/FLOPs or due to the fact that different distribution templates are used. As shown in Table. 2, there is huge variation in terms of #parameters and FLOPs between different versions of the same network, making the comparison fairly difficult and inconclusive. I would strongly suggest the authors to compare the performance between different templates when keeping #parameters and/or FLOPs fixed. This should be easy to do by computing how many filters are needed per layer to reach the desired #parameters/FLOPs, while keeping the desired distribution. \n\nAlso, to make a strong conclusion, they paper should also report ImageNet results trained with different templates. \n\nOverall, the paper, in its current form, is not ready for publication and I would vote for rejection. \n\n=========Post Rebuttal=======\nI reread the paper after authors revision and rebuttal. Thanks authors for the hard work. \n\nIndeed the authors have compared different templates when the number of parameters remain approximately the same (in both the original version and the new revision). I overlooked it and apologize. \n\nHowever, after rereading the paper, the conclusion is still not that clear and I didn't see a clear take home message about which filter template is better than the other. In the section \"Template Effects with similar resources\", it seems that uniform template patterns is the best for many models, which somehow is negative results given the motivation of this paper. \n\nIn addition, when comparing Fig. 3 in the original version versus that (Fig. 3) in the revision, some curves have changed their shape drastically (e.g., MobileNet on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) and uniform template shows stronger dominance. This worries me a bit that the experiments might still be preliminary and the paper is yet not ready for publication. \n\n I will keep the score. \n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2500/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2500/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ri16164@bristol.ac.uk", "walterio.mayol-cuevas@bristol.ac.uk"], "title": "Filter redistribution templates for iteration-lessconvolutional model reduction", "authors": ["Ramon Izquierdo Cordova", "Walterio Mayol Cuevas"], "abstract": "Automatic neural network discovery methods face an enormous challenge caused for the size of the search space.

The authors propose applying a few simple heuristics in the form of \"templates\" for the number of convolutional filters across the different layers within an architecture. Apart from reversing the filter distribution, which starts a network with a large amount of filters and then reduces them (given how the filter number is generally increased with depth and reduction in spatial resolution), the authors also propose using the same number of filters per layer (\"uniform\"), as well as \"quadratic\" and \"negative quadratic\" distributions. There does not seem to be any particular motivation for these patterns, but this is at least better than poor justifications.\n\nThe results include 4 common CNN architectures and experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, which is acceptable, but only single results are shown, which makes it hard to judge the significance of the performance of the redistributed networks, especially given that there seems to be no particular trend in the performance of any of the templates. The accuracy vs. parameter count results are interesting, as the default architecture does worse a good amount of the time. Unfortunately memory footprint results are mixed, and the default architectures tend to perform much better with respect to inference time. Most of the figures are hard to read and not labelled completely (e.g. relying on the caption to dictate which column corresponds to which architecture), so these should be reworked.\n\nUltimately, the results are largely empirical, and the work would benefit from a better exploration for the consequences of using these templates, and any sort of rule or correlation that links these to successful architectures - at the moment it is only a somewhat interesting observation.

There are five different kind of distributions studied: constant number of filters, monotonically increasing and decreasing number of filters and convex/concave with a local extremum at the layer in the middle.  For these distributions, the total number of filters is varied to study the trade-off between running-time vs. accuracy, memory vs. accuracy and parameter count vs. accuracy.\n\nAlthough the paper is purely experimental without any particular theoretical considerations, it presents a few surprising observations defying conventional wisdom:\n- The standard method of increasing the number of filters as the number of convolutional nodes is increasing is not the most optimal strategy in most cases.\n- The optimal distribution of channels is highly dependent on the network architecture.\n- Some network architectures are highly stable with respect to the distribution of channels, while others are very sensitive.\n\nGiven that this paper is easy to read and presents interesting insights for the design of convolutional network architectures and challenges mainstream views, I would consider it to be a generally valuable contribution, at least I enjoyed reading it.\n\nDespite the intriguing nature of this paper, there are several weaknesses which make me less enthusiastic about the quality of the paper:\n- The experiments are done only on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. These benchmarks are somewhat special. It would be useful to see whether the results also hold for more realistic vision benchmarks. Even if running all the experiments would be costly, I think that at least a small selection should be reproduced on OpenImages or MS-Coco or other more realistic benchmarks to validate the findings of this paper.\n- It would be interesting to see whether starting from the best channel distributions, applying MorphNet would end up with different distributions. In general: whether MorphNet would end up with similar distributions automatically.\n-  The paper does not clarify how the channel sizes for Inception were distributed, since proper balancing of the 1x1 and more spread out convolutions is a key part of that architecture. This is not clarified in this paper.\n- The grammar of the paper is poor, even the abstract is hard to read and interpret.\n- The paper presents itself as a methodology for automatically generating the optimal number of channels, while it is more of a one-off experiment and observation than a general purpose method.\n\nAnother small technical detail regarding the choice of colors in the diagrams: the baseline distribution and constant distribution are very hard to distinguish. This is especially critical because these are the two best distributions on average. Also the diagrams could benefit from more detailed captions.\n\nThe paper presents interesting, valuable experimental findings, but it is not extremely exciting theoretically. Also its practical execution is somewhat lacking. If it contained at least partial results on more realistic data sets, I would vote for strong accept, but in its current form, I find it borderline acceptance-worthy.\n "}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2500/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2500/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ri16164@bristol.ac.uk", "walterio.mayol-cuevas@bristol.ac.uk"], "title": "Filter redistribution templates for iteration-lessconvolutional model reduction", "authors": ["Ramon Izquierdo Cordova", "Walterio Mayol Cuevas"], "abstract": "Automatic neural network discovery methods face an enormous challenge caused for the size of the search space.
