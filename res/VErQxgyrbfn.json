In particular, this paper studies a convex duality framework that characterizes the global optima of a two-layer fully-convolutional ReLU denoising network via convex optimization. The authors use this regularization to interpret the obtained training results. The reviewers raised a variety of concerns regarding the tractability of the optimization problem (seems to be exponential in number of constraints), the utility for interpretation etc, significance of the results compared to existing literature. Some of these concerns were alleviated but not fully resolved. One reviewer had concerns about the correctness of the proof that was resolved based on the authors\u2019 response. I share many of the above concerns. However, I do think having a computationally feasible way to figure out the exact regularization in these simple settings (at least with small dimensions) could provide some insights to guide further theoretical development.  Therefore I am recommending acceptance. However, I strongly urge the authors to further revise the paper based on the above comments."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Convex Regularization behind Neural Reconstruction", "authorids": ["~Arda_Sahiner1", "~Morteza_Mardani1", "ozt@stanford.edu", "~Mert_Pilanci3", "~John_M._Pauly1"], "authors": ["Arda Sahiner", "Morteza Mardani", "Batu Ozturkler", "Mert Pilanci", "John M.

We have cited the new references, and discussed their difference from our work in the related work section of the revised manuscript. We should however note that they are quite different from ours in several ways. The main differences are summarized below:\n\n- **[Papyan et al\u20192017] -- Sparse Coding**\n\nThank you for bringing this work to our attention. This work is quite interesting for understanding CNNs for signal reconstruction. The authors relate CNNs to traditional sparse coding, by interpreting the forward pass of a CNN as a layered basis-pursuit algorithm. Unlike ours, this work does not consider the effect of CNN training but instead just models its forward pass. This work thus does not focus on the task of analyzing or interpreting the optimization process of a neural network, only its predictions. We have cited this in the revised paper and distinguished it from our work. \n\n- **[Yokota et al\u20192019] - Low-dimensional manifold modeling of patches in a single image**\n\nThank you for mentioning this work. The setting in this work is slightly different from ours. In particular, it follows the style of Deep Image Prior (DIP) works, which explore the setting of denoising a single noisy image by generating an image from a CNN and attempting to minimize the loss between the generated image and the noisy image. In contrast, in our setting, we train CNNs with noisy images as inputs and outputs are the ground truth images, and we learn a mapping from noisy images to ground truth images. \n\nAs you have mentioned, the motivations and basic intuition behind the work are quite similar to ours, in that they interpret CNNs as a low-dimensional manifold learning of patches. As such, in our revised version, we have added additional discussion on DIP works, including Yokota et al (2019), and remark on the differences. \n\n- **[Tachella et al\u20192020] -- Neural tangent denoiser**\n\nSimilar to [Yokota et al\u20192019], this work examines neural networks in the context of DIP--which is a different setting from ours. Beyond this, the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) has also been used to analyze neural networks, but that is only useful in the infinite-width limit, and does not apply for finite-width neural networks as they are used in practice. \n\nMoreover, NTK analysis will not explain the success of practical and finite-width neural networks (see for example Table 1 of [Arora et al, NeurIPS \u201919]). [Tachella et al\u201920] even mentions that networks trained with Adam outperform the NTK solution for these DIP problems. We have cited this in the revised paper, and also have distinguished our work from the NTK. \n\n**References**\nSanjeev  Arora,  Simon  S  Du,  Wei  Hu,  Zhiyuan  Li,  Russ  R  Salakhutdinov,  and  Ruosong  Wang.

It might be better to move this to the main paper, as this is the message that the paper is trying to convey?\"**\n\nThis is a good point. As suggested by the reviewer, space permitting, we will move this from the appendix to the main paper in the final version. \n\n- **\"Typos and notation mismatch in the proof of Theorem 1 in the appendix: what is X in eq. 13? index j in eq. 12?\"**\n\nThank you for catching these typos. They are fixed now.\n\n- **\"In the final version, it would be also useful to add the filter visualization for the MRI reconstruction as well. It would be interesting to see how dataset dependent the learned filters are.\"**\n\nThis is a great suggestion. As per reviewer\u2019s suggestion, we have included this visualization in Section B.5 of the Appendix. \n\n- **\"I am wondering about the complexity of the dual optimization problem. Are there fast convex solvers for scaling up the computations? Also, about the required number of sign patterns, can the authors provide intuitions for the datasets used in the paper, say for MNIST?\"**\n\nIn our current work, we use SGD for the convex program which is guaranteed to find the optimal solution in linear time, and we use a Pytorch solver that is scalable. \n\nIn addition, one can use off-the-shelf convex solvers such as CVXPY to solve convex problems directly, which can be quite parallelized with GPUs. \n\nThe primary focus of this work is not to make these convex solvers scalable for these problems, but as stated in Section 6,  this is an important step of our future work. \n\nA remark along these lines is added to the revised paper to clarify the computations, and also the conclusion is updated to include this as an important future work. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2928/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2928/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Convex Regularization behind Neural Reconstruction", "authorids": ["~Arda_Sahiner1", "~Morteza_Mardani1", "ozt@stanford.edu", "~Mert_Pilanci3", "~John_M._Pauly1"], "authors": ["Arda Sahiner", "Morteza Mardani", "Batu Ozturkler", "Mert Pilanci", "John M.

We have addressed all the reviewer's comments one-by-one below.\n\n- **\"The polynomial complexity on its own isn\u2019t that interesting...it would probably be nice to make it clear that this is mostly of theoretical interest.\"**\n\nYes, this is of theoretical interest for distinguishing the computational complexity of fully-connected networks from that of fully convolutional networks. We have included a remark on page 4 for clarification. However, the complexity is fully polynomial time for convolutional networks as we clarified in the revised version.\n\n- **\"The main result is quite interesting even outside of regression. Would it be possible to extend it to other convex loss functions?\"**\n\nYes. In fact, the results can be extended to every convex loss function. We have included the proof of such an extension in section E of the Appendix.\n\n- **\"Stating that the dual is easier to interpret than the primal is debatable. The primal is also locally linear around almost all points.\"**\n\nWhile small perturbations in the input will manifest linearly in the output of the primal network (i.e. local linearity), this is quite a different concept than the piecewise linear filtering we illustrate. The primal cannot be expressed in terms of a finite sum of {0, 1}-valued scalar weights applied to a set of linear filters. In contrast, we can do so with the dual, as shown in Figure 1 and eq (8). \n\n- **\"Please make all images in figure 5 equally large.\"**\n\nThe updated Figure 5 now has all images with equal size. \n\n- **\"Is there a good reason results are not reported on the full FastMRI dataset?\"**\n\nA small subset is selected simply to make the experiments tractable. To improve reproducibility, we have included a file \u201cdataset.txt\u201d in our supplemental code which points out to the exact .h5py files from the fastMRI dataset which store the data to be used for training and testing to replicate our results. \n\n- **\"Overall I\u2019m missing baselines to understand how relevant the results are. Adding a simple U-Net to the MRI case would disambiguate if this is a relaxation which is of theoretical importance, or if it\u2019s actually giving good results. The images on their own are kinda useless for this.\"**\n\nThe current results we provide are of theoretical importance. One cannot expect a two-layer network to perform as well as a deep U-Net. The two-layer network is simply a setting which can be theoretically analyzed and interpreted. Further work is needed to extend the results to deeper networks. One such way to extend to deeper networks is through greedy layer-wise training, which has shown promising in [Belilovsky et al\u20192019] and [N\u00f8kland and Eidnes\u20182019], but we leave this to future works.  \n\n- **\"The \u201cinterpretable reconstruction\u201d part is honestly somewhat debatable. Showing me a few hundred filters might give a tiny bit of insight, but I wouldn\u2019t say it lets me interpret the reconstruction properly.\"**\n\nWe agree that merely visualizing the filters does not interpret the results. Indeed, one needs to look at the filters along with the patch clustering or association map in Fig. 5 to make interpretation. The visualized filters nicely demonstrate that the network learns a combination of low-pass, band-pass, and high-pass filters. These filters are then selectively applied to individual patches. Thus, combining these, one would be able to find the exact set of filters applied to each input patch of an image for reconstruction. \n\n- **\"Figure 1b is irritatingly not vertically centered\"**\n\nWe have fixed this issue in the revised version--now Fig 1a and 1b are vertically aligned. \n\n- **\"Images in fig 3 suffer from similar issues. Overall images should be saved in exactly the resolution they are stored in.\"**\n\nThank you for the suggestion. The images are displayed exactly in the same size as they are stored (28x28). \n\n- **\"Has the number of sign patterns been ablated?\"**\n\nThank you for the useful suggestion. To address this comment we have included an ablation study, in section B.3 of the Appendix, for the effect of the number of the sign patterns on the quality of the approximation of the dual problem. As shown for the MNIST denoising problem in Figure 10, after randomly subsampling 4,000 sign patterns, for a noise standard deviation of 0.5, the dual problem can suitably represent the solution to the primal problem; whereas when we use a noise standard deviation of 0.1, the dual problem only requires 125 randomly subsampled sign patterns.\n\n**References**\nEugene Belilovsky, Michael Eickenberg, and Edouard Oyallon.

Based on NTK I'm not sure if convexity is so important. Regarding convex NN, this paper is also interesting.\"**\n\nIt is important to clarify that our analyses hold for finite-width networks (number of neurons bounded as per Theorem 1), while NTK relies on the oversimplified infinite-width assumption which simplifies to a linear kernel method.  NTK analysis will not explain the success of practical and finite-width neural networks (see for example Table 1 of [Arora et al\u201919]).\n\nIndeed, convexity analysis for finite-width networks becomes more tricky, and this is an important contribution of this work. We thank the reviewer for pointing out the interesting paper from Chen et al (2018) relating to Input Convex NNs (ICNN); we have cited it and made clear the distinctions between our work in the revised paper. In particular, while the forward pass of an  ICNN is a convex optimization problem, training ICNNs still requires non-convex optimization, e.g. the authors use SGD heuristically applied to the non-convex training objective. \n\n\n- **\"Would be good to discuss deeper NN. \"**\n\nRegarding deeper NNs, as commented in section 4.3, a typical trick is to use greedy layer-wise training, where one can sequentially train an unrolled network by stacking shallow networks. This has been found quite promising for training neural networks; see e.g., [Belilovsky et al\u20192019] and [N\u00f8kland and Eidnes\u20182019]. Finding the convex dual for end-to-end trained deep networks is a significantly more challenging problem, as it requires hierarchical groupings of sign patterns which are difficult to characterize. This problem is beyond the scope of our work and can be analyzed in future research. The two-layer problem was already an open-problem to solve, for which the analysis was extensive and non-trivial. \n\n- **\"Also good to make clear the advantage over other convex or nonconvex but optimizable formulations.\"**\n\nThe main advantage of this work is that we can **provably** find the global minimum of the non-convex neural network training problem. This contrasts with SGD applied to the non-convex primal training, which is heuristic and may not always find the global minimum, either getting trapped into  a local minimum, or, it converges extremely slowly. For example, refer to Fig. 9 in the Appendix, where under an exponential noise distribution, the primal fails to find the global optimum. \n\nAs for other formulations, such as the NTK and ICNNs, both have their own issues. Training an ICNN as mentioned before is not actually a convex optimization problem, while the NTK requires the oversimplified infinite-width assumption, which does not explain the practical finite-width networks.\n\n**References**\nEugene Belilovsky, Michael Eickenberg, and Edouard Oyallon.

Theorem 1 is not simply the dual program, it is indeed the ***strong dual***, which is non-trivial to find for this **non-convex** training program. \n\nThis powerful claim allows the optimal solution of the convex program (4) to coincide with the optimal solution of the the non-convex neural network training program (2), i.e. $p^* = d^*$. \n\nOur work is the first to show this claim for fully-convolutional two-layer neural networks for image reconstruction problems. This work finds that the computational complexity of solving this fully-convolutional neural network is polynomial in the problem dimensions, which contrasts with previous results on fully-connected networks, for which the training complexity is exponential in the dimension, as we clarified on page 4 in the revised version.\n\nEven for the simple, two-layer network, this result is exceedingly non-trivial and generates new insights into the learned filters of the neural network, and the implicit regularization that is provided by the neural network training objective. \n\nIt is clear that our proof requires more steps than a straightforward computation. We demonstrate what a standard duality approach would yield--a dead end--in section F of the Appendix in the revised version. Of particular importance is the re-scaling trick in (9), which allows us to take the dual problem in tractable form. Another novel piece in this proof is the enumeration of sign patterns, which allows us to finitely parameterize the infinite ReLU constraints into $\\ell$ constraints using the *pointwise maximum* as the reviewer has noticed, allowing for a finite-dimensional convex program. In this way, the proof of strong duality in Theorem 1 is a non-trivial result.\n\nAccordingly, we believe that these theoretical contributions are sufficiently novel and insightful. To clarify this issue, in the revised version we have detailed the small steps of the proof for Theorem 1. Please see section C of Appendix. \n\n- **\"I cannot see what's the goal of the experiments. If this approach is better than the usual nonconvex nn formulation, at least we should see a clear difference. The solid and dash lines are really close to each other, in terms of computation time/epochs or error/loss I cannot see the advantage. The claims in the experiment section are vague.\"**\n\nThe **first point** of the experiments is to verify the theoretical claims of Theorem 1 (i.e. the \u201czero duality gap\u201d). The point is not to show that dual formulation achieves a better solution than the primal one. That is a promising direction of our convex formulation though, but not the main scope of this submission. \n\nThe **second point** of the experiments is to demonstrate the interpretability offered by the dual formulation. The visualization of the dual filters in Fig. 4 is much more interpretable than visualization of primal filters, since the neural network is piecewise linear with respect to the dual filters (as discussed in Section 4.2). \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2928/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2928/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Convex Regularization behind Neural Reconstruction", "authorids": ["~Arda_Sahiner1", "~Morteza_Mardani1", "ozt@stanford.edu", "~Mert_Pilanci3", "~John_M._Pauly1"], "authors": ["Arda Sahiner", "Morteza Mardani", "Batu Ozturkler", "Mert Pilanci", "John M.

Since the activation function is non-linear, it is generally difficult to interpret the main problem. In this paper, Authors consider a huge pattern of activation as samples and define the corresponding filter as dual parameters. As a result, when a finite number of sufficiently large filters is prepared, this becomes a convex dual problem of the primal problem. This dual framework itself is the work in [Pilanci & Ergen, ICML2020], and it is considered that the actual contribution of this paper was to apply it to the image resconstruction problem and discuss its interpretation.\n\nThe conclusions about the interpretation of FCNN were that the l2 penalty of the weight parameters was group lasso in the dual parameter and sparse regularization of the path, and that denoising was patch-based clustering and its linear filtering.\n\nThe interpretation of neural image restoration through the dual problem is very interesting and I think it is well written as a paper. It is nice that an application example of medical image restoration is also shown.\n\nHowever, there are some recent studies that are considered to be very closely related to this paper, and the novelty of the conclusion itself of patch-based image processing seems to be weak.

This is well motivated by medical imaging, where there is risk of hallucinating unseen pixels, and there is high demand for robustness of training and interpretability of the prediction. For a two-layer convolutional neural network with ReLU activation, with weight-decay regularization, that is non-convex, this paper establishes strong convex duality, where the dual optimization is quite tractable and interpretable. It also shows empirical results for MNIST denoising and MRI reconstruction that support the claims.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed reading this paper. It is a solid work, very well written, and it has a balanced mix of theory and application, where the theory shows direct practical impact.\n\nStrong points:\n-   This paper is very well written and well organized. The motivation is very clear and sound.\n-   The proposed convex duality framework is solid and it fits nicely an important application with minimal assumptions.\n-   The interpretability offered by the dual network is very interesting. This is a novel and elegant view. In particular, the filters visualized in Fig. 4 are insightful to what a neural network learns. The clustering interpretation is also neat.\n-  The experiments with MNIST and fastMRI are convincing. In particular, the experiments with MRI are important and practically valuable, since in medical imaging deep learning has become the standard method nowadays for reconstruction, and, no or little is known about the interpretability of existing methods.\n\nAdditional feedback and suggestions:\n- The appendix (Fig. 9) includes experiments with impulsive noise that show SGD for convex dual network converges to a better training/validation loss than the non-convex network. It might be better to move this to the main paper, as this is the message that the paper is trying to convey?\n- Typos and notation mismatch in the proof of Theorem 1 in the appendix: what is X in eq. 13? index j in eq. 12?\n- In the final version, it would be also useful to add the filter visualization for the MRI reconstruction as well. It would be interesting to see how dataset dependent the learned filters are.\n- I am wondering about the complexity of the dual optimization problem. Are there fast convex solvers for scaling up the computations? Also, about the required number of sign patterns, can the authors provide intuitions for the datasets used in the paper, say for MNIST? \n\nCorrectness: The analyses are solid and the claims are correct. \nRelation to prior work: The paper has clearly discussed the connections with the previous works.\nReproducibility: The details of the experiments and the public datasets are included in the paper.

I\u2019m cautiously optimistic that this could open the door to more practically relevant results.\n\nHowever, the NNs experimented with and the experiments done are relatively simplistic, so it\u2019s hard to grasp how far away this is from practical results. It would also be nice if more effort was spent on contextualising these results within the wider scope of convex methods (e.g. infinite width 2 layer networks).\n\n* The polynomial complexity on its own isn\u2019t that interesting. The input dimension is in the hundreds of thousands, so even quadratic complexity would be highly limiting. It would probably be nice to make it clear that this is mostly of theoretical interest. Perhaps even write out a real estimate for l in the article.\n* The main result is quite interesting even outside of regression. Would it be possible to extend it to other convex loss functions?\n* Stating that the dual is easier to interpret than the primal is debatable. The primal is also locally linear around almost all points.\n* Please make all images in figure 5 equally large.\n* Is there a good reason results are not reported on the full FastMRI dataset? It would certainly make comparisons much easier and would contextualize the results. The current setup is not really reproducible.\n* Overall I\u2019m missing baselines to understand how relevant the results are. Adding a simple U-Net to the MRI case would disambiguate if this is a relaxation which is of theoretical importance, or if it\u2019s actually giving good results. The images on their own are kinda useless for this.\n* The \u201cinterpretable reconstruction\u201d part is honestly somewhat debatable. Showing me a few hundred filters might give a tiny bit of insight, but I wouldn\u2019t say it lets me interpret the reconstruction properly.\n* Figure 1b is irritatingly not vertically centered\n* Images in fig 3 suffer from similar issues. Overall images should be saved in exactly the resolution they are stored in (e.g. 28x28 for MNIST), this is especially important in articles whose whole purpose is to show imaging results. Also avoid linear interpolation between pixels.\n* Has the number of sign patterns been ablated?\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2928/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2928/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Convex Regularization behind Neural Reconstruction", "authorids": ["~Arda_Sahiner1", "~Morteza_Mardani1", "ozt@stanford.edu", "~Mert_Pilanci3", "~John_M._Pauly1"], "authors": ["Arda Sahiner", "Morteza Mardani", "Batu Ozturkler", "Mert Pilanci", "John M.
