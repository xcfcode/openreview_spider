We refer to the global answer for a better definition of terms. We confirm that we did not experimentally validate any of the generated sequences and, for experimentally verified sequences, we reserved the term \u201cfunctional\u201d. We explicit this further in the revised version of the manuscript. The suggestion of assessing the energy assessments of the generated sequences in Rosetta is a good approach to validate sequences before lab experiments but is not suitable for a high-throughput assessment.\n\n\u201c[...] \u201cWith respect to general sequence quality, ProteoGAN reaches [...]\u201d A single mutation can abrogate protein function, let alone twenty.\u201d\n\nSince we do not test the proteins we generate in a lab, we can indeed not verify that the proteins are functional for sure. However, we use several measures (MMD, MRR) to check similarity of the generated sequences with real sequences in distribution and conduct bioinformatic experiments (ProFET pipeline) to show that the proteins that are generated, while potentially showing a high mutation rate compared to existing sequences, are plausibly functional/valid because exhibiting a large number of similar characteristics to real sequences. In the current version of the paper, we changed the terminology to describe these sequences as \u201cvalidated in-silico\u201d (see previous comment and global answer). The objective of this sentence \u201cWith respect to \u2026 viable\u201d was to state that a high mutation rate is not a necessary condition for a protein to be non-viable, but we are aware that what matters is much more than a simple count of mutations. We rephrase this sentence in the paper to make it clearer. \n\n\u201c [...] train-test-validation splits in this paper [...].\u201d\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the important comment. We clarify this point in the global answer as it was raised by several reviewers.\n\n\u201c[...] use HMMER generated sequences of a family in a given GO category [...].\u201d\n\nWe added such a baseline to our results table.\n\n\u201cIn Figure 5,[...] Are you sampling from sequences of the same length or kmer composition?\u201d\n\nHere random means that we used the same model architecture as ProteoGAN to generate sequences, but use the random weights used for initialisation without training the model. This was to show the scale on which features should be compared (to answer: \u201cIs this difference I see large or small?\u201d). However, we removed this baseline from the set of baselines as it brought some confusion and was clearly underperforming compared to other models (and compared to the new baselines). \n\n\u201cMRR is an odd statistic. Why not just BLAST, or an alignment-based approach? How does MRR compare to e-value, or closest in sequence ID?\u201d\n\nWe used MRR between GO-specific MMDs in order to be able to evaluate the conditioning mechanism of our model in a fast manner. Based on Table 1, the metric enables us to rank models in terms of their ability to generate sequences specific to a given GO label. Additionally, we wanted a distribution-based measure since we are assessing generative model performance, not individual sequences. Further, MRR can be used with a wide range of sequences. Generated sequences are often very dissimilar to natural proteins in primary sequence while being similar in their characteristics. Alignment-based methods will most often fail to find any significant hit. Using alignment-based methods would restrict our target space of sequences to close homologs in nature (which we want to avoid), and such a measure would provide no information in regimes that are a bit further away from known sequences. This however is needed to guide the construction of models that are initally not good enough towards a better parameter space in an optimization (as we did).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3025/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3025/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Conditional Generative Modeling for De Novo Hierarchical Multi-Label Functional Protein Design", "authorids": ["~Tim_Kucera1", "karsten.borgwardt@bsse.ethz.ch", "~Matteo_Togninalli1", "~Laetitia_Papaxanthos2"], "authors": ["Tim Kucera", "Karsten Michael Borgwardt", "Matteo Togninalli", "Laetitia Papaxanthos"], "keywords": ["protein design", "conditional generative adversarial networks", "gene ontology", "hierarchical multi-label", "GO", "GAN"], "abstract": "The availability of vast protein sequence information and rich functional annotations thereof has a large potential for protein design applications in biomedicine and synthetic biology.

Linking our MMD similarity measure to structurally-derived similarities is a very interesting suggestion and we will further explore it in future work.\n\n\u201cThree embedding modes [...] method that does not use this hierarchical information.\u201d\n\nWe did observe that one-hot encoding performs better than the other embedding schemes, we refer to the paragraph \u201cInsights on cGANs architecture\u201d for the comment on the best label embedding. Moreover, we agree that a comparison with a baseline which does not account for hierarchical nature of the label is of interest. We therefore added a comparison between the performance of our model and the one reached by a model trained on one-hot encodings of the GO terms with removal of the parent terms (Nonhierarchical model, in Table 1). We notice that the hierarchical information of the labels enables better performance across our three evaluation criteria and more realistic sequences.

On the first version of the paper, we had four baselines (Unconditional, Predictor-guided, PepCVAE and Greener et al.). The three baselines Unconditional, Predictor-guided and Greener et al. were trained on the full sequences up to 2048 amino acids. PepCVAE was trained on the first 32 amino acids. \nRegarding this last point, of course training an RNN on 2048 tokens is not an issue. However, retraining a functional VAE model in combination with RNNs is. This type of models have known issues with posterior collapse (see e.g. Bowman et al. 2016) which is also why we did not choose these models for our own approach. We were not able to train a stable model with full sequence length without significant changes to the architecture the authors of PepCVAE proposed, which was trained originally on shorter (L=30) peptide sequences. We moved the results of PepCVAE and ProteoGAN trained on sequences of length 32 amino-acids to the supplementary material (Figure A2) as they are not directly addressing the problem at stake.\nAll other baselines were trained on the original sequences up to 2048 amino acids.\n10. The conditioning was another point that was unclear among several reviewers, and we have clarified the structure of the data and how our model incorporates the label data. In short, our model allows for conditioning on multiple GO terms simultaneously (all the GO labels of a given protein) by summing the respective label embeddings into a final vector that is fed to the cGAN. This allows to leverage the hierarchical structure of the labels efficiently.\n11. Thank you for pointing out this relevant reference, we have added it in our revised manuscript. \n\nThings that would improve my rating: [...]\n\nWe believe your comments enriched our contribution significantly. In addition, we have (1) revisited our train/val/splits and better described them in the main text, (2) added several baselines and explained why MMD is a good measure of sequence generative quality, and (3) updated the manuscript to make it clearer to readers. We therefore hope we could address your concerns and that this will increase the value of our work in your eyes. Please let us know if there are any more open questions.

We have added several baselines and revised the textwork to address your points. Here below and throughout our revised submission, we answer your comments.\n\n\u201cHowever, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any specific reason that guided design approaches could not generalize to multiple criteria.\u201d\nTo the extent of our knowledge, there exists no guided design method that would freely generate proteins with different types of functions. Guided design approaches usually depend on predictors, which are often only available for specialised functions but not general purpose. Additionally, we believe that cGANs are essentially enabling the generalisation of guided design to multiple criteria with a predictor trained at the same time.\n\n1. Indeed MMD measures the discrepancy between embeddings, in this case from a 3-mer string kernel. While the practical application seems very simple, we note that there is rigorous theory supporting MMD as a test statistic (Gretton et al). It was first proposed for two-sample tests of biological data (Borgwardt et al.) and this is exactly what we need for assessing the performance of a GAN whose objective it is to model the distribution of proteins. To assess performance, we are only presented with two sets of samples, one generated and one real (the dataset). It follows naturally to perform a two-sample goodness-of-fit test. Luckily, the kernel framework enables this on structured data (the protein sequence strings). We use the kernel proposed by Leslie et al., which, they demonstrated, performed comparable to classic methods such as PSI-BLAST on remote-homology detection. We added that all functional classes we are concerned with can be linearly separated in the 3-mer embedding space (94% accuracy on all annotations). (Further note, that even with k=3, the dimensionality of the embedding space is already 8000.) This should show that the 3-mer kernel is a sufficient choice for our setting, for proofs of MMD we refer you to Gretton et al. Of course there are more powerful kernels, but we stress that we chose this particular kernel because it can be efficiently computed and hence be used to monitor training and to guide large optimizations. Unfortunately, whether or not the MMD statistic can discriminate between functional and non-functional sequences cannot be determined as the required effect size (or a H1 distribution) is not available. Our phrasing of \u201cvalid sequences\u201d was therefore slightly premature, we have changed the text to make clear what we mean by that. We have also added an n-gram baseline, and revised text parts concerning MMD.\n2. We have considered multiple generative frameworks and model architectures. As you have pointed out, proteins are very complex and hence we chose a powerful model. Further, we require multi-label conditioning, which is directly possible within the framework of GANs. We have added several baselines based on HMMs and n-gram models to show that this choice was justified.\n3. We are not aware of a method that would enable likelihood estimation in GANs, at least not when the generator is based on a convolutional architecture (for an RNN-based generator, one could use the likelihood of the generated sequence). However, the auxiliary classifier of our model enables a ranking of sequences, thanks to the classification scores it yields for the function of interest.\n4. We have increased the size of the data splits to a more standard 80-10-10 which increases the power of the MMD estimate. We provide analysis of feature similarities between sets in supplemental Figure A8.\n5. Yes, these are standard deviations. Thanks for pointing this out. We also agree that several data splits are a better assessment, we have retrained all models on 5 different splits.\n6. Concerning the second approach, we added HMM baselines as you proposed, thank you for your suggestion. As you can see, the sequences generated by our model outperform the others across all our criteria. For the database retrieval baseline point, please see our answer to 7 (where \u201cpositive control\u201d corresponds in fact to retrieving sequences from the training set) and 8 below.\n7. The positive control is a set of natural sequences from the training set with a label distribution that is similar to the testset label distribution. One could see it as a second test set, which aims to simulate a perfect generative model (that would generate real proteins). We agree that this was not clear enough in our initial submission and have revised the text to better explain these two baselines.\n8. Indeed, eventually this is the goal of our work. Simply retrieving sequences from the database would not allow for novel designs. For more on this, please see our general answer to all reviewers as this was a common confusion we hope to address with the current revision.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3025/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3025/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Conditional Generative Modeling for De Novo Hierarchical Multi-Label Functional Protein Design", "authorids": ["~Tim_Kucera1", "karsten.borgwardt@bsse.ethz.ch", "~Matteo_Togninalli1", "~Laetitia_Papaxanthos2"], "authors": ["Tim Kucera", "Karsten Michael Borgwardt", "Matteo Togninalli", "Laetitia Papaxanthos"], "keywords": ["protein design", "conditional generative adversarial networks", "gene ontology", "hierarchical multi-label", "GO", "GAN"], "abstract": "The availability of vast protein sequence information and rich functional annotations thereof has a large potential for protein design applications in biomedicine and synthetic biology.

The rebuttal is composed of a global answer, which addresses questions asked by several reviewers, specific answers to each reviewer and the update of the main document and supplementary material, with edits marked in color.\n\nSeveral reviewers questioned the train/validation/test splits that we used in the paper to compare the performance of our model to baselines. First, we would like to acknowledge that keeping 4% (2% + 2%) of the sequences for the validation and test sets was unusually small and the results were potentially subject to having a large variance. Therefore, we reran our model and the baselines (including new ones) keeping 10% of the sequences as validation set and 10% of the sequences as test set. Additionally, we trained and tested the model and baselines on 5 different splits to obtain a standard deviation for each model and criterion. Second, the current splits (80-10-10) are done uniformly at random. We are doing so because our objective is to show that it is possible to generate sequences that verify the following four points: \n1) Novel sequences, defined as sequences not identical to the ones in the training set. We show, in this revision, that the generated sequences of our model are different from the sequences in the training set, and that the distribution of pairwise distances, in the kernel feature space, between generated sequences and its nearest neighbour in the training set are close to the distribution of pairwise distances between test set sequences and its nearest neighbour among training set sequences (compare Figure A8).\n2) In-distribution sequences, namely sequences that follow the distribution of sequences in the dataset. We show this by computing the MMD score between the distributions of generated sequences and real sequences. As a side remark, the results are robust to the choice of the kernel used for MMD, whether we choose a linear or a gaussian kernel on the k-mer embeddings (see Table 1.).\n3) In-distribution sequences conditionally generated based on given GO labels. We verify this by measuring MRR.\n4) Sequences that show the same physico-chemical characteristics as real sequences, as evaluated by ProFET. This last evaluation is a solid first step towards checking whether the generated sequences could behave as real sequences if inserted in a biological environment. \n\tWe believe that being able to generate sequences that follow these four criteria constitutes a big step forward compared to the state-of-the-art. However, we agree that being able to generate out-of-distribution sequences with splits that are pre-filtered using CATH or SCOP would be the next frontier in this line of work, and hope some of our results will prove to be useful for the community when moving towards that goal.\n\nSeveral reviewers also questioned the meaning of the word \u201cvalid\u201d. We used the adjective \u201cvalid\u201d to describe generated sequences that are in-distribution with sequences in the training set (i.e. exhibiting a low MMD). We agree that this word is not precisely used and propose instead to describe such sequences as \u201cvalidated in-silico\u201d. This would describe generated sequences that are verifying the four points described above. Therefore we consider that such sequences are plausibly viable, i.e. plausibly exhibiting the given function when inserted in a cell. This would further need to be confirmed by biological experiments in a future work. \n\nOverall, we believe that the suggestions from the reviewers strongly improve the paper and we look forward to hearing their impressions on this revised version.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3025/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3025/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Conditional Generative Modeling for De Novo Hierarchical Multi-Label Functional Protein Design", "authorids": ["~Tim_Kucera1", "karsten.borgwardt@bsse.ethz.ch", "~Matteo_Togninalli1", "~Laetitia_Papaxanthos2"], "authors": ["Tim Kucera", "Karsten Michael Borgwardt", "Matteo Togninalli", "Laetitia Papaxanthos"], "keywords": ["protein design", "conditional generative adversarial networks", "gene ontology", "hierarchical multi-label", "GO", "GAN"], "abstract": "The availability of vast protein sequence information and rich functional annotations thereof has a large potential for protein design applications in biomedicine and synthetic biology.

However, the evaluation criteria are lacking, requiring additional work.\n\nPros: \n- I think using MMD to determine the similarity between the true and generated distributions was very interesting. I am also a big fan of the kmer kernel for the MMD test statistic.\n\n-I also think understanding mode collapse with the duality gap was a good idea.\n\n- I appreciated the hyperparameter optimization studies to understand which parameters were important to tune to get working.\n\nCons:\n- I am concerned by the repeated usage of \"valid protein sequences\" throughout the paper. I'm not sure if the authors intended to use the word \"functional\". The real test of \"valid\" would be experimental validation in the lab to determine if the sequences still performed the functions of the GO categories, but I understand that this is not a particularly viable option. However, to make such a claim, the authors could calculate various energy statistics from Rosetta, or other mutation effect predictors to determine if the sequences are likely to be functional.\n- I am particularly troubled by the statement in the paper: \u201cWith respect to general sequence quality, ProteoGAN reaches MMD values of 0.0463, which corresponds to roughly 20% of random mutations in a set of natural sequences (compare supplementary Table A5). In comparison, previous in vitro biological experiments showed that proteins with 34% (resp. 59%) of mutated positions compared to the wild-type were viable\u2026\u201d\nThis, in no way, proves that sequences generated by this method are valid or functional. A single mutation can abrogate protein function, let alone twenty.\n-I am also concerned about the train-test-validation splits in this paper: It seems like this was done randomly. This is not how to prove the method can generalize to new sequences. I worry that generated sequences in the training set can have homologues in the test set. Train/test splits using CATH or SCOP would be more appropriate.\n-Since there is no control for homology in this work, it would be interesting to just use HMMER generated sequences of a family in a given GO category to compare against (simplest baseline model).\n-In Figure 5, I don't understand where the \"Random\" values came from. Are you sampling from sequences of the same length or kmer composition? Truly random amino acids is not a useful comparison.\n- MRR is an odd statistic. Why not just BLAST, or an alignment-based approach? How does MRR compare to e-value, or closest in sequence ID?\n\nNeutral:\n- I am surprised the authors are only using manually annotated sequences for this task, or not leveraging some sort of pretraining. Homologous sequences could improve model performance.\n- As someone working in biotechnology, I think there is great interest in the refinement of molecular properties to highly-specific functions, and little interest in generating sequences generally from GO categories, which are much too broad.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3025/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3025/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Conditional Generative Modeling for De Novo Hierarchical Multi-Label Functional Protein Design", "authorids": ["~Tim_Kucera1", "karsten.borgwardt@bsse.ethz.ch", "~Matteo_Togninalli1", "~Laetitia_Papaxanthos2"], "authors": ["Tim Kucera", "Karsten Michael Borgwardt", "Matteo Togninalli", "Laetitia Papaxanthos"], "keywords": ["protein design", "conditional generative adversarial networks", "gene ontology", "hierarchical multi-label", "GO", "GAN"], "abstract": "The availability of vast protein sequence information and rich functional annotations thereof has a large potential for protein design applications in biomedicine and synthetic biology.

The key idea is to design sequences while taking into account the hierarchical structure of the Gene Ontology.  Other contributions include the development of novel measures of assessment in this domain.\n\nThis is an ambitious piece of work.  Just describing everything that was done took a lot of space, and the authors have done a good job of relegating some of the important but less critical details to the supplement.\n\nOverall, the experimental design seems to be quite rigorous.  For example, it is nice to see significant time spent on hyperparameter optimization for the competing methods.\n\nOne of the main contributions of the paper is to propose a couple of performance measures that allow a set of designed proteins to be compared to a set of reference proteins. This is done using the MMD measure, based on a 3-mer spectrum kernel.  While the measures themselves seem reasonable, in order to propose a novel measure it seems that the paper should include some meta-evaluation of the measures themselves.  This could be achieved, e.g., by using 3D structure information to assess how well the proposed measures capture \"real\" similarity between proteins.  As it stands, the paper simply proposes the measures and then evaluates various protein design methods using those measures.\n\nThe general idea of taking into account the hierarchical structure of the GO is sensible, but not much effort seems to go into evaluating how well this worked.  Three embedding modes are mentioned briefly on p. 4, but the embeddings themselves are not discussed in the Results section, and there is no comparison to a variant of the proposed method that does not use this hierarchical information. \n\nThe results section also mentions, with respect to CVAE, that \"close inspection of the sequences and of the predicted chemophysical properties (Figure 5) of the sequences indicates that the sequences are not well-formed.\"  I can see from the figure that the sequences exhibit unusual characteristics, but more work should have been done to delve into this.\n\nMinor: In the second sentence of the abstract, I did not initially understand the meaning of the prhase \"or sequence fragments.\"  Based on the recurrence of this phrase on p. 2, I gather that the authors are talking about scenarios in which a protein is given a sequence fragment as the starting point for optimization, but this should be clarified.\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3025/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3025/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Conditional Generative Modeling for De Novo Hierarchical Multi-Label Functional Protein Design", "authorids": ["~Tim_Kucera1", "karsten.borgwardt@bsse.ethz.ch", "~Matteo_Togninalli1", "~Laetitia_Papaxanthos2"], "authors": ["Tim Kucera", "Karsten Michael Borgwardt", "Matteo Togninalli", "Laetitia Papaxanthos"], "keywords": ["protein design", "conditional generative adversarial networks", "gene ontology", "hierarchical multi-label", "GO", "GAN"], "abstract": "The availability of vast protein sequence information and rich functional annotations thereof has a large potential for protein design applications in biomedicine and synthetic biology.

They argue that this approach to conditional protein generation is more appropriate than sequence-based generation, because it gets directly at functional specification. At a high level, this is an interesting idea though it has already started to be explored by other works. The authors are correct that these works focus primarily on optimize a single function of interest. However, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any specific reason that guided design approaches could not generalize to multiple criteria. Regardless, controlled generation of proteins with pre specified functions is certainly interesting.\n\nThat said, the work presented here is too preliminary with too many missing baselines, missing or poorly/confusingly described experiments, and the dataset is not fully described. No comparisons are made against HMMs or other typical autoregressive generative models. Furthermore, there appear to be critical problems with the experiments. Specific comments follow below (in no particular order).\n\n1.\tIf I understand correctly, the MMD method used by the authors compares k-mer distributions between generated and real sequences. They set the k-mer size to 3 (\u201cThe size of the k-mers was set to 3\u201d). Therefore, MMD is only measuring whether the sampled 3-mer frequency matches the observed 3-mer frequency. This metric seems too simple and can\u2019t capture complex dependencies that exist in protein sequences. In fact, a simple 3-gram sequence model can perfectly optimize this metric. A simple baseline model in which sequences are generated from a 3-gram model conditioned on the function labels would be informative here. No evidence is otherwise provided that MMD is a good measure of the quality of a generative model.\n2.\tThe GAN seems like overkill for this problem. Have the authors considered any autoregressive generative models that can be trained by maximum likelihood?\n3.\tGANs also have the problem that likelihoods cannot be computed which makes it difficult, maybe even impossible, to use them to rank candidates or otherwise as priors over sequence space. If one wanted to use this model in practice, how would I choose a set of sequences to synthesize and experimentally validate? Strictly by random sampling? Is there a way to choose the top-k most likely sequences? In practice, experimental throughput is not large enough to explore many random samples, which is why focused design approaches have received so much attention. Is there a way to resolve this with GAN-based models?\n4.\tTrain/val/test splits: the val and test splits are very small. Much smaller than typically used for evaluating ML models (only 2% for val and test). Also, there is no analysis of sequence complexity within these groups. Typically, models are only of interest if they can generalize to relatively distant sequence. How similar are the train/val/test distributions? \n5.\tTable 1 reports standard deviations (I assume. It isn\u2019t stated what the error values are in the caption.) for random samples from the latent variables, but this doesn\u2019t take into account variability due to model training or the small test set. I encourage the authors to report standard errors over multiple data splits instead.\n6.\tI propose a simple generative model: given some set of GO terms, retrieve proteins with those terms from the training set. Then, to generate new proteins I simply propose those sequences. As a second approach, I fit an HMM to those sequences and sample new sequences from the HMM. How does this compare to the proposed approach? These baselines would also reveal how easy the val/test sets are due to similarity to the training set. \n7.\tIn Table 1, \u201cPositive Control\u201d is described confusingly: \u201cThe reference for MRR was again the test set and the evaluated sample an equally structured set (\u201dPositive Control\u201d)\u201d on p.23 is the only definition for positive control I can find. What is the positive control? \n8.\tThe primary use case for a model like this seems to be the ability to generate proteins with combinations of functions not found naturally. Otherwise, choosing a protein to start from is trivial: retrieve it from the database. Have the authors considered that use case?\n9.\tSequences lengths for the baseline models were limited to 32 amino acids whereas the proposed model has a maximum sequence length of 2048. Not only that, but only the first 32 amino acids were used? This does not seem like a fair comparison at all. Typical proteins are much longer than 32 amino acids, so it isn\u2019t surprising that the baselines perform poorly. Furthermore, this limitation makes no sense. RNNs can easily be applied to protein sequences of length 2048.\n10.\tProteins can have multiple GO terms associated with them. How was that dealt with? Do these proteins occur multiple times in the dataset for each term? Are proteins generated conditioned only a single term or multiple terms simultaneously? \n11.\tAs far as controlled sequence generation is concerned, \u201cGenerative Models for Graph-Based Protein Design\u201d - Ingraham 2019 seems highly relevant but is not mentioned.\n\nThings that would improve my rating:\n1.\tFully describe the train/val/test splits with analysis of sequence similarity between splits within functional categories. Increasing the size of the val and test splits is also a good idea.\n2.\tAdd reasonable baselines to the model evaluation and provide proof that MMD with k-mer size of 3 is a good measure of generative model quality. Baselines must be trained to generate complete sequences, rather than only the N-terminal 32 amino acids.\n3.\tProvide a more rigorous description of the model and experiments. A reader should, ideally, be able to understand the conditioning structure from the main text.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3025/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3025/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Conditional Generative Modeling for De Novo Hierarchical Multi-Label Functional Protein Design", "authorids": ["~Tim_Kucera1", "karsten.borgwardt@bsse.ethz.ch", "~Matteo_Togninalli1", "~Laetitia_Papaxanthos2"], "authors": ["Tim Kucera", "Karsten Michael Borgwardt", "Matteo Togninalli", "Laetitia Papaxanthos"], "keywords": ["protein design", "conditional generative adversarial networks", "gene ontology", "hierarchical multi-label", "GO", "GAN"], "abstract": "The availability of vast protein sequence information and rich functional annotations thereof has a large potential for protein design applications in biomedicine and synthetic biology. To this date, there exists no method for the general-purpose design of proteins without any prior knowledge about the protein of interest, such as costly and rare structure information or seed sequence fragments. However, the Gene Ontology (GO) database provides information about the hierarchical organisation of protein functions, and thus could inform generative models about the underlying complex sequence-function relationships, replacing the need for structural data. We therefore propose to use conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) on the task of fast de novo hierarchical multi-label protein design. We generate protein sequences exhibiting properties of a large set of molecular functions extracted from the GO database, using a single model and without any prior information. We shed light on efficient conditioning mechanisms and adapted network architectures thanks to a thorough hyperparameter selection process and analysis. We further provide statistically- and biologically-driven evaluation measures for generative models in the context of protein design to assess the quality of the generated sequences and facilitate progress in the field. We show that our proposed model, ProteoGAN, outperforms several baselines when designing proteins given a functional label and generates well-formed sequences.", "one-sentence_summary": "We develop a conditional Generative Adversarial Network for sequence-based protein design with hierarchical multi-label gene ontology annotations.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "kucera|conditional_generative_modeling_for_de_novo_hierarchical_multilabel_functional_protein_design", "pdf": "/pdf/9e789dd8d7baf0d6f20fe0ccae7d966bc5993e73.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=TVYJw9sn89", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkucera2021conditional,\ntitle={Conditional Generative Modeling for De Novo Hierarchical Multi-Label Functional Protein Design},\nauthor={Tim Kucera and Karsten Michael Borgwardt and Matteo Togninalli and Laetitia Papaxanthos},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=eHg0cXYigrT}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
