However, as correctly stated by the authors some of the unification (e.g. relation between LRP and Gradient*Input) has been already mentioned in prior work.\n\nSensitivity-n as a measure tries to tackle the difficulty of estimating the importance of features that can be seen either separately or in combination. While the measure shows interesting trends towards a linear behaviour for simpler methods, it does not persuade me as a measure of how well the relevance attribution method mimics the decision making process and does not really point out substantial differences between the different methods. Furthermore, The authors could comment on the relation between sensitivity-n and region perturbation techniques (Samek et al., IEEE TNNLS, 2017). Sensitivtiy-n seems to be an extension of the region perturbation idea to me.\n\nIt would be interesting to see the relation between the \"unified\" gradient-based explanation methods and approaches (e.g. Saliency maps, alpha-beta LRP, Deep Taylor, Deconvolution Networks, Grad-CAM, Guided Backprop ...) which do not fit into the unification framework. It's good that the author mention these works, still it would be great to see more discussion on the advantages/disadvantages, because these methods may have some nice theoretically properties (see e.g. the discussion on gradient vs. decompositiion techniques in Montavon et al., Digital Signal Processing, 2017) which can not be incorporated into the unified framework.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Towards better understanding of gradient-based attribution methods for Deep Neural Networks", "abstract": "Understanding the flow of information in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a challenging problem that has gain increasing attention over the last few years.

Saliency maps and Deep Taylor Decomposition only produce positive attribution maps and and this would penalize these methods in the sensitivity-n metric given that our task inputs do contain some negative evidence (as shown in Figure 3c). Similarly, alpha-beta LRP also adds some bias towards positive attributions with the parameters suggested by the authors. Grad-CAM, Deconvolutional Networks and Guided Backpropagation can only be applied to specific network architectures and do not fit our goal to compare methods across tasks and architectures, while we believe it is important for attribution methods to be as general as possible. We reported the same arguments at the end of section 2.2.\nWe also agree with your statement that other methods have been shown to have interesting theoretical properties. We actually did not intend to claim the superiority of gradient-based methods and added a note to clarify this in Section 3.1 in our last revision.\n\nAbout the connection with the region perturbation technique (Samek et al. 2017), this is similar to what we use (and now mention explicitly) to produce Figure 3c, with the difference that we occlude one pixel at the time, we produce the curves for the negative ranking as well as for the positive and we plot directly the output variation on the y-axis instead of the AOPC. This technique evaluates methods based on i) how \"fast\" the target activation drops or increase and ii) how \"much\" the target activation changes. However, we show in Figure 3c that these two criteria often collide if the curves for different methods intersect. This is in fact what motivated sensitivity-n.\nWith sensitivity-n, we fix a value n and remove random subsets of n features from the input (without following the ranking given by the attribution maps) and measure the Pearson correlation with the output variation. This shows that different methods are better at producing different explanations (influence of single features vs influence of regions) and therefore the question itself of which is the best attribution method does not make sense if a task is not further specified."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Towards better understanding of gradient-based attribution methods for Deep Neural Networks", "abstract": "Understanding the flow of information in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a challenging problem that has gain increasing attention over the last few years.
