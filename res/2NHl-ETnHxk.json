You have raised a couple of interesting points that we would hereby like to address. \n\nFirst of all we would like to clarify why we have referred to our method as being \u201con par\u201d with the other methods with respect to the age estimation experiment. Age estimation is a task with underlying label noise, since the brain age doesn\u2019t perfectly correlate with chronological age. We have found a statistical analysis to be potentially misleading to readers as the prediction errors were in the range of physiological variability for all models. We believe the performance of our method would be improved if larger datasets were available for training, or if we had access to increased computational resources.\n\nSecondly, we appreciate your comment regarding the use of multiple modalities. Initially, we intended to incorporate multiple modalities. However, we realized that modalities like T2W, FLAIR etc. are much scarcer than the T1-weighted images and the availability of consistent datasets is limited. Nonetheless, one possible approach to consider other modalities would be to use C-DeID-GAN to de-identify T1-weighted images followed by a domain-conversion network (e.g. T1W -> FLAIR) to synthesize an image in the other domains. We consider this to be a fruitful path of research that should be tackled in the future.\n\nRegarding the section on Controlling Synthesis via the Privacy Transform, the aim here was to show the principle that by manipulating $\\gamma$ we can control the appearance of the generated volume. This implies there is potential for more sophisticated manipulations that might explicitly control for the shape of the cranium, the jawline, etc. In the future, we might be able to better guarantee privacy by changing appearance via manipulation of the conditioning volume. We have made adjustments to the text to explain this more clearly.\n\nThank you for your input on the minor comments, we have addressed these in the current version of the paper. Thanks a lot for pointing them out.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1891/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1891/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Privacy Preservation in MRI Scans of the Brain", "authorids": ["~Lennart_Alexander_Van_der_Goten1", "~Tobias_Hepp1", "~Zeynep_Akata1", "~Kevin_Smith1"], "authors": ["Lennart Alexander Van der Goten", "Tobias Hepp", "Zeynep Akata", "Kevin Smith"], "keywords": ["medical imaging", "generative modeling", "privacy", "de-identification"], "abstract": "De-identification of magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) is intrinsically difficult since, even with all metadata removed, a person's face can easily be rendered and matched against a database.

ICLR has a broad scope, and many highly cited papers from ICLR have touched on other areas. Nevertheless, our work covers several highly relevant topics at ICLR including privacy, neuroscience, and GANs. More specifically, the conditional GAN we develop in this work contains several noteworthy innovations. Not the least of which is a new type of conditioning that must be non-invertible yet match the distribution of the original and preserve a designated region (the brain). We made other technical contributions as well, including the convex hull representation, the resampling blocks, and the use of a non-averaging relativistic loss. \n\nFinally, we note that the ICLR 2021 Call for Papers declares the following areas to be of relevance (https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2021/CallForPapers):\n>**applications in** audio, speech, robotics, **neuroscience**, computational biology, or any other field \u2026 societal considerations of representation learning including fairness, safety, **privacy**. Sister conferences ICML and NeurIPS regularly host a number of papers on medical image analysis (e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10511.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03829.pdf at NeurIPS 2020).\n\nPutting our work in context of the recent developments in generative modeling (e.g. MSG-GAN, StyleGAN), only very recently have the techniques used in natural images become mature enough to tackle the complex problem of de-identifying MRI scans. A minimally useful volume for MRI is 128x128x128, which eclipses the largest 1024x1024 images generated by GANs today. \n\nOur paper\u2019s main contribution is to define a new paradigm, or model class, for use in settings where part of the image must be perfectly retained but the rest must be de-identified to preserve privacy. The MRI application we present in the paper is just one example. We believe this problem will become increasingly important in the future. For example, consider uploading a face image for a skin cancer diagnosis. The face can be remodeled to preserve the patient\u2019s privacy while the lesion is untouched.\n\nWe believe that between our technical contributions and the definition of this new problem type, we have made noteworthy contributions to the ML community, showing how central problems in medical applications and society can be addressed by recent developments in deep learning. Finally, we would like to reference **AnonReviewer4** who deems our paper to be \u201cvery relevant to the community\u201d in support of this argument. \n\nTherefore, we would like to ask you to reconsider your verdict. Let us know if you have any further remarks.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1891/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1891/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Privacy Preservation in MRI Scans of the Brain", "authorids": ["~Lennart_Alexander_Van_der_Goten1", "~Tobias_Hepp1", "~Zeynep_Akata1", "~Kevin_Smith1"], "authors": ["Lennart Alexander Van der Goten", "Tobias Hepp", "Zeynep Akata", "Kevin Smith"], "keywords": ["medical imaging", "generative modeling", "privacy", "de-identification"], "abstract": "De-identification of magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) is intrinsically difficult since, even with all metadata removed, a person's face can easily be rendered and matched against a database.

Your concern regarding the removal of the face is indeed partially correct. It does extremely well at privacy preservation. As you can find in our experiments in the Table in Figure 3, removing everything except the brain has a 18.9% correct guess rate on OASIS-3 (beating our proposed method) and a 22.28% correct guess rate for ADNI (see results for MRI watershed, the method which removes all data except for the brain).\n\nSo what is the point of retaining the face?\n\nThe short answer can be found in Figure 4. Segmentation from the industry standard software fails if significant parts of the volume are missing. Age estimation also performs less reliably. **In general, automated medical measurements are developed using images with full patient data, and behave unpredictably when regions are deleted to preserve privacy.** We are not the first to realize this. For instance, [Milchenko & Marcus, 2013], the authors of FACE MASK, argue the same: \n```\n\u201cMany prior de-identification methods have employed pre-existing techniques that were developed for other purposes, such as MR skull stripping, a common preprocessing step in many neuroimaging studies. Skull stripping algorithms such as (Smith 2002) classify voxels into brain and non-brain, and leave only brain voxels in the dataset. This approach has the drawback that it removes anatomical features that are necessary to calculate important values such as intracranial volume and cerebrospinal fluid volume  [...]  In our experience, however, skull stripping requires careful supervision and may be affected by variation in diagnoses, age groups, MR field inhomogeneity, etc. (Fennema-Notestine et al. 2006).\u201d\n```\nAdditionally, de Sitter et. al [2019] (referenced in \u201cRelated Work\u201d) empirically analyzed how de-identification (denoted as FFR for \u201cfacial feature removal\u201d) methods affect relevant clinical  and scientific downstream tasks (among those SIENAX). An excerpt of their conclusion reads as follows: \n```\n\u201cOur results showed that the commonly used FFR methods can lead to subsequent failures of automated volumetric pipelines. Moreover, FFR can lead to substantial changes\u2014both random (low ICC) and systematic (significant differences)\u2014in volumes obtained by automated methods.\u201d\n```\nTo summarize, reshaping rather than deleting the privacy-sensitive regions is desirable because it ensures privacy and at the same time ensures robustness in the downstream automated medical analyses. \n\nAdmittedly, we didn\u2019t do a good job at outlining this thought process in the paper, as R5 was also confused on this point. Therefore, we have made changes to the **introduction and related work** in the uploaded draft to clarify this point, so that the reader can get a better understanding of the topic.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1891/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1891/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Privacy Preservation in MRI Scans of the Brain", "authorids": ["~Lennart_Alexander_Van_der_Goten1", "~Tobias_Hepp1", "~Zeynep_Akata1", "~Kevin_Smith1"], "authors": ["Lennart Alexander Van der Goten", "Tobias Hepp", "Zeynep Akata", "Kevin Smith"], "keywords": ["medical imaging", "generative modeling", "privacy", "de-identification"], "abstract": "De-identification of magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) is intrinsically difficult since, even with all metadata removed, a person's face can easily be rendered and matched against a database.

When we first observed the results in Figure 3 from MTurk, we were equally surprised by the results. \n\nFor this reason, we have included two pages in the Appendix [zipped in the supplementary material], one for OASIS-3 (p. 7) and one for ADNI (p. 8). **We observe that cues such as the cranial shape or shape of the ocular (eye) cavity can give hints that help the (Mechanical Turk) workers to identify patients.** These pointers do not exist, however, when it comes to C-DeID-GAN or MRI Watershed. For the former case, the privacy transform suppresses this information, and, for the latter case, the information is simply removed by the algorithm. This is exactly the reason why other methods (QUICKSHEAR, FACE MASK, DEFACE) exhibit worse results than C-DeID-GAN and MRI Watershed. Arguably, this constitutes a very strong notion of de-identification in which not only are traditional cues we would expect must be changed (eyes, nose, ears, etc.) but also less obvious ones such as cranial shape and jawline. Nonetheless, we are convinced that this more strict measure of de-identification is warranted given the significance of data-privacy within the medical field.\n\nAdditionally, we would like to address the point you made about C-DeID-GAN not outperforming the other methods in every case. You are absolutely right on this matter, the rationale behind this circumstance can be explained by imperfections in the GAN quality. More specifically, we face two limitations: \n1. Firstly, data limitations (both ADNI and OASIS-3) contain less than 3k images, which is very small in comparison to the data available for conventional GAN papers. \n2. Secondly, hardware limitations (especially GPU memory) that make it currently impossible to make C-DeID-GAN more expressive (e.g. by adding more channels/layers)\n\nHowever, our main focus was on establishing a new model class (remodeling instead of removing) that helps to pave the path for more research that can further close \u201cthe gap\u201d. \nWe are grateful for you raising these points and we are devoted to adding further explanations in the paper.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1891/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1891/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Privacy Preservation in MRI Scans of the Brain", "authorids": ["~Lennart_Alexander_Van_der_Goten1", "~Tobias_Hepp1", "~Zeynep_Akata1", "~Kevin_Smith1"], "authors": ["Lennart Alexander Van der Goten", "Tobias Hepp", "Zeynep Akata", "Kevin Smith"], "keywords": ["medical imaging", "generative modeling", "privacy", "de-identification"], "abstract": "De-identification of magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) is intrinsically difficult since, even with all metadata removed, a person's face can easily be rendered and matched against a database.

Let us begin with the misconception about retaining only the brain. We have adjusted the text in our revision to make it more clear, since R2 was also confused on this point.\n\nTo summarize the answer: reshaping rather than deleting the privacy-sensitive regions is desirable because it ensures privacy and at the same time ensures robustness in the downstream automated medical analyses. This was demonstrated in our own experiments in Figure 4 where segmentation from the industry standard software fails if significant parts of the volume are missing. Age estimation also performs less reliably. Note: MRI watershed is the method that removes all but the brain as you suggest. Beyond the results in our own study, we would like to give you a couple of examples on how other papers have justified their approach (i.e. to retain significantly more than just the brain):\n```\nQUICKSHEAR [Schimke et al., 2011]:\n[Section 3.2]\n\u201cSkull stripping methods are highly sensitive to parameters, which may often result into loss of desirable brain tissue. The results may also vary between methods and can require manual correction. Differences in data sets may impact further analysis, such as segmentation. Skull stripping may also favor a particular region based on the particular study [6]. This complicates meta-analysis, data re-use, and collaboration by discarding potentially relevant voxels.\u201d\n[...]\n\u201cIt is tempting to de-identify with skull stripping since it is part of analysis, but defacing techniques allow for more flexibility. Simply skull stripping an image may discard useful data.\u201d \n```\n```\nFACE MASK [Milchenko & Marcus, 2013]:\n\u201cMany prior de-identification methods have employed pre-existing techniques that were developed for other purposes, such as MR skull stripping, a common preprocessing step in many neuroimaging studies. Skull stripping algorithms such as (Smith 2002) classify voxels into brain and non-brain, and leave only brain voxels in the dataset. This approach has the drawback that it removes anatomical features that are necessary to calculate important values such as intracranial volume and cerebrospinal fluid volume [..] In our experience, however, skull stripping requires careful supervision and may be affected by variation in diagnoses, age groups, MR field inhomogeneity, etc. (Fennema-Notestine et al. 2006).\u201d\n```\nIn general, automated medical measurements are developed using images with full patient data, and behave unpredictably when regions are deleted to preserve privacy Most tools (c.f. SIENAX) are designed to work well on images that look like \u201coriginal\u201d MR images (i.e. not de-identified). We therefore believe that an approach that aims to retain the distribution (i.e. still looks original) has merit because it serves as a common denominator against which researchers can align their downstream models.\n\nWe are a bit confused by the point that you made regarding the de-identification quality (c.f. \u201c[...] you have not demonstrated that your method would perform well on it either\u201d). We believe that the experiment \u201cStudy on De-Identification Quality\u201d provides sufficient proof for claiming that C-DeID-GAN attains almost perfect de-identification results (identification rates are 23.88% [OASIS-3] resp. 21.56% [ADNI] which are both close to the theoretical optimum of 20%). We would be very open to additional input from your side to clarify this.\n\nFinally, we would like to address your point regarding a protection against algorithmic attacks (e.g. a CNN). Initially, we also envisioned to conduct an algorithmic test to check whether the synthesized images are prone to attacks. However, we quickly realized that this experiment is futile because the construction of the privacy transformation provides theoretical guarantees of privacy because only the (i) convex hull and the (ii) brain are taken from the actual patient.  The former doesn\u2019t expose any privacy-related information while the latter needs to be present by definition. Therefore, we decided to drop this experiment in light of the strong theoretical guarantees that are induced by the proposed privacy transform. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1891/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1891/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Privacy Preservation in MRI Scans of the Brain", "authorids": ["~Lennart_Alexander_Van_der_Goten1", "~Tobias_Hepp1", "~Zeynep_Akata1", "~Kevin_Smith1"], "authors": ["Lennart Alexander Van der Goten", "Tobias Hepp", "Zeynep Akata", "Kevin Smith"], "keywords": ["medical imaging", "generative modeling", "privacy", "de-identification"], "abstract": "De-identification of magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) is intrinsically difficult since, even with all metadata removed, a person's face can easily be rendered and matched against a database.

Providing an overview of the related work, they highlighted the shortcomings of the commonly applied methods to preserve privacy while simultaneously maintaining facial structures to enable commonly applied operations such as brain segmentation. To address these challenges the authors built on similar GANs approaches and adjusted it to the 3D dimensionality and the added criteria to fully preserve the brain area in the transformation. They experimentally validated the proposed method using two MR imaging datasets (ADNI and OASIS-3) for a) privacy preservation b) Common image processing (Brain/VCSF/GM/WM segmentation and age prediction). Finally they demonstrated a PoC for different image resolutions.\n\nThe scope of the paper is very relevant to the community. The paper is well presented within the scientific context. The methodology development and the experimental validation are well done. Overall the contribution is justified.\n\nMajor comments:\n\n* While the experimental validation is well designed, a statistical analysis is missing and is quite essential to support some of the authors' claims. Claims such as \u201cthe model performs on par with the other models\u201d are not meaningful enough without a statistical test to confirm it. This specifically refers to the analysis results shown in Figures 3 and 4. \n* One of the main advantages of MRI compared to other neuroimaging methods is the multi-modality, i.e. utilization of different MRI sequences (such as DWI, PWI, FLAIR and others) to retrieve different properties of the brain tissue. The authors tested the operations of segmentation and age prediction but did not address this aspect. A common process that is usually done with MRI multi-modal imaging is co-registration. Where does that come into play with regard to the DeID method? How is that addressed or will be potentially addressed? I would find it useful if the authors could relate to that point. \n* Regarding the analysis on controlling synthesis via the privacy transform, I\u2019ve found the motivation for the analysis as well as the conclusion are not entirely clear.

The convex hull was used to instruct the GAN to generate a synthetic face. The main contribution of this paper is that they use GAN to generate a 3D volume MRI in which the face has been remodeled rather than removed. Experiment results showed the proposed method outperforms several existing removed-based methods.\nCons:\nMy main concern about this paper is the purpose of remodeling the face. In my opinion, removing the original face is enough for the de-identification of an MRI scan. Why spent so much effort to generate a new one? Is the new face provides extra information to the downstream medical analyses? The authors point out that their method did not alter any content of medically relevant data. Therefore, I think remodeling the fake face is unnecessary and the method may have little practical uses.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1891/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1891/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Privacy Preservation in MRI Scans of the Brain", "authorids": ["~Lennart_Alexander_Van_der_Goten1", "~Tobias_Hepp1", "~Zeynep_Akata1", "~Kevin_Smith1"], "authors": ["Lennart Alexander Van der Goten", "Tobias Hepp", "Zeynep Akata", "Kevin Smith"], "keywords": ["medical imaging", "generative modeling", "privacy", "de-identification"], "abstract": "De-identification of magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) is intrinsically difficult since, even with all metadata removed, a person's face can easily be rendered and matched against a database.

I am very confused however about the point of the problem you are trying to solve. From what I understand you want to take a voxelized version of an MRI scan and distort it such that the observed face is no longer identifiable with the original patient, but the useful information in the MRI is preserved. Part of your method requires or extracts the brain from the MRI. In either case you claim that that is information is available and sufficient for downstream tasks, and everything can be removed. Would a superior method here not just be to take this brain information directly.  The De-Identification Quality metric which you use would obviously get the optimal 20% accuracy here as the we have no way of associating images of brains with images of faces, and even if we do, you have not demonstrated that you method would perform well on it either. I see no point in altering the face of the scans as the face information will be useless for any downstream task, and all other information is apparently preserved, so why not just take this preserved data as the privacy preserving MRI information? While this may fail to perform well under SIENAX, I would say this is a problem with using this software as a metric, as the brain would clearly be preserved. \n\nIf I am mistaken here, I apologies, and am happy to change by rating and comments given sufficient reasoning. However, from the knowledge I posses in the field I do not think the approach has merit due to superior, trivial baselines. \n\nI also have an issue with the experiment for assessing privacy preservation. I would say that the mechanical turk experiment is valuable, but only if you also demonstrate that deep learning based approaches cannot identify the associate the faces as well. Without this I have no way of knowing if your method fails to a simple CNN. \n\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1891/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1891/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Privacy Preservation in MRI Scans of the Brain", "authorids": ["~Lennart_Alexander_Van_der_Goten1", "~Tobias_Hepp1", "~Zeynep_Akata1", "~Kevin_Smith1"], "authors": ["Lennart Alexander Van der Goten", "Tobias Hepp", "Zeynep Akata", "Kevin Smith"], "keywords": ["medical imaging", "generative modeling", "privacy", "de-identification"], "abstract": "De-identification of magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) is intrinsically difficult since, even with all metadata removed, a person's face can easily be rendered and matched against a database.
