The paper provides experiments on real robots (never a small task), and a data-set for the community, and a sequence of illustrative experiments. Because the paper combines existing techniques, its main contribution is the empirical demonstrations of the utility of using sound. Overall, it was not quite enough for the reviewers. The main issues were: (1) motion prediction is perhaps expected given the physical setup, (2) lack of comparison with other approaches, (3) lack of diversity in the demonstrations (10 objects, one domain).\n\nThe authors added two new experiments with a different setup, further demonstrating their claims. In addition the authors highlighted that the novelty of this task means there are no clear baselines (to which r3 agreed). The new experiments are briefly described in the response (and visuals on a website), but the authors did not update the paper. The new experiments could potentially significantly strength the paper. However, the terse description in the response and the supplied visuals made it difficult for the reviewers to judge their contribution.\n\nOverall, this is certainly a very interesting direction. The results on real world data demonstrate promise, even if they are not the benchmarking style the community is used too.

Since the goal of this paper is to highlight the synergies between action audio and vision, we believed that a mixed section better reflects our contributions. However, following your suggestions, we are happy to separate section 3 into two separate sections. Thank you for pointing out the typos, this will be fixed in the final version of this work.\n\nRelated works: Thank you for pointing out Zhang et al. We think that this a very insightful paper that provides a way to generate audio data for object based on its 3D model and physical properties. However all the data used here is from a simulator. All of our data is from the real-world and on a real robot, because of which our learned embeddings work on real-world tasks.\n\nWe hope to have addressed your concerns with additional real-robot experiments.

This is because different combinations of start-state and action can result in the same generated sound. Using only sound information without start images leads to a lower MSE by around 5-10% across all the inverse model tasks. This shows that using the first image is important, however even without it, we can get fairly high performance. Thank you for suggesting this experiment; we will add this result in the final version of the paper.\n\nGround truth location of object for forward prediction model: Given an image of an object, we first perform background subtraction to segment the object. The centroid of this segmentation is used as the ground truth state of the object. Additional details will be added in the Appendix and segmentation masks will be released along with the dataset.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1617/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1617/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Swoosh!

We are also thankful to some interesting suggestions given by reviewers. In global comments, we would like to handle the question of novelty and experiments. For specific questions/queries, we provide individual answers to reviewers.\n\nNovelty: We believe the idea of investigating the relationship between sound and action is novel, which has never been investigated before in this thorough manner. As R1 points out, using sound/audio in forward dynamics is \u201crelatively new and may lead to many potential future developments in this direction.\u201d  Our work creates both a dataset and proposes a new framework for robotic learning with audio, and therefore we believe this work is valuable to the learning community. While some of these findings might be intuitive, our paper is the first to model these and empirically measure the role of audio in dynamics modeling. \n\nTechnical Novelty: As a matter of conscious choice, we did not play a lot with forward/inverse models or new architectures to highlight the fact that even while using standard models, using audio in dynamics modeling can lead to significant gains. But the paper still has several technical innovations that might have been overlooked. First, creating a robotic platform and framework to get a dataset with action, audio, and vision is challenging and a novel contribution of this work. Then, using this data to show that audio contains fine-grained information that can distinguish say a screwdriver from a hammer has never been shown before, and the first in this work. Finally, we demonstrate that object representations that we generate solely from audio information is useful for downstream tasks like forward transition model learning and even in robotic manipulation as shown by Robotic Push experiments (See below). \n\nExperiments\n\nR1: Comparison to SOTA \nFirst, we would like to reiterate that this is the first work that combines audio, action, and vision in a single learning framework over a large and diverse variety of objects. Hence, to our knowledge, there are no published work or SOTA algorithms using this new learning framework. If there are any such algorithms and papers, please send them our way, and we will compare with them. In terms of downstream tasks, we perform forward modelling (Section 3.5), which is a precursor for planning in robot manipulation. \n\nR1, R3: More experiments including robot manipulation.\n\nWe are pleased to report two new experiments to highlight the strength of our key idea. \n\nExperiment A - Robotic Pushing: In the first set of experiments, we look at how audio embeddings can be used for better robotic pushing. For this, we collect a dataset of around 1000 planar pushing experiments on 10 training set object, and test the audio-conditioned pushing model on 10 testing set objects. We note that without audio embedding the MSE error of the pushing location is 0.180 (normalized coordinates), while using audio embeddings gives an MSE error of 0.159. This clearly demonstrates that audio embeddings can significantly improve robotic pushing. Robot pushing videos can be accessed on our website: https://sites.google.com/view/iclr2020-sound-action.\n\nExperiment B - Few Shot Classification: In the second set of experiments, we look at how audio embeddings can be used for few shot classification on previously unseen objects. The key insight from this experiment is that for all numbers few-shot examples, using audio embeddings gives a performance of around 2-3X the performance of using randomly initialized CNNs. Specifically, say for k=1, using audio embeddings give a performance of 21%, while random CNN gives 7%. This further shows that audio embeddings contains useful information for fine-grained object recognition. Full results can be seen on our website: https://sites.google.com/view/iclr2020-sound-action.

The authors then tested how audio embeddings help object recognition and forward model prediction. \n\nThe idea presented in this paper is quite interesting. However, there are no significant technical innovations, the experimental evaluations are quite limited, and the writing can be improved. My overall recommendation is weak reject.\n\nThe problem of integrating audio for perception is interesting and has been quite widely explored; however, this paper extends the setup to also explore the effect of audios on dynamics modeling. This is relatively new and may lead to many potential future developments in this direction.\n\nTechnically, however, this paper mostly builds on existing technicals on learning forward and inverse models, except that the input is now audio in addition to video. The experimental results are also very limited. They are restricted to a single domain, a fixed collection of objects, and there are no comparisons with published, SOTA algorithms. There are also no results on downstream tasks such as robot manipulation.\n\nI also wonder how the authors think of the related work from Zhang et al: http://sound.csail.mit.edu/ , as they've also studied the effect of auditory and visual data in shape and material recognition.\n\nThe writing can be improved. Currently, the model and results are in the same section and mixed together. It'd prefer to separate them. There are a number of typos (incorrect spacing, etc.), especially in Section 3.4.

In robotics, we have seen tremendous progress in using visual and tactile perception; however we have often ignored a key sense: sound. This is primarily due to lack of data that captures the interplay of action and sound. In this work, we perform the first large-scale study of the interactions between sound and robotic action. To do this, we create the largest available sound-action-vision dataset with 15,000 interactions on 60 objects using our robotic platform Tilt-Bot. By tilting objects and allowing them to crash into the walls of a robotic tray, we collect rich four-channel audio information. Using this data, we explore the synergies between sound and action, and present three key insights. First, sound is indicative of fine-grained object class information, e.g., sound can differentiate a metal screwdriver from a metal wrench. Second, sound also contains information about the causal effects of an action, i.e. given the sound produced, we can predict what action was applied on the object. Finally, object representations derived from audio embeddings are indicative of implicit physical properties. We demonstrate that on previously unseen objects, audio embeddings generated through interactions can predict forward models 24% better than passive visual embeddings.
