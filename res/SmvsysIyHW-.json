To do so, we characterize an environment\u2019s exploration difficulty via the Second Largest Eigenvalue Modulus (SLEM) of the Markov chain induced by uniform stochastic behaviour. Specifically, we investigate the connection of state-space coverage with the SLEM of this Markov chain and use the theory of contraction coefficients to derive estimates of this eigenvalue of interest. Furthermore, we introduce a method for estimating the contraction coefficients on a local level and leverage it to design a novel exploration algorithm. We evaluate our algorithm on a series of GridWorld tasks of varying sizes and complexity.", "pdf": "/pdf/53cc242381870f7e58b5422d5130aa3c3f046e56.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|loco_adaptive_exploration_in_reinforcement_learning_via_local_estimation_of_contraction_coefficients", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021loco,\ntitle={{\\{}LOCO{\\}}: Adaptive exploration in reinforcement learning via local estimation of contraction coefficients},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to Self-Supervision for Reinforcement Learning Workshop - ICLR 2021},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SmvsysIyHW-},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615310247528, "tmdate": 1615313016556, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
