Building upon Hsu et al., (2019), the overriding goal is to examine the degree to which such an oracle is can provide memory and time improvements across broad streaming regimes.  In doing so, optimal bounds are derived in conjunction with a heavy hitter oracle.\n\nAlthough the rebuttal and discussion period did not lead to a consensus in the scoring of this paper, two reviewers were highly supportive.  However, the primary criticism from the lone dissenting reviewer was based on the high-level presentation and motivation, and in particular, the impression that the paper read more like a STOC theory paper.  In this regard though, my belief is that the authors can easily tailor a revision to increase the accessibility to a wider ICLR audience.", "title": "Paper Decision"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["taj320@lehigh.edu", "yili@ntu.edu.sg", "honghao_lin@sjtu.edu.cn", "24320152202802@stu.xmu.edu.cn", "dwoodruf@andrew.cmu.edu"], "title": "Learning-Augmented Data Stream Algorithms", "authors": ["Tanqiu Jiang", "Yi Li", "Honghao Lin", "Yisong Ruan", "David P.

A prior work of Hsu et al. (ICLR'18) showed that heavy hitter oracles exist and that they can be constructed using machine learning techniques. We are using the same type of oracles in our current submission. Similar oracles have been studied in previous works too, e.g., membership oracles for Bloom filters in Kraska et al. Both the previous works and the experiments in the current submission demonstrate that it is reasonable to make such an oracle assumption.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the questions on optimization ability, generalization error, etc. These are interesting research directions. The answers are very likely to depend on the application, data sets, etc., which we plan to study in the future.\n\nThe prior work by Hsu et al. showed that the oracle trained by deep learning has high accuracy (see Section 5.3 in their paper): for Internet traffic data, the AUC score is 0.9, and for search query data, the AUC score is 0.8. The performance of a simple online algorithm would likely depend on the type of classifier used and input feature representation. Linear classifiers with IP addresses represented as individual bits are unlikely to work well because their expressive power is limited. For instance, at the very least, we would like our classifier to express a DNF hypothesis of the form:\n(IP address = a1) or (IP address  = a2) or ...\n\nWe have updated the introduction to rephrase and clarify the lower bound claims.

The authors give provably better algorithms for the distinct elements problem, F_p moment problem (p > 2), and some more problems. These are important problems in streaming data analysis. They improve the space bounds and interestingly in some cases the bounds are better than what is possible without the oracle assumption. This also shows the power of such an oracle. There are experimental results to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithms. At a high level the work seems good and interesting for a large audience interested in streaming data analysis.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze whether such an oracle can help streaming algorithms to obtain improved bounds. I am not very familiar with this line of research so my comments will be more general in this case. The idea of improved bounds for streaming algorithms using machine learning oracle seems to be very appealing to me. The authors present novel theoretical results supporting this.\n\nExperiments are performed on real as well as synthetic datasets using Hsu et al.\u2019s method as an oracle.  Two real-world problems are selected, i.e., distinct packets in a network flow, Number of occurrences of each type of search query, and it is shown that using a oracle improves performance as compared to methods that do not use the oracle. Overall, I think the paper seems to be  an interesting direction which has both formal guarantees and experiments validating them in real-world datasets. One issue is perhaps, very little in terms of related work.

The authors show that under this model, there exist algorithms that have significantly better time and space complexity than the current best known algorithms that do not use an oracle. The authors support their theoretical analysis with experiments in which the oracle is represented by a deep neural network and demonstrate improvement over classical algorithms that do not use machine learning.\n\nOverall, this paper seems like a solid contribution to the literature. However, in its current state it does seem to be presented and motivated in a way that is appropriate for the audience of ML researchers at ICLR. It reads very much like a STOC theory paper, and a lot of the key ML details that would be relevant to audience at this conference seem to have been shoved under the rug in a way. Therefore my score for now is a weak reject, but I am very happy to increase the score if the authors address my presentations concerns.\n\nMajor comments:\n* The oracle-augmented datasteam model needs to be contextualized better. I don't have a good sense of whether this is a reasonable theoretical model to explore and a lot of very basic questions remain unanswered for me. For example, how do I even know that the oracle in question exists? What are the particular assumptions under which it exists? What are the requirements on the training data, optimization ability, generalization error, etc. How do we know that we can create in practice ML learning models that are sufficiently accurate to serve as an oracle?\n\n* The connections to deep learning seem arbitrary in some of the experiments. In one of the experiments, the authors train neural networks over a concatenation of IP address embeddings. Why do we need to use deep learning here? What is the benefit of using DL algorithms within the oracle-augmented datastream model? Is a simple algorithm enough? What algorithms should we ideally use in practice? What if you used simpler online learning algorithms with formal accuracy guarantees?\n\nMinor comments:\n* I thought there was a bit over-selling in intro. The authors say that they match the theoretical lower bounds for several problems. However, you are in a different computational model in which you now have access to an oracle. This needs to be made more explicitly, and language could be a bit toned down (e.g. in this model, we can obtain runtime that match or improve over lower bounds...)"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2046/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2046/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["taj320@lehigh.edu", "yili@ntu.edu.sg", "honghao_lin@sjtu.edu.cn", "24320152202802@stu.xmu.edu.cn", "dwoodruf@andrew.cmu.edu"], "title": "Learning-Augmented Data Stream Algorithms", "authors": ["Tanqiu Jiang", "Yi Li", "Honghao Lin", "Yisong Ruan", "David P.
