Final message muddied by lack of clarity and upselling of results.", "review": "### Summary\nThis paper gives generalization guarantees for vanilla knowledge distillation, where it identifies a large variance issue due to the teacher\u2019s complexity in this guarantee, and then proposes alternative approaches to eliminate this issue. The framework it uses is inspired by semi-parametric methods. The main resulting algorithm has two key components: cross-fitting and a corrective surrogate loss. An SGD variant is also presented. Experiments illustrate some of the benefits of the cross-fitting approach.\n\n### Strengths\n+ The semi-parametric perspective and the attempt to have a bias-variance tradeoff as part of the knowledge distillation procedure are well-motivated and insightful.\n+  Lemma 2 is a neat technical building block and it has the potential of being useful beyond the scope of the paper.\n\n### Weaknesses\n- The paper lacks clarity in notation and presentation. In terms of notation, many expressions are overloaded (multiple forms of $\\gamma$ and completely different meanings for symbols $\\zeta$ and $\\mu$). In terms of clarity: important definitions are buried in the text instead of being highlighted (e.g. the corrective surrogate loss or the choice of, the definition of $q_p$ given only in an example), key steps are not always spelled out (e.g. the Bregman divergence simplifications, the choice of $\\hat \\gamma= q_{\\hat p}$ in the cross-fitting approach, or the use of the teacher in the SGD approach)\n- The motivation of the intermediate choices are not well-presented. For example, in transitioning to the corrective surrogate loss, a Taylor expansion of the ideal loss is used, but then the $\\gamma$-corrected loss is given without explanation. To me it seems to be motivated only by quadratic losses, but I\u2019m sure more can be said by the authors.\n- Some of the arguments in favor of the paper are a bit underhanded. ~~For example, when discussing the drawbacks of vanilla distillation, the paper calls them *inherent*, though the only evidence is the upper bound provided. To make such a claim, a lower bound is needed.~~ [Edit: the author's lower bound is good.]\n- More importantly, the key contribution of the approach, the claim of eliminating the teacher complexity from the upper bounds is not quite crisp. Namely, Theorem 4 requires a upper bound on the critical radii of *uniformly over all* classes that could be empirically selected by the teacher. It\u2019s true that the complexity of the union of these classes (as in Theorem 1) can still be larger than this uniform bound. But this is not the comparison that the paper makes when it expounds the advantage of the new bound. Instead, it compares the complexity of any *one* of these classes (paragraph at the end of Section 4.2, page 6) to the union, which is disingenuous.\n- Lastly, even though the corrective surrogate loss is touted as the key component of the approach, the experiments clearly show that it\u2019s the cross-fitting that is ultimately regularizing the problem and reducing the dependence on the teacher\u2019s complexity. But this isn\u2019t analyzed in isolation in the paper. In general, the corrective loss only contributes modestly. The only exception seems in the Adult Dataset, but only when the teacher has *low* complexity, which is also not part of the message of the paper.\n\n### Overall\nI found that the paper takes an interesting approach to giving guarantees to KD methods, with several interesting technical contributions. However, the final message of the paper is muddied by the lack of clarity and an attempt to upsell the actual technical results. This is why at this point I would place the paper as borderline.\n\n_[Edit: I read the response of the authors. The lower bound for vanilla KD seems good. But the author still fail to adequately explain the gain of Thm 4 (now Thm 3). The requisite upper bound on the critical radius uniformly over all potential functions generated by the teacher means that the result of the theorem still has an implicit dependence on the teacher's complexity. For this reason, I will leave my recommendation the same.]_\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2515/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2515/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Knowledge Distillation as Semiparametric Inference", "authorids": ["~Tri_Dao1", "govinda.kamath@microsoft.com", "~Vasilis_Syrgkanis1", "~Lester_Mackey1"], "authors": ["Tri Dao", "Govinda M Kamath", "Vasilis Syrgkanis", "Lester Mackey"], "keywords": ["knowledge distillation", "semiparametric inference", "generalization bounds", "model compression", "cross-fitting", "orthogonal machine learning", "loss correction"], "abstract": "A popular approach to model compression is to train an inexpensive student model to mimic the class probabilities of a highly accurate but cumbersome teacher model.

A key theoretical question about KD is whether and how much this two-step approach can improve on the one-step approach that trains the student model directly on the labeled data. This paper casts KD as a semiparametric inference problem by treating the optimal student model as the parameter of primary interest and the true class probabilities as the nuisance parameter. Building on the semiparametric framework, the paper makes two contributions: 1) develops theoretical guarantees for the vanilla KD algorithm; 2) proposes improved KD by using a first-order bias-corrected loss and a sample splitting procedure.\n\nOverall, I find the paper novel, well-written, and thought-provoking. It bridges the two directions of KD and semiparametric inference, allowing for the possibility of borrowing theoretical and methodological tools from semiparametric inference to analyze and improve the KD approach.\n\nOn the other hand, I think the paper somewhat oversells the semiparametric inference idea, since the theory presented in the paper (Theorem 1) does not have much semiparametric flavor. The central questions in semiparametric inference are the information bounds and semiparametric efficiency for the target parameter. Although Theorem 1 is useful, it does not directly address these key questions. For example, what is the best possible performance for the student model? In many classical semiparametric inference problems, we are able to construct a semiparametrically efficient estimator. Would this be possible for KD?\n\nMore comments:\n1) The paper seems to treat $f_0$ as infinite dimensional (page 3, 3rd paragraph of Section 3). However, classical semiparametric inference largely exploits the finite or low dimensionality of the target parameter to answer the questions mentioned above. In the KD framework, I still think the finite-dimensional case is more interesting and would provide more fundamental insights.\n\n2) There is a notable difference between the settings of KD and classical semiparametric inference: the target parameter $f_0$ in KD is ancillary in the sense that the data generating model depends only on the nuisance parameter $p_0$. Would this affect the applicability of semiparametric inference techniques?\n\n3) Page 4, line 11, \u201cstudent\u201d should be \u201cteacher\u201d.\n\nUpdate: I appreciate the authors\u2019 response. The answer to my semiparametric efficiency question, however, is too terse and unclear. Theorems 1 and 3 provide only error bounds; I don\u2019t see how they, together with the semiparametric efficiency of OLS, directly imply semiparametric efficiency for the student model. Semiparametric efficiency involves the optimal asymptotic variance. The authors might have confused the concept with rate optimality. Nevertheless, the paper is a nice contribution, and I will keep my rating.", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2515/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2515/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Knowledge Distillation as Semiparametric Inference", "authorids": ["~Tri_Dao1", "govinda.kamath@microsoft.com", "~Vasilis_Syrgkanis1", "~Lester_Mackey1"], "authors": ["Tri Dao", "Govinda M Kamath", "Vasilis Syrgkanis", "Lester Mackey"], "keywords": ["knowledge distillation", "semiparametric inference", "generalization bounds", "model compression", "cross-fitting", "orthogonal machine learning", "loss correction"], "abstract": "A popular approach to model compression is to train an inexpensive student model to mimic the class probabilities of a highly accurate but cumbersome teacher model.

Then, the paper adapts techniques from semi-parametric inference to analyze the error of a student model and improve the performance of knowledge distillation. The presentation is overall of good quality and it is relatively easy for me to follow the logic flow. That being said, there is still some room of improving the clarity of the paper.\n\nP1: Analyzing and improving knowledge distillation from a point view of semi-parametric inference is very interesting.  The adaptation of semi-parametric inference techniques such as cross-fitting and orthogonal machine learning is novel.\n\nC1: The related work is not sufficient. After reviewing some pioneer studies in knowledge distillation before 2015, this paper jumps to very recent studies in 2020.  As knowledge distillation is a hot research topic, there are a large number of related studies from 2016 to 2019. It is highly recommended for this paper to present the advance of knowledge distillation techniques from 2015 until now in a more comprehensive and organized way.\n\nC2: Some contributions of this paper, cross-fitting and orthogonal machine learning, are largely adapted from semi-parametric inference literature. The contribution that is not adapted from semi-parametric inference literature is the proposed correction that balances the bias and variance. The correction is a linear combination of a bias term and a variance term. It is not clear how the bias and variance terms are related to the theoretical analysis in previous sections.

Here is a concrete example that we can include in the final revision.  Consider the squared error logit loss (1) and let F be a linear model class so that $f_0(x)$ is the best linear approximation to $\\log(p_0(x))$ in a least squares sense.  Then, by Thm. 4 in our submission (now Thm. 3 in the revision), whenever the teacher MSE $\\| p_0 - \\hat{p} \\|_{2,2} = o(n^{-1/4})$, our gamma-corrected cross-fitted student is semiparametrically efficient (because ordinary least squares is semiparametrically efficient for the linear projection model by Chamberlain \u201cAsymptotic efficiency in estimation with conditional moment restrictions,\u201d 1987).  Our Thm. 1 also implies semiparametric efficiency for vanilla distillation under the more stringent condition that the teacher MSE $\\| p_0 - \\hat{p} \\|_{2,2} = o(n^{-1/2})$.\n\n[How ancillarity of $f_0$ affects applicability of semiparametric techniques] Thank you for this intriguing question. Our results do successfully adapt classical semiparametric inference techniques to the misspecified setting in which the true data generating process does not depend on $f_0$, and $f_0$ is only defined via its role as a population loss minimizer.  (See the \u201cTheory for finite-dimensional model class\u201d response above for a concrete example.)

The gamma correction is developed in four steps: (1) we view the vanilla KD loss as a zero-th order estimate of the ideal loss and formulate a potentially more accurate ideal first-order estimate; (2) we approximate the ideal first-order estimate with an unbiased approximation of the unknown $p_0$ that we call the orthogonal loss; (3) we observe that for standard distillation losses (and more generally all Bregman divergence losses), the orthogonal loss is linear in f and reweights f by a certain matrix valued function $q_{f,p}$; and (4) we recognize that $q_{f,p}$ can have large variance for our target distillation losses due to small $p_0$ probabilities appearing in the denominator, so we replace $q_{f,p}$ with a tunable matrix function $\\gamma$ that the user can choose to balance bias (when $\\gamma = 0$ we recover the zero-th order approximation of vanilla KD) and variance (which is potentially large when $\\gamma = q_{f,p}$).\n\n[\u201cInherent\u201d drawbacks and lower bounds on vanilla KD\u2019s performance] Thank you for highlighting this inappropriate language.  We agree that \u201cinherent\u201d is not quite the right way to describe the drawbacks of vanilla distillation, and we have updated the text to provide a more precise picture of vanilla distillation performance.  In addition, we have added two lower bounding examples to Sec. 3 in the revision, showing that the student\u2019s performance does indeed depend on the teacher\u2019s critical radius and approximation error.  \n\nTo demonstrate the worst-case dependence of vanilla distillation on the overfitting of the teacher to its training data, our first example instantiates a classification problem in which the following properties all hold simultaneously:\n\nThe critical radius of the teacher-student function class $\\mathcal{G}$ defined in Thm. 1 is a non-vanishing constant, due to the complexity of the teacher\u2019s function class (the teacher is a truncated interpolation rule).\nThe vanilla distillation student error is lower bounded by a non-vanishing constant $\\| \\hat{f} - f_0 \\|^2$, matching the $\\delta_n$ dependence of the Thm. 1 upper bound up to a constant factor.\nThe cross-fitted distilled student in the same example satisfies $E \\| \\hat{f}^{CF} - f_0 \\|_{2,2}^2 = O(n^{-4/(4+d)})$.\nIn this example, the vanilla distillation student does not converge to the optimal $f_0$ due to the teacher\u2019s overfitting, while the cross-fitted student will converge in MSE at a known rate.\n\nTo demonstrate the worst-case dependence of vanilla distillation on the underfitting of the teacher due to large approximation error, our second example instantiates a classification problem in which the following properties all hold simultaneously:\n\nThe vanilla distillation student error $\\| \\hat{f} - f_0 \\|^2$ is lower bounded by $\\| \\gamma_{f_0,p_0}^\\top (\\hat{p} - p_0) \\|^2$ with high probability, matching the teacher MSE dependence of the Thm. 1 upper bound up to a constant factor.\nVanilla distillation student error $\\| \\hat{f} - f_0 \\|^2$ converges at a slow $\\Omega(min(1,\\lambda^2))$ rate whenever the teacher regularization parameter $\\lambda \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{C\\log \\log(n)}{n}}$.\nBy Thm. 3 in the revision (Thm. 4 in the original submission), the gamma-corrected student in the same example satisfies $\\| \\hat{f} - f_0 \\|^2 = O(\\lambda^4 + 1/n)$ when $\\lambda \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{C\\log \\log(n)}{n}}$.\n\nWe also note that these examples describe the worst-case behavior of vanilla distillation and that in other better-case scenarios, vanilla distillation can perform better than the upper-bounding Thm. 1 would imply.\n\nFinally, we note that for the case of square losses, Section 5 of Foster and Syrgkanis, when instantiated to our setting with the square loss, provide conditions on the metric entropy of the student and teacher such that the orthogonal distillation approach (with gamma being equal to gamma_{f,p}), achieves minimax optimal oracle rates (in terms of dependence on n and the metric entropy) for the student\u2019s excess risk problem (i.e. achieves the statistically optimal rate for the loss (log(p_0(x)) - f(x))^2, even if we had been given oracle access to the function p_0). We will add a remark on such oracle rates achieved by orthogonal distillation.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2515/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2515/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Knowledge Distillation as Semiparametric Inference", "authorids": ["~Tri_Dao1", "govinda.kamath@microsoft.com", "~Vasilis_Syrgkanis1", "~Lester_Mackey1"], "authors": ["Tri Dao", "Govinda M Kamath", "Vasilis Syrgkanis", "Lester Mackey"], "keywords": ["knowledge distillation", "semiparametric inference", "generalization bounds", "model compression", "cross-fitting", "orthogonal machine learning", "loss correction"], "abstract": "A popular approach to model compression is to train an inexpensive student model to mimic the class probabilities of a highly accurate but cumbersome teacher model.

The quantity we need in Thm 1 is essentially a uniform bound only over the student\u2019s function class for any fixed function of the teacher. For instance, if the loss function is L-lipschitz for any fixed hat{p} in the teacher\u2019s function space, then by standard contraction theorems for Rademacher complexities, the critical radius of the class in Thm 1 is at most L times the critical radius of the student\u2019s class. This more clearly shows that this quantity is only a statement about the statistical size of the student model and the teacher\u2019s model enters only in a benign manner, since it is a statement for any fixed teacher and not uniformly over the teacher. In the paragraph following the theorem we provide another example in terms of VC dimension. We note that if the student and teacher function spaces have bounded VC dimension, then the quantity in Thm 4 can be upper bounded in terms of only the students VC dimension, while that in Thm 1 scales with the maximum of the VC dimensions of the student and the teacher. We will add more concrete comparison examples along these lines.\n\n[Analysis of cross-fitting alone] We will clarify that by plugging the constant choice $\\hat{\\gamma}^{(t)}(x) = 0$ into Thm. 4 of the original submission (now numbered Thm. 3 in the revision), one obtains an analysis of cross-fitting without gamma correction.  All of the gains surrounding the reduced dependence on the teacher\u2019s model class still apply (i.e., Thm. 4 shows that cross-fitting alone is sufficient to reduce student error due to teacher overfitting).  However, cross-fitting without gamma correction is still susceptible to excessive student error due to teacher underfitting (the Thm. 4 error bound scales like $\\|p_0 - \\hat{p}\\|^2$ instead of  $\\|p_0 - \\hat{p}\\|^4$).  These qualitative predictions accord with our experimental observations as well.  For example, in Fig. 5 in the revision appendix, we see large gains from gamma correction (on top of cross-fitting) on the Higgs, MAGIC, and Adult datasets when the teacher is underfitting due to a restricted or misspecified function class, while the impact of cross-fitting is dominant when the teacher is more flexible and susceptible to overfitting.  We will endeavor to make this messaging more clear in the final revision."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2515/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2515/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Knowledge Distillation as Semiparametric Inference", "authorids": ["~Tri_Dao1", "govinda.kamath@microsoft.com", "~Vasilis_Syrgkanis1", "~Lester_Mackey1"], "authors": ["Tri Dao", "Govinda M Kamath", "Vasilis Syrgkanis", "Lester Mackey"], "keywords": ["knowledge distillation", "semiparametric inference", "generalization bounds", "model compression", "cross-fitting", "orthogonal machine learning", "loss correction"], "abstract": "A popular approach to model compression is to train an inexpensive student model to mimic the class probabilities of a highly accurate but cumbersome teacher model.
