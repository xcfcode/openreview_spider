The operator H is a matrix of finite dimensions and it is not completely clear to me what is the role of the multi-layer parameterization. \n\u201cwhy is the deep network parameterization needed? Since no nonlinearities are present, isn t this equivalent to fix the rank of H?\u201d\n\nEven though composition of linear functions is still linear, using d linear layers is better than one. On a grid with n^2 vertices: one convolution layer requires O(n^2) computations and have local receptive field; one fully-connected layer requires O(n^4) computations and have global receptive field; our deep U-Net architecture has O(n^2) computations but global receptive field. Our hope is that the deep U-Net architecture learns a linear function with both good computation properties (O(n^2)) and convergence properties, which is impossible for one layer models.\n\nOur learned network H is a convolutional operator, which does not have low rank. A low rank H is unlikely to perform well because many different errors may be mapped to the same correction term, while a high rank H can correct different errors differently. Our parameterization learns a high rank H with O(n^2) computation.\n\n\n2) \u201cBased on a grid approach, the idea applies only to one- or two-dimensional problems.\u201d\n\nOur method generalizes without modification to any dimensional problems: simply replace 2-D convolution to k-D convolution.\n\n\n3) \u201cin the introduction, what does it mean that generic solvers are effective 'but could be far from optimal'?  Does this refer to the convergence speed or to the correctness of the solution?\u201d\n\nWe meant that generic solvers like Jacobi are hand-designed and theoretically correct, but may not be optimal in terms of convergence speed. Designing a solver is a trade-off between computation-per-iteration and spectral radius. We would like to have the smallest spectral radius given computation budget. We verify in our experiments: human designed solvers (e.g. Jacobi) are not Pareto optimal, and are outperformed by our learned solvers. Similar observations have also been made in other fields: learned models outperform hand designed ones, e.g. Andrychowicz et al., 2016, Song et al, 2017.\n\n\n4) \u201cother deep learning approaches to PDE solving are mentioned in the introduction. Is the proposed method compared to them somewhere in the experiments?\u201d\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, related works applying ML to PDEs directly fit the solution with deep networks, which have no correctness or generalization guarantees and are restricted to specific dimensions and geometries. Our algorithm is the first deep learning based method with provable correctness and generalization guarantees.\n\n\n5) \u201cgiven a PDE and some boundary conditions, is there any known method to choose the liner iterator T optimally? For example, since u* is the solution of a linear system, could one choose the updates to be the gradient descent updates of a least-squares objective such as || A u - f||^2?\u201d\n\nActually, this is exactly the update rule for most existing methods (conjugate gradient, Jacobi, etc). We compared with these methods (conjugate gradient, Jacobi) in experiments and outperform them. For example, if we minimize the objective 1/2 u^T A u - u^T f, given that A is symmetric, positive-definite, this objective has a unique minimizer, and the derivative is exactly Au - f. If we perform gradient descent on this objective with learning rate 1, we get exactly the Jacobi update.\n\nGradient descent may not be optimal; improving it is undergoing active research (e.g. ADAM, Adagrad, \u201cLearning to learn\u201d [1]). We tackle a special class of optimization problems and design methods with both correctness guarantees and better performance.\n\n[1] Andrychowicz, Marcin, et al. \"Learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent. NIPS, 2016.\n\n\n6) \u201cgiven the `interpretation of H' sketched in Section 3.3, is there any relationship between the proposed accelerated update and the update of second-order coordinated descent methods (like Newton or quasi-Newton)?\u201d\n\nOn a grid with k (= n^2) vertices, second order methods (e.g. Newton) have optimal convergence speed (solve linear equations with a single update), but poor computation complexity (O(k^3) to solve A inverse). Our method only require O(k) computation per-iteration, and we hope to achieve a good trade-off between convergence speed and computation budget by optimization."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1214/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1214/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1214/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Neural PDE Solvers with Convergence Guarantees", "abstract": "Partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used across the physical and computational sciences.

Most readers will be unfamiliar with this. You should explain what they do and how they are qualitatively different than your approach.\u201d\n\nWe will add more discussions in our updated paper. To the best of our knowledge, related works applying ML to PDEs directly fit the solution with deep networks, which have no correctness or generalization guarantees and are restricted to specific dimensions and geometries.\n\n\n2) \u201cYou do a good job 3.3 of motivating for what H is doing. However, you could do a better job of motivating the overall setup of (6). Is this a common formulation? If so, where else is it used?\u201d\n\nThis formulation is a novel idea that provides correctness guarantees by leveraging a hand designed solver: we modify the residual of a hand designed solver. Another idea that also modify the residual (but not of a hand designed solver) is conjugate gradient.\n\n\n3) \u201cI\u2019m surprised that you didn\u2019t impose some sort of symmetry conditions on the convolutions in H, such as that they are invariant to flips of the kernel. This is true, for example, for the linearized Poisson operator.\u201d\n\nGeneralization, for our model, is almost for free because of our linear ConvNet setup. Therefore, we didn\u2019t find strong reasons to restrict the network parameters and reduce dimensionality. Enforcing symmetry introduces unnecessary overhead.\n\n\n4) \u201cValid iterators converge to a valid solution. However, can\u2019t there be multiple candidate solutions? How would you construct a method that would be able to find all possible solutions?\u201d\n\nFor most PDEs with Dirichlet boundary conditions (e.g. Possion, Helmholtz), the solution is always unique. Thus, a valid iterator should converge to the unique solution. We currently consider PDEs that have unique solutions.\n\n\n==Minor comments==\n\n5) \u201cIn (9), why do you randomize the value of k? Wouldn\u2019t you want to learn a different H depending on what computation budget you knew you were going to use downstream when you deploy the solver?\u201d\n\nOur hope is to learn a generic solver for a type of PDE that can be applied to a variety of applications. Therefore, we train the model agnostic to downstream applications. Nonetheless practitioners who know their computation budget can certainly fine tune our iterator with a fixed k.\n\n6) \u201cIn future work it may make sense to learn a different H_i for each step i of the iterative solver.\u201d\n\nThank you for the suggestion.

This seems like a pretty important design decision. Are there alternatives that guarantee that u satisfies b always, rather than updating u in such a way that it violates G and then clamping it back? Along these lines, it might be useful to pose (2) with additional terms in the linear system to reflect G.\u201d\n\nThis is the most straightforward way to satisfy the boundary condition, and most existing iterative solvers enforce boundary conditions with this reset operation.

Along these lines, it might be useful to pose (2) with additional terms in the linear system to reflect G. \n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1214/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Neural PDE Solvers with Convergence Guarantees", "abstract": "Partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used across the physical and computational sciences.

The linear updates of the target solver, specified by the problem's geometry and boundary conditions, are computed from the updates of a well-known solver through an optimized linear map.  The obtained solver is guaranteed to converge to the correct solution and\nachieves a considerable speed-up compared to solvers obtained from alternative state-of-the-art methods.   \n\nStrengths:\nSolving PDEs is an important and hard problem and the proposed method seems to consistently outperform the state of the art. I ve liked the idea of learning a speed-up operator to improve the performance of a standard solver and adapt it to new boundary conditions or problem geometries. The approach is simple enough to allow a straightforward proof of correctness. \n\nWeaknesses:\nThe method seems to rely strongly on the linearity of the solver and its deformation (to guarantee the correctness of the solution). The operator H is a matrix of finite dimensions and it is not completely clear to me what is the role of the multi-layer parameterization. Based on a grid approach, the idea applies only to one- or two-dimensional problems. \n\nQuestions:\n- in the introduction, what does it mean that generic solvers are effective 'but could be far from optimal'?  Does this refer to the convergence speed or to the correctness of the solution? \n- other deep learning approaches to PDE solving are mentioned in the introduction. Is the proposed method compared to them somewhere in the experiments? \n- given a PDE and some boundary conditions, is there any known method to choose the liner iterator T optimally? For example, since u* is the solution of a linear system, could one choose the updates to be the gradient descent updates of a least-squares objective such as || A u - f||^2?\n- why is the deep network parameterization needed? Since no nonlinearities are present, isn t this equivalent to fix the rank of H?\n- given the `  interpretation of H' sketched in Section 3.3, is there any relationship between the proposed accelerated update and the update of second-order coordinated descent methods (like Newton or quasi-Newton)?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1214/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Neural PDE Solvers with Convergence Guarantees", "abstract": "Partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used across the physical and computational sciences.

We were not aware of it and we will certainly add a reference. Deep Multigrid has some surface resemblance to our method, but there are major differences:\n\n(1) Generalization: Deep Multigrid does not generalize to different grid size or different geometries. The learned prolongation and restriction operators are fully-connected layers, which need retraining for each grid size and geometry. Our model generalizes (both by design and in experiments) to very different grid sizes and geometries after training on a single example (Figure 1).\n\n(2) Usability: Deep Multigrid only experimented on 1D grids, with no proposed generalization to 2D or 3D geometries. \nOn 1D grid, the matrix A is tridiagonal, and Au = f can be solved exactly by Gaussian elimination in O(n) time [1]. Contrastly, our method applies without modification to any dimension (by using d-dimensional convolution).\n\n(3) Flexibility: Deep Multigrid only learns prolongation and restriction operators. Our U-Net model is end-to-end: it implicitly includes smoothing, prolongation, and restriction. Our approach is simpler yet more general.\n\n(4) Experiments: Deep multigrid does not compare runtime with state-of-the-art solvers. Our method is faster (wall-clock time and number of operations) than both Jacobi Multigrid and FEniCS.\n\n\n[1] Randall J LeVeque.
