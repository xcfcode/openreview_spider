HRNs work on top of hierarchical particle-based representations of objects and the corresponding physics (e.g. forces between different parts), and are essentially are graph-convolutional neural networks.\nUnlike the original work, the proposed method introduces several improvements: 1. an updated loss function, that adds distance constraints between *all* the particles of the object. 2. recurrent training, when the predictions are fed to the inputs. 3. adding dropout.  \n\nWriting:\nThe paper is relatively well-written and easy to follow.\n\nEvaluation:\nAuthors compare their model on a dynamics prediction task and seem to outperform the original HRN, especially on longer-term sequences. In addition they report results for trajectory sampling (qualitative) and model-free RL, where using their model as a stochastic simulator seems to have positive impact on agent training.\n\nDecision:\nAlthough the proposed improvements upon HRN generally make sense, it is not clear if those are very significant on their own: adding dropout and recurrent training do not seem particularly novel and, since there is no ablation study, it is hard to see what exactly contributes to the reported improvements. \nAs for the experimental evaluation, it seems like important baselines are missing, and the model seems to be very sensitive to hyperparameters (see questions). Thus, I am currently leaning more towards a rejection, hence the \u201cweak reject\u201d rating.\n\nVarious questions / concerns:\n\n* It is not clear why authors do not provide a comparison to DPI-Nets (Li ICLR\u201819). This model seems to be outperforming HRN, and from what it looks like is publicly available: https://github.com/YunzhuLi/DPI-Net. I would encourage authors to provide comparison to this baseline, and potentially on similar sets of experiments, or explain why this comparison would not be possible (which seems unlikely).\n\n* Authors seem to acknowledge that the model is sensitive to the hyperparameter choice (dropout rates), however, there is no numerical evaluation that would help readers understand how critical this choice is for the final performance. Judging from very specific settings in different experiments, this could be a serious concern.\n\n* I find it a bit strange that results in Fig. 7-8 are for random seeds. Is it not possible to just plot an average for e.g. 10 runs?\n\nUpdate:\nI would like to thank the authors for a detailed response!\nIt seems like there is a common concern about the novelty among reviewers: improvements over HRN are quite incremental. Although authors provide a verbal justification for not comparing to another strong baselines, I do not see why would it not be possible to compare methods in the similar settings, even though that baseline might be more limited.\nGenerally, if the main contribution is actually only the \"stochastic\" part and not improved performance, then just adding dropout does not seem like a particularly novel approach to me: whether the convolutions are on graphs or on euclidean domains, this does not change the way dropout is done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2430/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2430/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["piotr.tatarczyk@tum.de", "mrowca@stanford.edu", "feifeili@cs.stanford.edu", "yamins@stanford.edu", "nils.thuerey@tum.de"], "title": "Stochastic Neural Physics Predictor", "authors": ["Piotr Tatarczyk", "Damian Mrowca", "Li Fei-Fei", "Daniel L.

Our work was well received, addressing the very relevant and interesting problem of plausible multi-modal outcomes of intuitive physics scenarios (R1-3) with graph convolutions dropout as a \u201cvery good contribution\u201d (R1) and recurrent training and shape preservation as contributions to stabilize long-term predictions (R1-3). The results look good and valuable (R3), outperforming baselines especially on long-term predictions (R2). The final fully trained stochastic simulator has a positive impact on the training of model-free RL agents for physical manipulation tasks (R1-2). The paper is well written and easy to follow (R1) with weaknesses in the description of the system (R3) which will be addressed in the revised version by incorporating improvements in figures and text suggested by the reviewers. We have also added further experiments and attached high resolution videos in individual responses to address specific concerns of the reviewers about e.g. figure quality (R3), complexity of the experiments and overall performance of our physics predictor (R1, R3).\n\nAll in all, we hope that this illustrates that our contributions are far beyond incremental (R1, R2). Rather, they are a significant step towards fully learned, flexible intuitive physics models that are able to forward simulate complex multi-model physical systems with multiple possible outcomes. Using dropout on graph convolutions to generate multiple plausible trajectories is a simple yet elegant solution and has to our knowledge not been done before. The combination of improved shape loss and recurrent training greatly stabilizes long term predictions to be on par or better than methods which require specialized constraints and access to ground truth shapes. This in turn leads to greater flexibility across materials and different scenarios.

This model seems to be outperforming HRN...\u201d\n\nWe have considered this architecture, and there are several reasons why we found the comparison to DPI-Nets not crucial for our work. To begin with, it is questionable if the DPI-Nets model clearly outperforms the HRN. HRN aims at solving a more difficult and general problem. As HRN works across different materials without special material constraints, we choose to work with the HRN instead of DPI net in our work. In rigid body simulations, DPI-Nets assumes rigidity of objects and predicts only rotation and translation, which is a different and much easier task. For rigid bodies this requires access to the undeformed ground truth shape over the whole prediction sequence. This contrasts with HRN, which fully learns the dynamics of each material without specialized constraints and does not require the ground truth shape to be provided at every prediction step. Our proposed model can predict correct dynamics and shapes in complex scenes without these constraints on par with DPI-Nets. A specific example is our scene involving three different, interacting objects, where all three are made from different materials: rigid, deformable and cloth. We also would like to point out that our experiments are at least on par with the complexity of the rigid fluid experiments used by Li et al.. Unnatural deformations for rigid and elastic soft bodies and cloth are much more salient to the human observer than wrong predictions of single fluid particles. We encourage reviewers to consider the following video, where we present our results of the simulations from the paper as well as additional more complex scenarios, which will be added to our manuscript: https://www.dropbox.com/s/59dalr767rlqhwm/Stochastic_Neural_Physics_Predictor_Experiments.mp4?dl=0\n\nFurthermore, the main focus of our work is finding ways of introducing stochasticity for simulating physical dynamics that reliably produce visually plausible results. The work of Li et al. did not explore this area, which makes the two works orthogonal in this regard. Nonetheless, DPI-Nets can potentially also benefit from our findings, both in terms of modelling stochasticity and improving prediction quality.\n\n\u201cAuthors seem to acknowledge that the model is sensitive to the hyperparameter choice (dropout rates)...\u201d\n\nWe included qualitative example rollouts for several different dropout rates in the Appendix. It is hard to find a good quantitative metric that captures the quality of rollouts as well as actual examples. Smaller perturbations might capture the mean better, but capture fewer possible modalities than larger perturbations, and the types and magnitude of perturbations might not transfer across different situations. Compared to input force and position perturbations, our dropout method significantly simplifies this problem to one parameter. For example with conventional perturbation methods, if we would like to perturb the simulation for colliding rigid cubes, it is not possibly to simply perturb each single particle. Instead, we need to rotate and translate the particles in accordance with the entire shape of the object such that it doesn\u2019t deform unnaturally. For a soft object it would be even harder to hard-code plausibly looking perturbations. With our dropout method we only have to adjust one parameter to control how widely sampled trajectories are spread which is a huge simplification over previous methods. We find an even more constrained set of values between 0.7 and 0.9 to work across a wide range of scenarios. The attached video further illustrates the problem of hard coded input perturbations and the advantage of learned dropout perturbations which flexibly and automatically adapt to different scenarios:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/59dalr767rlqhwm/Stochastic_Neural_Physics_Predictor_Experiments.mp4?dl=0 (at 0:48) \n\n\u201cI find it a bit strange that results in Fig. 7-8 are for random seeds. Is it not possible to just plot an average for e.g. 10 runs? \u201c\n\nThere is a clear intent behind plotting the curves separately. The training process in model-free RL is in most cases very sensitive not only to hyperparameters, but also the random seed. Our goal was to clearly show that agents learning in stochastic physical environments learn faster and converge to better policies than our baselines independent of the chosen random seed. Henderson et al. [1] showed that the variance between runs with different random seeds is sufficient to drastically change the resulting distributions hiding the true performance of RL algorithms. Hence, plotting the mean over multiple runs can be misleading. \n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.06560.pdf"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2430/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2430/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["piotr.tatarczyk@tum.de", "mrowca@stanford.edu", "feifeili@cs.stanford.edu", "yamins@stanford.edu", "nils.thuerey@tum.de"], "title": "Stochastic Neural Physics Predictor", "authors": ["Piotr Tatarczyk", "Damian Mrowca", "Li Fei-Fei", "Daniel L.

We are glad that it has been mentioned as a \u201cvery good contribution\u201d by the reviewer. We agree that dropout itself is not a novel method. However, a naive implementation in graph convolutional networks has a negative impact on predictions. In our work, we proposed a novel and effective implementation in graph convolutional networks that does not lower system performance. In our experiments, it does not cause object shape degradation that is present when dropout is applied in a conventional way, as we discuss in Section 3.2. \n\nThe training process in reinforcement learning (RL) is sensitive to hyper parameters, often also to a random seed. Overparameterized systems are difficult to work with, due to e.g. computationally expensive hyperparameter searches, which is a reason why our proposed easy-to-use method for improving the training in model-free RL has the potential to be adopted on a wider scale. Our method can also be seen as a reward relaxation method. Due to its high effectiveness for a very common problem in RL, this contribution should not be underrated. Our proposed training method significantly outperforms other perturbation methods, e.g., commonly used action space noise, offering a promising future direction for RL community. \n\n\u201cThere should be a discussion on the different type of methods to account for uncertainties...\u201d\n\nAs mentioned in Section 2, we explored Mean-Variance-Estimation method [1] for predicting plausible object trajectories. At test time, sampling from independent per-particle normal distributions failed due to a lack of space-time consistency between object particles that are present in real objects. We will make this point clearer and underline that such an experiment has been conducted. We also evaluated this method as an uncertainty estimator, which gave reasonable results e.g indicating relatively high prediction uncertainty during collisions and force applications. We are happy to provide the results, although we decided to not include them in our original submission. As proposed by [2] Monte Carlo Dropout can be seen as a Bayesian approximation for inference. With this definition, it falls under the category of Bayesian Neural Networks. Furthermore, Bayesian neural networks are part of a group of algorithms that exhibit limited scalability, and as such are not applicable to large systems like ours. This is one of the motivations for our implementation via Monte Carlo dropout as a viable solution.\n\n\u201cBecause the tasks are not very complicated, it is not clear how good the whole neural physics predictor is.\u201d\n\nRegarding concerns about experiments not being complicated enough, we would like to argue that \nour selected scenarios include several highly complex geometries, physical effects (collisions, object deformations) and materials (rigid, deformable/soft, cloth). Most recent papers in the intuitive physics domain still deal with simple 2D scenarios [3]. However, to show that our model works on a greater set of scenarios, we will include more examples in the revised version and we are happy to include more scenarios on acceptance which we could not include because of rebuttal time constraints.\n\nAs a response, we conducted more highly complex experiments in an extended set of scenarios, including new geometries and materials. We strongly encourage to watch the following video with visualizations of our results: \nScenario 1: In \u201cMultiple Materials\u201d, three distinct geometries, each made of different materials (soft body, rigid body, cloth) interact in one scene. They are lifted, drop on the floor and collide with each other. In a stochastic simulation, the shapes are preserved well, positions are well distributed with respect to the ground truth and the trajectories are visually plausible. \nScenario 2:  In \u201cBall hitting tower\u201d (at 1:05 of the video), we compare our stochastic simulation method to simple input perturbation, but the performance of the physics predictor in a forward simulation can be assessed. This task includes a stack of 3 cubes, which are hit by a ball. Stack is a challenging case of a very frequent collision, which our model predicts well.\n\nScenarios 1 and 2: https://www.dropbox.com/s/59dalr767rlqhwm/Stochastic_Neural_Physics_Predictor_Experiments.mp4?dl=0 \n\nScenario 3: We simulated the toy experiment presented in Figure 1. A ball falls on top of a pyramid.\nThis experiment shows a clear advantage of a stochastic physics engine over deterministic ones. \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/btpkvgtf84zea8l/Stochastic%20Neural%20Physics%20Predictor%20Experiment%202.mp4?dl=0\n\n[1] https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/374138\n[2] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02142.pdf\n[3] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03177.pdf"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2430/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2430/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["piotr.tatarczyk@tum.de", "mrowca@stanford.edu", "feifeili@cs.stanford.edu", "yamins@stanford.edu", "nils.thuerey@tum.de"], "title": "Stochastic Neural Physics Predictor", "authors": ["Piotr Tatarczyk", "Damian Mrowca", "Li Fei-Fei", "Daniel L.

The question is relevant and interesting.\n\nThe authors bring in two improvements to the HRN model by (Mrowca et al., 2018). They drop the hierarchy from the shape loss, which is decipeted in Figure 3, and provide a change in the recurrent training decipited in Figure 4.  Figure 4 is only showing the modified training, not the initial HRN training, although Figure 3 contains both. For the sake of consitency and good read the Figure 4 should contain the original training image.\n\nThe description of the system is very verbose, but a concrete description of the system is only in the references, which make the manuscript hard to read and it does not fit well in a conference where one cannot assume that the audience is not an expert of this particular subfield.\n\nAs a remedy, I would suggest, a simple one-hieararcy level architecture with hyperparameters to show what is really happening. One could use the system in Figure 1 as a more thorough example.\n\nThe results looks good and valuable, altough the images provided are quite small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2430/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2430/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["piotr.tatarczyk@tum.de", "mrowca@stanford.edu", "feifeili@cs.stanford.edu", "yamins@stanford.edu", "nils.thuerey@tum.de"], "title": "Stochastic Neural Physics Predictor", "authors": ["Piotr Tatarczyk", "Damian Mrowca", "Li Fei-Fei", "Daniel L.

While near-term motion can be predicted accurately, long-term predictions suffer from accumulating input and prediction errors which can lead to plausible but different trajectories that diverge from the ground truth.  A system that predicts distributions of the future physical states for long time horizons based on its uncertainty is thus a promising solution.  In this work, we introduce a novel robust Monte Carlo sampling based graph-convolutional dropout method that allows us to sample multiple plausible trajectories for an initial state given a neural-network based forward dynamics predictor.  By introducing a new shape preservation loss and training our dynamics model recurrently, we stabilize long-term predictions. We show that our model\u2019s long-term forward dynamics prediction errors on complicated physical interactions of rigid and deformable objects of various shapes are significantly lower than existing strong baselines. Lastly, we demonstrate how generating multiple trajectories with our Monte Carlo dropout method can be used to train model-free reinforcement learning agents faster and to better solutions on simple manipulation tasks.", "keywords": ["physics prediction", "forward dynamics", "stochastic environments", "dropout"], "paperhash": "tatarczyk|stochastic_neural_physics_predictor", "original_pdf": "/attachment/ee0c134742d10ef44107c1ebef11c9fb03790186.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\ntatarczyk2020stochastic,\ntitle={Stochastic Neural Physics Predictor},\nauthor={Piotr Tatarczyk and Damian Mrowca and Li Fei-Fei and Daniel L.
