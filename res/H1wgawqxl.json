However, I think the view of learning non-linearities is more intuitive. It also is a view others have taken (such as Agostinelli, et al (2014)) and so by treating what we are doing as learning activation functions for a particular node, we can more easily compare to other approaches.\n\nThis sort of equivalence also arises in the case of convolution nets. We could of course view the convolution layers as a standard feedforward neural network with more nodes and some constraints on the weight matrices, but the view that we learn a stack of filters in each convolution layer more accurately captures the intuition behind why convolution nets are a good idea and what actually happens after fitting the model.\n\nTo answer the second question, I do not think that the gains are purely from increasing the capacity. If we increased capacity and fixed a single non-linearity for the entire network, I do not think the results would be as good. But, this is something we could check to provide evidence that the gains are not purely due to increased capacity.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Nonparametrically Learning Activation Functions in Deep Neural Nets", "abstract": "We provide a principled framework for nonparametrically learning activation functions in deep neural networks.

This is achieved by representing the activation function in a basis of non-linear functions and learning the coefficients.  Authors use Fourier basis in the paper.  A theoretical analysis of the proposed approach is also presented, using algorithmic stability arguments, to demonstrate good generalization behavior (vanishing generalization error with large data sets) of networks with learnt non-linearities.\n\nThe main question I have about this paper is that writing a non-linear activation function as a linear or affine combination of other non-linear basis functions is equivalent to making a larger network whose nodes have the basis functions as non-linearities and whose weights have certain constraints on them.  Thus, the value of the proposed approach of learning non-linearities over optimizing network capacity for a given task (with fixed non-linearities) is not clear to me.  Or could it be argued that the constrained implied by learnt non-linearity approach are somehow good thing to do?\n\nAnother question - In the two stage training process for CNNs, when ReLU activation is replaced by NPFC(L,T), is the NPFC(L,T) activation initialized to approximate ReLU, or is it initialized using random coefficients?\n\nFew minor corrections/questions:\n- Pg 2. \u201c \u2026 the interval [-L+T, L+T] \u2026\u201d should be \u201c \u2026 the interval [-L+T, L-T] \u2026 \u201c ?\n- Pg 2., Equation for f(x), should it be \u201c (-L+T) i \\pi x / L \u201c in both sin and cos terms, or without \u201c x \u201c ?\n- Theorem 4.2 \u201c \u2026 some algorithm \\eps-uniformly stable \u2026\u201d remove the word \u201calgorithm\u201d\n- Theorem 4.5.

To respond:\n\n- We did look at training with tanh activation functions in the first stage. The results we got were very similar to when we used ReLU activations in the stage I/pre-training stage. Because performing the stage I training with ReLus requires fewer weight updates, we chose to use that version in the paper. We can add a comment regarding this, because using the tanh function does seem to be the intuitive choice.\n\n- That sounds like a good idea and it could provide some insight into the effects of learning nonparametric activation functions. We will add such a plot in the next revision. Thank you for the suggestion.\n\n- This sounds like an interesting suggestion as well.
