Much of the paper is devoted to reviewing this follow-up work. I think it's clearly time for this to be made part of the published literature, so I recommend acceptance. (And all reviewers are in agreement that the paper ought to be accepted.)\n\nThe paper proposes, in the context of Adam, to apply literal weight decay in place of L2 regularization. An impressively thorough set of experiments are given to demonstrate the improved generalization performance, as well as a decoupling of the hyperparameters. \n\nPrevious versions of the paper suffered from a lack of theoretical justification for the proposed method. Ordinarily, in such cases, one would worry that the improved results could be due to some sort of experimental confound. But AdamW has been validated by so many other groups on a range of domains that the improvement is well established.

It is true that this means that *in the original SGD* \\alpha and \\lambda are coupled. In contrast, SGDW does not have \\lambda in Line 6 but has it in Line 9, where \\lambda and \\alpha are decoupled. Please note that Algorithm 1 uses two different colors to define specifics of SGD and SGDW when regularization is applied. We hypothesize that this confusion might have been caused by a black&white printout (in which the original colors were not easy to tell apart) and to avoid this confusion in the future we changed the colors to also be clearly distinguishable when printed in black&white. \n\n\nThanks again for your review!

In my experience, most practitioners would not be surprised by this observation itself. The second observation made by the authors, that L2 regularization is not effective in Adam, is the more interesting (and perhaps surprising) observation.\u201d \n\nIn our experience, practitioners often have the equivalence result for SGD in mind and other cases such as Adam tend to remain unnoticed until they actively think about them. In reply to your comment, we\u2019ve toned down the wording from \n\n\u201cContrary to a belief which seems popular among some practitioners, the two techniques are not equivalent. For SGD, they can be made equivalent by a reparameterization of the weight decay factor based on the learning rate; this is not the case for Adam.\u201d\n\nto\n\n\u201cThe two techniques can be made equivalent for SGD by a reparameterization of the weight decay factor based on the learning rate; however, as is often overlooked, this is not the case for Adam.\u201d \n\n                                                                                       ***\n\n\u201c2) I am not convinced of the importance of Proposition 3. In practice, adaptive methods will have a preconditioner which depends locally on the parameters. I understand the motivation from the previous paragraph but felt that the formal result added little.\u201d\n\nWe agree that the relevance of Proposition 3 does not derive from its immediate applicability to practical adaptive gradient algorithms. Nevertheless, we still believe the proposition to be useful since (for this simple special case of a fixed preconditioner) it provides a precise equivalence between decoupled weight decay and standard L2 regularization with a scaled regularizer and thus provides an intuitive explanation for what decoupled weight decay does: parameters with a small preconditioner (which in practice would be caused by typically large gradients in this dimension) are regularized relatively more than they would be with L2 regularization; specifically, the regularization is proportional to the inverse of the root of the preconditioner. \nFor adaptive gradient algorithms with changing preconditioner matrices (which includes all popular cases) there is no 1-to-1 equivalence to a fixed L2 regularization, but we can still use the intuition from the proposition to think about what loss function is being optimized in each step.\n\n                                                                                       ***\n\n\"However, the last paragraph of Section 3 seems to utilize the Bernstein-von Mises theorem to promote the idea that with large datasets the prior distribution is unimportant (and is ignored). I am not sure that I follow this argument. For example, this claim seems to be completely independent of the optimization algorithm used and moreover Propositions 1,2, and 3 are independent of the data distribution. I suspect that this confusion is due to a misunderstanding on my part and would appreciate clarification from the authors.\"\n\nThank you for this comment! After a closer analysis of the argument by Aitchison described in the last paragraph of Section 3, we are also less convinced about it: due to the equivalence of L2 regularization and weight decay in SGD settings (our Proposition 1), one should not expect them to scale differently with the dataset size, as the argument would suggest. In order to avoid possible confusion, we decided to remove that paragraph entirely. Thank you for raising concerns about it. \n\n                                                                                       ***\n\n\u201cI find the notation in the paper confusing in general. x is used to denote weights, and w to denote hyperparameters (e.g. w' for L2 regularization scale and w for weight decay scale). I don't see why it wouldn't be preferable to use the more standard W for weights, x for inputs, and lambda for hparams\u201d\n\nThanks, this is a good point.

One of the main advantages of Adam is the speed of convergence. Does AdamW or AdamWR converge faster than the corresponding SGD method?

The results show that Adam and its variants with decoupled weight decay converge faster (in terms of training loss) on CIFAR-10 than the corresponding SGD variants (the difference for ImageNet32x32 is small). As is discussed in the main paper, when the same values of training loss are considered, AdamW demonstrates better values of test error than Adam. Interestingly, SuppFigure 5 and SuppFigure 6 show that restart variants AdamWR and SGDWR also demonstrate better generalization than AdamW and SGDW, respectively. \u201d\n\nWhile in the paper we noted that restarts help to obtain better anytime performance, we didn\u2019t pay attention to the fact that they also show better test errors for the same levels of training errors; this observation was made while answering this question, thank you.\n\n                                                                                       ***\n\n\u201c2.

The largest part of the difference between SGD and Adam was linked to weight decay and L2 regularization, but we believe that this is not the case anymore for SGDW and AdamW. We tend to believe that the issues often cited for \u201cadaptive methods may converge to sharp local optima\u201d are present and we hope that our findings on weight decay regularization will complement new methods which attempt to address these issues. \n\n                                                                                       ***\n\n\u201cI would also recommend to change scale of y-axis, Figure 4, right.

As the authors write, this work has already been impactful and motivated a great deal of further research. The empirical evaluation is convincing and the results have been reproduced and further studied by others. A moderate amount of space in the paper (Section 3, Section 4.5) is used to refer to work motivated by the paper itself. While I do not take issue with this I believe it should be considered for the final decision (in the sense that disentangling the contributions of the authors and related work becomes tricky). With this said, I continue with my review.\n\nPaper summary: The authors observe that L2 regularization is not effective when using the Adam optimizer. By replacing L2 regularization with decoupled weight decay the authors are able to close the generalization gap between SGD and Adam and make Adam more robust to hyperparameter settings. The empirical evaluation is comprehensive and convincing.\n\nDetailed comments:\n\n1) The authors emphasize the fact that L2 regularization and weight decay are not the same for different optimizers and claim that this goes against the belief of some practitioners. In my experience, most practitioners would not be surprised by this observation itself. The second observation made by the authors, that L2 regularization is not effective in Adam, is the more interesting (and perhaps surprising) observation.\n\n2) I am not convinced of the importance of Proposition 3. In practice, adaptive methods will have a preconditioner which depends locally on the parameters. I understand the motivation from the previous paragraph but felt that the formal result added little.\n\n3) Section 3 introduced the Bayesian filtering perspective of stochastic optimization. The authors share the observation of Aitchison, 2018 that decoupled weight decay can be recovered in this framework. My interpretation is that this observation is important _because_ of the empirical observations in this paper and does not necessarily provide theoretical support for the approach. However, the last paragraph of Section 3 seems to utilize the Bernstein-von Mises theorem to promote the idea that with large datasets the prior distribution is unimportant (and is ignored). I am not sure that I follow this argument. For example, this claim seems to be completely independent of the optimization algorithm used and moreover Propositions 1,2, and 3 are independent of the data distribution. I suspect that this confusion is due to a misunderstanding on my part and would appreciate clarification from the authors.\n\n4) The empirical evaluation in this paper is very strong and these practical techniques have already been adopted by the community in addition to spurring novel research. The empirical observation broadly explores two directions: decoupled weight decay leads to separable hyperparameter search spaces (meaning optimization is less sensitive to hyperparameters), and decoupled weight decay gives improved generalization (and training performance). Both claims are explored throughly with strong evidence given for the improvement due to AdamW.\n\nOverall, I find this paper to be presented well and with convincing empirical results. I feel that the theoretical justification for decoupling weight decay are a little weak, and believe that other work is moving towards better explanations then the ones presented in this paper [1,2,3]. Despite this, I believe that this paper should be accepted.\n\n\nMinor comments:\n\n- I find the notation in the paper confusing in general. x is used to denote weights, and w to denote hyperparameters (e.g. w' for L2 regularization scale and w for weight decay scale). I don't see why it wouldn't be preferable to use the more standard W for weights, x for inputs, and lambda for hparams.\n- Figure 4: it is difficult to distinguish between Adam and SGDWR (especially left).\n\n\n\nClarity: The paper is well written and clear. I find the notation confusing in places, but is consistent throughout.\n\nOriginality: This paper presents original findings but occasionally relies on work motivated by itself to convince the reader of its importance. I do not think that this subtracts from the value of the work.\n\nSignificance: The work is clearly significant. Even without knowing that practitioners have adopted the techniques presented in this work, the paper clearly distinguishes itself with strong empirical results.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper939/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Decoupled Weight Decay Regularization", "abstract": "L$_2$ regularization and weight decay regularization are equivalent for standard stochastic gradient descent (when rescaled by the learning rate), but as we demonstrate this is \\emph{not} the case for adaptive gradient algorithms, such as Adam.

The authors also cited a recent work to provide a justification of their proposed update rules from the perspective of Bayesian filtering. To demonstrate the effectiveness of both methods, experiments on CIFAR10 and ImageNet32x32 are conducted to compare with the original methods. Results show that the proposed methods consistently lead to faster convergence. Overall the paper is well written and easy to follow, with enough details describing the experimental settings. \n\nFirst of all I appreciate the authors pointing out that weight decay is not equal to L2 regularization in general. This is evident once the original definition of weight decay is given. The main motivation comes from the argument that instead of using L2 regularization, weight decay should be used in adaptive gradient methods. The Bayesian filtering interpretation helps to justify the proposed method. But it is not clear to me why the hyperparameters w and \\alpha are decoupled in the proposed methods? For example, in Line 6 of Alg. 1, g_t is a function of w, and later in Line 8, g_t is coupled with \\alpha which naturally introduces a term w \\alpha into m_t. So both w and \\alpha are still coupled together in the proposed algorithm. If this is the case why the authors still call w and \\alpha decoupled? \n\nTo me the most interesting result is Proposition 3 where the authors show that weight decay actually corresponds to preconditioned L2 regularization. This helps to explain what's the algorithmic difference between these two methods in adaptive gradient methods, and provides an intuitive insight on why weight decay may lead to better results compared with the vanilla L2 regularization. \n\nExperiments on image recognition tasks basically confirm the authors' claims. However, as the authors have already pointed out, it is better to have more thorough experiments on other kinds of tasks, e.g., in text classification, etc. If the improvement does come from the difference between weight decay vs L2, then I would also expect the same improvement on other tasks. It would be great to see more experimental results on other tasks to have a better understanding of this problem. So far it is not clear whether the same improvement holds in general or not. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper939/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Decoupled Weight Decay Regularization", "abstract": "L$_2$ regularization and weight decay regularization are equivalent for standard stochastic gradient descent (when rescaled by the learning rate), but as we demonstrate this is \\emph{not} the case for adaptive gradient algorithms, such as Adam.
