It is also very disrespectful towards all the other authors and reviewers that the rules of the game are completely ignored for this particular paper. \n\n- The main argument of the AC is that he/she \"knows\" much better than all the reviewers how good this paper is. We all know \n that these reviews are biased, but ignoring 3 reviews for another one it not gonna make things better. All the official reviewers said \"reject\", but then the AC God came and saved the day, of course, ignoring all the reviewers work.  My question is: why didn't the AC review all the other papers himself, why does he/she need reviewers when it is now clear that the AC is the only person to correctly evaluate the quality of a paper?  \n\n- Even if, hypothetically speaking, the AC would hold the absolute truth, this decision is very unfair and disrespectful towards the other submitted papers which were judged based on the 3 reviews, thus subject to the randomness and bias inherent in this process. \n\n- Anonymity break: the github account linked in the abstract could have been easily used to detect the first author's name. This is clearly against the rules and this paper should have been rejected only because of this reason, in the first place.\n\n- Authors outright bullying reviewers: yeah, they have someone to protect them, why care more ?\n\nThe ICLR representatives continue up to date to refuse making justice in this case. Moreover, on twitter, they concluded that \"we do hope that it is not seen as representative of the 1600 other (mostly) productive conversations that happened concurrently.\" .

I think it is necessary now to step back and look at the technical content of the paper so that we can \"stay professional and friendly\". Appeals to the AC's authority and his intuition about the possible impact of the paper might be a valid way of defending the paper, however, since not all of us \"have worked and thought about this field for over a decade\", it might be hard for some of us to follow the AC's argument. While the AC is completely within his right to accept the paper, my argument is simply that it should be made transparent how the specific technical contribution of the paper affected this decision. \n\nIt is understandable that the meta-reviewer doesn't have time to review the paper and has to base the decision on the reviews and the authors comments. If the decision was based on a personal review by the AC, I believe such review (with a summary of technical part and experiments) should be posted so that the decision becomes transparent. It the next part of my comment, I will assume that the decision was instead based on the discussion here, and address AC's comments about this discussion.\n\n--------\u2013\u2013------------------------\u2013\u2013------------------------\u2013\u2013------------------------\u2013\u2013------------------------\u2013\u2013----------------------\n\nThe AC comments that \"Detailed equations were discussed and improved our understanding of the paper.\" While it's true that \"equations\" were discussed between Rev1 and the authors,  I do not believe our understanding of the paper was improved.\n\nThe only publicly visible discussion happened after the acceptance decision. The authors did not elect to address technical concerns of the reviewers before the AC decision, therefore the discussion the AC mentions could not affect the AC's decision. The AC claims that \"Nobody was ignored\", however, the reviewer comments were ignored by the authors (as far as I can tell from the public part of the discussion). \n\nThere was indeed a discussion between Rev1 and authors after the acceptance decision. if you follow the discussion, you will find out that in none of the comments Rev1 agrees with the authors, or the authors agree with any point raised by Rev1. The authors failed to defend their point, and withdrew from the discussion (the last comment is by Rev1). I, therefore, cannot follow the argument of AC that \"Detailed equations were discussed and improved our understanding of the paper.\"\n\nThe AC is under the impression that \"All related work has been or will be added to a later paper version so having missed it in prior submission is now irrelevant. That's what this process is for.\nIf the authors still did not cite relevant work it would be bad.\" Unfortunately, we have to accept that what is happening is, in fact, \"bad\". If you follow the discussion, the authors refuse to cite the recent relevant papers, instead stating that they will cite Venn, 1880 and Whitehead, 1929.  They add that \"If space available, we consider add one of the two references you mentions which appear in 2015 and 2017\", however, the submitted manuscript has not been revised once since submission.\n\nThe AC might reasonably state that the fact that the consensus was not reached does not imply rejection of the paper. However, the ICLR AC guidelines state that \"A key part of your role during the review period is to actively facilitate discussion among reviewers, with the aim of clarifying aspects of the papers\u2019 claims, and other questions that have been raised, in fair and respectful ways.\" It seems to me that it would be appropriate for the AC to moderate the discussion between Rev1 and the authors so that the truth can be found. If the AC chooses not to do so, the guidelines still instruct them to \" Discuss any major points of contention. As raised by the authors or reviewers in the discussion, and how these might have influenced the decision.\" None of the AC's comments address or state what the reviewers concerns are and why they have been downweighted in the acceptance decision. I hope that AC chooses to engage in technical discussion (possibly with Rev1 or even the authors) to clarify this.\n\n", "title": "Lack of technical discussion by AC"}, "signatures": ["(anonymous)"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["(anonymous)", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Imposing Category Trees Onto Word-Embeddings Using A Geometric Construction", "abstract": "We present a novel method to precisely impose tree-structured category information onto word-embeddings, resulting in ball embeddings in higher dimensional spaces (N-balls for short).

Looking at the AC's comments I can't really gain an intuition as to why the paper was accepted, none of the reviewers concerns are addressed, no discussion attempt was made with the reviewers in the portal. How does this reflect reviews are important ? \n\nFurthermore sharing links containing the authors name is in clear violation of the anonymity rule. Interacting with the GitHub repository is definitely something natural to do for the author, have a quick check of how reproducible the work is, maybe how much work was put into making it reproducible. Some conferences like ICML encourage this heavily. Thus the statement made by the AC :\n\n\"Searching for a title of a paper on Google is much easier than clicking through github repos and the reverse name github thing is only obvious in retrospect. So it's not relevant in my opinion.\"\n\nIs heavily overlooking the conferences rules.  Why does everyone else have to make a proper effort in doing this ? and yet we have an exception for this paper.\n\n\"Anonymity. ICLR is double-blind, which means that authors are not aware of reviewer identities and reviewers are not aware of author identities. If you believe a paper contains an anonymity violation, contact your AC immediately. Anonymity violations are not considered as part of reviewing criteria, they are requirements for submission. Unless your AC decides that the paper does indeed violate anonymity, proceed to review it as normal. Do not reveal your or the authors\u2019 identities in the discussion.\"\n\nFurthermore:\n\n\"Arxiv and prior work. ICLR considers unpublished arxiv papers to be prior work. While we encourage reviewers to apply the reasonable standards of the relevant community in considering what does and does constitute prior work, the following minimum standards will be enforced: no paper will be considered prior work if it appeared on arxiv, or another online venue, less than 30 days prior to the ICLR deadline.\"\n\n The latter exception with Arxiv and non proceedings does not override the former rule regarding anonymous submissions. Furthermore the rule itself has timing constraints, uploading linked prior work to arXiv or GitHub the day before the deadline would be in violation of this rule.\n", "title": "Reviews are important ?"}, "signatures": ["(anonymous)"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["(anonymous)", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Imposing Category Trees Onto Word-Embeddings Using A Geometric Construction", "abstract": "We present a novel method to precisely impose tree-structured category information onto word-embeddings, resulting in ball embeddings in higher dimensional spaces (N-balls for short).

And inserting margin (\\delta) in the proper way in the constraints does not change that.  \n\nWhen they insert margins around balls, for a y_1=> y_2 implication rule , it is enforced that whenever a point is not only inside the inner ball but even margin away from the boundary of it (but outside),  it has to be not only inside the boundary of the outer ball, but also margin away from the boundary (but inside).  Enforcing such constraint guarantees y_1 implies y_2.  This is to provide separation between the balls and facilitate margin based models.\n\nThis lengthy discussion seems more like a distraction from the main point and out of place here.

This submission contains Github and Google Drive links to author-related accounts (see e.g. the abstract). I do not think this is permitted or standard. I leave the decision regarding \"automatic rejection\" of the submission to meta-reviewers of the paper.\n------------------------------------------------\nThe paper presents a method for tweaking existing vector embeddings of categorical objects (such as words), to convert them to ball embeddings that follow hierarchies. Each category is represented as a Eucldiean norm ball in high dimensional space, with center and radii adaptable to data. Next, inclusion and exclusion constraints on each pair of  balls are imposed based on the hierarchical structure. These constraints are imposed via an algorithmic approach.  The empirical study includes investigating the consistency of the representation with the hierarchy and demonstrating nearest neighbors for a set of words.\n\nOn the positive side, the paper addresses an important problem. It is readable and well organized. The related work could be improved by adding a number of representative related works such as [3,4].  \n\nThe major concern about the paper is the originality of the method. Encoding hierarchies with high dimensional balls and encoding inclusion and exclusion as constraints on those balls is a neat and powerful idea from modeling perspective. However, it is not novel, since the approach is already established for example in [1, 2 Chapter 5]. \nThe next major concern is regarding the evaluation of the quality of embeddings.\nThe empirical evaluation does not sufficiently evaluate the quality of tweaked embeddings. In contrast, the quantitative evaluation is more concerned with if the embeddings being consistent with the given hierarchy. In particular, not enough quantitative evidence that the proposed embeddings are actually effective in capturing semantics or in prediction tasks is provided. It should be noted that, the first aspect, ie consistency of the feasible solutions with hierarchy, can be theoretically established (see e.g. [1]).  The first paragraph of 3.2 seems unclear or wrong. See for example [2] for a gradient based solution for the problem.\nFinally, using an algorithmic approach as opposed to learning method for constructing embeddings, makes the method not directly related to the topic of ICLR conference.\n\nOverall, due to the above reasons, I vote the paper to be rejected. (The poor anonymization makes it a strong case for a reject.)\n\n[1] Mirzazadeh, F., Ravanbakhsh S., Ding N., Schuurmans D.,  \"Embedding inference for structured multilabel prediction\", NIPS 2015.\n[2] Mirzazadeh, F.\"Solving Association Problems with Convex Co-embedding\", PhD thesis, 2017.
