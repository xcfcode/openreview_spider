We find another classification criterion which shares the same theoretical background.\n\nwe want to find a disentangled property among each class. We can interpret each C_i for class i into a singular value decomposition. In the experiment, we observed that the changes of magnitude and angle by the linear map C are different with the class factor in appendix. This implies C_i has different distinct singular values and semi axis. Then, each block component C_i in C has different eigenvalues. Therefore, we can assign eigenvalues into block sub-matrices. These eigenvalues will be the metric for classification.\n\nThe better aspect of classification than clustering is that the classification provides the score for each class that measures how much likely a given data point belongs to the class. Our method uses the eigenvalue as the classification metric. We define the Gaussian distributions of which mean is the eigenvalue of C^TC for each class. We find eigenvalues as much as the estimated number of classes by our algorithm. We calculate the probability for each class for the change of magnitude of a given data point. Then, we can find which class is most probable.\n\n\n5. Why can we assume propositions 3.1 and 3.2?\nWe first notice that the proposition 3.1 and proposition 3.2 are changed to theorem 3.1 and theorem 3.2.\n\nYou mentioned that the proposition 3.1 and 3.2 are not well explained. In the revised version, we tried to show those propositions work, and prove the existence of a linear map C with more realistic assumptions than the union of linear subspaces which is used in the sparse subspace clustering.\n\nWe revised the part of explaining the existence of an (approximate) linear map by introducing the lemma 3.1. The reason we called C as an approximate linear map is that we do not solve the exact dimension of the subspace which class manifolds lie on. we empirically observe that the dimension of the subspace that the subset (class manifold) lies on is approximately (the dimension of latent space) / (the number of classes).\n\nWe changed the hypothesis to the assumption 3.1, and introduce the assumption 3.2. Assumption 3.1. tells us that we can get a tuple (x, h, z), which shares the same factors such as class, brightness, sheerness, sharpness, by using D, C, G after training networks with the cycle consistency loss. That is to say, an data point x encodes into two latent vectors in H, Z respectively, without losing its information. This is because the cycle consistency loss makes the networks encode the right permutation. Therefore, we can track the transformations of the class manifold through the different domains X, H, Z by using D, C, G.\n\nTo show the existence of a convex-compact linear map between two class manifolds in H and in Z, we introduce Assumption 3.2. Assumption 3.2 is more realistic and tight than the assumption that the data space is the union of linear subspaces. Each class manifold in the high abstraction space (H and Z) has convexity and compactness as discussed in Bengio et al. 2013. In addition, we showed that class manifolds are disjoint, so we cannot generate other class samples by using a few samples in a class. It implies that the subspaces that the two different class manifolds lie on are orthogonal and sums of the dimension of subspaces H_i and Z_i are dim(H) and dim(Z) respectively. Therefore, we can conclude that H and Z are the direct sums of H_i and Z_i.\n\nBy introducing the lemma 3.1. we know that C_i is convex and compact linear map. Then, we can prove the existence of a convex-compact linear map. This linear map guarantees at least between S_H_i and S_Z_i. Even if C_i does not hold compactness and convexity outside the the class subset, it does not matter. Because the outside of class manifolds is nothing.\n\nNow, we can find a linear map from H to Z, which satisfies in the union of class manifolds, by using Theorem 3.2.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper2/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper2/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper2/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unsupervised classification into unknown number of classes", "abstract": "We propose a novel unsupervised classification method based on graph Laplacian.

Nevertheless, we are going to deal with this work in the camera-ready version for related works of unsupervised learning if we are accepted.\n\n3. why L1-loss is used in (5)-(7) in Algorithm 1?\nThis is because the cycle consistency, which is used in cycleGAN.  In addition,  L2 and L_inf loss cannot get us a sparse solution, which is the key to divide C into sub block matrices. \n\n4. piecewise linear map\nThanks for your feedback, we change piecewise linear map to approximate linear map. When we first start the research, we think that we can express C as the piecewise linear map and we can approximate this as a linear map. However, we remove that part, and introduce the assumption 3.2 lemma 3.1 to make our method more clear.\n\n5. What is the key signal in the data that enables the algorithm to relate different clusters to their corresponding classes, especially when all classes have equal probability?\nThe classification datasets usually have the same numbers of datapoints for each class.

As you mentioned in your review, we did not write enough explanations about section 3. We will deal with the lack of explanation of section 3 in the end. First, we notice that we slightly change the method of details of classifying method.\n\n1. experimental results are lacking, compare against at least a few reasonable baselines\nIn the revised version, we introduced the criteria which we used. ACC measures the performance of the clustering, which is analogous to the prediction accuracy in the classification. We add some results of other methods.

Unsupervised clustering (even when number of classes is not known) is a very well studied problem in machine learning.\nIn this work, we want to show the advantage of classification than clustering. The main difference between classification and clustering is that there exists measurable metrics for each class, which enable us to calculate the probability of belonging in each class. On the other hand, the clustering has to calculate the distance between the whole dataset. It causes the very high computational complexity. In this paper, we show a classification method in the manner of unsupervised learning, which has not been well studied. In our method, we propose the Gaussian distributions for each class of which mean is the eigenvalue of C^TC. This will be a metric for classification in the manner of unsupervised learning.\n\n3. importance of self-expressiveness\nIn the revised version, we made an assumption 3.2 that each class manifold lies in the subspace of R^n., and vectors in different class are disjoint. We also showed that the connector C is a convex-compact linear map. It implies that, when we express a data point in a latent space by the linear combination of whole dataset, the coefficients of vectors which is not in the class of the given data points are zero. This can be used as the similarity in spectral clustering method. In this paper, we define the mutual expressiveness as the relationship between basis of H and Z which are in same classes\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper2/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper2/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper2/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unsupervised classification into unknown number of classes", "abstract": "We propose a novel unsupervised classification method based on graph Laplacian.

I think the use cycle-consistency loss in an auxiliary latent space is quite clever. However, experimental results are lacking. Unsupervised clustering (even when number of classes is not known) is a very well studied problem in machine learning. The authors should compare against at least a few reasonable baselines.\n\n------------------------------------------\nPresentation\n------------------------------------------\nI found the presentation to be somewhat wanting.

Specifically, it constructs a piece-wise linear mapping (the Connector Network) between the discriminator network and the generator network. The learning objective is based on the cycle-consistency loss. Experiments show that it can achieve reasonable loss. This paper addresses an important problem, namely, unsupervised image classification, and may present interesting ideas. However, the paper is not in a good shape for publication in its current form.\n\nFirst, the paper is not well written and many of the key ideas are not clear. It devotes more than half of the pages to the review of the preliminary materials in Sections 2-3 while only briefly explained the main algorithm in Section 4. Many of the details are missing. For example, why L1-loss is used in (5)-(7) in Algorithm 1? What is the \u201crandom-walk Laplacian matrix L_{sym}\u201d (never defined)? More importantly, it seems that Section 3.4 is a key section to explain how to perform unsupervised classification. However, the ideas (regarding the footprints and footprint mask etc.) are totally unclear. It is assumed that all different classes have equal probabilities. In this setting, it is unclear (in its intuition) why it is possible to assign a cluster index to its true class labels. What is the key signal in the data that enables the algorithm to relate different clusters to their corresponding classes, especially when all classes have equal probability? Furthermore, it is not clear why the mapping from H to Z can be written as a sum of C_1,\u2026,C_k in Proposition 3.2. If the final mapping is piece-wise linear, how can it be written as a sum of linear mappings? Similar question arises in the first paragraph of Section 4.1: if the connector network is constructed as a piecewise linear function (as stated earlier in the paper in abstract and introduction), then how can it be written as a matrix? (Only linear mapping can be expressed as a matrix.)\n\nSecond, the experiment is insufficient. None of the experiment details are presented in the paper. Only the final accuracy of 0.874 is given without any further details. What is the model architecture and size? More experimental analysis should be presented. For example, there are many different hyperparameters in the algorithms. How are the \\lambda_D, \\lambda_G chosen when there is no labeled validation set? How sensitive is the algorithm to different model architecture and model size? Furthermore, none of the baselines results are presented and compared against.\n\nA lot of related works are missing.

Unlike the widely used classification method, this architecture does not require the labels of data and the number of classes. Our key idea is to introduce a approximate linear map and a spectral clustering theory on the dimension reduced spaces into generative adversarial networks. Inspired by the human visual recognition system, the proposed framework can classify and also generate images as the human brains do. We build an approximate linear connector network $C$ analogous to the cerebral cortex, between the discriminator $D$ and the generator $G$. The connector network allows us to estimate the unknown number of classes. Estimating the number of classes is one of the challenging researches in the unsupervised learning, especially in spectral clustering. The proposed method can also classify the images by using the estimated number of classes. Therefore, we define our method as an unsupervised classification method.", "keywords": ["unsupervised learning"], "authorids": ["syhan@cml.snu.ac.kr", "kimdy7@snu.ac.kr", "junglee@snu.ac.kr"], "authors": ["Sungyeob Han", "Daeyoung Kim", "Jungwoo Lee"], "pdf": "/pdf/055d89d7d88f3d1126774fe6825d3329457cda7a.pdf", "paperhash": "han|unsupervised_classification_into_unknown_number_of_classes", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nhan2019unsupervised,\ntitle={Unsupervised classification into unknown number of classes},\nauthor={Sungyeob Han and Daeyoung Kim and Jungwoo Lee},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1gUVjCqKm},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper2/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234560360, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "S1gUVjCqKm", "replyto": "S1gUVjCqKm", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper2/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335626927, "tmdate": 1552335626927, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper2/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 10}
