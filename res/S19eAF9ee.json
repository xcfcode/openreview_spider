Authors propose Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks (GRCN)  that extends convLSTM  (Shi et al. 2015) for data having an unregular graph structure at each timestep. They replace the 2D convolution with a graph convolutional operator from (Defferrad et al., 2016).\nAuthors propose two variations of the GRCN model. In Model 1,  the graph convolution is only applied on the input data. In Model 2, the graph convolution  is applied on both  input data and the previous hidden states. They evaluate their approaches on two different tasks, video generation using the movingMNIST dataset and world-level language modelling using Penntreebank.\n\nOn movingMNIST authors show that their GRCN 2 improves upon convLSTM. However, they evaluate only with one-layer convLSTM, while Shi et al. report better results with 3 layers (also not as good as  GRCN) . It would be nice to evaluate GCRCN in that setting as well.\nWhile the authors show an improvement of GRCN relatively to convLSTM, GRCN on this task seems relatively weak compared to recent works such as the Video Pixel Networks (Kalchbrenner et al., 2016). It contradicts the claim that \"Model 2 has shown good performance in the case of video prediction\" in the conclusion.\n\nFor the Penntreebank experiments, author compares  their model 1 with FC-LSTM, with or without dropout. However, the results in (Zaremba et al., 2014) still seems different than the one reported here. In (Zaremba et al., 2014), they  reports a test perplexity of 78.4 for the large regularized LSTM in their table 1 which outperforms the score of the GRCN. Also, following works such as variational dropout or zoneout have since improve upon Zaremba results. Is there some differences in the experimental setting?  It would be nice to have results that are directly comparable to previous work.\n\n\nPros:\n- Interesting model, \nCons:\n- Overall, the proposed contribution is relatively incremental compared to (Shi et al. 2015) and (Defferrad et al., 2016). \n- Weak results of GRCN relatively to previous works in the experiments, that do not convince of the GRCN advantages.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Structured Sequence Modeling with Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks", "abstract": "This paper introduces Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (GCRN), a deep learning model able to predict structured sequences of data.

The approach follows closely that of Shi et al. 2015, but it is generalized to arbitrary graph structures rather than a fixed grid by using graph convolutions of Defferrard et al. 2016. This is not a strict generalization because the graph formulation treats all edges equally, while the conv kernels in Shi et al. have a built in directionality. The authors show results on a moving MNIST and on the Penn Tree Bank Language Modeling task.\n\nThe paper, model and experiments are decent but I have some concerns:\n\n1. The proposed model is not exceptionally novel from a technical perspective. I usually don't mind if this is the case provided that the authors make up for the deficiency with thorough experimental evaluation, clear write up, and interesting insights into the pros/cons of the approach with respect to previous models. In this case I lean towards this not being the case.\n\n2. The experiment results section is rather terse and light on interpretation. I'm not fully up to date on the latest of Penn Tree Bank language modeling results but I do know that it is a hotly contested and well-known dataset. I am surprised to see a comparison only to Zaremba et al 2014 where I would expect to see multiple other results.\n\n3. The writing is not very clear and the authors don't make sufficiently strong attempt to compare the models or provide insight or comparisons into why the proposed model works better. In particular, unless I'm mistaken the word probabilities are a function of the neighborhood in the graph. What is the width of this graph? For example, suppose I sample a word in one part of the graph, doesn't this information have to propagate to the other parts of the graph along the edges? Also, it's not clear to me how the model can achieve reasonable results on moving MNIST when it cannot distinguish the direction of the moving edges. The authors state this but do not provide satisfying insight into how this can work. How does a pixel know that it should turn on in the next frame? I wish the authors thought about this more and presented it more clearly.\n\nIn summary, the paper has somewhat weak technical contribution, the experiments section is not very thorough, and the insights are sparse.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Structured Sequence Modeling with Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks", "abstract": "This paper introduces Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (GCRN), a deep learning model able to predict structured sequences of data.

Model 2 is exactly what you describe. You are right that our spectral filters are isotropic, and thus do not distinguish between edges. All edges are indeed treated equally (they could be treated differently by having one graph per type of edge for example). This naturally makes sense on graphs with only one type of edge, like the vocabulary graph used in Section 5.2. On images however, it is not evident whether this is good or not. That's exactly what we wanted to test in Section 5.1: could our isotropic filters perform better than 2D filters on video prediction ? And the answer is yes. Moreover, our spectral filters require much less parameters than 2D filters for the same diameter, e.g. 5x5=25 corresponds to K=3, 9x9=81 corresponds to K=5.\n\n2. No particular reason. For a fair comparison with Shi et al. (2015), we used the same architecture as them, which is Model 2.\n\n3. On moving MNIST, we followed the same setup as Shi et al.

I understand that the input at each time step x_t is a n x d matrix where n is the vocabulary size and d is the word vector dimensions. How did you construct x_t for language modelling? \n\n3. Because the graph is constructed based on word2vec, you can't fine tune the word embeddings, right? (otherwise the graph will change after each update)\n\n4. how did you tune the hyper-parameters for those models reported? Did you employ early-stop to halt all training after 8 epochs?\n\n5.
