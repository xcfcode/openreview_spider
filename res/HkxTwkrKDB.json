We also made slight changes to the proof of Corollary 1 in accordance to the notation in the new definition.\nReviewer2: The preliminaries were revised to include a discussion of the main theorem in the case where $k=1$ and to highlight the connection to the proof of invariant universality that appears in the DeepSets paper [Zaheer et al., 2017].\nReviewer2: A precise reference to the result in Golubitsky&Stuart [2002] (equivatiant polynomials $\\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$) was added.\nReviewer3: The experimental results are now discussed in a results summary section.\nReviewer3: We added a conclusion section that summarizes our results and contributions.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1785/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1785/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On Universal Equivariant Set Networks", "authors": ["Nimrod Segol", "Yaron Lipman"], "authorids": ["nimrod.segol@weizmann.ac.il", "yaron.lipman@weizmann.ac.il"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "universality", "set functions", "equivariance"], "TL;DR": "Settling permutation equivariance universality for popular deep models.

It also explaina the brevity of my review. My apologies to the authors and other reviewers.\n\n*Paper summary*\n\nThe authors design a set architecture, which is equivariant to permutations on the input. They show the simplest such set architecture, which preserves equivariance, while being a universal approximator. Nicely this architecture relies on a correction to PointNet, called PointNetST, which they show is not equivariant universal. Furthermore, they run experiments on a few toy examples demonstrating that their system performs well.\n\n*Paper decision*\n\nI have decided to give this paper a weak accept, since it contains both theory and nice experiments. To change to a firm accept, I think the paper needs some changes in written style mainly, to make it friendlier to newcomers to the area, which can easily be implemented in the camera ready stage of paper preparation. For instance, the omission of a results discussion section or a conclusion are clearly not reader friendly.\n\n*Supporting arguments*\n\n- The paper is written clearly. This said, it requires a great deal of effort to follow the maths if you are not already fluent in a lot of the ideas used in the paper (this includes myself). \n- I think the structure of the paper is fine for this sort of work. Perhaps at the beginning it would be more useful to spend more time on a roadmap of the results presented in the paper and to explain the exact significance of why the reader should want to continue reading.\n- I think the selection of experiments is nice, containing both regression and classification. What would have been nicer would be to perform some sort of ablation study, where the authors studied how the representational capacity of the network changed as a result of them introducing the universal linear transmission layer.\n- A direct theoretical and experimental comparison between PointNet and PointNetST would have been useful for me to understand the impact of the change that the authors introduce.\n\n*Questions/notes for the authors*\n\n- Please answer my concerns in the support arguments\n- Where is the conclusion section?"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1785/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1785/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On Universal Equivariant Set Networks", "authors": ["Nimrod Segol", "Yaron Lipman"], "authorids": ["nimrod.segol@weizmann.ac.il", "yaron.lipman@weizmann.ac.il"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "universality", "set functions", "equivariance"], "TL;DR": "Settling permutation equivariance universality for popular deep models.

The proof uses an expression for equivariant polynomials and the universality of MLP. It then shows that the proposed expression in terms of power-sum polynomials can be constructed in PointNet using a minimal modification to the architecture, or using DeepSets, therefore proving the universality of such deep models. \n\nThe results of this paper are important. In terms of presentation, the notation and statement of theorems are precise, however, the presentation is rather dry, and I think the paper can be significantly more accessible. For example, here is an alternative and clearer route presenting the same result: one may study the simple case of having single input channel, for which the output at index \"i\" of an equivariant polynomial is written as the sum of all powers of input multiplied by a polynomial function of the corresponding power-sum. This second part is indeed what is used in the proof of the universality of the permutation invariant version of DeepSets, making the connection more visible. Generalizing this to the multi-channel input as the next step could make the proof more accessible. \n\nThe second issue I would like to raise is related to discussions around the non-universality of the vanilla PointNet model. Given the fact that it applies the same MLP independently to individual set members, it is obvious that it is not universal equivariant (for example, consider a function that performs a fixed permutation to its input), and I fail to see why the paper goes into the trouble of having theorems and experiments just to demonstrate this point. If there were any other objectives beyond this in the experiments could you please clarify? \n\nFinally, could you give a more accurate citation (chapter-page number) for the single-channel version of Theorem 2.? \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1785/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1785/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On Universal Equivariant Set Networks", "authors": ["Nimrod Segol", "Yaron Lipman"], "authorids": ["nimrod.segol@weizmann.ac.il", "yaron.lipman@weizmann.ac.il"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "universality", "set functions", "equivariance"], "TL;DR": "Settling permutation equivariance universality for popular deep models.

Authors should scope the paper to the specific function family these networks can approximate. No baseline comparison with GraphNets.\n\n\n\nThe paper proposes theoretical analysis on a set of networks that process features independently through MLPs + global aggregation operations. However, the function of interest is limited to a small family of affine equivariant transformations.\n\nA more general function is\n\n\\begin{equation}\nP(X)_i = Ax_i + \\sum_{j \\in N(x_i, X)} B_{(x_j, x_i)} x_j + c\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $N(x_i, X)$ is the set of index of neighbors within the set $X$. It is trivial to show that this function is permutation equivariant.\n\nThen, can the function family the authors used in the paper approximate this function? No.\nCan the proposed permutation equivariant function represent all function the authors used in the paper? Yes.\n\n1) If $B=0$, then the proposed function becomes MLP.\n2) If $A=0, N(x_i, X) = [n]$ and $B_{(x_j, x_i)} \\leftarrow B$, then this is $\\mathbf{1}\\mathbf{1}^TXB$, the global aggregation function.\n\nAlso, this is the actual function that a lot of people are interested in. Let me go over few more examples.\n\n3) If $N(x_i, X) = $adjacency on a graph and $B_{(x_j, x_i)} \\leftarrow B$, then this is a graph neural network \"convolution\" (it is not a convolution)\nExample adjacency $N(x_i, X) = \\{j \\;| \\; \\|x_i - x_j\\|_p < \\delta, x_j \\in X\\}$.\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{GraphOp}(X)_i = Ax_i + \\sum_{j \\in \\{j \\;| \\; \\|x_i - x_j\\|_p < \\delta, x_j \\in X\\}} Bx_j + c\n\\end{equation}\n\n4) If $x_i = [r,g,b,u,v]$ where $[r,g,b]$ is the color, $[u,v]$ is the pixel coordinate and $N(x_i, X) =$ pixel neighbors within some kernel size, $B(x_j, x_i)$ to be the block diagonal matrix only for the first three dimensions and 0 for the rest, then this is the 2D convolution.\n\n\nAgain, the above function is a more general permutation equivariant function that can represent: a graph neural network layer, a convolution, MLP, global pooling and is one of the most widely used functions in the ML community, not MLP + global aggregation.\n\n\nRegarding the experiment metrics and plots:\n\nOn the Knapsack test, the metric of interest is not the accuracy of individual prediction. Rather, whether the network has successfully predicted the optimal solution, or how close the prediction is to the solution.\nFor example: success rate within the epsilon radius of the optimal solution while satisfying all the constraints. Fail otherwise. If these networks can truly solve these problems, authors should report the success rate while varying the threshold, not individual accuracy of the items which can be arbitrarily high by violating constraints.\n\nAlso, the authors should compare with few more graphnet + transmission layer (GraphNetST) baselines with the graph layers: $P(X)_i = Ax_i + \\sum_{j \\in N(x_i, X)} Bx_j + c$ and the same single transmission layer $\\mathbf{1}\\mathbf{1}^TXB$ in PointNetST.\nPointNet is a specialization of graphnets and GraphNetST should be added as a baseline with reasonable adjacency.\n\nAlso experiment figures are extremely compact. Try using log scale or other lines to make the gaps wider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinor\n\nI am quite confused with the name PointNetST. Authors claim adding one layer of DeepSet layer to a PointNet becomes PointNetST, but I see this as a special DeepSet with a single transmission layer. The convention is B -> B', not A + B -> A'. In this case, A: PointNet, B: DeepSet\n\nLemma 3 is too trivial.\n\nThe paper is not very self contained. Spare few lines of equations to define what are DeepSets and PointNetSeg in the paper and point out the difference since these networks are used throughout the paper extensively without proper mathematical definition.\n\nP.2 power sum multi-symmetric polynomials. \"For a vector $x \\in R^K$ and a multi-index ...\" I think it was moved out of the next paragraph since  the same $x$ is defined again as $x \\in R^n$ again in the next sentence.\nAlso, try using the consistent dimension for x throughout the paper, it confuses the reader.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1785/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1785/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On Universal Equivariant Set Networks", "authors": ["Nimrod Segol", "Yaron Lipman"], "authorids": ["nimrod.segol@weizmann.ac.il", "yaron.lipman@weizmann.ac.il"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "universality", "set functions", "equivariance"], "TL;DR": "Settling permutation equivariance universality for popular deep models.
