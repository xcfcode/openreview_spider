With class-dependent label noise,  it is also close to a onehot vector, but the elements correspond to the cluster which the predicted class belongs are non-zero, to minimize the loss function. On the other hand, with class-independent label noise, all elements of the softmax output vector needs to be non-zero thus smoothed onehot vector.

The analysis is sound and addresses interesting points, giving insightful results. Nevertheless, the overall conclusion is not very surprising. This work  confirms the commonly admitted fact that CNNs learn features that are visually meaningful.   Moreover, there is no significant novelty in the paper. The paper only analyses the CNNs behavior, without suggesting any new algorithm based on the observations. One specific point that seems under-investigated in my sense is the observation about the robustness to adversarial perturbations. The model with the class dependent noisy labels is in average less sensitive to the perturbations, even if this is not significant for the tested noise level. Did the authors test with different noise levels? This calls for a further analysis. It has the potential to give more insights, and probably inspire new methods to improve training robustness.

They argue that real-world noise should be class-relevant.\n\nPros:\n\n1. The authors find a new angle to exploit robust learning with noisy labels.\n\n2. The authors perform numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposal. And their experimental result support their previous claims.\n\nCons:\n\nWe have two questions in the following.\n\n1. Basic definition: in learning with noisy labels, there are two basic models. First, most research focuses on class-conditional noise (CCN) model [1]. Second, recent research explore a bit on instance-dependent noise (IDN) model [2, 3]. As far as I know, there is no class-irrelevant label noise and class-relevevant label noise. In CCN mode, people would like to use symmetric noise and asymmetric noise as a basic benchmark to conduct experiments.\n\n2. Motivation: The authors want to claim CNNs are more robust to such realistic label noise than class-irrelevant label noise. However, they make one mistake. They do not have a clear definition about realistic label noise. In my mind, I believe Clothing1M [4] should be realistic label noise dataset.\n\nBy the way, in learning with noisy labels, there are two kinds of research. First, people propose new robust methods for CCN model. Second, people propose new robust methods for IDN models. Proposing new setting should be encouraged. However, the setting and conclusion should be reasonable.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] D. Angluin and P. Laird. Learning from noisy examples. Machine Learning, 1988.\n\n[2] A. Menon, B. Rooyen, and N.
