What is the difference between g_l(x) and g_l(y) if g_l : H_{l\u22121} \u2192 H_l and f_l: H_{l\u22121} \u2192 H_l are the same? What are e_x and e_y? Why is there a \u03bb if it is a generative model?\n\n- If the title is called 'text decipherment', there should be no parallel data at all, otherwise it is a huge overclaim on the decipherment tasks. Please add citations of Kevin Knight's recent papers on deciperment.\n\n- Reading the experiment results of 'Sentiment Transfer' is a disaster to me. I couldn't get much information on 'sentiment transfer' from a bunch of ungrammatical unnatural language sentences. I would prefer to see some results of baseline models for comparison instead of a pure qualitative analysis.\n\n- The claim on \"FMAEs are state of the art for neural machine translation with limited supervision on EN-DE and EN-FR\" is not exciting to me. Semi-supervised learning is interesting, but in the scenario of MT we do have enough parallel data for many language pairs. Unless the model is able to exceed the 'real' state-of-the-art that uses the full set of parallel data, otherwise we couldn't identify whether the models are able to benefit NMT.  Interestingly, the authors didn't provide any of the results that are experimented with full parallel data set. Possibly it is because the introduction of stochastic variables that prevent the models from overfitting on small datasets.\n\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Models for Alignment and Data Efficiency in Language", "abstract": "We examine how learning from unaligned data can improve both the data efficiency of supervised tasks as well as enable alignments without any supervision.
