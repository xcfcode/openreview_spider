Here it is hard to tell if the algorithm runned long enough (and the confidence interval are missing). \n- Only reports scores for k=2 which make no clear sense when the datasets have 10 classes. \n- Assuming  the task is classification it seems to performs poorly because the slope on cumulative gain on MNIST at the end of the plot is close to 0.5.
