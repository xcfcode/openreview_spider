We are glad that you found our writing clear and a valuable contribution to the literature.\n\nWe also appreciate being pointed to these relevant works. While our technique is different, there are definitely important connections to previous domain adaptation work, and we have used these to better place where neuron editing falls in the landscape of learning transformations that can extrapolate [1, 2]. Domain adaptation seeks to learn a network on some labeled data that can be applied to some unlabeled data. Almost exclusively, these works consider the task to be *classification*, and labels are the *class labels*, which are known on one dataset and not the other. Instead, neuron editing considers the task *transformation*, and labels are the *target distribution*, which is known for one dataset and not the other. Thus, neuron editing is a transformation-learning extension of the existing classification-learning domain adaptation work.\n\nWe had not thought of it in such terms before, but greatly appreciate your recommendation.

We are glad you are able to appreciate the contribution it would make to the discussion regarding generative modeling. We thank you for your one major critique regarding the clarity of the biological applications. We have made this explanation much more comprehensive in our revision and will gladly continue to improve it as we receive recommendations. We have explained more about the particular mass cytometry datasets, the task of batch correction  itself, the most pressing computational problems of existing approaches, and why we believe deep learning is an appropriate tool. Specifically, we have heavily edited the entirety of Section 1 and the first several paragraphs in both Sections 3.2 and Section 3.3.

First, biaxial plots are a commonly used way of visualizing cellular (cytometry) data of this kind [1]. Second, viewing the raw data values is important for verifying that neuron editing\u2019s batch-correction transformations are *biologically sensible*. For example, when defending a biological conclusion based on the batch-corrected data, this visualization would be necessary to justify why interferon-gamma values in the sample were increased (because the technical replicate spike-ins showed that batch measured artificially low interferon-gamma).\n\u2014 Thank you for the notes about the minor edits here and there.\n\u2014 The idea of extrapolating to more than just one pair is a very interesting one, and one that we think would be promising future work, that\u2019s a great insight, which we have included in our final discussion.\n\nAgain, thank you for your review and the help improving our manuscript!\n\n[1] Korin, Ben, Tania Dubovik, and Asya Rolls. \"Mass cytometry analysis of immune cells in the brain.\" Nature protocols 13.2 (2018): 377."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1114/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1114/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Beyond GANs: Transforming without a Target Distribution", "authors": ["Matthew Amodio", "David van Dijk", "Ruth Montgomery", "Guy Wolf", "Smita Krishnaswamy"], "authorids": ["matthew.amodio@yale.edu", "david.vandijk@yale.edu", "ruth.montgomery@yale.edu", "guy.wolf@umontreal.ca", "smita.krishnaswamy@yale.edu"], "keywords": ["GAN", "domain transfer", "computational biology", "latent space manipulations"], "TL;DR": "A method for learning a transformation between one pair of source/target datasets and applying it a separate source dataset for which there is no target dataset", "abstract": "While generative neural networks can learn to transform a specific input dataset into a specific target dataset, they require having just such a paired set of input/output datasets.

We hope that you will reconsider your rating in light of our comments and revision, and join the other two reviewers in recommending our paper for acceptance.\n\nYour point that the introduction was far more narrowly tailored (to the biological application) than the content of the paper itself was extremely helpful. We have rewritten the introduction to speak to the method\u2019s general applicability, as opposed to motivating it only for the context of computational biology. Specifically, we have heavily edited the entirety of Section 1 and the first several paragraphs in both Sections 3.2 and Section 3.3, hopefully making these aspects far more clear than they were in their first version. We think this significantly improves the cohesion and consistency of the presentation. However, it is worth mentioning that the biological application is very compelling and solves long standing problems in both batch correction and predicting combinatorial drug effects.\n\nWe are not sure we agree about the applicability of the recently published StyleGAN to our problem, however. While its results are definitely impressive, if we understand correctly, StyleGAN is used for generation based on a code sampled from a noise distribution Z (like a standard Gaussian). The results are individual high quality images from scratch, but this is a fundamentally different task than ours. Neuron editing\u2019s task is to take as input a data point from one dataset (and no noise), and generate a data point from another dataset (referred to as domain mapping, image-to-image translation, manifold alignment, or any of a number of other names). This is different from generating just any out-of-sample point, but we would need to generate one from a given input point. While the paper does mention a sort of \u201cstyle mixing\u201d, this requires having a known source point in the other domain, for one thing, and appears to be a non-standard use of the model anyway. We believe that the gold-standard baseline for the task of domain translation is the CycleGAN, which we compare to in our experiments.\n\nIn response to the small points you helpfully raised:\n\u2014 We think our definition of mode collapse (tied to a notion of diversity in the real dataset that is unmodeled by the generator) is still a correct description, albeit from a different perspective than it is usually thought of. Mode collapse doesn\u2019t just refer to a large part of the latent space mapping to a small region around a single point (and it especially doesn\u2019t require the generated point to be inaccurate). This definition is biased by our use of datasets which are standard collections of images: consider for example if the target dataset is *in fact* just a small region around a single point. Modeling this effectively obviously wouldn\u2019t be mode collapse, even though the whole latent space would map to a small region. We proffer that mode collapse requires a notion of *diversity in the dataset* that isn\u2019t being modeled. But this is a minor quibble where we can reasonably disagree and would gladly reword the offending line if desired.\n\u2014 The diversity of data types we experiment on are a strength of the technique, and appreciate the suggestions on how to better bridge the discussion/motivation of these sections.\n\u2014 Regarding previous work, we briefly mentioned the most related works that assume the shift in latent space is a single constant vector across the whole distribution, and that use highly specialized pre-trained models on labeled data to extract features in a supervised manner rather than our unsupervised autoencoder. We could expand on these sections as necessary.\n\nOverall, we greatly appreciate your feedback and hope you believe our responses and revisions have addressed your concerns sufficiently to upgrade your rating.

The method relies on an autoencoder, instead of a GAN, to which neuron-editing is applied. A transformation of one of the inner layer is learned using the source and target distributions is estimated and then applied to the extrapolating distribution. This leads to better reconstructions than GAN approaches as judged by some visualizations and results. The method is also applied to biological datasets and some improvement is shown (accuracy increases on specific prediction tasks).\n\nThe idea of applying neuron-editing to an autoencoder is pretty interesting. It's a simple manipulation that makes a lot of sense and judging by the image transformation examples works well. This method also numerically greatly outperforms others on the CelebA extrapolation task so the extrapolation is believable, even though more examples in the appendix would be good. The motivation of applying the method to medical data to correct for instrument variability is also very interesting.\n\nHowever I felt that I could not fully see the benefit of the application for medical data because the area, task, datasets etc are not well introduced. I think the datasets should be explained better, and examples of the images should be given. I understand the gist of Figure 4 but it's not well explained and I do not see why these dimensions were picked. I think there is more work to do there. I think a more careful introduction to the field, with explanations of the data, why deep methods are applicable there, what people have tried etc are necessary.\n\nAlso all of the tables in the paper with classification tasks should have sections in the appendix to explain everything about those tasks. In general, it seems the main weakness of the paper is in exposing the information/writing. \n\nSmaller points:\nIn section 2, source, target and extrapolation distributions are not introduced properly.

Their approach for \u201cneuron editing\u201d can be used to learn how neurons in a DNN encode particular transformations in the latent space, with the hope of using it to be able to generate data that are out-of-sample and/or do not lie on the same manifold as the data used to train the generative model. Experiments were performed on the CelebA dataset. The authors further demonstrate the usefulness of their proposed idea by using it to remove noise/batch effects from data and also predicting synergy between drugs by using their idea to model the effect of drug treatments.\n\nWhile the idea behind this paper is interesting and their method does seem to provide improvements over other generative models, the paper is a bit difficult to follow and the applications to biology are not explained well enough to understand the implications of their results. The fact that the authors did not compare to StyleGANs also seems a bit suspicious because these models are sota for the types of problems that this paper addresses. Additionally, the authors should consider rewriting the motivation for this problem to be more general. This is a convincing new method to transform distributions in any setting, but the introduction would lead one to believe its applicability is mostly to computational biology. \n\nDetailed comments:\n- The writing and motivation needs to be reworked in order to ensure that the introduction, results, and abstract match in their tone and content. The abstract uses a face recognition/generation application to motivate the work, the introduction focuses solely on computational biology, the results switch between biology and face recognition.\n\n- Section 2: Three desirable properties for a transformation are listed, but what makes these properties desirable?\nEquation (1): Not obvious why the piecewise function definition is necessary, since the second equation seems to hold for j = 0 and j = 99 as well. This should either be corrected or simplified.\n\n- \u201cMode collapse refers to the discriminator being unable to detect differences in variability between real and fake examples.\u201d Not true. Mode collapse is when a large region of the model\u2019s input space maps onto the small region around a single (often bad) sample.\n\n- Section 3: It would be helpful to see gradual interpolation from the original latent representation of a sample along the direction the neuron edit will be performed, and continued beyond the proposed final latent activations, to demonstrate how this process actually affects the model\u2019s output.\n\n- Doesn\u2019t really seem like the authors tried very hard with the other methods (especially the vanilla GAN) and the omission of StyleGAN, the current state-of-the-art in this kind of transformation learning, is conspicuously omitted. It is highly likely that a well-trained StyleGAN would do better than the other GAN/AE techniques compared against.\n\n- A PCA-based transformation is applied directly to the image data, but it would be interesting (and perhaps more informative) to perform an alignment of the PCs of activations in the latent space.\n\n- Section 4: Again, the motivation distinctly focuses on computational biology when one could easily imagine this approach being applicable to a variety of problems.\n\n- Comparisons with StyleGANs would\u2019ve been appreciated, especially given the fact that they\u2019re now considered state-of-the-art when it comes to modifying the latent space and creating out of sample images as proposed in this work. \n\n- The idea is interesting, though one wonders if there isn\u2019t any other work where the neurons have been \u201cedited\u201d to accommodate different transformations, given that the idea is itself rather intuitive. A more thorough literature review in that regard would be helpful.\n\n- The CelebA experiments help lay establish an intuitive understanding of the proposed technique and were helpful. However, the ideas are a little disconnected with the biological applications of the technique. Better motivation/bridging of the two sets of experiments would be nice.\n\n- A more detailed explanation and analysis of the combinatorial drug application would\u2019ve been helpful to understand the results.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1114/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1114/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Beyond GANs: Transforming without a Target Distribution", "authors": ["Matthew Amodio", "David van Dijk", "Ruth Montgomery", "Guy Wolf", "Smita Krishnaswamy"], "authorids": ["matthew.amodio@yale.edu", "david.vandijk@yale.edu", "ruth.montgomery@yale.edu", "guy.wolf@umontreal.ca", "smita.krishnaswamy@yale.edu"], "keywords": ["GAN", "domain transfer", "computational biology", "latent space manipulations"], "TL;DR": "A method for learning a transformation between one pair of source/target datasets and applying it a separate source dataset for which there is no target dataset", "abstract": "While generative neural networks can learn to transform a specific input dataset into a specific target dataset, they require having just such a paired set of input/output datasets.

We first demonstrate it on image transformations and then move to our two main biological applications: removal of batch artifacts representing unwanted noise and modeling the effect of drug treatments to predict synergy between drugs.", "pdf": "/pdf/0232619c86c446eb071540c28199a621d64d9d7f.pdf", "paperhash": "amodio|beyond_gans_transforming_without_a_target_distribution", "original_pdf": "/attachment/09c7faf367a6a86006d84965add14f95506b96a7.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\namodio2020beyond,\ntitle={Beyond {\\{}GAN{\\}}s: Transforming without a Target Distribution},\nauthor={Matthew Amodio and David van Dijk and Ruth Montgomery and Guy Wolf and Smita Krishnaswamy},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1lDSCEYPH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
