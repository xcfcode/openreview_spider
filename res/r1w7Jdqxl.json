As a result, new users and new items are no longer second-class citizens -- they are encoded in exactly the same way as those in the training set.\n\n(1) CDL only encodes items using deep neural network, while the representations of the users are still obtained by matrix factorization. The learning process, driven by the combined objective, devoted a considerable amount of efforts to minimize the reconstruction error of the auto-encoder, which does not necessarily lead to improved recommendation. \n(2) Whereas it partly addresses the cold-start problem.

Actually, none of the previous publications of the listed authors were about Deep RS. \n\nThe key idea of this work is to couple both the user network and the item network to make predictions. The idea of coupled learning instead of the model architecture is our major contribution. The CDL method, which we compare with as a baseline, can actually be considered as a \"less coupled\" version, where the training of the item encoder and the rating matrix factorization are done alternatively. Our experimental results have shown that the proposed method yields better results on multiple datasets -- this may be considered as an important evidence that shows the significance of coupling. Intuitively, coupled learning tailors the representations towards accurate recommendation, and thus it can often lead to better recommendation results. \n\nIt is true that the dual networks take a bit longer to train. However, the time complexity remains in an acceptable level (about 10 hours to train a model for MovieLens, our largest dataset). Note that once the networks are trained, they work very efficiently when deployed for service. For existing users or items, encoding features can be calculated in advance and then memorized -- we are as fast as traditional method like WMF under this scenario. The encoding of new users or new items only needs to go through several layers of feed-forward computation (on average, 0.4 milliseconds to encode a user/item). We will add these details to the paper.

Note that without subsampling, the number of users increases from 4,663 to 131,821, while the density decreases from 0.25% to 0.15%. The results are listed below:\n\n=== with subsampling\n     Recall@50  Recall@100 Recall@200\nWMF     37.14%      48.81%     60.25%\nCDL     38.11%      49.73%     61.00%\nOurs    44.95%      59.15%     72.56%\n\n=== without subsampling\n    Recall@50  Recall@100 Recall@200\nWMF    35.95%      46.48%     56.69%\nCDL    37.01%      47.41%     57.34%\nOurs   44.35%      57.30%     69.84%\n\nWe can see that without subsampling, the recall values decrease moderately for all methods. However, the general trend remains similar -- our proposed method still outperforms others by a remarkable margin. \n\nAs to the evaluation metric, there have been different choices in literatures. Recall@M is a common choice adopted by our baselines [1, 2], and is closely related to how a recommendation system is assessed in practice. That being said, we also did additional tests to compute other metrics (including AUC and RMSE), as listed below:\n\nAUC   CiteULike   MovieLens       Ciao\nWMF      91.01%      89.27%     79.82%\nCDL      96.36%      89.30%     83.74%\nOurs     93.70%      96.74%     81.80%\n            \nRMSE    CiteULike   MovieLens   Ciao\nWMF         0.070       0.070   0.129\nCDL         0.106       0.071   0.088\nOurs        0.120       0.128   0.126\n\nWe can see that different metrics are not quite correlated. Sometimes, they even exhibit opposite trends.\n \nPrevious work [3] has performed systematic study of this issue, and shown that \"Common methodologies based on error metrics (such as RMSE) are not a natural fit for evaluating the top-N recommendation task. Rather, top-N performance can be directly measured by alternative methodologies based on accuracy metrics (such as precision/recall).\"\n\n[1] Wang C, Blei D M.

At the very least other performance measures (rmse or AUC) should be reported for completeness, even if the results are not strong\n2) Given that the contribution is fairly simple (i.e., the \"standard\" recommender systems task, but with a new model) it's a shame that unusual data samples have to be taken. This should be a case where it's possible to report results against competing methods using *exactly* the same data they used, and exactly the same error measure, for the fairest comparison possible.\n\nWithout the above it's hard to tell how much the performance improvements are really due to the method being better, versus the choice of datasets and the choice of loss functions.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Collaborative Deep Embedding via Dual Networks", "abstract": "Despite the long history of research on recommender systems, current approaches still face a number of challenges in practice, e.g. the difficulties in handling new items, the high diversity of user interests, and the noisiness and sparsity of observations.
