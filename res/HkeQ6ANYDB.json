In the revision, we have experimentally shown in Figure 13 that these physics-specific adaptations boost the result. \n\nQ2: More \u201cimpactful\u201d physics tasks instead of projectile motion and collisions\nA2: We specifically chose widely known physics tasks like projectile motion and collisions. This allows readers to access our paper and improve the algorithms, without the barrier to entry of knowing specialized physics. Although widely known, these tasks can also be made very challenging as we show in Fig. 4 by adding model mismatch. In crux, a kinematic equation with an unknown model mismatch can be a harder physics problem than a differential equation that perfectly describes the system.\n\nQ3: Experiments with more sample amounts.\nA3: We have added experiments with more training sample amount (1024). The new results are in the revised version of Fig.14. We find that when the amount of training data surpasses a certain point (like 512, 1024 in tossing task), the performance of PhysicsNAS is no longer better than the MLP method.

Since all 3 reviewers have mentioned our novelty in the merging of NAS with PBL, we summarize our modifications in addition to the conventional NAS below. \n\n*****************************************\nNovelty in merging NAS with PBL\n*****************************************\nWe are indeed inspired by existing NAS methods, but incorporating physical priors required (non-obvious) modifications to differentiable NAS [Liu2018, Cai2018]. We\u2019ve added a new result figure to the paper showing that---without our tweaks---naive NAS is outperformed by PhysicsNAS at every testing configuration (cf. Figure 13). \n\ni. Modifications in search space: \nWe considered using only operation weights as in Darts [Liu2018] and Proxyless [Cai2018], but finally had to add edge weights because we found that when introducing physical operations, the resulting imbalance of operation numbers between edges made the previous NAS methods more prone to search out a collapsed model.  We also considered utilizing unrolled optimization to construct the search space and adding physical operation in the middle layers of the search space but we had to rule them out because we found the physical tasks we implement here all have closed-form solutions and are more suitable for optimization without iterative solvers. Eventually, we converged on three physics-motivated modifications, described in ===Section 3.3=== of the original submission. \n\nIn the revision, we\u2019d like to highlight the experimental value of these three modifications.  ===Figure 13=== of the revised submission demonstrates that PhysicsNAS outperforms NAS over all tested model mismatch configurations and training sample sizes. This experiment helps justify the value of our three major adaptations. \n\nii. Modifications in optimization strategy: \nThe optimization strategy in PhysicsNAS is essentially modified to be a mixture of Darts and Proxyless as we adopt their advantages respectively. We found the real-valued path-weights utilized in Darts made PhysicsNAS tend to abandon the physical operations that naturally prefer small output values. Thus we adopted the probabilistic path weights utilized in Proxyless. As well, we found that the selection of only one edge for every node in Proxyless was inadequate for aggregating physical information and adopted the two-edge selection scheme utilized in Darts. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1388/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1388/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Blending Diverse Physical Priors with Neural Networks", "authors": ["Yunhao Ba", "Guangyuan Zhao", "Achuta Kadambi"], "authorids": ["yhba@ucla.edu", "zhaoguangyuan@ucla.edu", "achuta@ee.ucla.edu"], "keywords": ["Physics-based learning", "Physics-aware learning"], "TL;DR": "A new method for physics-based learning is proposed that can handle a more diverse range of quality in the physical prior and dataset.", "abstract": "Rethinking physics in the era of deep learning is an increasingly important topic.

This entails including physical inputs to the network and the incorporation of new operations to the NAS. I think the idea has merit and rather like it. However, there are several aspects of the work that could be improved. The technical novelty is small, as the extension of the  existing NAS models to handle physical inputs and a few new operators is relatively straightforward. The experiments, while well designed, only explore uninteresting toy problems. While I appreciate the necessity to explore the methods performance in a more controlled setting, a more impactful testbed would be more convincing. Another drawback of the evaluation is the lack of a proper statistical analysis of the results, given the small data and model sizes.\n\n\n=== Relevance & Prior Work ===\n+ The related work gives a good summary and categorization of prior work in physics-based learning\n+ The problem (physics-based learning) is interesting and relevant to the community\n\n\n=== Novelty & Approach===\n+ application of NAS to physics based learning\n+ incorporation of physics solutions as inputs into differentiable NAS\n+ creation of physics-informed operation sets to merge physical models into network\n- technical steps to merge NAS and PBL are relatively straightforward\n\n\n=== Evaluation ===\nTwo representative physical simulations were chosen for evaluation, where elements of the physics model are intentionally omitted,  1) estimating trajectory of a ball in presence of wind and air resistance, and 2) a collision speed simulation where two objects collide, where sliding friction is not accounted for in the physics model.\n\nThe baselines consist of: a 3-layer MLP (data-driven), a 3-layer MLP with Physical Regularization, a 3-layer MLP with residual connection to the physics prediction, an MLP with two input branches, on for the data and one for the physics predictions (Physical Fusion), and the Embedded Physics model which estimates parameters for the physics modelu using a 3-layer MLP.\n\nPhysicsNAS can combine elements of the baseline models, but the total number of nodes is limited to 5.\n\n+ Experiments testing the dependence of the model on the numbers of samples and the strength of the physical inconsistencies were conducted. In both cases, PhysicsNAS outperformed the best specialized physics models.\n\n- The chosen testbed tasks are toy problems. While these types of experiments are necessary to understand the performance of the model, it would have been interesting to see PhysicsNAS applied to a more impactful task\n\n- Given the size of the networks and the training data, there is no reason why a more sophisticated statistical analysis of the results wasn\u2019t performed (confidence intervals, t-test, p-value).

It also seems that the approach need not be confined to physics per se - in many\nproblems in chemistry, materials science etc. scientists are looking for ways to incorporate domain\nexpertise while accounting for model-mismatch. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1388/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1388/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Blending Diverse Physical Priors with Neural Networks", "authors": ["Yunhao Ba", "Guangyuan Zhao", "Achuta Kadambi"], "authorids": ["yhba@ucla.edu", "zhaoguangyuan@ucla.edu", "achuta@ee.ucla.edu"], "keywords": ["Physics-based learning", "Physics-aware learning"], "TL;DR": "A new method for physics-based learning is proposed that can handle a more diverse range of quality in the physical prior and dataset.", "abstract": "Rethinking physics in the era of deep learning is an increasingly important topic.

It is interesting because it cleverly tackles the challenge of manually designing priors and network architectures. The results are also impressive as the proposed method surpasses all the considered baselines. Despite of the above upsides, I have the following questions/concerns.\n1. There is limited technical novelty as the entire method is mainly based on previous work on neural architecture search. Nevertheless, it might be helpful to have some ablation study to show the improvement of the task-specific adaptations presented in the paper, with which I believe this could be a good paper on the application side.\n2. I'm curious about the performance of the baseline methods given the same amount of computation. For example, is it possible to perform intensive hyperparameter tuning for the baselines to also obtain improvement. It seems that the authors did not discuss the computational costs and whether different methods are compared given the same cost."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1388/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1388/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Blending Diverse Physical Priors with Neural Networks", "authors": ["Yunhao Ba", "Guangyuan Zhao", "Achuta Kadambi"], "authorids": ["yhba@ucla.edu", "zhaoguangyuan@ucla.edu", "achuta@ee.ucla.edu"], "keywords": ["Physics-based learning", "Physics-aware learning"], "TL;DR": "A new method for physics-based learning is proposed that can handle a more diverse range of quality in the physical prior and dataset.", "abstract": "Rethinking physics in the era of deep learning is an increasingly important topic.
