The latter is specially important because it is where the alignment comes into play. Unfortunately this was not explained in the paper (e.g. Figure 2 was not reference at any point in the paper!).\nIn the experimental results, the authors showed that by introducing the correspondence loss, mapping by the trained network  becomes more biologically meaningful (at a very coarse level that at least the cell types match).
