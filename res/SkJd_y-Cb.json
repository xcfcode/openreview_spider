In SGNS, each word x is associated with vectors a_x and r_x. Given a set of context words C, the model calculates the probability that the target word is x by a dot product between a_x and the average of {r_c: c in C}.  The paper generalizes this computation to an arbitrary network: now each word x is associated with some network N_x whose input is a set of context words C and the output is the aforementioned probability. This is essentially an architectural change: from a bag-of-words model to a (3-layer) feedforward model. \n\nAnother contribution of the paper is a new form of regularization by tying a subset of layers between different N_x. In particular, the paper considers incorporating POS tags by tying within each POS group. For instance, the parameters of the first layer are shared across all noun words. (This assumes that POS tags are given.)\n\nWhile this is a natural extension to word2vec, the reviewer has some reservations about the execution of this work. Word embeddings are useful in large part because they can be used to initialize the parameters of a network. None of the chosen experiments shows this. Improvement in the log likelihood over SGNS is somewhat obvious because there are more parameters. The similarity between \"words\" now requires a selection of context vectors (7) which is awkward/arbitrary. The use of POS tags is not very compelling (though harmless). It's not necessary: contrary to the claim in the paper, word embeddings captures syntactic information if the context width is small and/or context information is provided. A more sensible experiment would be to actually plug in the entire pretrained word nets into an external model and see how much they help. \n\nEDIT: It's usually the case that even if the number of parameters is the same, extra nonlinearity results in better data fitting (e.g., Berg-Kirkpatrick et al, 2010), it's still not unexpected. \n\nAll of this is closely addressed in the following prior work: \n\nLearning to Embed Words in Context for Syntactic Tasks (Tu et al., 2017)\n\nQuality: Natural but questionable extension, see above. \n\nClarity: Clear. \n\nOriginality: Acceptable, but a very similar idea of embedding contexts is presented in Tu et al.

In keeping with the formulation of Mikolov et al, the model learned is a set of independent binary classifiers, one per word. As opposed to other work, each classifier is not based on the dot product between an embedding vector and a context vector but instead is a per-word neural network which takes the context as input and produces a score for each term. An interesting consequence of using networks instead of vectors to parametrize the embeddings is that it's easy to see many ways to let the model use side information such as part-of-speech tags. The paper explores one such way, by sharing parameters across networks of all words which have the same POS tag (effectively having different parameterizations for words which occur with multiple POS tags).\n\nThe idea is interesting but the evaluation leaves doubts. Here are my main problems:\n 1. The quantitative likelihood-based evaluation can easily be gamed by making all classifiers output numbers which are close to 1. This is because the model is not normalized, and no attempt at normalization is claimed to be made during the likelihood evaluation. This means it's likely hyperparameter tuning (of, say, how many negative examples to use per positive example) is likely to bias this evaluation to look more positive than it should.\n 2. The qualitative similarity-based evaluation notes, correctly, that the standard metric of dot product / cosine between word embeddings does not work in the case of networks, and instead measures similarity by looking at the similarity of the predictions of the networks. Then all networks are ranked by similarity to a query network to make the now-standard similar word lists. While this approach is interesting, the baseline models were evaluated using the plain dot product. It's unclear whether this new evaluation methodology would have also produced nicer word lists for the baseline methods.\n\nIn the light that the evaluation has these two issues I do not recommend accepting this paper.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Word2net: Deep Representations of Language", "abstract": "Word embeddings extract semantic features of words from large datasets of text.\nMost embedding methods rely on a log-bilinear model to predict the occurrence\nof a word in a context of other words.

Our experimental study shows that word2net outperforms existing methods both with the same context dimension (K) and the same number of parameters (p/V), especially when we use POS information.\n\n>> The similarity between \"words\" (7) is awkward/arbitrary.\n\nWe use Equation (7) to compute functional similarities between networks. It captures the idea that similar networks map similar inputs to similar outputs. The reason we use the context vectors as input is because they span typical inputs to the networks; linear combinations of context vectors have been used as input to the networks during training.\n\n>> The use of POS tags is not necessary: contrary to the claim in the paper, word embeddings capture syntactic information if the context width is small and/or context information is provided.\n\nAs Reviewer 3 notes correctly, when we train a word embedding method such as word2vec, the embeddings of some words might capture some syntactic information, especially when the context size is small. However, work by Andreas and Klein, 2014, shows that over the entire vocabulary, the embeddings do not encode much syntactic information. One contribution of our work is to develop a method that allows us to incorporate syntactic information into the task of learning semantic representations.\n\n>> A more sensible experiment would be to actually plug in the entire pretrained word nets into an external model and see how much they help.\n\nWe agree that evaluating word2net on downstream tasks is an excellent idea for future work. We also suspect that there are applications where existing embedding methods are not applicable since they only learn vectors, and the asymmetric compositionality of neural networks is necessary to solve the task.\n\n>> This is closely addressed in the following prior work: Learning to Embed Words in Context for Syntactic Tasks (Tu et al., 2017)\n\nThe workshop paper of Tu et al. is very interesting. However, it addresses the entirely different task of learning a separate embedding for each occurrence of a word (i.e., token embeddings). The token embeddings are then used as features for downstream tasks such as POS tagging.\nIn contrast, our aim is to learn a representation for each word depending on its POS tag, which means we use the POS tags during training as additional information we want the embedding to capture.\n\n>> Originality: Acceptable, but a very similar idea of embedding contexts is presented in Tu et al. (2017).\n\nWe will include the citation to this interesting workshop paper (thank you for pointing us to it), but we also think that the main contribution of our work of learning a neural network for each word rather than a vector is complementary to the ideas in Tu et al.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Word2net: Deep Representations of Language", "abstract": "Word embeddings extract semantic features of words from large datasets of text.\nMost embedding methods rely on a log-bilinear model to predict the occurrence\nof a word in a context of other words.

The summary shows a firm understanding of our work and we appreciate the constructive feedback for the experimental section.\n\n>> Like Mikolov et al, the model learned is a set of independent binary classifiers, one per word. \n\nCorrect. One contribution of this work is to demonstrate that the skipgram formulation of Mikolov et al., originally derived as an approximation to multiclass classification, can be viewed as a binary classification, one for each word. The binary classifiers are not fully independent; rather, they are coupled through the context vectors, which are the input to the classifiers.\n\n>> An interesting consequence of using networks instead of vectors is that it's easy to use side information such as part-of-speech tags. \n\nCorrect. Incorporating side information into embeddings is a difficult task and has only been partially addressed in previous work. In particular, syntactic information has been difficult to incorporate.\n\n>> The paper explores one such way, by sharing parameters across networks of all words which have the same POS tag.\n\nYes, we effectively learn a different representation for each word - POS tag combination.\n \n>> The quantitative likelihood-based evaluation can easily be gamed. \n\nIt is true that the quantitative evaluation can be gamed without proper normalization. To avoid that, we were careful to make the comparison as fair as possible. During training, all methods used the same number of negative samples, and the reported held-out likelihood values correspond to the average over both positive and negative samples, giving the same weights to positive and negative samples.\n \n>> In the qualitative similarity-based evaluation the vector representations are ranked by cosine similarity while the word networks are ranked by functional similarity (cosine similarity does not apply). While this approach is interesting, it is unclear if it would produce nicer lists for the baseline methods as well.\n\nThank you. Evaluating the word vectors on \"functional similarity\" is an excellent idea. We reran the similarity queries and found that some queries changed slightly while others did not change. For example, in the 4 queries in Table 3, when evaluating the CBOW baseline with the functional similarity, only 2 queries changed by one word, while the other two queries remained unchanged. We leave it for future work to study the difference between functional and cosine similarity. If the functional similarity we developed for word2net is indeed better for vector-based embeddings this might be a worthwhile contribution by itself."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Word2net: Deep Representations of Language", "abstract": "Word embeddings extract semantic features of words from large datasets of text.\nMost embedding methods rely on a log-bilinear model to predict the occurrence\nof a word in a context of other words.
