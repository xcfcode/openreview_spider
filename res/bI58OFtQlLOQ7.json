Deep learning (in the unsupervised sense) helps having features optimized for each of these 2 different tasks, adapt them for different situations (different robotics grippers) and beat hand-designed features for detection of graspable areas, using a mixture of inputs (depth + rgb + xyz).\r\n\r\nNovelty: deep learning for detection is not as uncommon as the authors suggest (pedestrians detection by [4] and imagenet 2012 detection challenge by Krizhevsky), however its application to robotics grasping detection is indeed novel. And detecting rotations (optimal grasping detection) while not completely novel is not extremely common.\r\n\r\nQuality: the experiments are well conducted (e.g. proper 5-fold cross validation).\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Deep learning successfully demonstrated in a new domain.\r\n- Goes beyond the simpler task of classification.\r\n- Unsupervised learning itself clearly learns interesting 3D features of graspable areas versus non-graspable ones.\r\n- Demonstrates superior results to hand-coded features and automatic adaptability to different grippers.\r\n- The 2-pass shows improvements in quality and ~2x speedup.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Even though networks are fairly small, the system is still far from realtime. Maybe explaining what the current bottlenecks are and further work would be interesting. Maybe you want to use convolutional networks to speed-up detection (no need to recompute each window's features, a lot of them are shared in a detection setting)."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Learning for Detecting Robotic Grasps", "decision": "conferenceOral-iclr2013-workshop", "abstract": "In this work, we consider the problem of detecting robotic grasps in an RGB-D view of a scene containing objects.
