The usual standard Gaussian is transformed by one or more neural network layers, resulting in a prior that is better dispersed and has multiple modes (according to t-SNE visualizations).\n\nEvaluation\n\nPros:  Parametrizing the prior of deep generative models is a sensible thing to do, and the approach seems to result in improvements to the generated samples and to the latent space (as seen in t-SNE visualizations) in comparison to a fixed Gaussian prior.  \n\nCons:  Parametrizing the prior is an incremental suggestion and not particularly novel.  The authors note this themselves, citing the work on VampPriors [2].  Yet, the authors fail to cite the work on lossy autoencoders (LAEs) [1], which also parametrizes the prior.  The only difference is that LAEs use an autoregressive flow because they require the prior to remain a tractable density whereas this work can employ a non-invertible map because of its use of an adversarial loss.  Regarding experiments, I think a better baseline would be to compare against a fixed mixture density prior.  Doing so would test if the additional parameters (which need to be optimized) in the prior\u2019s transformation are necessary.   \n\nConclusion\n\nWhile I find no serious flaws in this work, I can\u2019t recommend its acceptance due to a lack of novelty.  \n\n\n1.
