The authors propose a number of performance enhancements (curriculum learning, attention (zoomed-in centered) frames, reward shaping, game variables, post-training rules) inspired by domain knowledge.\n\nThe enhancements together lead to a clear win as demonstrated by the competition results. From Fig 4, the curriculum learning clearly helps with learning over increasingly difficult settings. A nice result is that there is no overfitting to the harder classes once they have learned (probably because the curriculum is health and speed). The authors conclude from Fig 5 that the adaptive curriculum is better and more stable that pure A3C; however, this is a bit of a stretch given that graph. They go on to say that Pure A3C doesn't learn at all in the harder map but then show no result/graph to back this claim. Tbl 5 shows a clear benefit of the post-training rules.\n\nIf the goal is to solve problems like these (3D shooters), then this paper makes a significant contribution in that it shows which techniques are practical for solving the problem and ultimately improving performance in these kinds of tasks. Still, I am just not excited about this paper, mainly because it relies so heavily of many sources of domain knowledge, it is quite far from the pure reinforcement learning problem. The results are relatively unsurprising. Maybe they are novel for this problem, though.\n\nI'm not sure we can realistically draw any conclusions about Figure 6 in the paper's current form. I recommend the authors increase the resolution or run some actual metrics to determine the fuzziness/clarity of each row/image: something more concrete than an arrow of already low-resolution images.\n\n--- Added after rebuttal:\n\nI still do not see any high-res images for Figure 6 or any link to them, but I trust that the authors will add them if accepted.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Training Agent for First-Person Shooter Game with Actor-Critic Curriculum Learning", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel framework for training vision-based agent for First-Person Shooter (FPS) Game, in particular Doom.\nOur framework combines the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approach (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) model) with curriculum learning.

It is not uncommon to see application-oriented papers using a combination of multiple techniques to achieve strong performance. This category covers many seminar works, e.g., deep reinforcement learning for Atari games (applying deep models to traditional Q-learning), or even AlphaGo (supervised learning, policy gradient, value function, Monte-Carlo Tree Search, self-play). It may be a bit shortsighted to judge such strong performing papers with a single criterion.\n\nConfusion about the domain:\nReviewer3 mentions that the paper \"basically applies A3C to 3D spatial navigation tasks.\", which is not true. In the deathmatch game of Doom, multiple players explore the maze and fight against each other to get a higher score, which is defined as #kills - #suicide. In this task, part of the goal is to learn anti-enemy tactics (e.g., dodging the rocket shot from the enemy, e.g., video:  http://yuandong-tian.com/dodge.mp4). Therefore, Doom is a very different environment compared to pure navigation tasks proposed in previous works (e.g, https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03673, https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05143). Both Reviewer1 and Reviewer2 clearly mentioned that it is a gaming scenario (3D shooter game), rather than a navigation task.\n\nOne major issue brought about by the reviewers is its novelty. In terms of applicational contribution, as pointed out by Reviewer1, this paper made \"a significant contribution in that it shows which techniques are practical for solving the problem and ultimately improving performance in these kinds of tasks\". Previous research in 3d game environments using a similar framework (a3c + curriculum training), or using more complicated approaches (e.g, memory-equipped approach like Arnold in https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05521) does not achieve this level of performance. Therefore, our method could serve as a baseline (we will release the code and pre-trained models) for follow-up research. In terms of technical contributions, in this paper we use a modified version of A3C that stores a single model in the server side to collect game experience from multiple clients, which is different from original A3C that stores models on the client side and perform asynchronous updates. As a result, the proposed approach uses less memory.\n\nA related concern from the reviewers is whether papers focusing on a specific game like Doom will lead to better general solutions to the reinforcement learning problem. We believe the answer is yes. For example, many papers on Atari games focus on Montezuma's Revenge, a particular game with very sparse reward and requires strong exploration techniques. Go, as a game with fully-observable but enormous states, is another example that could lead to a better understanding of general RL techniques. In our paper, having different levels of enemies is critical for our curriculum training to work. This could motivate following works that use parametrized factors in the environment to bootstrap the training, or apply similar approaches on changing/online environments.\n\nOther issues:\n\nWe will run more experiments regarding to Fig. 5 and add more figures on curriculum learning regarding the full map.\n\nWe have more videos showing that the agent indeed learns tactics e.g., dodging. See the following link: http://yuandong-tian.com/dodge.mp4. The low-resolution image in Fig. 6 will be replaced by high-resolutional images.\n\nWe will add more discussions about the method of the paper and compare conceptually with others, which will naturally bring about more related works."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Training Agent for First-Person Shooter Game with Actor-Critic Curriculum Learning", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel framework for training vision-based agent for First-Person Shooter (FPS) Game, in particular Doom.\nOur framework combines the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approach (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) model) with curriculum learning.

The original A3C paper mentions \"gradient norm clipping\" -- it's unclear what was exactly used, but the effect should be similar. The DQN paper explicitly describes where and how the clipping is applied, and our use of Huber loss follows their settings.\n\nIn this paper we mainly focus on introducing a system that trains strong Doom AI bots. And we will try our best to explain various choices in designing the system. In this case the aforementioned reason provides justification why this choice is not arbitrary, and we'll also provide some experiments in the next version to further justify this choice.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Training Agent for First-Person Shooter Game with Actor-Critic Curriculum Learning", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel framework for training vision-based agent for First-Person Shooter (FPS) Game, in particular Doom.\nOur framework combines the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approach (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) model) with curriculum learning.
