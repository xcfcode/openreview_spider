This is achieved by a simple adjustment to the output of an encoder's network architecture plus the addition of a maximal mean discrepancy based loss function for regularization. Most algorithms in representation learning are easily adaptable to our framework and we demonstrate its effectiveness by adjusting SimCLR to have a manifold encoding space. Our experiments show that we obtain a substantial performance boost over the baseline for low dimensional encodings.", "pdf": "/pdf/73fa68949ed350ec1c31af4f0ebd861ad6ac0ee0.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|selfsupervised_representation_learning_on_manifolds", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021selfsupervised,\ntitle={Self-supervised representation learning on manifolds},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to ICLR 2021 Workshop on Geometrical and Topological Representation Learning},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=EofGDIGAhvR},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615225929161, "tmdate": 1615967298665, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
