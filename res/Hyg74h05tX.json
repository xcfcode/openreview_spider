Responses to my concerns somewhat addressed, though simpler alternatives to uniform dequant would be nice.\n\n=====\n\nImprovements are attained on two image datasets by (a) variational dequantization, (b) mixture CDF coupling layers, and (c) self-attention in conditioning net.\n\nQuality: The work is fine, demonstrating familiarity with recent work in flows and improving upon it. The experiments are on CIFAR-10 and 32x32 ImageNet. Unclear if the evaluation numbers are on a test set or a 'validation' set. I will be assuming test set. The visualizations are fine, but not nearly as convincing as the Glow visualizations on CelebA.\n\nClarity: The presentation is clear enough, and the motivation seems reasonable, though the assertion that all AR models are slow seems a bit belied by the recent WaveRNN work, which gets a Wavenet like model running in realtime on a phone. On the other hand, I felt like the proposed fixes were all a bit scattered here & there. Each could stand as a research topic on its own, and one paper can't fit in much analysis of all three. For example, a RealNVP style model usually needs to shuffle or reverse the channels to attain decent performance, but there's no discussion of how/whether that is done here. Folks wanting to replicate this work would want a formula for the tractable log-abs-det-jacobian of the coupling layer, but all we have is \"involves calculating the pdf of the logistic mixtures\".\n\nOriginality: Self-attention is not new, though its uptake in the conditioning networks of flow models has been slow/nonexistent. I found the dequantization improvement more novel. The new proposal for a coupling layer seems like a clever way of introducing more parameters in a structured manner. \n\nSignificance: Bringing flow models closer to the performance of AR models is good progress.\n\n\nQuestions\nI wonder whether some kind of spline or cubic interpolation might achieve similar improvement over the uniform dequantization. Perhaps uniform is not the best baseline?\nThe new coupling layer might just be viewed as a way of introducing many more parameters in a structured manner. Have you compared parameter counts?\nAppendix B shows some portion of the code, but seems like a missed opportunity to fit this into a framework like tfp.bijectors. The code seems glued in somewhat slapdash. For example, the tf_go function looks like debugging/logging code (unwanted), and lacks any usage.\n\nI think this work is promising and interesting to the probabilistic modeling community, but needs some cleanup and some more compelling presentation (non image data?

Nonetheless, some this ablation study was useful in tearing apart the contribution of each of several pieces of the model (missing pieces being gated convolutions, dropout, and instance normalization), although without explaining them.\nAlthough flow-based model can intuitively sample faster than autoregressive models, the measure of sampling time is a bit interesting as an actual evidence of that claim.

I really like Real NVP models, which I think are a bit underappreciated. Thus, I\u2019m happy that there are papers trying to improve their performance.  However, I wish this was done with more rigour.\n\nThe paper makes 3 claims about the current flow models: (1) it is suboptimal to use additive uniform noise when dequantizing images, (2) affine coupling layers are not expressive enough, and (3) the architectures fail to capture global image context. I\u2019ll comment on these claims and proposed solutions below.\n\n(1) I agree with the reasoning behind the need for a better dequantization distribution. However, I think the authors should provide an evidence that the lower bound is indeed loose when q is uniform. For example, for the CIFAR-10 model, the authors calculated a gap of 0.025 bpd when using variational dequantization. What would this gap be when using uniform q?  Maybe, a clear illustration of the dequantization effect on a simpler dataset or a toy example would be more useful.\n\n(2) My main concern about the mixture CDFs coupling layer is how much bigger the model becomes and how much slower it trains. I find this analysis crucial when deciding whether 0.05 bpd improvement as reported in Table 1 is worth the hassle.\n\n(3) As a person not familiar with the Transformer, I couldn\u2019t understand how exactly self-attention works and how much it helps the model to capture the global image context. Also, I think this problem needs a separate illustration on a dataset of larger images.  \n  \nThe experiments section is very weak in backing up the identified problems and proposed solutions. Firstly, I think it is more clear if the ablation study is done in reverse: instead of making Flow++ and removing components, start with the vanilla model and then add stuff.  Secondly, it\u2019s not clear if these improvements generalize across datasets, e.g. when images are larger than 32x32. Though, larger inputs may lead to huge models which are impossible to train when the resources are quite limited. That\u2019s why I find it important to report how much complexity is added compared to the initial Real NVP. Also, I think it\u2019s a well-known fact that sampling from PixelCNN models is slow unlike for Real NVPs, so I don\u2019t find the results in Table 3 surprising or even useful. \n\nTo conclude, I find this paper unfinished and wouldn\u2019t recommend its acceptance until the analysis of the problems and their solutions becomes better thought out.

In this paper, we investigate and improve upon three limiting design choices employed by flow-based models in prior work: the use of uniform noise for dequantization, the use of inexpressive affine flows, and the use of purely convolutional conditioning networks in coupling layers. Based on our findings, we propose Flow++, a new flow-based model that is now the state-of-the-art non-autoregressive model for unconditional density estimation on standard image benchmarks. Our work has begun to close the significant performance gap that has so far existed between autoregressive models and flow-based models.", "keywords": ["Deep Generative Models", "Normalizing Flows", "RealNVP", "Density Estimation"], "authorids": ["jonathanho@berkeley.edu", "peter@covariant.ai", "aravind_srinivas@berkeley.edu", "dementrock@gmail.com", "pabbeel@cs.berkeley.edu"], "authors": ["Jonathan Ho", "Xi Chen", "Aravind Srinivas", "Yan Duan", "Pieter Abbeel"], "TL;DR": "Improved training of current flow-based generative models (Glow and RealNVP) on density estimation benchmarks", "pdf": "/pdf/132aef8e926f7f548a6db4f1e773b9ddfa4e2fac.pdf", "paperhash": "ho|flow_improving_flowbased_generative_models_with_variational_dequantization_and_architecture_design", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nho2019flow,\ntitle={Flow++: Improving Flow-Based Generative Models  with  Variational Dequantization and Architecture Design  },\nauthor={Jonathan Ho and Xi Chen and Aravind Srinivas and Yan Duan and Pieter Abbeel},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyg74h05tX},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1435/Official_Comment", "rdate": null, "ddate": null, "expdate": null, "duedate": null, "tmdate": 1543621611639, "tddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "reply": {"forum": "Hyg74h05tX", "replyto": null, "readers": {"description": "Select all user groups that should be able to read this comment.", "value-dropdown-hierarchy": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1435/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1435/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1435/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1435/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"]}, "signatures": {"description": "", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1435/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1435/Authors|ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1435/Area_Chair[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values-copied": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference", "{signatures}"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "required": true}, "comment": {"order": 1, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}", "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).", "required": true}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1435/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1435/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1435/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "noninvitees": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "multiReply": true, "taskCompletionCount": null, "transform": null, "cdate": 1543621611639}}}], "count": 9}
