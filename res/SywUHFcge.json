Among them, Stability training is the closest to the \"Siamese training\". \n\nAgain, the main purpose of covering Siamese training in this paper is to provide an empirical study showing how our theorems can be useful for analyzing a specific hardening strategy. We do not intend to claim it as a novel hardening strategy. \n\nATT: Stability training was shown to improve the model robustness against Gaussian noise in (Zheng et al., 2016).

For instance, illustrated by the seminal cognitive neuroscience paper \"untangling invariant object recognition\" ~\\cite{dicarlo2007untangling} and its follow-up study \\cite{dicarlo2012does}, the authors show that one can view the information processing of visual object recognition by  human brains as the process of finding operations that progressively transform retinal representations into a new form of representation ($X_2$ in this paper), followed by the application of relatively simple decision functions (e.g., linear classifiers~\\cite{duda2012pattern}). \n\nMore specifically, in human and other primates, such visual recognition takes place along the ventral visual stream and this stream is considered to be a progressive series of visual re-representations, from V1 to V2 to V4 to IT cortex ~\\cite{dicarlo2007untangling}. \n\nMultiple relevant studies (e.g., ~\\cite{dicarlo2007untangling,johnson1980sensory,hung2005fast}) have argued that this viewpoint of representation learning plus simple decision is more productive than hypothesizing that brains directly learn very complex decision functions (highly non-linear) that operate on the retinal image representation. \n\nThis is because the experimental evidence suggests that this view takes the problem apart in a way that is consistent with the architecture and response properties of the ventral visual stream. Besides simple decision functions can be easily implemented in a single step of biologically plausible neuronal processing (i.e., a thresholded sum over weighted synapses).  \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": " A Theoretical Framework for Robustness of (Deep) Classifiers against Adversarial Samples", "abstract": "Most machine learning classifiers, including deep neural networks, are vulnerable to adversarial examples.

For instance, illustrated by the seminal paper \"untangling invariant object recognition\" in cognitive Science ~\\cite{dicarlo2007untangling}, the authors show that one can view the central process of visual object recognition in human brain as a problem of finding operations that progressively transform retinal representations into a new form of representation ($X_2$ in this paper), followed by the application of relatively simple decision functions ($c_2$ in our paper) (e.g., linear classifiers~\\cite{duda2012pattern}). Multiple relevant studies (e.g., ~\\cite{dicarlo2007untangling,johnson1980sensory,hung2005fast}) argue that this viewpoint of representation learning plus simple decision is more productive than hypothesizing that brains directly learn very complex decision functions (highly non-linear) that operate on the retinal image representation. This is because it takes the problem apart in a way that is consistent with the architecture and response properties of the ventral visual system. Besides such simple decision functions are easily implemented in a single biologically plausible neuronal processing step (i.e., a thresholded sum over weighted synapses).

Two typical examples can be derived from Table 3:\n\n- If $f_1$ misses discovering some related features and does not extract unrelated features, $f_1$ is strong-robust (even tough its accuracy may be not satisfactory).\n\nThis is illustrated by a simple example in Figure 6 showing 1 = n_1 < n_2 = 2, X_1 \\subset X_2. \nIn terms of classification, $f_1$ (green boundary line) is not accurate according to $f_2$ (red boundary line). However, $f_1$ is strong-robust to the adversarial samples. For Test-sample Case (c) see the discussions of boundary points in Section 3.5.4.\n\n- If $f_1$ uses some extra and unrelated features, it will not be strong-robust to adversarial attacks (though it may be an accurate predictor).\nThis is illustrated by a simple example in Figure 2.\n \nIn the adversarial setting, we should aim to get a classifier that is both strong-robust and accurate. A better feature learning is exactly the solution that may improve both goals.\n\nThis question partially relates to the discussion of \"how g function and c function influence the adverial robustness\".

We sincerely appreciate all the comments that have helped us improve the paper. \nHowever, we want to point out that the comment \" strong robustness implies perfect accuracy of the predictor\" is incorrect. This is closely related to AnonReviewer3 question1. \n\nEssentially, this is another important insight from our theorem -- $g_1$ matters for the strong-robustness and $c_1$ does not. The related discussion is included in Section 3.5.4 and Section 7.3 in the latest version. \n\nYour concerns: \"if you take any predictor that predicts one single instance correctly for each output label, then strong robustness implies perfect accuracy of the predictor\" have been explained by Figure 5 and Figure 6. In both figures $f_1$ is strong-robust according to $f_2$ and $f_1$ predicts one single instance correctly for each output label. However, $f_1$ is not accurate according to $f_2$.\n \nMore specifically, Figure 5 is about $n_1 = n_2 = 2, X_1 = X_2 = \\RR^2$ and Figure 6 is about $1 = n_1 < n_2 = 2, X_1 \\subset X_2$.\n\nOur definition of strong-robustness is $\\P(f_1(x) = f_1(x') | d_2(x,x') < \\epsilon) = 1, \\forall x,x' \\in X$. \nAll pairs of test samples $(x,x')$ can be categorized into the three cases as follows: \n\nTest-case (a) in both figures is about when $x$ and $x'$ are predicted as the same class by both and $f_1$ gets correct predictions according to $f_2$. There exist no adversarial samples. \n\nTest-case (b) in both figures is about when $x$ and $x'$ are predicted as the same class by both and $f_1$ gets incorrect predictions according to $f_2$. There exist no adversarial samples. \n\nTest-case (c) in both figures shows the case of $f_1(x) \\ne f_1(x') | d_2(x,x') < \\epsilon$. This case has been explained in Section 3.5.4. Essentially, this is about ``Boundary based adversarial attacks'' not adversarial sample problem we focus in this paper. This type of attacks can only attack the points whose distance to the boundary of $f_1$ is smaller than $\\epsilon$.

The main weakness is the notion of strong robustness itself, which is an extremely rigid notion. It requires the partitioning of the predictor function by class to match the exact partitioning of the oracle. This robustness is almost never the case in real life: it requires that the predictor is almost perfect.\n\nThe main flaw however is that the output space is assumed to have discrete topology and continuity is assumed for the classifier. Continuity of the classifier wrt. a discrete output is also never really satisfied. However, if the output space is assumed to be continues values with an interesting topology (like probabilities), then the notion of strong robustness becomes so constrained and strict, that it has even less practical sense and relevance. Based on those definition, several uninteresting, trivial consequences follow. They seem to be true, with inelegant proofs, but that matters little as they seem irrelevant for any practical purposes.\n\nThe second part is a well executed experiment by training a Siamese architecture with an explicit additional robustness constraint. The approach seems to be working very well, but is compared only to a baseline (stability training) which performs worse than the original model without any trainings for adversarials. This is strange as adversarial examples have been studied extensively in the past year and several methods claimed improvements over the original model not trained for robustness.\n\nThe experimental section and approach would look interesting, if it were compared with a stronger baseline, however the empty theoretical definitions and analysis attempts make the paper in its current form unappealing.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": " A Theoretical Framework for Robustness of (Deep) Classifiers against Adversarial Samples", "abstract": "Most machine learning classifiers, including deep neural networks, are vulnerable to adversarial examples.

Continuity of the classifier wrt. a discrete output is also never really satisfied. \u2026 , several uninteresting, trivial consequences follow. \u2026 matters little as they seem irrelevant for any practical purposes.\n\nAnswer: We want to point out that this comment indicates some incorrect understanding of our paper: \n\n1. Our topology is not about the output space. They are about the input space and the extract features. More specifically, the equations are as follows: \n-\t$d_1'(x, x') = d_1(g_1(x),g_1(x'))$\n-\t$d_2'(x, x') = d_2(g_2(x),g_2(x'))$\n\n2. We do NOT assume continuity for the classifier. The assumption we made on f_1 is \u201calmost everywhere (a.e.) continuity\u201d. (Explained in Section 2.3.1 and Appendix Section 6.5 of the 2016-Dec-14 version). \n\n\n3. Lemma (6.3) shows that if a classifer f_1 is not continuous almost everywhere (a.e.), f_1 is not robust (even) against random noise. \n\n4. Popular machine learning classifiers all satisfy the almost everywhere (a.e.) continuity assumption. Explanation of DNN is a.e. continuous is included in Section 2.3.1.  Explanations of logistic regression and SVM being continuous almost everywhere are included in Section 6.6. (of the 2016-Dec-14 version).   \n\n5. The a.e. Continuity essentially indicates,\n- It does not mean that the function $f_1$ is continuous in every point in its feature space X; \n\n- As we all know (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function): If a probability distribution admits a density, then the probability of every one-point set {a} is zero; the same holds for finite and countable sets. The same conclusion holds for zero measure sets (Null_set: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_set ), for instance, straight lines  in  $R^n$.\n\n- The a.e. Continuity follows the same property as density function: the probability of picking one-point set {x} from the whole feature space is zero; the same holds for zero measure sets. This means: the probability of picking the discontinuous points (e.g., points on the decision boundary) is zero, because they are null_set.\n\nWe have updated the paper with the more detailed explanations about a.e. continuity and its indications, \n\n6. As we have answered in the third point of Q1- AnonReviewer2, our theoretical analysis provides a much better understanding of the relationship between robustness and accuracy. A very interesting finding from our analysis is about the importance of feature learning. In the adversarial setting, we should aim to get a classifier that is both strong-robust and accurate.

In particular, the (complicated) discriminant function (f) is decomposed into a feature extractor (g) and a classifier (c), where the feature extractor (g) defines the feature space. \n\nThe main contribution of this paper is to propose abstract understanding and analysis for adversarial phenomenon, which is interesting and important. \n\nHowever, this paper also has the following problems. \n\n1)\tIt is not clear how the classifier c can affect the overall robustness to adversarial noises. The classifier c seems absent from the analysis, which somehow indicates that the classifier does not matter. (Please correct me if it is not true) This is counter-intuitive. For example, if we always take the input space as the feature space and the entire f as the classifier c, the strong robustness can always hold. \nI am also wondering if the metric d has anything to do with the classifier c.\n2)\tA very relevant problem is how to decompose f into g and c. For examples, one can take any intermediate layer or the input space as the feature space for a neural network. Will this affect the analysis of the adversarial robustness?\n3)\tThe oracle is a good concept. However, it is hard to explicitly define it. In this paper, the feature space of the oracle is just the input image space, and the inf-norm is used as the metric. This implementation makes the algorithm in Section 4 quite similar to existing methods (though there are some detailed differences as mentioned in the discussion). \n\nDue to the above problems, I feel that some aspects of the paper are not ready.

The purely topological conclusions of Section 3 seem to be very disconnected to the quantitative measurements of Section 4. A more thorough exposure on the connections between the two sections would be helpful.\n\nAnswer:  We want to sincerely thank reviewer for point out that we missed such an important discussion. We have added three paragraphs at the beginning of Section-4. They are copied as follows:\n\nSection 3's analysis indicates that strong-robustness is a strong condition of machine learning classifiers and requires thorough understanding of oracle. Since many state-of-the-art learning models, including DNNs, are not strong-robust, it is important to understand and quantify how far they are away from strong-robust. We name such situations as \"weak-robustness\" and propose a quantitative measure to describe how robust a classification model is against adversarial attacks. The proposed measure is named as Adversarial Robustness for Classifiers (ARC) and uses the expectation of how difficult it is to generate adversarial samples on a classifier.\n\nComparing to relevant studies in the literature, our analysis of weak-robustness has the following contributions: \n\u2022 (1) We propose a measure ARC to quantify a classifier\u2019 weak-robustness by considering both the predictor f1 and the oracle f2 (introduced in Section 2). Measures proposed by previous studies (Papernot et al., 2015b; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2015) simply calculate the average of model accuracy under adversarial samples, which ignores the importance of oracle. \n\u2022 (2) Similar to the definition of strong-robustness, we connect the notion of weak-robustness to Definition (2.2) (the general definition of Adversarial test sample for a classification task). \n\u2022 (3) We further prove that a classifier f1 is strong-robust against adversarial samples if and only if its ARC achieves the maximum (1 since ARC is rescaled to [0, 1]). This clearly shows that the weak-robustness is quantitatively related to the strong-robustness. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": " A Theoretical Framework for Robustness of (Deep) Classifiers against Adversarial Samples", "abstract": "Most machine learning classifiers, including deep neural networks, are vulnerable to adversarial examples.

The robustness definition is not self-contained - How does X1 and X2 relate to f1 and f2? It can be guessed based on the previous paragraph, but it is not specified formally in the definition. In Theorem 3.7 what do d_1 and d_2 refer to?\n\nAnswer: Thank you for pointing out this writing issue. We have added two paragraphs at the beginning of Section-3. They are copied as follows: \n\nAs shown in Figure~1 we assume a common machine learning classifier $f_1 = g_1 \\circ c_1 $, where $g_1 : X \\to X_1$ represents the feature extraction and $c_1: X_1 \\to Y$ performs the operation of classification. In Section-2, we decompose $f_2$ as $f_2 = g_2 \\circ c_2$ where $g_2 : X \\to X_2$ represents the feature extraction and $c_2: X_2 \\to Y$ performs the operation of classification. Here, $X_2$ describes the feature space in which oracle makes the decision.\n\nThe reason why we need the above decomposition of $f_1$ and $f_2$ is to introduce two metric spaces defined in $X_1$ and $X_2$. In this section, we theoretically prove a special relationship between two metric spaces is a sufficient condition in determining whether $f_1$ is strong-robust at test time, or not. Then we extend the discussion from metric spaces into two pseudometric spaces defined in $X$ and prove that a special relationship between two pseudometric spaces is sufficient and necessary in determining the strong-robustness of $f_1$.\n\nThe second paragraph of Section 3.1 also helps in understanding this decomposition: \n\nAs shown in Figure1, the two metric spaces in our formulation are $(X_1,d_1)$ and $(X_2,d_2)$. For a pair of samples $(x,x')$ ($x,x' \\in X$), the feature extraction of $f_1$ and $f_2$ transfer $(x,x')$ to $(x_1, x_1')$ ($x_1,x_1' \\in X_1$) and $(x_2, x_2')$ ($x_2,x_2' \\in X_2$). Then the adversarial problem defined by Definition 2.2 is to find a pair of samples $(x,x')$ satisfying that $d_2(x_2,x_2')$ is small while $d_1(x_1,x_1')$ is large. \n\n\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": " A Theoretical Framework for Robustness of (Deep) Classifiers against Adversarial Samples", "abstract": "Most machine learning classifiers, including deep neural networks, are vulnerable to adversarial examples.
