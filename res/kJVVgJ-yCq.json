We believe that we have been able to modify our paper and improve the quality of our analysis due to the reviews. We have performed the following significant changes in the paper after receiving the reviews-\n\n1. We have added a new baseline-\n\t- It helps us to comment on the efficiency of our proposed modulation network as a conditioning approach.\n\t- It helps us demonstrate why a task modulation based approach is required for a set of complex tasks.\n2. We have shown that our approach scales well with the number of tasks.\n3. We have provided new results for the other datasets used in our experiments, i.e., Librispeech, MuST-C, IWSLT, Commonvoice, and Europarl.\n4. We have updated the ASR performance with the latest results, which beats the best results of the end-to-end deep ASR work mentioned earlier.\n5. We add analysis about the number of additional parameters and their effect on the performance.\n6. We have modified the writing style to express our motivation and findings lucidly based on the comments received.\n7. We have updated the related works section to discuss and compare our work with relevant works based on the reviews.\n\nWe updated the paper with these modifications.

The t-sne plots in the paper are drawn for only the three test datasets. However, we used multiple datasets for each of the ASR(Librispeech, Common voice, TEDLIUM, MuSTC-ASR), ST (MuSTC, IWSLT20, Europarl), and MT (WMT19, OpenSubtitles) tasks in the multi-modality experiments. We analyze whether or not our proposed approach is able to separate the data coming from these different distributions. As compared to data coming from different tasks, separating the data coming from the same task(generated from different distributions) is more difficult. Earlier, we observed task-based clustering(Figure 2), where the ASR, ST, and MT tasks were grouped into three main clusters. We found that within these clusters, the tasks have sub-clusters based on the source dataset. Hence, the model is able to identify each sub-task based on the dataset and give decent performances on all of them. For example, the single model achieves a **WER of 7.5 on the Librispeech tst-clean, 10.35 on MuSTC, and 11.65 on the TEDLIUM v3. For the ST task, the same model gives a BLEU score of 28.64 on the MuSTC test set, 27.61 on the IWSLT tst-2010, and 27.57 on the Europarl test set.** This shows that our proposed approach scales well with N.

The \u201cOHV\u201d approach in Table 2 is exactly the same as the T5 approach without the pretraining step. We remove the pre-training for a fair comparison of implicit task information over explicit task information. The main results have been provided in Table 3 with multi-modality experiments where our proposed approach achieves SOTA results on the ST task.\n\n**Number of tasks:**  This is a great question. Since, we use multiple datasets for each task, the actual number of tasks is 10. We evaluated the performance and the learnt task embedding for each sub-task.The model is able to identify each sub-task(based on t-sne plots) based on the dataset and give decent performances on all of them. For example, **the single model achieves a WER of 7.5 on the librispeech tst-clean, 10.35 on MuSTC, and 11.65 on the TEDLIUM v3. For the ST task, the same model gives a BLEU score of 28.64 on the MuSTC test set, 27.61 on the IWSLT tst-2010, and 27.57 on the Europarl test set**.

It proposes task adaptive parameters by modulating model parameters to account for differences in tasks. The authors conduct experiments on speech and machine translation and show reasonable performance.\n\nHonestly, this paper is lacking because this is just too incremental over the T5 model (which can train over 20 tasks without any task specific parameters). It feels quite lacklustre comparing to the many exciting multi-task or transfer learning works out there. The notion of training speech and language adds a little to the paper but I think it is insufficient to feel excited about.\n\nThe results in the paper don't look terribly good either. I'm also perplexed why the performance is even outperformed by the baseline. I also don't think it is really a good idea to reduce T5 to \"OHV\" (one hot vector) and completely remove the pretraining completely. Namely, \"Unlike T5, we don\u2019t initialize the models with the text embeddings from large pretrained language model (Devlin et al., 2018). Instead, we focus on establishing the importance of task information during MTL and having a single model for all the tasks.\" this is way too convenient and unconvincing. I think the authors should compare their model with T5 to have an apples to apples comparison. \n\nI have also concerns about the practicality of modulating parameters and how this would cope over N task when N is large. The number of tasks in this paper is very small (compared to T5) and this is not well ablated in the paper. What about other adapter based approaches like projected attention layers (https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02671) or hypergrid (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05891)? I think it's worth to compare the modulated parameters with other forms of multi-task adaptations of these transformer models. \n\nOverall I recommend rejection. While this is a promising direction, this is poor execution. The proposed novelty of modulated parameters is also insufficient. Results are also not very exciting. \n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3199/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3199/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning without Forgetting: Task Aware Multitask Learning for Multi-Modality Tasks", "authorids": ["~Sathish_Reddy_Indurthi2", "~Mohd_Abbas_Zaidi2", "~Nikhil_Kumar_Lakumarapu1", "bsgunn.lee@samsung.com", "~HyoJung_Han1", "sangha01.kim@samsung.com", "inc.hwang@samsung.com"], "authors": ["Sathish Reddy Indurthi", "Mohd Abbas Zaidi", "Nikhil Kumar Lakumarapu", "Beomseok Lee", "HyoJung Han", "Sangha Kim", "Inchul Hwang"], "keywords": ["Deep Learning", "Joint Learning", "Meta Learning", "Multi-task Learning"], "abstract": "Existing joint learning strategies like multi-task or meta-learning focus more on shared learning and have little to no scope for task-specific learning.

This framework uses a single model with shared representations for learning multiple tasks together. Also, explicit task information may not be always available, in such cases the proposed framework is useful. The proposed framework is evaluated on various datasets spanning multiple modalities, where the MTL model even achieves state-of-the-art results on some datasets. \n\nPros:\n1) The paper is well written and easy to follow. \n\n2) The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on some tasks/datasets. \n\nCons: \n1) Seems like the implicit approach does perform more or less the same as the explicit approach. I believe the explicit approach is not something new and has been tried in various works. In that sense, the implicit approach is not exciting. I agree that the proposed framework would be able to learn task specific information without any explicit supervision, but this use case is not well explored in this paper. Would your approach scale to N (> 5-10) tasks? \n\n2) From Table-2, OHV performs better than explicit TCN. The paper argues that providing OHV text labels is not always possible for tasks involving non-text modalities such as speech and images. But, I think it is possible to learn simple joint space task embeddings presentations for tasks from multiple modalities. \n\n3)  From Table-3, the difference between explicit and implicit TCN methods is small. Statistical significance scores are not provided to know whether the improvements are real. I believe the explicit TCN approach is not something new so it would be better to know if implicit learning is strictly better than explicit.\n\nOverall: \nThe paper is well written and easy to follow with SOTA results. However, I am concerned about the novelty aspect of the proposed framework. It is not clear from the current experiments whether the proposed task-specific representation learning is better than a simple OHV or simple multimodal joint-space task embeddings. \n\nQuestions:\n1) Is implicit TCN better than explicit TCN in Table-3? Can you provide the statistical significance scores?\n\n2) Instead of OHV, can you learn a join space task embedding representation? This paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04558.pdf used special tokens for multilingual translation, can you think of extending to the multi-modal setup with speech and image? If not possible, why?\n\n3)  Would your approach of learning task-specific representation learning scale to more task i.e., > 10 tasks?\n\nOther comments: \n1) It would have been easier to understand the implicit task information section if there is a corresponding pictorial presentation of the approach. \n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3199/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3199/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning without Forgetting: Task Aware Multitask Learning for Multi-Modality Tasks", "authorids": ["~Sathish_Reddy_Indurthi2", "~Mohd_Abbas_Zaidi2", "~Nikhil_Kumar_Lakumarapu1", "bsgunn.lee@samsung.com", "~HyoJung_Han1", "sangha01.kim@samsung.com", "inc.hwang@samsung.com"], "authors": ["Sathish Reddy Indurthi", "Mohd Abbas Zaidi", "Nikhil Kumar Lakumarapu", "Beomseok Lee", "HyoJung Han", "Sangha Kim", "Inchul Hwang"], "keywords": ["Deep Learning", "Joint Learning", "Meta Learning", "Multi-task Learning"], "abstract": "Existing joint learning strategies like multi-task or meta-learning focus more on shared learning and have little to no scope for task-specific learning.

The hope is that more explicit knowledge of task information will improve MTL, especially in cases where the model seems to confuse tasks (as shown in the example of speech translation in Table 1). \n\nPros:\n- This is a timely contribution that addresses an important problem in MTL\n- The proposed method is reasonable and relatively easy to implement: it basically involves adding a network that characterizes the task, and using its outputs to modify the MTL model's parameters. \n\nCons:\n- While the results in Table 2 and Table 3 look promising, the presentation would benefit from more analyses experiments (see below). For example,  investigating whether the number of confused cases in Table 1 actually reduces, comparing whether the added parameters of the task-characterization network requires more data, exploring other ways to modulate the MTL model. Since the method is relatively straightforward, the paper would look stronger if it has more empirical analyses. \n\nAdditional questions and comments: \n- Some claims need to be explained or clarified. For example in introduction the authors write: \"However, providing task information is not straightforward for certain modalities such as speech and image. Also, providing explicit task information might not always be desirable, e.g., automatic multilingual speech recognition task.\" Why is task information not straightforward for speech? I understand it is harder to integrate the discrete label with the speech signal but it has been done before and the reason needs to be spelled out (i.e. don't assume the reader works in ASR.) \n- Can you list out the same examples in Table 1 for the proposed systems? Did they solve the problem of confused tasks? \n- Can you clarify how many new parameters are added for the different task-characterization networks, relative to the full network? It was also be interesting to fix to random weights in the task-characterization networks to see if the results are expected. \n- Please discuss other methods for modulating the weights of the model, besides the one used. I think it's not necessarily to do experiments in those, but mentioning other potential techniques for modulation would make the idea more comprehensive, perhaps suggesting it as future work.

This creates the need for a distinct shared pretraining phase and a task-specific finetuning phase. The fine-tuning phase creates separate systems for each task, where improving the performance of a particular task necessitates forgetting some of the knowledge garnered in other tasks. Humans, on the other hand, perform task-specific learning in synergy with general domain-based learning. Inspired by these learning patterns in humans, we suggest a simple yet generic task aware framework to incorporate into existing joint learning strategies. The proposed framework computes task-specific representations to modulate model parameters during joint learning. Hence, it performs both shared and task-specific learning in a single-phase resulting in a single model for all the tasks. The single model itself achieves significant performance gains over the existing joint learning strategies.  For example, we train a model on Speech Translation (ST), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and Machine Translation (MT) tasks using the proposed task aware joint learning approach. This single model achieves a performance of 28.64 BLEU score on ST MuST-C English-German, WER of 11.61 on ASR TEDLium v3, and BLEU score of 23.35 on MT WMT14 English-German tasks. This sets a new state-of-the-art performance (SOTA) on the ST task while outperforming the existing end-to-end ASR systems with a competitive performance on the MT task.
