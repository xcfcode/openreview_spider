We have updated our paper to include a discussion of other methods that use a multi-stage architecture in section 2.3. To generate the upper noise vector, we generated samples with the noise input to the lower sub-network fixed and then perform kNN search among this pool of samples. Using hierarchical sampling during training improves the results at test time compared to vanilla sampling using the same number of samples, because it functions as if more samples were generated using vanilla sampling at training time, which in the context of IMLE results in improved performance. We tried performing all computation on the GPU, but ran into memory issues with our implementation (which may be an issue specific to our implementation). It\u2019s possible that projection using a random Gaussian matrix could introduce distortions, but we also tried using the original features without projection and observed no significant difference in the results (which can also be explained theoretically by the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma). The low-resolution input is generated by applying Gaussian blur and subsampling. In our experience, LPIPS focuses more on the high-level semantics and less on the low-level details, and so does not correlate well with human judgement in the context of super-resolution. We conducted human evaluation to eliminate possible biases that can be introduced by the choice of evaluation metric. To generate different samples from the same input image for SRGAN, we trained a SRGAN model where we add a second input to the generator containing random noise. We found that even when with random noise as input, SRGAN cannot generate multi-modal results due to mode collapse. As per your suggestion, we have updated the paper to include comparisons to [f][g][h][i] in the appendix and found that our method outperforms these methods in terms of image quality.

To train the sub-networks, we first train the sub-network for the lower input resolution; then we add the second sub-network on top and train both sub-networks jointly. The feature space is pre-trained and fixed in our setting. \n\nAt test time, given a low-resolution input image, we randomly generate one noise input for each sub-network and feed all inputs into the network to get the super-resolved output. The variation exhibited by different samples corresponds to different plausible ways to super-resolve ambiguous regions of the input image. To productionize such a network in real-time systems, we can use established techniques for model compression and binarization. Our approach is as easy to productionize as GAN-based methods because the sampling procedure for our method and GAN are the same at test time (only the training algorithm differs). Multi-modality could be a problem in this case because it is important in various applications to have control over which mode we want to output; for example, if we\u2019d like to super-resolve all frames in a video, we need to make sure the same mode is selected consistently across all frames, so that the blurry regions are super-resolved in the same way in all frames. To choose one specific mode in a conscious way, we can simply choose a noise input that results in a super-resolved image that we prefer and use this (fixed) noise input for all low-resolution input images. \n\nIn our paper, we focused on a more challenging setting than that is typically considered in the literature, where the input image is of a relatively low resolution (64x64). We chose this setting because most existing methods already perform very well when the input is of a higher resolution, and so the differences between different methods are easier to discern under a more challenging lower-resolution setting. Because the limitations of SRGAN are more perceptible under this setting, SRGAN does not outperform bicubic interpolation by a large margin; however, SRIM does outperform it by a fairly large margin.

We note that the existing datasets commonly used in the super-resolution literature for evaluation are quite small (they typically contain <=100 images), whereas ImageNet is a lot bigger and can provide more reliable results. Common super-resolution testing datasets are also typically used in a high-resolution setting (i.e. fairly high-resolution inputs are fed into the super-resolution algorithm), whereas our experiments are conducted with 64x64 inputs, which can contain 3-6x fewer pixels than the inputs that are used with common datasets. Because the typical inputs are at higher resolutions, the typical setting is easier and so differences between different methods are harder to discern, which is why we performed evaluation under a more challenging setting. However, as per your request, we have updated our paper to include a comparison of our method to SRGAN on the commonly used dataset of Set14 in the appendix and found that both methods perform comparably, but note that this comparison is less informative because all methods perform well on Set14. We have also updated our paper to include comparisons to more recent methods in the appendix, including EnhanceNet, SFT network, EDSR network and RDN. We found that our method outperforms these methods in terms of image quality.

Paper is mostly clearly written and except for some sections, it provides enough details. The work is original enough but might need some improvement or more explanation in experiments/result section.\n\nPros:\n-The idea seems to be original enough, simple and easy to implement.\n-A nice follow-up of the recent work in NN search and Implicit maximum likelihood estimation. \n-Many details that could be helpful for further research in the area are given.\n\nCons:\n-Regarding methodology, an unclear point in the paper is how different networks trained according to algorithm 1. Is each sub-network trained separately? Is the visual perception based feature space pre-trained and fixed, or is it jointly retrained with the super-resolution network? \n\n-Another critical point is post-training, particularly the way learned parameters are used could be explained better: Given a super-resolution model f, how the super-resolution of a single image is performed? What is the sampling variation? How likely such a network can be productionized in real-time systems (e.g., digital displays or embedded systems)? How does the proposed approach compared to GAN based methods with regards to that? Is multi-modality a problem in this case? Any way to choose one specific mode in a conscious way?\n\n-My main concern about the paper is the results section: Authors perform both large-scale offline comparison (imagenet) and a small subset human evaluation. The results in human evaluation need some explanation. This comparison is identical to several previous 1-1 comparisons performed in literature and almost every single such comparison it has been found that state of the art techniques (e.g., 10+ years of super-resolution algorithms) significantly outperform bicubic interpolation. However, Table 2 in the paper suggests that both SRGAN and SRIM barely beats bicubic interpolation. For example, authors in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.5019.pdf showed that a relatively older supervised technique beat bicubic 90% of the time. There seems to be some explanation needed here: Is it the sample size?

Leading methods like SRGAN produce images that contain various artifacts, such as high-frequency noise, hallucinated colours and shape distortions, which adversely affect the realism of the result. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach based on an extension of the method of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE). We demonstrate greater effectiveness at noise reduction and preservation of the original colours and shapes, yielding more realistic super-resolved images.
