The key idea is that given an optimal family of student models, any model sampled from this family is expected to perform well when trained using knowledge distillation. Overall this is an interesting idea and an important direction of research. However, the reviewers raised several concerns regarding novelty and experimental evaluation. There was a clear consensus among the reviewers that the paper is not yet ready for publication. The specific reasons for rejection include the following: (i) the proposed method is somewhat incremental, and the paper's contributions should be adjusted accordingly; (ii) the experimental results in the paper do not provide a clear/fair comparison with existing approaches, and additional baselines should be considered. The reviewers have provided detailed feedback in their reviews, and we hope that the authors can incorporate this feedback when preparing future revisions of the paper."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Don't be picky, all students in the right family can learn from good teachers", "authorids": ["~Roy_Henha_Eyono1", "~Fabio_Maria_Carlucci2", "~Pedro_M_Esperan\u00e7a1", "~Binxin_Ru1", "~Philip_Torr1"], "authors": ["Roy Henha Eyono", "Fabio Maria Carlucci", "Pedro M Esperan\u00e7a", "Binxin Ru", "Philip Torr"], "keywords": ["knowledge distillation", "neural architecture search", "nas", "automl", "knowledge trasfer", "model compression"], "abstract": "State-of-the-art results in deep learning have been improving steadily, in good part due to the use of larger models.

As such, no comparison is possible. The authors' approach of using KD to improve NAS is also conceptually different from our approach where NAS is used to improve KD. \n(b) Liu et al (2019b) is the work most similar to ours and we are currently running experiments on ImageNet to directly compare with them. Nevertheless, we are 33x more sample efficient, which is a non-trivial improvement.\n\n**\"The title shows the fact that the macro-structure of a network is more important than its micro-structure, which has been studied in previous work. But this fact doesn\u2019t logically lead to idea of \u2018searching for a family\u2019. Also, I think it isn\u2019t clearly articulated that how this family of student architectures can benefit knowledge distillation\".**\nWe agree that searching for a family/distribution rather than a specific architecture is not the only possibility to solve those issues, but it is a natural way in that direction, and has been shown to be successful. Specifically, searching for a family instead of a single architecture allows our method to be be extremely efficient compared to traditional NAS approaches.\nSee also the reply to your comment about 'ensembles'.\n\n**\"Maybe the performance gains result from the ensemble of networks\".**\nOur method does not use ensembles of networks. By optimizing the generator, we find the best family of architectures (networks that share similar characteristics according to the generator parameters). Samples from this family are then evaluated. We report the average accuracy of the optimal family, as there is natural variability. This is the average of the accuracies, not of the predictions (as would be in ensembles).\n\n**\"it doesn't make much sense to have the comparisons showed in Figure 7\".**\nThe reviewer does not explain the reasons for this comment, but we agree that Fig.7 was not absolutely clear and would like to clarify it. We have relabeled the (blue, orange, green) points from (Teacher, AutoKD, Student) to (Large SOTA Model, AutoKD-Student, NAS), which is a more accurate description of the 3 networks shown. 'NAS' does not use KD.\n\nThe empirical support for the benefits of AutoKD, given in Fig.7, are as follows: (1) compared to standard NAS (green), AutoKD (orange) shows the benefit of training the best student network with knowledge distillation from a fixed teacher network (blue), while maintaining the same memory complexity; (2) compared to a fixed teacher network (blue),  AutoKD (orange) is able to be compressed to achieve a lower memory-complexity with negligible loss in accuracy. The green and orange points, share the same memory complexity by design, as they use the same architecture. \nThese details will be added to the Figure for the final version.\n\n**Regarding the [Detailed comments].**\nThank you for this feedback, we are currently improving the paper.\n\n**Regarding comparison with other KD+NAS methods.**\nPlease see our \"GENERAL COMMENT\" reply."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3272/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3272/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Don't be picky, all students in the right family can learn from good teachers", "authorids": ["~Roy_Henha_Eyono1", "~Fabio_Maria_Carlucci2", "~Pedro_M_Esperan\u00e7a1", "~Binxin_Ru1", "~Philip_Torr1"], "authors": ["Roy Henha Eyono", "Fabio Maria Carlucci", "Pedro M Esperan\u00e7a", "Binxin Ru", "Philip Torr"], "keywords": ["knowledge distillation", "neural architecture search", "nas", "automl", "knowledge trasfer", "model compression"], "abstract": "State-of-the-art results in deep learning have been improving steadily, in good part due to the use of larger models.

It seems we failed to communicate clearly and as a consequence a number of misconceptions arose. We would like to clarify those with this reply.\n\n======  GOAL AND MERITS\n\nOur goal is to transfer the knowledge from powerful SOTA networks to much smaller models for real life deployment. KD offers a solution, but its performance can be constrained by the architecture of the student. We thus propose to optimize the student architecture via NAS. \nNAS solutions not based on generators have proved to be extremely costly as they spend huge computational resources comparing similar architectures (see Yang et al, 2020). \nIn contrast, we argue that once a good enough distribution (family) of architectures is found, any of them will perform well (see Ru et al, 2020). \nThis distinction enables us to be 33x more sample efficient, reducing the practical cost from 5 days on 200 TPUs (Liu et al, 2019b) to less than 3 days on 8 GPUs - thus making the technology much more widely usable.\nWe are not the first to investigate the combination of KD and NAS, but we are the first proposing a practical approach for doing so.\n\n======  RESULT COMPARISONS\n\nSince our goal is to transfer knowledge from a large model with state-of-the-art performance to a smaller student, we require that the teacher outperforms the student. \nAs NAGO architectures, used as students, are a strong baseline, we needed to select a stronger teacher in order to make sure there was room for an improvement.

This reformulation of the NAS problem makes it possible to search in an expressive searching space, at the same time, avoid to waste time in comparing similar architectures.\n\nStrengths\n  This KD-NAS approach further develops the benefit of NAGO and makes it convenient to search for a family of student architectures. The optimization objective of finding a family instead of a single architecture helps to speed up NAS process or more sample efficient.\n\nWeaknesses\n  There have already exist KD-NAS approaches and the main difference of this work is to search for a family. This objective mainly takes advantage of the generator in NAGO, so the contribution and novelty should be reduced accordingly.\n  The purpose of some experiments in this paper is a little confusing. From my point of view, this paper aims to utilize NAS to benefit KD, at the same time, make NAS more efficient. Maybe you should compare AutoKD with earlier KD-NAS approaches instead of NAGO to show the impact of KD on NAS.\n  The title shows the fact that the macro-structure of a network is more important than its micro-structure, which has been studied in previous work. But this fact doesn\u2019t logically lead to idea of \u2018searching for a family\u2019. Also, I think it isn\u2019t clearly articulated that how this family of student architectures can benefit knowledge distillation. Maybe the performance gains result from the ensemble of networks.\n  Finally, I think it doesn't make much sense to have the comparisons showed in Figure 7. Besides, the logic and results shown in the visualization of Figure 6 are not clear enough to me.\n\n\n[ Detailed comments]\n1.

However, this paper reports CRD used ShuffleNetV1 which have more parameters \n  - On MIT67 dataset, VID used an ImageNet-pretrained model for transfer learning, but AutoKD used the fine-tuned teacher which is much beneficial to KD in terms of performance.\n  - On CIFAR10 dataset, the compared models (WRN 16-1 and two WRN 40-2s) have fewer parameters than that of NAGO for AutoKD. Therefore, it is hard to say that AutoKD outperforms them.\n- Experimental results are somewhat unconvincing:\n   - As weight is zero in Figure 2, the accuracies in the table should show consistent performance but are deviated w.r.t temperature.

The authors claim that by learning the parameters of the generator instead of relying directly on the search space, it is possible to explore the search space of architectures more effectively, increasing the diversity of the architectures explored. They show that this approach combined with the standard knowledge distillation loss is able to learn good student architectures requiring substantially less samples and achieving competitive performances when comparing to other knowledge distillation algorithms.\n\nPros:\n+ The paper is clear overall. A system for combining knowledge distillation and architecture search is proposed that combines surrogate functions, multi-fidelity optimization, and neural architecture generators.\n+ The results on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 are compelling.\n\nCons:\n\n- Somewhat limited conceptual innovation. The authors combine NAGO and BOHB to obtain a solution for architecture search for knowledge distillation. While the results are solid, there is little insight about the behavior of the method, e.g., no ablations are performed beyond the comparison with NAGO, so it is hard to assess the importance of the individual components. \n- No results on ImageNet.\n- The results are compared with models that use other teacher architectures, so it is hard to determine if the improvements are due to an improved teacher or a better knowledge distillation method. The fact that both student architecture size and student accuracy are important metrics means that there is no easy way \n- No code is included, but I assume that this is something that the authors will address for the final version.\n- The use of BOHB and the surrogate loss are insufficiently described, for example, in Algorithm 1.\n- The claim that a standard neural architecture search would produce architectures sampled from the same distributions and therefore not be efficient in exploring the space of students is insufficiently explored.\n\nComments: \n\nIn essence, this paper only corresponds to a difference in how the architectures for knowledge distillation are generated. The claim that not going through the architecture generator would lead to architectures that are too similar lacks substantiation. Additionally, the paper does not have information about comparisons with other architecture search algorithms for knowledge distillation or surrogate functions, therefore the introduction of a new framework may not be warranted under the claims of the authors. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3272/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3272/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Don't be picky, all students in the right family can learn from good teachers", "authorids": ["~Roy_Henha_Eyono1", "~Fabio_Maria_Carlucci2", "~Pedro_M_Esperan\u00e7a1", "~Binxin_Ru1", "~Philip_Torr1"], "authors": ["Roy Henha Eyono", "Fabio Maria Carlucci", "Pedro M Esperan\u00e7a", "Binxin Ru", "Philip Torr"], "keywords": ["knowledge distillation", "neural architecture search", "nas", "automl", "knowledge trasfer", "model compression"], "abstract": "State-of-the-art results in deep learning have been improving steadily, in good part due to the use of larger models.
