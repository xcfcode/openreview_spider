The authors introduce marginal advantage functions and use them for the estimation of the counterfactual advantage function. These functions permit to decompose the Multi-Agent Policy Optimization Problem in Single Agent Policy Optimization subproblems, which are solved using TRPO.\n\n\nStrengths\n\nThe paper proposes elegant derivations to deal with the multi-agent policy optimization problem.  The marginal advantage function gives the possibility to solve the credit assignment problem. Instead, the synchronous advantage estimation assumes that the current policy is close to the previous one. To rely on this approximation, the authors propose to add KL constraints to the optimization problem, which lead to derivations similar to TRPO. \nThe approach is interesting and the experimental results confirm that the method performs better than COMA.\n\n\n\nWeakness\n\nThe paper is only experimental and gives no theoretical guarantees. \nIn the results of the experiments, it seems that QMIX has excellent performance, sometimes better than the proposed method, but in the Experimental Results, there are no comments on this fact. Could you give some insight into why QMIX, in some cases, performs better than the proposed method?\nIs it possible to perform an ablation study on the clipping parameter? It seems the most relevant hyperparameter of the proposed method since it regularized the assumption of using the past policy as the current one.\n\n\nMinor:\n- figure 6 reorgnized $\\rightarrow$ reorganized\n- missing space in second line under equation 9\n\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2431/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2431/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-agent Policy Optimization with Approximatively Synchronous Advantage Estimation", "authorids": ["~Lipeng_Wan1", "songxw17@stu.xjtu.edu.cn", "~Xuguang_Lan2", "~Nanning_Zheng1"], "authors": ["Lipeng Wan", "Xuwei Song", "Xuguang Lan", "Nanning Zheng"], "keywords": ["multi-agent reinforcement learning", "policy optimization", "advantage estimation", "credit assignment"], "abstract": "Cooperative multi-agent tasks require agents to deduce their own contributions with shared global rewards, known as the challenge of credit assignment.

", "review": "This works follows the footsteps of other centralized value function approaches for multi-agent learning, building directly on the counterfactual value function proposed in COMA. \n\nThe main idea is to sample additional joint actions to variance-reduce the advantage estimate for each of the agents at each time step.\nThe paper also introduces a KL penalty that is supposed to ensure that the policies are updated slowly, making the advantage estimate more accurate. \n\nA few comments:\n1) \", we consider using centralized critic to predict joint Q values, and the marginal advantages can be directly calculated with these Q values, which avoids interactive simulation.\". This directly contradicts Figure 2, where it is mentioned that \"one step simulations are executed\" for each of the samples. This point is relevant since extra simulation steps would drastically change the sample requirements for the method. Furthermore, this assumes that there is a simulator that can be set to arbitrary state transitions, which is different from the standard RL assumption. \n2) \"which means the counter-factual advantage in equation(5) can be replaced by any form of advantage function used in SARL.\". This is generally true. How to estimate the advantage is orthogonal to single agent vs multi-agent learning. In particular, the COMA critic (Q-function) could easily be replaced with a GAE or similar. On a related note, while using a critic that depends only on the Q(s,u) (ie. the central state and joint action) is common practice in this line of work, it is not generally appropriate. Clearly, in Dec-POMDPs, the future actions will depend on the action-observation histories (AOHs), $\\tau$ of all the agents. As a consequence, in general the critic should condition on these AOHs.\n3) \"And in addition, the last actions of ally units are accessable for all agents.\" This is different form the standard SMAC setting, where only the last actions of the *visible* agents are observable by each of the agents. Please clarify this rationale.\n4) Please specify what advantage estimation is being used in this paper. My understanding is that the paper uses the joint-Q function similar to the COMA paper. Is this accurate? \n5) Overall the results look competitive, but are currently not very informative due to missing ablations. It's impossible to tell if the PPO-like KL penalty or the multi-sample variance reduction are responsible for the improved performance. \n6) The training curves look very odd. In particular, they look unstable but have very narrow errorbars, indicating that many of the runs drop at the same time. This suggests that the experiments may have accidentally reused the same random seed.  \n7) MMM2 is the only \"superhard\" scenario used from SMAC.

However, I found the manuscript hard to follow and experimental proof unconvincing.\n\n- Clarify issues: It seems that the authors end up with a multi-agent variation of TRPO in Eq 16. They seem to basically assume that agent policies are independent, so they can rewrite the advantage A(s, u^a) of agent a as marginalization of A(s, u^joint) over the actions/policies of the other agents. From this, they then apply TRPO to each agent individually, using the most conservative trust region radius among the N agents.

The authors claim the former alleviates the credit-assignment problem, while the later reduces bias in the approximation of the advantage function due to assuming other agents' policies stationary. \nNumerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm match or outperforms some state of the art baselines.\n\nStrong points:\nThe marginal advantage estimator is derived in two different ways---first and last line of (5)---, and both make intuitive sense. This estimator seems a natural extension of the counter-factual advantage estimator due to Foerster et al. (2018). \n\nThe connection with trust-region methods to reduce bias is also interesting, I personally tend to think on trust-region constraints as a method to reduce variance in the parameter update (due to stochastic gradient), while here it is motivated to reduce bias. It is also practical, since it can be easily implemented by using PPO for every agent.\n\nSimulation results show that the proposed improvements perform well in practice.\n\nWeak points:\nThe writing requires much improvement in order to be publishable. Notation is unclear if not loose and sometimes incomplete (e.g,, indexes in summations and unions are difficult to follow, policy parameter is never introduced, exponent instead of Cartesian product on the observation and action sets wasn't obvious...) There are multiple typos (mainly in text but also some in maths). The draft must be proof-read for English style and grammar issues. This is the main reason for my rejection. \n\nMany experimental details are missing hindering reproducibility.\n\nThe draft is 9 pages long. But the paper format could be much improved such that it fits in 8 pages, so I haven't considered this a deal breaker. \n\nQuestions:\n1. Why in the centralised-learning decentralised-execution are the agents' policies independent of each other?\n2. The concept of the counter-factual scene is not clear. Are the authors assuming the agents behave stationarily? Hence, the trust-region constraint bounds the relaxation on this assumption?\n3. First line in Sec. 5 says \"we use COMA advantage as counter-factual advantage to estimate the approximately synchronous advantage.\" What does it mean? Don't the authors use the marginal advantage?\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2431/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2431/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-agent Policy Optimization with Approximatively Synchronous Advantage Estimation", "authorids": ["~Lipeng_Wan1", "songxw17@stu.xjtu.edu.cn", "~Xuguang_Lan2", "~Nanning_Zheng1"], "authors": ["Lipeng Wan", "Xuwei Song", "Xuguang Lan", "Nanning Zheng"], "keywords": ["multi-agent reinforcement learning", "policy optimization", "advantage estimation", "credit assignment"], "abstract": "Cooperative multi-agent tasks require agents to deduce their own contributions with shared global rewards, known as the challenge of credit assignment. General methods for policy based multi-agent reinforcement learning to solve the challenge introduce differentiate value functions or advantage functions for individual agents. In multi-agent system, polices of different agents need to be evaluated jointly. In order to update polices synchronously, such value functions or advantage functions also need synchronous evaluation. However, in current methods, value functions or advantage functions use counter-factual joint actions which are evaluated asynchronously, thus suffer from natural estimation bias. In this work, we propose the approximatively synchronous advantage estimation. We first derive the marginal advantage function, an expansion from single-agent advantage function to multi-agent system. Further more, we introduce a policy approximation for synchronous advantage estimation, and break down the multi-agent policy optimization problem into multiple sub-problems of single-agent policy optimization.
