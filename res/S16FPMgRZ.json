This is promising as it enables the implementation of complex deep learning algorithms on mobile devices due to its huge space saving performance.  Overall, this paper is easy to follow. \n\nCons: \n\nQ1: Can the authors discuss the computational time of the proposed tensor regression layers and compare it to that of the baseline CNN? The tensor regression layer is computationally more expensive than the flattening operations in original CNN. Usually, it also involves expensive model selection procedure to choose the tuning parameters (N+1 ranks and a L2 norm sparsity parameter). In the experiments, the authors simply tried a few ranks without serious tuning. \n\nQ2: The authors reported the space saving in Table 1 but not in Table 2. Since spacing saving is a major contribution of the proposed method, can authors add the space saving percentage in Table 2?\n\nQ3: There are a few typos in the current paper. I would suggest the authors to take a careful proofreading. For example,\n\n(1) In the \u201cRelated work\u201c paragraph on page 2, \u201cLebedev et al.

However, in expression (8) on page 5, $\\tilde{\\cal G}$ is of dimension $(R_0, R_1, \\ldots, R_N, R_{N+1})$.\n\n(5) Use \\cite{} and \\citep{} correctly. For example, in the \u201cRelated work\u201c paragraph on page 2,\n\n\u201cSeveral prior papers address the power of tensor regression to preserve natural multi-modal structure and learn compact predictive models Guo et al.

This is done by performing CP decomposition on the convolution kernel before fine-tuning the whole network.\n\nThese papers only focus on decomposing the weight tensors. By contrast, we propose to preserve the multi-linear structure of the activation throughout the network. In particular TCL focuses on contraction activation tensors. Additionally, those works focus on the convolutional kernels, where the number of parameters is already quite small, while our work is focused on eliminating the standard flattening and fully-connected layers\n\nNote that in the TCL, we do not assume a Tucker form of the activation tensors but rather apply tensor contraction to them to reduce their dimensionality. Similarly, TRL is a new layer that does not simply consist in assuming a Tucker form of the regression weight but directly maps an input tensor to an output tensor using low-rank regression tensor weights. It can be used to replace the flattening and fully-connected layers in traditional network architectures.\n\nOur contribution is the introduction of these two novel layers, trainable end-to-end using gradient backpropagation. Being able to these train end-to-end is crucial to be able to learn the whole network jointly (most existing tensor methods are solved analytically, and existing work on deep learning and tensor decomposition focuses mainly on pre-training a network, applying some sort of decomposition to the weights and fine-tuning. By training end-to-end we learn the whole network jointly).\n\nWe compare with a competitive, state-of-the-art architecture, (ResNet) and show that performance is maintained while showing large space savings. Note that there has been no such attempt in the past to compare with. As we mention in the related work, Novikov et. al. (2015) retain the flattening and fully connected layers for the output while we present an end-to-end tensorized architecture. They obtain space savings by applying tensor decomposition to the weights of some of the fully-connected layers, reshaped as tensors (which also means selecting both the size of the tensor to reshape to, in addition to the rank of the decomposition).\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Tensor Contraction & Regression Networks", "abstract": "Convolution neural networks typically consist of many convolutional layers followed by several fully-connected layers.

While convolutional layers map between high-order activation tensors, the fully-connected layers operate on flattened activation vectors.  Despite its success, this approach has notable drawbacks. Flattening discards the multi-dimensional structure of the activations, and the fully-connected layers require a large number of parameters. \nWe present two new techniques to address these problems.  First, we introduce tensor contraction layers which can replace the ordinary fully-connected layers in a neural network. Second, we introduce tensor regression layers, which express the output of a neural network as a low-rank multi-linear mapping from a high-order activation tensor to the softmax layer.  Both the contraction and regression weights are learned end-to-end by backpropagation. By imposing low rank on both, we use significantly fewer parameters.
