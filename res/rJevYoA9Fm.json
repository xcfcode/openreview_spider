While singular values of convolutional layers represent sufficient interest for researchers, huge computational complexity made it difficult to investigate their properties in the case of layers of deep neural networks. Using the fact that operator matrix of the convolutional layer has a special form (i.e. can be represented as block-matrix, which blocks are doubly block circulant matrices) the authors proposed a more efficient method of computation of singular values. I really enjoyed reading this paper and I think that it opens a lot of interesting applications. As one of the possible applications the authors proposed a regularization method based on bounding of singular values.\n\nThe paper from my point of view has two main drawbacks:\n\n1.  Diversity of experiments. While the paper has strong theoretical component, the part dedicated to experiments is not broad enough. It would be interesting to see regularization on other architectures and other datasets.\n\n2.The system of references. I would recommend to add not only references to the sources, but also to the theorem numbers or the chapters. For example, I would recommend to replace \u2018Poposition 9 ((Lefkimmiatis et al., 2013))\u2019 with \u2018Poposition 9 ((Lefkimmiatis et al., 2013, Proposition 1))\u2019.

We have shown that its singular values, including its largest, are different from those of any reshaping of K.  \n\nHowever based on your suggestion we conducted a few experiments on the CIFAR10 dataset, with somewhat surprising results: \n(1) We clipped the singular values of the reshaped K every 100 steps. We tried various constants for the clipped value, and found that the best accuracy we achieved was the same as the accuracy we achieved by clipping A.  \n(2) We clipped the singular values of K to these same values every step, and found that the best accuracy achieved was slightly worse than the accuracy achieved in step 1. So clipping after every step is not very useful. We observed similar behavior when we clipped A after every step. \n(3) Most surprisingly, we found that clipping A on a GPU was about 25% faster than clipping K --- on the same machine, 10000 batches of CIFAR10 took 14490 s when we clipped K, whereas they took 11004 s when we clipped A! One possible explanation is parallelization --- clipping K takes O(m^3 k^2) flops, whereas clipping A does m^2 FFT\u2019s, followed by n^2 m x m SVDs, which takes O(m^3 n^2) flops, but these can be parallelized and completed in as little as O(n^2 log n + m^3) time.\n\nClearly this is only one dataset, and the results may not generalize to other sets.

The convolution performed here is a standard circular convolution. Such an operation can be represented as:\n\nz = X * y\n\nwhere X is a circulant matrix of the filter x. The authors of this paper are directly studying the singular values of this well structured matrix of the filter x. Of course in the setting where X is the underlying matrix that is equivalent to performing a convolutional layer but that is irrelevant in the context of my question.\n\nOn the other hand, the same operation can be performed as\n\nz = Y *x\n\nwhere Y, the input signal, has the circulant structure instead of the filters.\n\nReviewer 2 is arguing that the singular values of interests for vanishing gradients etc, are the singular values of the vector x. That is the singular values of the filter coming from the reshape without introducing any structure. According to this, there is a single singular value since x is a vector.\n\nHowever, in the authors perspective the singular values of interest are the ones from the first example. That is the singular values of the structured matrix X which in this case will yield n singular values as opposed to a single singular value.\n\nIs this the fundamental argument of reviewer 2? \n\nIf yes, then this brings a contradiction. This is because if we handle the argument from operator perspective. For a linear operators T:V > V on an n dimensional finite vector space, x is an eigenvector of T if there exsits a \\lambda such that T(x) = \\lambda * x.\n\nNow, consider the case where the linear operator, T, can have the basis representation of a filter of all ones. Applying this on a signal x of all ones we get, T(x) = n * x. That means, we know that for such a filter n has to be an eigenvalue of the operator T.\n\nNow, following the authors approach, that is z = T(x) = F * x. The eigen values of F which is the matrix representation of T under appropriate basis will be indeed n. This is since F is a circulant matrix of all ones and the eigenvalues are a single n and (n-1) zero eigenvalues. However, according the reviewer, the eigen values of interest are the eigen values of f where T(x) = X * f.  However, the SVD of f (where f is a vector of ones) does not have a singular value of n in general. You can take several counter examples.\n\nThus, according the definition of eigen decomposition on linear operators on finite dimensional space, the singular values of the structured matrix are the correct singular values of interest. More precisely, the singular values computed in this paper are indeed the singular values of the linear operator described as CNN convolution. I would love to hear back R2's comments and thoughts.\n\nMoreover, may the authors comment more clearly and cite the reference of this claim?\n\n\"It can be proved that if a kernel of size (k, k, m, m) is applied to an input of size (n, n, m), and the entries of the kernel are chosen from a continuous probability distribution like a Gaussian, then with probability 1, the number of distinct singular values in the linear transformation of its convolutional layer is at least (m n^2)/2.\"\n\nAs determining the correct number of singular values for a generic linear map (without matrix representation), i.e. without introducing a basis, will support their claims further.", "title": "The simple circular 1D convolution"}, "signatures": ["(anonymous)"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["(anonymous)", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Singular Values of Convolutional Layers", "abstract": "We characterize the singular values of the linear transformation associated with a standard 2D multi-channel convolutional layer, enabling their efficient computation.

I understand that the linear function studied in this paper is a linear map from n^2m to n^2m, characterized by the matrix A in the paper, and I also understand that the paper proposes to compute the singular values of this matrix A. This is interesting byitself. However, as I described in my last several threads, it is misleading and confusing to call the singular values of this matrix A \"the singular values of the convolution layer\". The actual linear map computed by a convolution layer is the one obtained by reshaping it to a 2D matrix, and it is the singular values of this matrix that have something to do with gradient vanishing or explosion because the gradient computed by the backpropagation is w.r.t. this 2D matrix (reshaped from the original 4D tensor), NOT the one (the matrix A in this paper) studied in this paper. It is not clear to me why people may be interested in computing the singular values of this redundant matrix A. Furthermore, the complexity of computing the singular values of matrix A is much worse (O(m^3n^2) >> O(m^3k^2)) than that of computing the true singular values of the actual linear map.

However it is clear that still quite a few misunderstandings of our work remain.  A convolutional layer applied to an n x n feature map with m input channels and m output channels is a function with n^2 m inputs and n^2 m outputs.  This function is linear.  The standard encoding of a linear function as a matrix has n^2 m rows and n^2 m columns.  The singular values of a linear function are defined to be the singular values of this matrix.  Computing these singular values is the subject of this paper.  The matrix and its singular values are a property of the function computed by the layer, no matter how it is implemented. Due to the special nature of the linear transform induced by the convolution layer, the matrix does indeed have lots of redundancy; we exploit this in computing the singular values efficiently (see Equations (1) and (6)).  We have proved that our method provides the correct singular values, and further verified this with unit tests.  We have also proved, in our first response to your review, that no reshaping of the kernel tensor can possibly provide the correct singular values.  We are therefore not surprised that our method gives different answers than a reshaping of the kernel tensor.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper453/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper453/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper453/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Singular Values of Convolutional Layers", "abstract": "We characterize the singular values of the linear transformation associated with a standard 2D multi-channel convolutional layer, enabling their efficient computation.

This is an important problem with abundant applications on regularizing deep neural networks. However, there are several technical issues need to be addressed in its current form. \n\nFirst, in the section \"Summary of Results\", at first read of the paper I found it very confusing why the time complexity of computing the spectrum is a function of n, where n is the size of the input feature map. Intuitively, since the size of the convolutional kernel is m x m x k x k, it is expected that the time complexity is expressed as a function of (m, k). Later I realized that this is due to the unnecessary and redundant 0 padding in section 2.1 that leads to this artifact. I understand that in order to apply the described Fourier transform technique it is necessary to introduce the large nxn filter, which is of the same size as the input, but it also introduces redundant computation. This fact further emerges in the introduction of matrix A in Eq (1). \n\nMore importantly, I think the authors didn't perform a detailed analysis on using the basic definition of convolutional filter to compute its spectrum, and this is the reason why they reached a misleading conclusion that simple SVD takes O(n^6 m^3) time. Specifically, each convolution operation corresponds to a inner product operation, so we can reshape the input 3D tensor with shape m x n x n into a 2D matrix, with shape n^2 x mk^2, denoted as X. Note that this creates a unnecessary redundancy in the input feature map, but it does not create redundant weight for the convolutional kernel. As a comparison, the introduced matrix A in the paper is heavily redundant. Similarly, for m channels, we can reshape the 4D convolutional kernel with shape m x m x k x k into a 2D matrix, with shape mk^2 x m, denoted as K. Then the usual convolution layer can be described as the following linear system: Y = X K, where Y with shape n^2 x m is the output, and can be easily reshaped into size m x n x n. Hence to compute the spectrum of the convolution layer corresponds to computing the singular values of the 2D matrix K with size mk^2 x m. Hence a naive application of SVD directly gives us the solution in time O(m^3 k^2) (Note that the time complexity of SVD for matrix with size a x b is O(min{a^2 b, a b^2})), which is much smaller than the one given in the paper O(m^3 n^2) since k << n. \n\nIn experiment the authors made unfair comparison between their proposed method and the full matrix method: the full matrix A is fully redundant, due to its circulant pattern. As this implies a highly redundant information, nobody will form and compute matrix A explicitly in practice. So the time improvements demonstrated in the experiment section are meaningless. A valid baseline would be to compare the proposed method with the one introduced above. But in this case I would imagine the proposed method to be worse due to its unnecessary 0 padding leading to the worst time complexity.

If my understanding is correct, then basically what being done here is to vectorize both the input and output 3D tensors and then treat them as two fully-connected layers. So the linear map computed in the paper corresponds to the fully connected matrix here, which also explains why there is an input size n in the time complexity of the proposed method. \n\nBut this is not the actual linear map happened in CNNs, as the same convolutional kernel is being applied repeatedly, i.e., the weights are tied. Perhaps what's more problematic is that, although the huge matrix A has the circulant pattern (actually this is not true in practice as well, because the circulant pattern is due to the assumption of wrapping around), when computing the singular values of A, different blocks are treated as independent, but in fact those weights are being tied. In other words, when computing the gradient of this kernel, using this method (by vectorzing both 3D tensors into vectors and compute the gradient of the huge matrix A) will lead to the wrong gradient. The correct one is to re-add different blocks of the gradient w.r.t. A according to the circulant pattern. \n\nIntuitively, what I am saying is that in CNNs the linear map is unique, and the redundancy comes from the overlapping patches in the input 3D tensor, while what the proposed method computes is the other way around. \n\nI implemented the proposed method and compared it with the one I gave above, and the results confirm my analysis: \n\ndef SingularValues(kernel, input_shape):\n    transform_coefficients = np.fft.fft2(kernel, input_shape, axes=[0, 1])\n    return np.linalg.svd(transform_coefficients, compute_uv=False)\n\n\ndef Reshaped(kernel):\n    matrix = np.reshape(kernel, (-1, kernel.shape[-1]))\n    return np.linalg.svd(matrix, compute_uv=False)\n\n\ndef check(m, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    m = # chanels\n    k = # kernel sizes\n    \"\"\"\n    # input shape\n    n = 28\n    kernel = np.random.rand(k, k, m, m)\n    start_time = time.time()\n    svs = SingularValues(kernel, (n, n))\n    end_time = time.time()\n    print(\"Time used by the proposed method: {} seconds\".format(end_time - start_time))\n    start_time = time.time()\n    mines = Reshaped(kernel)\n    end_time = time.time()\n    print(\"Time used by the reshaping method: {} seconds\".format(end_time - start_time))\n    print(\"Shape = {}, Singular Values returned by the proposed method: {}\".format(svs.shape, svs))\n    print(\"Shape = {}, Singular Values computed by reshaping: {}\".format(mines.shape, mines))\n\n\ncheck(64, 5)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe singular values computed by these two different methods are different, and the proposed method takes around 0.4 second to finish while the reshaping one takes 0.02.

It seems that the confusion comes from the definition of the linear map and its singular values induced by the convolutional kernel. Let me ask the problem in the following way: what is the actual linear function that being applied to the input tensor in CNNs? Given a 4D convolutional tensor with shape (k, k, m, m), for each fixed slice in the 4th dimension, the linear map is defined by the 3D tensor from the first 3 dimensions, as it is this 3D tensor that is being taken inner product repeatedly with each part of the input 3D tensor. Hence the reshape given in my first comment exactly reflect this fact. \n\nPut it in another way, the inner product between two matrices of same dimension A, B is defined as Tr(A^TB), but this defines the same Euclidean geometry by saying that Tr(A^T B) = <vec(A), vec(B)>. In the case of CNN we are dealing with 4D tensors, but the actual linear map is of shape mk^2 x m, as the first three dimensions of each slice in the 4th dimension are used to define the linear map. \n\nThe argument of sampling kernel weights from a continuous distribution is irrelevant.

In that response, we demonstrate that there is no reshaping of the kernel tensor whose singular values coincide with the singular values of its linear transform.\n\nIn the case of convolutional layers, the paper by Tsuzuku, et al estimates the largest singular value to within a constant factor (see Corollary 1), whereas we characterize the exact values of all of its singular values.  \n\nThe paper by Scaman and Virmaux uses a power method for individual layers. In the form they describe, it only gives the largest singular value.  We compared our work with the paper by Gouk, et al in our submission.

Proposition 8 in our paper (from earlier work) shows that computing the projection of a matrix onto an operator norm ball may require clipping multiple singular values.  The method of Gouk, et al scales down all of the singular values by the amount needed to bring their estimate of the largest to its desired value - this is not closest matrix in the operator norm ball.  \n\nOur method is the first to feasibly provide access to all of the singular values of convolutional layers for models commonly used in practice.

Repeatedly applying the code on page two of our paper to random inputs has always produced at least this number of distinct singular values.  (We invite the reader to try this.)  Any reshaping of an (k, k, m, m) kernel can produce at most mk singular values, which is not enough to be correct.  The reshaping outlined in your review can have at most m singular values, which is even smaller.\n\nAs we noted in our answer to a question during the review period, an example in which the reshaping does not compute even the largest singular value correctly can be obtained by executing the following commands after importing numpy as np and defining SingularValues as in page two of our paper:\n \n   kernel = np.array(np.ones(4)).reshape(2,2,1,1)\n   SingularValues(kernel, [4,4])\n   reshaped = kernel.reshape(4,1)\n   np.linalg.svd(reshaped, compute_uv=False)\n\nThe correct largest singular value of the convolutional layer is 4.

Thus we would expect min(mni, mno) singular values.  Except in degenerate cases, this linear transformation has full rank.\n\nIn our code, the FFT produces a tensor of dimensions (m, n, i, o) and the second line performs an SVD for the i x o matrix for each value of the first two dimensions. Thus it produces min(i, o) singular values for each on the mn matrices, thus the total number of singular values we produce is mn * min(i, o). So our method produces the correct number of singular values.  \n(In fact, our unit tests verify that our method computes the correct singular values, as proved in the paper.)\n\nSingular values are repeated due to the special structure of the linear transformation.

The matrix encoding its linear transformation is ((a b c), (c a b), (b c a)). Its eigenvalues are a+b+c, a + b\u03c9 + c\u03c9^2, a + b\u03c9^2 + c\u03c9, where \u03c9 = (-1 + sqrt(-3))/2. The singular values are the magnitudes of the eigenvalues, but since |a + b\u03c9 + c\u03c9^2| =  |a + b\u03c9^2 + c\u03c9| we get repeated singular values.  However, for random inputs, we have seen that the repeated singular values tend to come in pairs, so that there are Omega(mn * min(i, o)) distinct singular values.\n\nIt is clear that no reshaping of the 4D tensor of dimensions (a, b, i, o) to a 2D matrix can produce Omega(mn * min(i, o))  singular values.  An example in which the reshaping described in the ICLR\u201918 paper by Miyato, et al does not compute even the largest singular value correctly can be obtained by executing the following commands after importing numpy as np and defining SingularValues as in page two of our paper:\n \n   kernel = np.array(np.ones(4)).reshape(2,2,1,1)\n   SingularValues(kernel, [4,4])\n   reshaped = kernel.reshape(4,1)\n   np.linalg.svd(reshaped, compute_uv=False)\n\nThe correct largest singular value of the convolutional layer is 4. (An all-ones feature map is turned into an all-fours feature map by applying this filter.) The (only) singular value of the reshaping of the kernel, which is (1,1,1,1)^T, is 2.  This is not an isolated instance --- random inputs also produce counterexamples except in very rare cases.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper453/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper453/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper453/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Singular Values of Convolutional Layers", "abstract": "We characterize the singular values of the linear transformation associated with a standard 2D multi-channel convolutional layer, enabling their efficient computation.

Here are the answers to your questions.\n\n1) The singular values are the components of the tensor output by the code on page 2; flattening it produces them in a list.\n\n2) In Figure 4, while singular values in the first layer are much larger than the rest, many layers have a lot of singular values that are pretty big.  For example, most of the layers have at least 10000 singular values that are at least 1.  As you requested, we have created a plot of the ratios of the singular values in each layer with the largest singular value in that layer.  It can be viewed at https://www.dropbox.com/s/15ujg0qdr9didr8/resnet_svd_ratios.png?dl=0.  The effective rank of the convolutional layers is larger closer to the inputs.\n\n3) The x-axis in Figure 5 is wall-clock training time using a GPU.
