This model is generic for visualizing any sequence classification tasks. To our knowledge, there have not been previous works which visualize sequence classes. \n\nWe want thank the reviewer for addressing the issue of abstract clarity. Accordingly, we revised our abstract into: \n\n\u201cThis paper applies a deep convolutional/highway MLP framework to classify genomic sequences on the transcription factor binding site task. To make the model understandable, we propose an optimization driven strategy to extract \u201cmotifs\u201d, or symbolic patterns which visualize the positive class learned by the network. We show that our system, Deep Motif (DeMo), extracts motifs that are similar to, and in some cases outperform the current well known motifs. In addition, we find that a deeper model consisting of multiple convolutional and highway layers can outperform a single convolutional and fully connected layer in the previous state-of-the-art.\u201d\n\t\t\n- The closest related study by Simonyan et al. (2013) visualizes class-specific image patterns. However, searching class-specific sequence patterns in a high-dimensional discrete-feature space is largely different from the image case because the lack of smoothness among alphabet letters (or genomic characters in our case). \n\n- In addition, the specific model we use for TBFS prediction is much deeper than Alipanahi et al. (2015). We want to show that model improvements which have shown state-of-the-art results in NLP tasks (e.g. Zhang et. al 2015), can also be applied to achieve state-of-the-art results in biomedical sequence tasks.\n \n+ Response to drawback 2:\n\nWe want to thank the reviewer for pointing this out. \n\n- In the first paragraph: we explained TFBS task as: \u201cEach different TF binds to specific transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) on the DNA sequence to regulate cell machinery. Accurately classifying and understanding the DNA subsequences that TFs bind to will allow us to better understand the underlying biological processes and potentially influence biomedical studies of human health.\u201d \n\nTo make the whole description more clear, we have revised the second sentence in the above paragraph into the following and uploaded the revised version. ==> \u201cWe focus on the task of accurately classifying and understanding the DNA subsequences that TFs bind to, which will allow us to better understand the underlying biological processes and potentially influence biomedical studies of human health. \\footnote{This task classifies whether or not there is a binding site for a particular TF of interest when given an input DNA sequence.}\u201d \n\n- We have explained the concept \u201cmotif\u201d in the last sentence of the first page: \u201cmotifs, consensus sequences which define the positive binding sites for a particular TF. \u201c\n\n- For Equation(1), we have explained: \u201cP_+(S) as the probability of the input sequence S (matrix of input length \u00d7 4 **(i.e. alphabet size)**) being a positive TFBS computed by the softmax output of our trained model ** for a specific TF **.\u201d In the original draft we missed the terms inside the ** symbols. We have added them in the revised version. \n\n- We explained the details of Figure 2 in its caption. For the caption of Figure 2(b) it states: \u201c(b) Comparison of DeMo motifs vs JASPAR motifs for 2 different TFs. Motifs are shown using information content in bits.\u201d  The y-axis in figure 2(b) is bits, since motifs are typically visualized using Shannon entropy. The 2 motifs we used are GATA2 (left column of 2(b)), and NRF1 (right column of 2(b)). The key point of Figure 2(b) is to show that our motifs (bottom row) are similar by visual inspection to the known JASPAR motifs (top row).\n\n- For the y-axis of Figure 2(a), we wrote \u201cDifference in AUC Scores DeMo - DeepBind\u201d. Because of the space limit, we can not add these descriptions into the main draft. But in the revised version, we add  \u201cDifference in AUC Scores DeMo - DeepBind\u201d in the caption of Figure 2(a).

Compared to DeepBind (Alipanahi et al., 2015), the authors use a deeper network (combination of deeper convolutional layers and highway MLP layers) and show that this model improves the classification performance (measured in AUC). The paper also presents a visualization method similar to Simonyan et al. (2013). The main contribution of the paper can be summarized as: (1) improved classification performance of TFBs using deeper CNNs, and (2) a visualization method of motifs from the learned CNN model. \n\nNovelty:\nThe technical novelty of the method is quite incremental. Compared to DeepBind, the main novelty is the use of deeper CNN layers and highway MLPs; the improvement of the AUC is ~1% (0.946 vs 0.931) which is moderate. In terms of visualization, the main difference is to optimize the input to maximize the output of the network via backprop (Equation 1) instead of using actual samples. \n\nClarity and presentation: \nThe paper is quite clearly written (given page limit), but more details would be helpful for clarification.\n\nSignificance:\nAlthough the technical novelty is incremental, there is a reasonable (although not big) improvement in performance.

This paper could contribute to more investigation and application of deep learning in the computational biology domain, which is under-explored compared to other areas (vision, speech, etc.). \n\nOverall, the paper would fall on the borderline; however, given the relative paucity of deep learning papers in computational biology, the paper may be worthy of presentation at the ICLR workshop.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"CMT_id": "", "title": "Deep Motif: Visualizing Genomic Sequence Classifications", "abstract": "This paper applies a deep convolutional/highway MLP framework to classify genomic\nsequences on the transcription factor binding site task.
