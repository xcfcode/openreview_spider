The authors made no attempt to argue these points in their rebuttals and so I went looking at the paper to find the answer in their revisions, but did not find it after scanning through the paper. I think a paper like this needs to explain what is gained and what obstructions earlier approaches met, and why the current techniques side step those. One of the reviewers felt that the fixed cardinality assumption was mild. I'm really not sure why the authors didn't attack this idea. Maybe it is mild in some technical sense?\n\nWhat I read of the paper seemed excellent in term of style and clarity. I think the paper simply needs to make a better case that it is not merely an exercise in topology. I think the result here is publishable on its own grounds, but for the paper to effectively communicate those findings, the authors should have revised it to address these issues. They chose not to and so I recommend ICLR take a pass. Once the reviewers revised the framing and scope/impact, provided it doesn't sound trivial, I think it'll be ready for publication.\n\n", "title": "Paper Decision"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["christianbueno@ucsb.edu", "alan.g.hylton@nasa.gov"], "title": "Limitations for Learning from Point Clouds", "authors": ["Christian Bueno", "Alan G.

They further provide examples of functions that can't be mutually approximated by PointNets and DeepSets.\n\n- It is important in order to know the representational power and fundamental limitations of basic algorithmic building blocks.

As mentioned in the paper, we made a slight adjustment to the form of the DeepSets architecture by replacing summation with averaging. We believe this variation is not directly addressed by the theorem presented in the original manuscript. We also believe replacing summation with averaging provides a theoretical improvement by allowing one to interpret DeepSets as acting continuously on probability measures, which lends some intuition to its behavoir when applied to larger point clouds.\n\nOur work also elucidates how simplistic the architecture can be while retaining UATs.\n\n\"The paper shows two specific functions, where one can be approximated by PointNet but not by DeepSets and vice-versa.

At least not for the case of PointNet trying to approximate the center-of-mass.

This forms the basis of our empirical verification of our results.\n\n\"The paper is clearly targeted at a specialist audience and invokes dense and advanced mathematical concepts.

In particular, the proofs in the original manuscripts of PoitnNet and DeepSets use techniques that don't seem to readily apply to the other, let alone scale to arbitrary finite cardinality. The introduction of this fairly easy generalization of the classical UAT is what allowed us to prove multiple universal approximation theorems with one method of attack.

This was made even more difficult because point cloud cardinality was free to be unbounded. However we now have results that apply to the bounded cardinality case for PointNet and show that this still cannot uniformly approximate the center-of-mass. We provide an explicit error bound and empirical test of this bound in the paper. We found these results to be robust in the sense that we could randomly sample pairs of points, and use those as a seed to find sets that yield the predicted worst case error. In a sense, this demonstrates a method to produce adversarial point cloud examples with theoretical guarantees.\n\nWe hope this further elucidates the nature of these function classes and improves the practicality of these results."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2555/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2555/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["christianbueno@ucsb.edu", "alan.g.hylton@nasa.gov"], "title": "Limitations for Learning from Point Clouds", "authors": ["Christian Bueno", "Alan G.

We prove that even with cloud size bounded to k or less points, PointNet cannot uniformly approximate the center-of-mass function. Moreover we prove an explicit worst case error lower bound (worst case error is at least (k-2)*Diam(domain)/k)  and empirically confirm the robustness of these results.
