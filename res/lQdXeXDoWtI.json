It observes that existing methods are hard to compare, in particular due to unclear hyper-parameter and model selection criteria. It introduces a common benchmark suite including a well designed model selection procedure, and re-evaluates existing methods on this suite. The results show that under such controlled evaluation, the benefit of existing DG methods over vanilla empirical risk minimisation (ERM) largely disappear. This raises the concern that existing DG methods might be over-tuned and hard to replicate. By releasing the controlled benchmark suite, future research progress can be more reliably measured. \n\nStrength: \n+ The paper highlights an important point. Comparing existing methods is indeed tricky and complicated by model selection and hyper-parameter selection issues, etc.  It makes good recommendations for practice, such as requiring that any DG method also specifies its model selection method.  (We knew this already, but it\u2019s good to remind people explicitly!) Helpfully it specifies a few reasonable options for model selection criteria which future papers could refer to rather than inventing ad-hoc approaches. \n+ A common benchmark with a pre-specified strategy for hyper-parameter/early-stopping could be very helpful for more reliably comparing and measuring research progress in future. \n+ A significant amount of effort was expended running a large and properly comparable evaluation across all several existing methods.\n\nWeakness: \n1. Strength of claim & validation. This paper is in part making a very strong negative result claim that a wide range of existing methods don\u2019t work when implemented \u201cproperly\u201d. This might be true, but then there is onus on the paper to make sure that all of the evaluation details are completely watertight.  \n- Are 20 trials enough for random search on all these models? It would be good to show some evidence that performance has saturated at this point (e.g., that performance doesn\u2019t improve further with an order of magnitude more search). It would be good to also show some specific hyper-parameters found by the random search, so experts in the specific algorithms shown can assess if something sensible was found. Do the discovered hyper-parameters correspond to ERM for those methods where ERM is a special case?\n- Are the hyper-parameter choices and ranges (Tab 6) satisfactory? For example some algorithms I have expertise on include hyper-parameters not documented in Tab 6, and its not clear how these are set. As another example, the DG research in my group has used SGD with momentum, not Adam, due to better stability in our experience. It\u2019s not clear how this change affects things. \n- Re Tab 6. It\u2019s not clear: When optimising the methods do you jointly optimize the Resnet hyper parameters (such as learning rate, batch size) with the DG-specific parameters (bottom half of table) for each individual DG method. Or do you optimize ResNet hyperparameters first for ERM and then fix those before optimising the DG hyper-parameters?\n- Overall, while the benchmark should be a useful contribution anyway, to believe the specific numerical conclusions, we have to trust the authors did a really good job re-implementing everything. If this research project had been setup instead as a competition where DG developers submit algorithms according to the constraints imposed by the benchmark for independent evaluation, and still reached the sae conclusion, then it would be more believable. \n\n2. Insight. If we accept the headline conclusion that ERM indeed outperforms all the existing methods, it would be really nice to have some insight into what went wrong along the way. Some of these were alluded to, but not properly analysed.  For example:\n- Do the prior methods have visible benefit over ERM on the more commonly evaluated networks like ResNet-18, and that benefit just fails to transfer to ResNet-50? We don\u2019t know, because the comparison is only made on ResNet-50. \n- Do the prior methods have visible benefit over ERM in the absence of data augmentation, and not otherwise? \n- How much of the negative result is due to \u201cproper tuning\u201d improving ERM compared to previous poorly tuned implementations of the baselines; versus worsening the previously over-tuned DG methods?\n- What is the primary source of over-tuning in existing DG methods? Which dominates among model selection, hyper-parameter selection, dataset split?\n- Insights such as these would make the paper more satisfying, as well as believability -- by identifying more precisely the factors behind the negative result. Without these, it feels a bit empty. \n\n3. Minor: \n- I don\u2019t understand the final comment in \u201cuntestable assumptions\u201d on Pg 8. \u201cDG algorithms that self-evaluate and self-adapt at test time\u201d seems wrong. Adapting at test-time per-se, is against the problem spec of DG and blurs into domain adaptation.\n\n============ UPDATE =============\n\nThanks to the authors for their feedback. I appreciate the efforts on clarification and loose-end tying.\n\nOne outstanding thing to clarify to help us understand whether Claim 1 can be fully supported: \n- AFAIK the Table 1 / Table 5 that underpin this claim are comparing numbers copied from previous papers with numbers generated from Domain Bed benchmark? However I suspect the splits are not the same. For example, some previous benchmarks have a fixed split by default, while I understood Domain Bed use multiple random splits? If so the numbers are not directly comparable, and it still may not be fair to make a strong claim that tuned ERM outperforms prior work.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1580/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1580/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "In Search of Lost Domain Generalization", "authorids": ["~Ishaan_Gulrajani1", "~David_Lopez-Paz2"], "authors": ["Ishaan Gulrajani", "David Lopez-Paz"], "keywords": ["domain generalization", "reproducible research"], "abstract": "The goal of domain generalization algorithms is to predict well on distributions different from those seen during training.\nWhile a myriad of domain generalization algorithms exist, inconsistencies in experimental conditions---datasets, network architectures, and model selection criteria---render fair comparisons difficult.\nThe goal of this paper is to understand how useful domain generalization algorithms are in realistic settings.\nAs a first step, we realize that model selection is non-trivial for domain generalization tasks, and we argue that algorithms without a model selection criterion remain incomplete.\nNext we implement DomainBed, a testbed for domain generalization including seven benchmarks, fourteen algorithms, and three model selection criteria.\nWhen conducting extensive experiments using DomainBed we find that when carefully implemented and tuned, ERM outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of average performance.\nFurthermore, no algorithm included in DomainBed outperforms ERM by more than one point when evaluated under the same experimental conditions.\nWe hope that the release of DomainBed, alongside contributions from fellow researchers, will streamline reproducible and rigorous advances in domain generalization.", "one-sentence_summary": "Our ERM baseline achieves state-of-the-art performance across many domain generalization benchmarks", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "gulrajani|in_search_of_lost_domain_generalization", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/eb1fb830f4df1b84b72a6be5a73d0b61a2cbcb8a.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/83e32f2664eddb15fdc2ac88f7bff07dd2682647.pdf", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Poster", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\ngulrajani2021in,\ntitle={In Search of Lost Domain Generalization},\nauthor={Ishaan Gulrajani and David Lopez-Paz},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=lQdXeXDoWtI}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).

In doing so, the authors evaluate a large variety of the most successful recent variants under principled model selection schemes (training-domain and leave-out-out validation), and find that standard empirical risk minimization outperforms \u2013 or is at least comparable \u2013 to all recently proposed state-of-the-art competitors. In bringing together a large set of heterogeneous methods the work makes an interesting contribution to the current DG literature. At the same time, in its current form I found the manuscript to be lacking any sufficiently substantial recommendations on how to improve the currently available zoo of methods.\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe manuscript contains a very rigorous and impressively detailed background section (moved to the appendix) as well as experimental evaluations of the most important recent methods in domain generalization. The methodological introduction is very well written and principled, and contrasts domain generalization against other learning setups (from generative learning all the way to continual learning, domain adaptation etc.).\n\nThe experimental section does a convincing job of comparing empirical risk minimization against the various DG competitors that have been developed in recent years (DIVA, RSC, DDAIG, etc.), and in particular makes important recommendations that should find their way into practical research around the theme of DG. The proposed DomainBed environment (code in supplementary materials) appears of high quality, although it is difficult to gauge whether its ease-of-use in terms of extending it to new approaches will convince future researcher to adopt it and incorporate it with their propositions.\n\nAll in all, I found the manuscript to be a compelling read that contains an interesting alternative viewpoint on the role and limitations of DG. That being said, I think more needs to be done to make this paper more inspiring and useful for the wider community, in particular with regards to its concreteness (see below).\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nAs highlighted above the paper is extremely well-written. However, it often leans in directions that I find too implicit, and \u2013 in my opinion \u2013 unnecessarily so. For example: \"selecting hyperparameters is a learning problem at least as hard as fitting the model (inasmuch as we may interpret any model parameter as a hyperparameter)\" (page 3, final paragraph). While this is a stimulating sentence, as a reader I am left wondering how this is crucial to motivating the central elements of the paper. In addition, what is the average DG researcher going to extract from this? Left untouched, I would suspect such a statement might invite some additional criticism from the viewpoint of previous DG research: how can one possibly guarantee that the tuning as part of DomainBed is optimal for the large heterogeneous variety of DG approaches out there, and who is to say that this can't be improved upon?\n\nWhile page 8 introduces a number of interesting and compelling open questions, I would encourage the authors to provide more guidance in this context, potentially in the form of some experimentation, or analysis of the large set of results (e.g. which methods have strengths where, etc.). Some (again, too implicit) comments are there \u2013 e.g. \"Therefore, we believe there is great promise in DG algorithms able to self-evaluate and self-adapt during test time.\" \u2013 more concise propositions as to which ideas the DG community can consider would be extremely helpful here.\n\nI think the final paragraph of the paper nicely summarizes what I find to be the central weakness of this manuscript: in asking what a good benchmark is, instead of proposing some sort of alternative or making a recommendation, the authors opt for an intellectually compelling quote by Proust. Sure it's lovely to read, but I would again caution that is going to be of limited practical usefulness.\n\nIn summary, I therefore remain somewhat unconvinced that the manuscript, at least in its current form that mainly resorts to criticism of other DG approaches (while undoubtedly warranted (!)), but otherwise steers clear of any concise recommendations for future improvements, is an optimal use of content for an 8 pages conference paper.\n\n### Minor points\n\n\"Although challenging, DG is the best approximation to real prediction problems, where unforeseen distributional discrepancies between training and testing data are surely expected.\" (page 3, third paragraph). DG is an interesting problem, but I'd be a bit more cautious in elevating its role for ML predictions problems in the real-world. At least in its current form DG approximates real-world problems from a (constrained) direction, and the above statement doesn't yet synergize well will the paragraph that rightfully asks whether DG benchmarks \"are [..] the right datasets?\" (page 8). Some clarification around the restrictions of DG early on would be helpful here.\n\nWhile an interesting analysis of the differences between learning scenarios and domain generalization has been demarcated clearly from other types of learning problems, a very brief mentioning of the difference between multi-task and multi-domain learning would be beneficial given there is some confusion around these terms in the current literature.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1580/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1580/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "In Search of Lost Domain Generalization", "authorids": ["~Ishaan_Gulrajani1", "~David_Lopez-Paz2"], "authors": ["Ishaan Gulrajani", "David Lopez-Paz"], "keywords": ["domain generalization", "reproducible research"], "abstract": "The goal of domain generalization algorithms is to predict well on distributions different from those seen during training.\nWhile a myriad of domain generalization algorithms exist, inconsistencies in experimental conditions---datasets, network architectures, and model selection criteria---render fair comparisons difficult.\nThe goal of this paper is to understand how useful domain generalization algorithms are in realistic settings.\nAs a first step, we realize that model selection is non-trivial for domain generalization tasks, and we argue that algorithms without a model selection criterion remain incomplete.\nNext we implement DomainBed, a testbed for domain generalization including seven benchmarks, fourteen algorithms, and three model selection criteria.\nWhen conducting extensive experiments using DomainBed we find that when carefully implemented and tuned, ERM outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of average performance.\nFurthermore, no algorithm included in DomainBed outperforms ERM by more than one point when evaluated under the same experimental conditions.\nWe hope that the release of DomainBed, alongside contributions from fellow researchers, will streamline reproducible and rigorous advances in domain generalization.", "one-sentence_summary": "Our ERM baseline achieves state-of-the-art performance across many domain generalization benchmarks", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "gulrajani|in_search_of_lost_domain_generalization", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/eb1fb830f4df1b84b72a6be5a73d0b61a2cbcb8a.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/83e32f2664eddb15fdc2ac88f7bff07dd2682647.pdf", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Poster", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\ngulrajani2021in,\ntitle={In Search of Lost Domain Generalization},\nauthor={Ishaan Gulrajani and David Lopez-Paz},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=lQdXeXDoWtI}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).

We feel that it\u2019s a really important point.\n\nOur first main contribution (\u201cClaim 1\u201d in the paper) is a strong ERM baseline result which outperforms prior published results. The validity and usefulness of this result don\u2019t depend on the quality of our implementation choices.\n\nRegarding \u201cClaim 2\u201d in the paper: As you suggest, it\u2019s impossible to rigorously prove a broad negative claim, and we want to emphasize that we\u2019re not attempting to do so. Our Claim 2 isn\u2019t that existing methods don\u2019t outperform ERM when implemented \"properly\u201d (which would be an ill-defined claim), but rather that they didn\u2019t outperform ERM in our restricted experimental setting. Such restriction is a fundamental limitation of any negative claim, but we think our claim is nonetheless meaningful for three reasons: (1) our implementation can outperform previously published results, (2) we explain implementation details and motivate them carefully in the paper, and (3) we are open-sourcing DomainBed, getting in touch with the original authors of the baselines for code reviews, and inviting the whole research community to improve our results. We feel this is the best way to achieve rigorous and reproducible results across a large variety of algorithms.\n\nWe\u2019ve added a discussion to the paper which explains this and makes the limitations of our claims clear.\n\n**\u201cAre 20 trials enough for random search on all these models?\u201d**\n\nWe have run experiments on a random subset of algorithms and datasets with 100 trials, showing no significant improvement. We plan to include these in a supplementary in the camera-ready version after the entire sweep completes. \n\n**\u201cIt would be good to also show some specific hyper-parameters found by the random search\u201d**\n\nWe now include a script in DomainBed to print best hyperparameters, and plan to include the output in the supplementary material of the camera-ready version upon completion of the entire sweep. \n\n**\"Do the discovered hyper-parameters correspond to ERM for those methods where ERM is a special case?**\n\nYes, in some cases, algorithms find their best performance with a hyper-parameter configuration that results in an ERM-like behaviour.\n\n**\u201cAre the hyper-parameter choices and ranges (Tab 6) satisfactory?\u201d  / \u201cSGD with momentum\u201d**\n\nWe chose the ranges in Table 6 based on experience gained from doing many exploratory experiments for each algorithm. Could you give us examples of such missing hyper-parameters? We are eager to conduct more experiments and push the numbers of all algorithms as high as possible. We have tried SGD with momentum with no improvement.\n\n** \u201cWhen optimising the methods do you jointly optimize the Resnet hyper parameters?\u201d**\n\nAll hyper-parameters are optimized jointly. We make sure this is clear in the revised version.\n\n**\u201cIf this research project had been setup instead as a competition [...] it would be more believable.\u201d**\n\nWe think this is a great way forward! We\u2019ve open-sourced DomainBed (which we actively maintain) and invited the entire domain generalization research community to build together the most rigorous, reproducible, and reliable set of experimental results. We\u2019re excited that we\u2019ve already received such contributions from multiple researchers. In a field full of discrepancies in experimental protocols and impossible-to-replicate results, we believe this is the way forward.\n \n**\u201cDo the prior methods have visible benefit over ERM on the more commonly evaluated networks like ResNet-18\u201d**\n\nPreliminary experiments show that all methods lose in performance when using a ResNet-18, but the ranking of methods does not vary. We will add this result to the camera-ready upon completion of the entire sweep.\n\n**\u201cDo the prior methods have visible benefit over ERM in the absence of data augmentation, and not otherwise?\u201d**\n\nTable 4 shows that data augmentation does not influence domain generalization performance greatly. We speculate that this is because the ResNet models are already pre-trained on ImageNet with data augmentations.\n\n**\u201cHow much of the negative result is due to \u201cproper tuning\u201d improving ERM [...] versus worsening the previously over-tuned DG methods?\u201d**\n\nTable 5 in the Appendix suggests it is the former, since all the other numbers are copied verbatim from the corresponding research papers."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1580/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1580/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "In Search of Lost Domain Generalization", "authorids": ["~Ishaan_Gulrajani1", "~David_Lopez-Paz2"], "authors": ["Ishaan Gulrajani", "David Lopez-Paz"], "keywords": ["domain generalization", "reproducible research"], "abstract": "The goal of domain generalization algorithms is to predict well on distributions different from those seen during training.\nWhile a myriad of domain generalization algorithms exist, inconsistencies in experimental conditions---datasets, network architectures, and model selection criteria---render fair comparisons difficult.\nThe goal of this paper is to understand how useful domain generalization algorithms are in realistic settings.\nAs a first step, we realize that model selection is non-trivial for domain generalization tasks, and we argue that algorithms without a model selection criterion remain incomplete.\nNext we implement DomainBed, a testbed for domain generalization including seven benchmarks, fourteen algorithms, and three model selection criteria.\nWhen conducting extensive experiments using DomainBed we find that when carefully implemented and tuned, ERM outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of average performance.\nFurthermore, no algorithm included in DomainBed outperforms ERM by more than one point when evaluated under the same experimental conditions.\nWe hope that the release of DomainBed, alongside contributions from fellow researchers, will streamline reproducible and rigorous advances in domain generalization.", "one-sentence_summary": "Our ERM baseline achieves state-of-the-art performance across many domain generalization benchmarks", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "gulrajani|in_search_of_lost_domain_generalization", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/eb1fb830f4df1b84b72a6be5a73d0b61a2cbcb8a.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/83e32f2664eddb15fdc2ac88f7bff07dd2682647.pdf", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Poster", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\ngulrajani2021in,\ntitle={In Search of Lost Domain Generalization},\nauthor={Ishaan Gulrajani and David Lopez-Paz},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=lQdXeXDoWtI}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "required": true}, "comment": {"order": 1, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}", "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).

We\u2019ve added a discussion to our paper explaining the limitations of our claims. In short, our negative result claims apply only to our specific implementation.

Evaluating models this way, together with an excessive \u201cpublish or perish\u201d pressure, could translate in some cases in suboptimal experimental protocols.

However, it was significantly ignored in previous works. It is nice to see that the authors provide three kinds of model selection methods. From the results, it seems that existing DG methods do not have a clear advantage over ERM even when test-domain validation test is used. Does this mean existing methods themselves are not good? Or the dataset might not be appropriate for DG?

(ii) no competitor can outperform ERM by more than one point (iii) model selection matters for DG.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nReasons for score:\n\n\nI believe \"the well-tuned ERM outperforms many SoTA DG methods\" may not surprise many researchers in this area, but I would very much like to see a paper delivering this message clearly. Thus, I recommend an acceptance. \n\n##########################################################################\n\nPros:\n\n\n1. For quite a while, ERM (when carefully implemented and tuned) being the SoTA in DG is \"elephant in the room\". At least, we should admit that, quite often, the \"improvements\" claimed by those DA methods are gone when switching from a weaker backbone (e.g., ResNet-18) to a stonger one (e.g., ResNet-50). A high-standard testing protocol is a very important contribution in DG research.\n\n2. This work brings an open-sourced software for replicating the existing methods, and comparing the newly proposed ones in a consistent and realistic setting.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nCons:\n\n\n1. Domain-Net, as a much larger scale and more challenging dataset, could be considered. \n\n2. Can you elaborate the last sentence of Claim 2, i.e.,  \"our advice to DG practitioners is to use CORALwith a hyperparameter search distribution that allows ERM-like behavior\".\n\n##########################################################################\n\nA typo: (Page 6) \"Table 5.2\" shows that using a ResNet-50 neural network architecture.
