Just one question.\n\nGiven the transformer was originally a sequence-to-sequence model consisting of both an encoder and a decoder where the decoded message need not be the same length as the encoded message, how does the reformer still work in that circumstance? Wouldn't the fundamental difference between queries (which come from the decoder) and keys (which come from the encoder) there make sharing the QK space not possible? Put another way, doesn't sharing QK space limit you to self-attention? \n\nSometimes there is some ambiguity in terminology where e.g. BERT uses only the encoder blocks of a transformer and still calls itself a transformer. Is the reformer only reproducing the encoder blocks?\n\nThanks!"}, "signatures": ["~James_Tian1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["~James_Tian1", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Reformer: The Efficient Transformer", "authors": ["Nikita Kitaev", "Lukasz Kaiser", "Anselm Levskaya"], "authorids": ["kitaev@cs.berkeley.edu", "lukaszkaiser@google.com", "levskaya@google.com"], "keywords": ["attention", "locality sensitive hashing", "reversible layers"], "TL;DR": "Efficient Transformer with locality-sensitive hashing and reversible layers", "abstract": "Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on\na number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly,\nespecially on long sequences.

The proposed approach consists mainly of three main operations: \n- Using reversible layers (inspired from RevNets) in order to prevent the need of storing the activations of all layers to be reused for back propagation; \n- Using locality sensitive hashing to approximate the costly softmax(QK^T) computation in the full dot-product attention;\n- Chunking the feed-forward layers computations to reduce their cost.\nThis approach is first applied to a toy dataset to analyze its complexity, then tested on enwik8 language modelling task and imagenet-64 image generation task for ablation study and performance assessment. \n\nThe problem approached by the paper is interesting and the proposed approach is novel to the best of my knowledge. The paper is well structured and clearly written a part from some small typos (see minor comments below).   \n\nWhile the analysis of complexity is sound and convincing, and the fact of being able to train larger Reformers is very interesting, I have some questions and concerns about the approach and experiments. \n- Effect of reversible layers: It is clear for the experiment of Imagenet64 that the effect is negligible, but the experiment on enwik8 in the paper seems unfinished. Did the authors manage to finish the training, and does it confirm the observation? \n- Sharing QK: I am a bit confused about the effect and usefulness of this operation. Can the authors comment on why it is needed for LSH attention? It seems to me that the same operations can be achieved with different Q and K. Indeed, doing so, the authors slightly reduce the capacity of the model. The observed non-significantly decreased performance can be an effect of using only 3-layers. This may explain why the results reported for larger models in figure 5 show higher bpc than similar size state of the art models.\n- Time per iterations: Can the authors report the time per iteration for the larger hash rounds (8 and 16) that are closer to full attention? For the highest reported number (4), from a quick and not precise look at figure 4, it seems that the performance achieved by the proposed method after 140k iterations is achieved by the full attention after ~40k iterations. The gain in time per iteration for this particular number of hash rounds can be lost by the loss in performance. \n- Can the authors detail how they chose the hyperparameters of their approach? e.g. the size of hash buckets, the distribution used to generate the random matrix R .. \n- The reported results can be made stronger by reporting average/error bars across several trial to show consistency. \n\nMinor: typos: \nDimension of matrix R [d_k, d_b/2] -> [d_k, b/2]\nLast paragraph of page 6: state of these art -> state of the art\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \nAfter rebuttal:\nI have read the authors answer, and found they addressed my concerns.

We\u2019re updated the technical sections of the paper to increase clarity; please let us know if there are still any sections that you find difficult to parse.\n\n1. How is causal masking implemented?\n\nTo mask out attention to the future, we associate each query/key vector with a position index, where the position indices are then sorted using the same permutation as the QK sort. Position indices are compared for each query-key dot product, and the attention probability is masked to zero if the query comes before the key.\n\n2. Attention-in-place\n\nThank you for pointing out that this was unclear. We have updated the paper to elaborate on this point.\n\nIn a typical Transformer implementation, positions can attend to themselves. There is a dot product between the query vector at position i and the key vector at position i; if this dot product is high then the value vector at position i will contribute to the output of the attention layer. This behavior isn\u2019t very useful because local information is already propagated through the residual connections, but standard attention can learn to drive this attention probability to zero by making q_i and k_i orthogonal. Shared-QK attention, on the other hand, can\u2019t reduce this weight because the query and the key are the same vector. To address this issue, we don\u2019t allow attention-in-place for the Reformer.\n\n3. Backprop through LSH attention, and sorting.\n\nWe use sorting as an implementation for allowing items that map to the same hash bucket to attend to each other. Similar items get mapped to the same hash bucket with high probability, which allows similar item pairs to participate in both the forward and backward passes. Each hash bucket may contain a certain number of unrelated items, in which case there will be a gradient signal that either up-weighs or down-weighs attention to these items.\n\nWe don\u2019t differentiate through the hash bucket assignment procedure, or the choice of what order to sort the items into. Rather, these operations take query/key vectors as input where LSH maps nearby vectors to the same bucket with high probability. Therefore, the sorting re-adjusts any time parameter updates to cause relevant vector pairs to have higher dot product, and \u201cunhelpful\u201d vector pairs to have lower dot products.\n\n4. Additional tasks.\n\nThank you for your recommendation that we evaluate on other tasks. Prompted by your recommendation we started working on applying the Reformer to machine translation (we didn\u2019t do that before since sequences are short in translation data-sets so it was not a prime target for Reformer).  Thus far we have trained a decoder-only Reformer on concatenated English-then-German sentence pairs, and we do not observe any difference compared to a regular Transformer LM. We\u2019re in the process of constructing and tuning a more standard encoder-decoder approach that likewise uses the Reformer architecture. In the final version of our paper, we\u2019ll report BLEU numbers and comparisons for English-German translation -- the current runs make us believe that they will be the same as for Transformer."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1838/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1838/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Reformer: The Efficient Transformer", "authors": ["Nikita Kitaev", "Lukasz Kaiser", "Anselm Levskaya"], "authorids": ["kitaev@cs.berkeley.edu", "lukaszkaiser@google.com", "levskaya@google.com"], "keywords": ["attention", "locality sensitive hashing", "reversible layers"], "TL;DR": "Efficient Transformer with locality-sensitive hashing and reversible layers", "abstract": "Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on\na number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly,\nespecially on long sequences.

We have posted an update to address some of the comments, which we detail below.\n\n1. Effect of reversible layers\n\nWe updated the figures in the paper to cover longer training durations. As expected, reversible layers perform the same as regular Transformer layers on enwik8.\n\n2. Sharing QK\n\nThis operation is needed so that we can batch LSH attention on current hardware. Absent any hardware requirements, we could do unshared LSH attention as illustrated in Figure 2(b). Each hash bucket in the unshared condition may contain a different number of queries, a different number of keys, and moreover there is no relationship between the number of queries and the number of keys. Computing one bucket at a time would be too slow, and it\u2019s unclear how to batch buckets of highly variable sizes. With shared-QK, as in Figure 2(c-d), we can batch effectively because the entries we want to calculate cluster near the main diagonal (after sorting). Let us stress though that this is purely a speed optimization which we did due to the realities of current hardware architectures. It works, but one could indeed hope that one day it will not be necessary.\n\n3. Enwik8 results\n\nWe\u2019re happy to report that, with further tuning, our 12-layer model reaches 1.05 bits/dim on enwik8. Adjusting optimizer settings and dropout played a big role in improving perplexity for this task.\n\n3. Time per iterations\n\nThank you for your suggestion. We\u2019ve updated the right part of Figure 5 to sweep over a larger range of hash numbers and sequence lengths. Although full attention is fast for short sequences, its O(n^2) scaling makes it rather slow at long sequence lengths, even when compared to the 8-hash LSH variant.\n\n4. Hyperparameters\n\nThe random matrix R has i.i.d. unit Gaussian entries, following Andoni et al. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02897.pdf; page 4). The number of hash buckets was chosen such that each bucket would have 64 entries on average. Making the hash buckets smaller hurts accuracy, whereas increasing it doesn\u2019t seem to do much other than making the model slower.\n\n5. Variance between runs.\n\nThank you for your pointing this out. For now, we can report that the variance between runs, at convergence, is minimal: we see no variance when rounding to two decimal points."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1838/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1838/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Reformer: The Efficient Transformer", "authors": ["Nikita Kitaev", "Lukasz Kaiser", "Anselm Levskaya"], "authorids": ["kitaev@cs.berkeley.edu", "lukaszkaiser@google.com", "levskaya@google.com"], "keywords": ["attention", "locality sensitive hashing", "reversible layers"], "TL;DR": "Efficient Transformer with locality-sensitive hashing and reversible layers", "abstract": "Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on\na number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly,\nespecially on long sequences.

The Locality sensitive hashing scheme reduces complexity from L^2 to L which is pretty neat. \n\nTackling the quadratic complexity of self-attention is indeed an important and nice direction. I think the LSH based attention quite novel and is a natural solution to reducing the complexity of the self-attention module.  However, I think the technical description could be improved as the current form is quite confusing and difficult to parse.\n\nThe experiments are a little on the weaker side. Authors presented results on imagenet, enwiki and a synthetic task. I am mainly concerned if the Reformer works on tasks such as machine translation or other NLP tasks. The paper does not present much evidence that the effectiveness of LSH is broad and versatile.\n\nMy current vote is a weak accept, based on some preliminary understanding and the general novelty of the idea. \n\nI do have some questions/issues/comments:\n\n1) Given that there is some form of QK sorting, how is it possible to mask the future? Is this because tokens are sorted within buckets?\n2) Can the authors clarify what \"Causal masking on the Transformer is typically implemented to allow a position i to attend to itself.\" mean?\n3) I'm a little confused about how the sorting is being done. Can this be done in an end-to-end differentiable manner?\n4) Can the authors present some results on other tasks? While neat, I think other tasks (e.g., MT or QA) can be investigated to further ascertain that the LSH attention works well. Current experimental results are not too convincing.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1838/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1838/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Reformer: The Efficient Transformer", "authors": ["Nikita Kitaev", "Lukasz Kaiser", "Anselm Levskaya"], "authorids": ["kitaev@cs.berkeley.edu", "lukaszkaiser@google.com", "levskaya@google.com"], "keywords": ["attention", "locality sensitive hashing", "reversible layers"], "TL;DR": "Efficient Transformer with locality-sensitive hashing and reversible layers", "abstract": "Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on\na number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly,\nespecially on long sequences.

As such, it is very important to improve the space and computational complexity of this popular deep model. The techniques presented in this manuscript seem to be very reasonable and the experimental results also indicate that they are effective. My major concern is that the authors shall present more detailed experimental results.

In most experiments we picked n_c so that l_c = 64. Note that we attend to the current and previous chunk, so with l_c = 64 we perform full 64x128 attentions, and there are l/64 of them. So the cost of that part is (2l/n_c)^2 but since we pick n_c so that l_c is constant, it can also be denoted simply by O(l), where the main constant factor is the 64x128 matrix multiplication and, more importantly, memory access.\n\nThe above calculation, as you note, does indeed *not* include the computation of the hash id. Hash id is computed by multiplying activations of length l by a random matrix and picking the argmax. This is again of the order O(l) with the constant n_c, as you say. In theory, if n_c were very large, this could grow prohibitively. In that case one could use projection hashes -- e.g., multiply by 2 different matrices into size sqrt(n_c) and use the 2 hashes as higher and lower bits of the hash. In practice though, this matrix multiplication is quite cheap -- even upto n_c=1024 the cost of this matmul is negligible compared to the cost of memory access during hashing -- that's why we did not emphasize it in the analysis.", "title": "Cost clarifications"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1838/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1838/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Reformer: The Efficient Transformer", "authors": ["Nikita Kitaev", "Lukasz Kaiser", "Anselm Levskaya"], "authorids": ["kitaev@cs.berkeley.edu", "lukaszkaiser@google.com", "levskaya@google.com"], "keywords": ["attention", "locality sensitive hashing", "reversible layers"], "TL;DR": "Efficient Transformer with locality-sensitive hashing and reversible layers", "abstract": "Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on\na number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly,\nespecially on long sequences.

One minor concern/query that I had, which hopefully can be addressed by the time of author response / paper update, was why the results on enwik8 are so far from prior published transformer results. E.g. there have been transformers published with 0.99bpc (TransformerXL), and several others around the 1.0-1.06 mark. From Figure 5 it appears as though the models will not obtain results lower than 1.2 bpc. Is it because the models have not converged, or is it because the test data is different (i.e. you don't use the 90MB/5MB/5MB train/valid/test split)?\n\nFurthermore I was not able to replicate the positive benefit of sharing the key and query weight matrices. Namely, I used a 24 layer TransformerXL baseline --- exactly the same setup as the published paper --- which obtains 0.992 bpc and then tried tying the weights between the query and key parameters; this lead to a model with 1.012; which is 0.02bpc drop. The non-shared variant had a faster drop in training and validation learning curves. I don't mean for this to detract from the paper - but just to add another data-point on this observation. Perhaps you don't have to share the weights for queries and keys (still normalizing them of course, so you can use the spherical LSH).", "title": "Query about shared queries"}, "signatures": ["~Jack_William_Rae1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["~Jack_William_Rae1", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Reformer: The Efficient Transformer", "authors": ["Nikita Kitaev", "Lukasz Kaiser", "Anselm Levskaya"], "authorids": ["kitaev@cs.berkeley.edu", "lukaszkaiser@google.com", "levskaya@google.com"], "keywords": ["attention", "locality sensitive hashing", "reversible layers"], "TL;DR": "Efficient Transformer with locality-sensitive hashing and reversible layers", "abstract": "Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on\na number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly,\nespecially on long sequences.
