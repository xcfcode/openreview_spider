The proposed method outperforms the baselines of ISP and JISP on the physics tasks. \n\nMy main pro for the paper is that is exhaustively testing the utility of physics prior in learning a goal directed policy. Additional experiments show the proposed method outperforms the closely related I2A baseline. \n\nMy main concerns are: \n(a) From figure 11, it seems that IPA and PPO are comparable. While it is true, that IPA outperforms PPO in many more games, but in many cases the performance gain within error bars. \n\n(b) The difference between ConvLSTM and Spatial Net is still unclear to me. In one of the comments, authors mention: \"SpatialNet also has a input copy mechanism that add the current state to the output of the spatialnet encoding\". This is trivial to implement in ConvLSTM -- and will give more insights into why Spatial Net is outperforming ConvLSTM. Right now, results are in favor of Spatial net, but the exact differences from ConvLSTM that lead to performance difference is unclear. \n\nDespite a very good rebuttal, I am still concerned by (a)/(b) and can therefore cannot recommend the paper to be accepted. I highly encourage authors to clarify these points and resubmit to a future conference. Utilizing physics prior to improve policy learning has great potential.

We provide individual responses below. \n\n(a) In our IPA model, the policy net and frame prediction network do not share any parameters. SpatialNet is fine-tuned to more accurately predict future frames on the new environment while the policy net is optimized for control performance. Policy gradients are not back-propagated to SpatialNet. We have added this clarification in the paper (Section 3.2). Both PPO and IPA agents see identical number of frames, we train the frame prediction network on the frames used to train the policy. We have updated the description in Section 3.2 to make this clearer.\n\n(b) All the tested approaches see exactly the same number of frames on the control environment. SpatialNet sees extra frames from the PhysVideos data, but these are offline, from a different domain and contain objects of different shapes, colors, dynamics from the target control environments (PhysWorld and Atari). The PhysVideo frames are only used to train SpatialNet for dynamics prediction, and not for any policy learning.\n\n(c) Thank you for the suggestions. We have added comparisons with the two baselines: (1) ISP: initialization of a model with weights learned with SpatialNet on the PhysWorld environment -- where we use the convolutional encoding of SpatialNet (z_t) as input into the policy network, and  (2) JISP: jointly optimizing future frame prediction + environment reward (see Section 5.1, Table 2).  We find that initializing with the weights from SpatialNet performs about the same as normal PPO, likely due to much of the initially learned priors being corrupted with reward updates. As for the second baseline, we find that joint training does provide a benefit in performance over PPO, but not as large as IPA (except on PhysForage).\n\n(d)  We first emphasize that our experiments are on a stochastic version of Atari, which is more challenging than the benchmark used by previous work [Machado et al., 2017].

We have added relevant comparisons to both the imagination augmented agents architecture (I2A) (Table 3) and the ConvLSTM model (Table 1) as baselines. Below, we provide a comparison of our method with each baseline along with empirical results.\n\nConvLSTM: SpatialNet differs from ConvLSTM in two main ways that allow it to maintain dynamics information more accurately: 1)  the grid states are updated through convolutions instead of LSTM updates (which blur dynamics over time), and (2)  SpatialNet also has a input copy mechanism that add the current state to the output of the spatialnet encoding -- this allows the encoding to focus better on the dynamics.\n\nWe trained a ConvLSTM following the specifications in (Xingjian et al., 2015) and also performed some hyperparameter tuning. We find that the ConvLSTM architecture allows for similar 1 step future frame prediction as SpatialNet (our model) -- see Table 1. However, we find that ConvLSTM  is unable to maintain dynamics information over longer horizons and achieves significantly worse multi step future frame prediction (Table 1 and Figure 3). ConvLSTM also does not generalize well to new datasets with smaller and faster objects (Figure 8). SpatialNet, on the other hand, has a much simpler mechanism for capturing state transitions and is able to effectively model physics and generalize better.\n\nI2A: I2A encodes a global context summary of future frames which is fed into a policy while IPA stacks future frames, allowing convolutional filters to encode local dynamics of different objects.\n\nWe trained the I2A model following the specifications in [Weber et al., 2017] and also performed some hyperparameter tuning, where SpatialNet is used as a future frame predictor.\nIn our experiments, we find that I2A performs significantly worse than IPA (our approach) and performs on par with PPO on the PhysWorld environments. By feeding stacked future frames in IPA, we allow convolutions to locally extract information about each individual object to predict its dynamics in the future. In contrast, I2A\u2019s structure only allows global encoding of the future states of objects that makes it difficult for policy to infer the future dynamics of objects and their interactions.\n\nReferences:\n[Weber et al., 2017] Imagination-Augmented Agents for Deep Reinforcement Learning\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1538/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1538/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1538/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Physics Priors for Deep Reinforcement Learing", "abstract": "While model-based deep reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for sample efficiency and generalization, learning an accurate dynamics model is challenging and often requires substantial interactions with the environment.

We provide answers to individual questions below.\n\n(1) We note that the environments in PhysWorld contain objects of different color and shapes than the objects in PhysVideos, the video dataset used for pre-training SpatialNet. As a result, the pretrained model\u2019s notion of shape or color does not have any transferability to the new task, only its knowledge of physical dynamics does.\n\n(2) When comparing average performance across all the Atari benchmark games, PPO is the state of the art approach, competitive with ACER and better than A2C [Schulman et al., 2017]. \n\n(3) We have included standard deviation values for rewards in in PhysWorld and Atari environments (Table 2,3,6) . Following prior work [Schulman et al., 2017], we use 3 seeds for all our experiments. We also ran extra experiments for the Atari games (5 seeds) and observed similar mean and standard deviation performance (Tables 3 and 6)\n\n(4) We have added in results for the entire suite of Atari games in Appendix A.3 (Table 6). Across all the 49 games, IPA outperforms PPO in 31 games. Not all Atari games require an understanding of physical dynamics, which explains why IPA does not improve upon PPO in those games. We specifically use PhysWorld for this purpose -- to test our approach on environments that rely more on understanding basics physics like velocity, collision laws, etc.\n\n(5) Thank you for this suggestion -- we have added a discussion about ego-dynamics in the paper. Since our approach is to learn physics priors that transfer well to new environments, we don\u2019t learn ego-dynamics, which require the action space of the agent to be input to the model -- this is usually task-specific. The dynamics of the world minus the ego-dynamics is more general and transfers well to new environments. See our comparison for transfer with a \u201cmodel+policy transfer\u201d baseline in Table 4.\n\n(6) We agree that achieving performance gains on many Atari games are limited by factors other physics such as exploration or reflexive action, which we note maybe the reason we do not achieve universal improvement across all Atari games. However, we believe certain Atari games, such as Asteroids, do benefit from predicting the dynamics of moving rocks, etc., and we do observe substantial gains in such environments. We specifically created PhysWorld and performed empirical studies to test our approach on environments that rely more on understanding various aspects of basic physics like velocity, collision laws, etc.\n\n(7) Our transfer learning experiments (Table 4) test the generalization of a policy from a single source environment to a single target environment. In this scenario, techniques like MAML are not directly applicable since they require meta-learning over multiple different environments to find good initialization points for the policy parameters. We also note that methods like PPO do perform better than approaches like MAML on tasks like the Sonic Benchmark [Nichol et al., 2018].\n\n\nReferences:\n[Machado et al., 2017] Revisiting the Arcade Learning Environment: Evaluation Protocols and Open Problems for General Agents \n[Schulman et al., 2017] Schulman, J., Wolski, F., Dhariwal, P., Radford, A., & Klimov, O.

Do the policy-net and the frame prediction net share any parameters? \n\n(b) Is the comparison in Table 2/Figure 5 fair in terms of number of frames seen by the agent? Let a PPO agent see N frames?

But is there some task that are more realistic than atari games that can leverage the power of physics priors more? It's good that this method works in some atari games. But isn't learning the dynamics of atari games a bit off the topic? \n7. The transfer learning experiments should contain a baseline -- maml/reptile. Since you are learning physics prior, it is fair to add meta-learning baselines for comparison.\n\nI think the direction is interesting and the effort is made well. But the experiments are less convincing than the abstract/introduction.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1538/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Physics Priors for Deep Reinforcement Learing", "abstract": "While model-based deep reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for sample efficiency and generalization, learning an accurate dynamics model is challenging and often requires substantial interactions with the environment. Further, a wide variety of domains have dynamics that share common foundations like the laws of physics, which are rarely exploited by these algorithms. Humans often acquire such physics priors that allow us to easily adapt to the dynamics of any environment. In this work, we propose an approach to learn such physics priors and incorporate them into an RL agent. Our method involves pre-training a frame predictor on raw videos and then using it to initialize the dynamics prediction model on a target task. Our prediction model, SpatialNet, is designed to implicitly capture localized physical phenomena and interactions.
