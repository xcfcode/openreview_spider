Modern datasets such as CNN/DailyMail open up new opportunities to train deep learning models for extractive summarization compared to traditional DUC datasets that have very little training data, and it is now more possible than ever to substantially outperform the LEAD baseline (which our models as well as that of Cheng and Lapata do). Hence we think research on using deep learning models for extractive single document summarization is both desirable and necessary. \n\n* Regarding your comment on multi-document summarization:\nWe are still not aware of any large scale datasets for this problem on which we could train our deep learning models. The newly released MS-MARCO dataset is the only one that comes close but it was released in parallel to our paper.\n\n* Regarding your comment on sentence length capped to 50:\nThis is more of an approximation to increase training speed than any real limitation. More than 90% of the sentences have fewer than 50 words, so this approximation has very little effect in terms of accuracy, but increases training speed by restricting the tensor size of each batch."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Classify or Select: Neural Architectures for Extractive Document Summarization", "abstract": "We present two novel and contrasting Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based architectures for extractive summarization of documents.

The results show that the positional features have high absolute weight (31.09) in the original data but close to zero weight (0.20) in the shuffled data, confirming our intuition that the document structure is quite important in modeling summaries. We also performed ablation experiments removing one feature at a time for both Classifier and Selector architectures as reported in Table 5. These results show that removing positional features hurts the Selector the most. Removing these features also hurts the Classifier, but not as much, since the architecture of the sequence classifier already captures the structural properties of the document. \n\n*Regarding your questions/comments on the content-richness feature:\nThe importance weights of the features in Table 4 show that content richness is not as important as salience, position or redundancy, but the weights are not insignificant showing that they indeed add some value. The ablation tests in Table 5 also demonstrate the removing the content features hurts performance of the Classifier as well as the Selector.\n\n*Regarding your question on inconsistency between training and testing for Eq (3):\nThe update for summary representation is consistent between training and testing for the Selector architecture. For the Classifier architecture, we use hard-updates at training time and soft-updates at testing time for the following reason: since the classifier model makes binary decision for each sentence, it may end up selecting too few or too many sentences for summary (this is not the case for Selector because we stop selecting sentences once the desired summary length is reached). Therefore we run the classifier on all sentences, and sort them in the decreasing order of their probability of being in summary, and chose the top sentences in that order until the desired summary length is reached. Since we use soft probabilities in making decisions, we also use soft updates of the summary representation at test time so that it is consistent with our sentence selection mechanism.\n\n* Regarding your comment on beam search:\nWe agree beam search will improve the performance of both models. However, so far as the comparison between the two architectures is concerned, greedy algorithm is used on both of them, so it is fair. We will definitely update the numbers with beam search upon acceptance."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Classify or Select: Neural Architectures for Extractive Document Summarization", "abstract": "We present two novel and contrasting Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based architectures for extractive summarization of documents.

These two models basically use either classification or ranking in a sequential order to pick the candidate sentences for summarization. Experiments in this paper show the results are either better or close to the SOTA.\n\nTechnical comments:\n\n- In equation (1), there is a position-relevant component call \"positional importance\". I am wondering how important this component is? Is it possible to show the performance without this component? Especially, for the discussion on impact of document structure, when the model is trained on the shuffled order but tested on the original order.\n- A similar question about equation (1), is the content-richness component really necessary? Since the score function already has salience part, which could measure how important of $h_j$ with respect to the whole document.\n- For the dynamic summary representation in equation (3), why not use the same updating equation for both training and test procedures? During test time, the model actually knows the decisions that have been made so far by the decoder. In this way, the model will be more consistent during training and test. \n- I think section 5 is the most interesting part of this paper, and it is also convincing on the difference between the two architectures.\n- It is a little disappointing that the decoding algorithm used in this paper is too simple.

I just ran some analysis on the output of the Classifier and Selector, and what I found is that the Classifier picks the first sentence of the document as its top prediction for summary 38% of the time, while the Selector picks it only 16% of the time. Also, the first two sentences of the document are found in the Classifier's top 5 predictions 80% of the time, whereas the Selector includes them in the top 5 predictions only 65% of the time. Therefore, we do have some evidence that the Classifier is learning the pattern that the beginning sentences are important for summary simply by virtue of its architecture, and independent of the positional features. This hypothesis is also vindicated by the simulation experiment we ran in Section 5 where random shuffling of sentences in the training data makes the Classifier degrade much more than the Selector, since the former's architecture is no longer applicable to the input data.\n\n(2) Sentence compression is definitely a related task, but it is not immediately obvious how our models could apply to this task since they only do extraction at sentence level. Perhaps you are referring to extracting words in a sentence in an analogous manner to extracting sentences in a document? If yes, this is a very interesting idea, but one limitation could be that our compression will only consist of deletion and re-ordering of words in the original sentence. State-of-the-art abstractive sentence compression models such as NAMAS [Rush et al, ACL 2015] and [Nallapati et al, CoNLL `16] achieve compression by also paraphrasing, which lends them more modeling strength. However, this idea is certainly worth trying, and we may consider this as part of our future work.

Our hypothesis is that the Classifier exploits the document structure (such as discourse, and story development patterns used by journalists in news stories) in its sequential decision making, but may not offer advantages in other settings where such structure is less apparent. To validate this hypothesis, we randomly shuffled all the sentences in each document at training time, and trained both architectures on the shuffled data. As reported in Table 3 and discussed in section 5 under the heading \"Impact of Document Structure\", we do see a role reversal as predicted by our hypothesis, where the Selector indeed outperforms the Classifier on shuffled data. We argued that this simulation experiment offers preliminary evidence that Selector can be superior to Classifier in real-world scenarios such as multi-document summarization (where there is no logical ordering of sentences across document boundaries) and summarization of Tweets on a given topic (where each Tweet is usually independent of other Tweets).

Two for absolute position indices in forward and backward directions, and two for relative positions in forward and backward directions. For the absolute positions, we simply count the sentence id in both directions, e.g., if a document has five sentences, the first sentence from beginning would get a forward index of 0 and a backward index of 4. Since these indices do not capture document length information, we also use relative positions by normalizing sentence index by document length and putting the normalized value into one of K quantized bins, where K is constant across all documents, e.g., in the above document with five sentences, using K=3, the sentences would get forward indices of (0,0,1,2,2) and backward indices of (2,2,1,0,0). Likewise, a document with 10 sentences would get forward indices of (0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,2,2). Once we get all 4 types of positional indices for each sentence, we look up the corresponding embedding matrices to retrieve their respective positional embedding vectors and concatenate them together into a single long vector. These positional embedding matrices are initialized at random values and are learned automatically by the model at training time. In our work, we used K=10, and a positional embedding of size 50 for each type, resulting in a concatenated vector of size 200.\nThanks\n-Ramesh "}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Classify or Select: Neural Architectures for Extractive Document Summarization", "abstract": "We present two novel and contrasting Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based architectures for extractive summarization of documents.
