(2020). The algorithm is demonstrably faster than existing methods in experiments resembling those from Bunel et al. (2020). The idea of applying a dual active set method is arguably quite straightforward from an optimization perspective. What makes the contribution in this paper strong is \n\n(1) A good implementation in multiple ways. The performance of active set methods highly depends on the how the sets are maintained (section 3.2). Also, making the algorithm run efficiently in practice requires taking advantage of GPUs and the neural network structure (section 3.3, G). I believe that without doing these well, it is likely that such an approach would be significantly slower than existing methods. I look forward to seeing the authors code released.\n\n(2) Providing the proper context for the work -- The paper builds upon prior contributions from Anderson et al. and other works that study the dual aspect of the problem. The authors do a good job explaining how their work fits in and how it compares to other approaches. This both provides a nice theoretical grounding for this work and is also useful pedagogically.\n\n(3) Detailed experiments on reasonably sized neural networks and providing hyperparameters.\n\nTwo things I would like the authors to address:\n\n(1) Experimental results - CPU-only\n\nHow does an all CPU version of the algorithm compare to Gurobi? This would be a better apples-to-apples comparison since commercial solvers do not make use GPUs. I would understand if a CPU-only implementation is slower since Gurobi is highly-tuned.\n\n(2) Comparison with Tjandraatmadja et al. (2020)\n\nI would like the authors to contrast their approach more against the the one by Tjandraatmadja et al. The formulations used there are different (and the focus of that paper is different), they do describe a cutting plane approach, which in a sense can be viewed as an approach that incrementally increases the number of dual variables. The authors can either do so here in the response, or if they think it would benefit the paper add it in.\n\n-------------------------\nUpdate after author response:\nThanks to the authors for addressing my questions!", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper126/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper126/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Scaling the Convex Barrier with Active Sets", "authorids": ["~Alessandro_De_Palma1", "~Harkirat_Behl1", "~Rudy_R_Bunel1", "~Philip_Torr1", "~M._Pawan_Kumar1"], "authors": ["Alessandro De Palma", "Harkirat Behl", "Rudy R Bunel", "Philip Torr", "M.

Unsurprisingly, the bottle neck for this approach is the computation of lower bounds, which can be translated into a non-linear (and NP-hard) optimization problem. Dual solvers typically instead attempt to solve a linear formulation of the problem, and recently Anderson et al. introduced a new MIP formulation for the problem which is more accurate than previously used formulations at the cost of potentially requiring a significantly larger number of constraints.\n\nIn this work, the authors introduce a dual solver called \"Active Set\" that is designed to solve Anderson's tighter formulation, with the aim of achieving increased accuracy while keeping the computational costs low. The solver seems correct, even though I couldn't verify the details; generally speaking, it operates by starting with the easier but less accurate formulation that is classically used, and making it more precise by the gradual introduction of (an \"active set\" of) variables from a modified version of Anderson et al's more accurate formulation. Experimental evaluations show that the new solver can be used both for incomplete verification and complete verification; in both cases, it is possible to use Active Set to obtain an implementation that can either achieve higher accuracy (for incomplete verification) or avoid a timeout for a greater percentage of instances (for complete verification). \n\nThe paper is well written. The preliminaries and writeup in general are clearly aimed at experts with some background knowledge in the given area (which prevented me from verifying the technical details), but I believe that it fits well within the scope of ICLR. The main contribution is the design of a new solver and its experimental evaluation; the theoretical contribution is negligible. It is also easy to imagine that there could be many alternate ways one could use Anderson et al.'s recent formulation to improve the state of the art - in that sense, the results achieved by the authors are not surprising. But that does not mean that there were no challenges left to overcome, and the experimental evaluations seem to be reasonable. So I think that the paper's contribution is sufficient to warrant a presentation at ICLR.\n\nQuestion:\n-Are there other \"standard\" datasets that could be considered instead of CIFAR-10, and would it be difficult to also use these for experimental evaluations?\n\nMinor remarks:\n-page 2: \"if more compute budget is...\"  should be \"if a larger computational budget is...\"\n\nPost-rebuttal comment:\nI acknowledge having read the authors' response and I have also glanced over the updated version of the paper.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper126/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper126/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Scaling the Convex Barrier with Active Sets", "authorids": ["~Alessandro_De_Palma1", "~Harkirat_Behl1", "~Rudy_R_Bunel1", "~Philip_Torr1", "~M._Pawan_Kumar1"], "authors": ["Alessandro De Palma", "Harkirat Behl", "Rudy R Bunel", "Philip Torr", "M.

The README.md file contains instructions for reproducing the experiments. We will nevertheless also release all our code in a public repository right away upon publication.\n\n**Reviewer's remarks.**\na) We adjusted the notation to reflect that $\\hat{x}_n$ is a scalar. In the formulation of equation (1), activations after the input layer are optimization variables subject to equality constraints, and thus need to be optimized over. This is a consequence of representing the layers as constraints (rather as a composite function in the objective function). Moreover, for verification, we do not need the solution to be unique.\nb) We have fixed the capitalization in the references.\nc) As in previous work (Bunel et al 2020a, Dvijotham et al. 2018), we require that the minimisation of equation (10) can be performed in closed-form. We have now clarified this in the paper.\nd) The restriction to piecewise-linear functions is inherited from the formulation by Anderson et al., for which we provide a dual solver. However, the dual active set framework can be generalised to any LP formulation that features an efficient separation oracle."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper126/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper126/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Scaling the Convex Barrier with Active Sets", "authorids": ["~Alessandro_De_Palma1", "~Harkirat_Behl1", "~Rudy_R_Bunel1", "~Philip_Torr1", "~M._Pawan_Kumar1"], "authors": ["Alessandro De Palma", "Harkirat Behl", "Rudy R Bunel", "Philip Torr", "M.

We clarified our explanation in Appendix B1. In practice, Big-M achieves bounds close to optimality for problem (2) in a time which is competitive with existing solvers for the Planet relaxation: see Figure 2 (a). Its effectiveness is further confirmed on complete verification, Figure 3.\nAnalogously, Active Set provably converges to the bounds of the primal of the current restricted dual problem. \nAgain, the effectiveness of the produced bounds is demonstrated empirically. In Figure 1, Active Set (AS) yields tighter bounds than \u201cGurobi 1 cut\u201d in a fraction of its runtime and significantly tightens the bounds from Planet-based methods (\u201cGurobi Planet\u201d, BDD+, Big-M). This is further confirmed by the performance of AS in complete verification (in spite of the additional computational cost with respect to BDD+).\n\nFor what concerns the optimization algorithm: any variant of gradient descent can be employed within Active Set (and Big-M). We clarified this in the paper.\nWhile, differently from Adam [1], vanilla GD would provably converge to the solution of equation (8), the choice of Adam as optimizer  for the experiments was dictated by empirical reasons. In fact, Adam is less sensitive to the step size schedule and displayed faster empirical convergence in our experiments. This is in line with previous dual solvers on looser relaxations (Bunel et al. 2020a, Dvijotham et al. 2018).\nIn order to prove effective on complete verification, we seek to maximise short-term bound improvement rather than to systematically reach optimality. \n\n**Point 2.**\nIt is possible to converge to the complete $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ (and then, to the optimal solution of the relaxation) with suitable modifications of the selection criterion (e.g., by converging on the restricted problem after each variable addition and recovering the primal optimal solution via the scheme by (Sherali and Choi, 1996)).  \nHowever, in the context of efficient neural network verification, our goal is to rapidly improve upon the bounds from the Planet relaxation, rather than to converge to the optimality of problem (6). \nAs explained in section 3.2, this was the motivation behind our selection criterion design.\nFinally, we would like to stress that adding a number of variables larger than quadratic defeats the purpose of the relaxation by Anderson et al.. In fact, the quadratic \u201cextended\u201d formulation would then be preferable (see equation (26) in appendix F.2).\n\nWe added a set of experiments on selection criterion and frequency in Appendix I.4. For the selection criterion, we test against random variable selection (by uniformly sampling the $I_k$ masks). It can be seen that random mask selection only marginally improves upon the Planet relaxation bounds, whereas the improvement becomes significant with our selection criterion (section 3.2). Moreover, our selection criterion is rather robust with respect to variable addition frequency, and tends to perform better if variables are added earlier. This makes it particularly suitable for neural network verification.\n\n**Remaining points.**\n4. Thanks for pointing this out. We have clarified this in the paper. \n5. As stated in the first paragraph of section 2.1, we consider the relaxed LP, rather than the IP.\n6. Yes, as per the previous point.\n\n\n[1] On the Convergence of Adam and Beyond, Sashank J.

Essentially, it takes the tightened ReLU relaxation of (Anderson et al. 2020), builds its Lagrangian dual, and then applies a column generation scheme to accommodate the explosion of decision variables. The authors present computational results showing that, due to the amenability of the methods to GPU accelaration, they can produce stronger verification bounds than comparable methods working with weaker relaxations in a modest amount more time. Moreover, they show that the method can be successfully embedded in a branch-and-bound-like framework for exact verification.\n\nI like the paper and think it makes a good contribution to the literature. The paper builds heavily on (Anderson 2020), but the algorithm approach is very different and the authors clearly had to do some work (e.g. rederiving the dual to ensure efficient inner problem solves, making convolutions+masking work on the GPU) to make everything work out. The computational results also seem compelling, though I have some potential concerns about the comparison being made.\n\nMy main concern is the use of \"Gurobi 1 cut\" as the baseline for comparison. Given that there is a one-to-one mapping between cuts in the primal formulation (Gurobi 1 cut) and variables in the dual formulation (the new approach), I am curious why the authors did not choose symmetric generation schemes for the two. Would the solve times be significantly lower if only one cut per layer is added (as in ActiveSet), instead of one per neuron? If so, what benefit do multiple iterations of cut generation offer? Is LP incrementalism or warm-starting used, or is the second LP solved from scratch? Even with these changes, I would imagine that the ActiveSet method still runs (much?) faster than the primal approach, but it's quite possible that the bound improvement would shrink.\n\nMinor comments:\n* p1: The phrasing \"The main bottleneck of the above approach\" is ambigious (which approach?). If the approach includes (ii), then the bottleneck will be the enumeration tree, not the convex subproblems.\n* p2: The \"which is linearly-sized\" reads like it applies to the optimal solution of (2), not the formulation (2) itself.\n* p18: I think there are some extra primes in the text of Appendix F.2.", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper126/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper126/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Scaling the Convex Barrier with Active Sets", "authorids": ["~Alessandro_De_Palma1", "~Harkirat_Behl1", "~Rudy_R_Bunel1", "~Philip_Torr1", "~M._Pawan_Kumar1"], "authors": ["Alessandro De Palma", "Harkirat Behl", "Rudy R Bunel", "Philip Torr", "M.
