However, in Fig 3c, the convergence of LB + diagonal Fisher is much faster than LB + full Fisher. In fact, it is roughly equal to the convergence of LB which has much smaller variance.

However, convergence is not only related to the variance but also the covariance structure. In this paper, we found some surprising counter-intuitive phenomenon. In particular, the following three methods: the gradients of LB + diag Fisher, LB + full Fisher and SB have roughly the same variance (see Fig 3b). However, in Fig 3c, the convergence of LB + diagonal Fisher is much faster than LB + full Fisher. In fact, it is roughly equal to the convergence of LB. Moreover, over the convex-quadratic setting, we give a theoretical convergence guarantee for FB (full-batch) + diagonal Fisher and FB + full Fisher in terms of their Frobenius norms. We demonstrate that the Frobenius norm analysis carries over to deep neural networks in our experiments.\n\n-In a recent comprehensive study on LB training [1], the authors showed that epoch-budget training favors SB regime and is disadvantageous for LB. Moreover, the work of [2] shows that LB\u2019s generalization performance can be remedied by extending the number of epochs trained. In this paper, we demonstrated that using diagonal Fisher noise allows us to improve LB generalization performance within an epoch-budget training (and in addition, retaining LB\u2019s fast convergence per iteration). \n\n-Analyzing optimization and generalization together: In this paper, we examined both the optimization and generalization performance of LB training in unison rather than separately. Recent works (for example, [3]) indicates that optimization and generalization in deep learning cannot be decoupled. \n\n[1]: Shallue, Christopher J., et al. \"Measuring the Effects of Data Parallelism on Neural Network Training.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.03600 (2018) \n[2]: Hoffer, Elad, Itay Hubara, and Daniel Soudry. \"Train longer, generalize better: closing the generalization gap in large batch training of neural networks.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2017.\n[3]: Neyshabur, Behnam, et al. \"Exploring generalization in deep learning.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2017.\n\n============================================================================================\n\nSummary of changes:\n\n-Revised Section 3.3 \n-Minor rewriting of Section 4.3 as suggested by Reviewer 2 to remove previous confusions about experimental setup\n-Added paragraph at end of Theorem 3.1 discussing how taking C=0 impacts optimization and generalization.

However, the main contribution of the paper is the surprising role of variance we mentioned in the summary of contribution. Generalization improvement is a bonus of the curvature noise where we gave a detailed discussion. We will revise the paper in the camera-ready version to make these points more clear in the writing. Additionally, running batch size 4K with ResNet44 or VGG16 on ImageNet is really out of our capability (In [1], to fit batch size 8192 with ResNet50, they use 256 GPUs and 50Gbit of network bandwidth).\n\nBetter optimization scheme could either mean a lower train loss or faster convergence.

Regarding the generalization analysis, we agree that it is not a complete picture. However, within the current uniform stability framework that we work with in Appendix B, there is little or nothing more we can do. It is not possible to explicitly measure the difference of the determinant of the diffusion matrix $\\Sigma_S(t)$ between taking full Fisher and diagonal Fisher. In that case, we would like to ask what type of theoretical analysis the reviewer wishes to see? It would be certainly interesting to provide rigorous guarantees for LB + diagonal Fisher and LB + full Fisher in the non-convex deep learning setting. However, we believe that this would be far too ambitious a task and the state of current deep learning theory offers no tools for us to do so.  Additionally, the focus of the paper is the optimization difference among choices of curvature noise.\n\nIn [1], all plots are present as out-of-sample-error (generalization) vs. steps. We can see that the model degradation of LB can be explained by not having enough optimization updates, which suggests a better optimization scheme is at least an important sign of better generalization.\n\n[1]: Shallue, Christopher J., et al. \"Measuring the Effects of Data Parallelism on Neural Network Training.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.03600 (2018) "}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper705/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper705/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper705/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Exploring Curvature Noise in Large-Batch Stochastic Optimization", "abstract": "Using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with large batch-sizes to train deep neural networks is an increasingly popular technique.

The generalization bound is given by Eqn. 11 where the right-hand side is given by a Hellinger distance between two probability distributions. Since we are working over the convex-quadratic setting, we have Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and the Hellinger distance is given by Eqn. 13. As t is going to infinity, the term of importance are the determinants of the diffusion matrices $\\Sigma_S(t)$. In page 14 of our paper, we gave the formula for the determinant of $\\Sigma_S(t)$ for the cases where the noise is either identity or full Fisher. For full Fisher, we see that there is less dependence on the data (more robust) and for identity, we have more dependence on the data (given by the denominator term) and so we choose diagonal Fisher as a middle ground. That explains why diagonal Fisher gives a better generalization than LB.\n\nFurthermore, from a heuristic standpoint, we provided experiments on the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian and marginal variance of the gradients. In Figure 3b), we find that the marginal variance of the gradients for LB + diag F is much larger than LB and similar to SB/LB + full Fisher. In Figure 3c), we find that the maximum eigenvalue of LB + diag F is smaller than the baseline LB + GBN. While the connection is not completely explicit, the fact that such heuristics are correlated with generalization performance has been discussed extensively in the literature; for example in [1, 2, 3, 4]. \n\nFrom [5], the time-to-target-validation (generalization) is explained purely by optimization considerations.

We address them as follows:\n\n- Motivation for using diagonal Fisher to improve generalization\n\nIn the convex-quadratic setting, we provided a theoretical analysis in Appendix B of how choosing different noise covariance structures in Eqn. 2 impacts the generalization error. The choice of noise covariance equal to Fisher and equal to identity are extreme cases and diagonal Fisher represents a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d. The Hellinger distance is much smaller when diagonal Fisher is chosen compared to identity leading to a tighter generalization bound in Eqn. 11. \n    \nMoreover, the experiments show that taking the diagonal preserves some generalization benefits of full Fisher. An example of this is reported in Table 1 where we trained ResNet-44 model on CIFAR-10, the validation accuracy for full Fisher was 93.22 while diagonal Fisher was 92.72 (whereas the baseline LB + GBN is 91.92).\n\n- Results without linear scaling\n\nWe have included extra experiments with square-root scaling in Appendix E. Indeed, in the experiments, full Fisher has the same behavior as SB and no LR scaling is required for it. However, for diagonal Fisher, since the optimization property is closer to LB, the learning rate needs to be scaled (either linear or square root) to get optimal performance.  \n\n- ImageNet experiments\n\nWell-designed experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10/100 have a good track record of generalizing to large datasets such as ImageNet.  In the recent systematic studies of LB training in [1], many of the experimental results are qualitatively consistent between different datasets (ranging from MNIST to Open Images) and architectures (ranging from Fully Connected to ResNet-50) within epoch-budget regimes.\n\nWe want to iterate that the central focus of our paper is not an empirical study on closing generalization gap of LB. Rather, we discovered adding diagonal Fisher gradient noise to LB gives significantly better optimization performance than full Fisher (and also SB) while they roughly share the same gradient variance and improving generalization of LB. We gave a full justification in the convex-quadratic setting.\n\nWe thank the reviewer again for responding in such a timely manner. Please let us know if there are more concerns with any other parts of the paper. \n\n[1]: Shallue, Christopher J., et al. \"Measuring the Effects of Data Parallelism on Neural Network Training.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.03600 (2018) \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper705/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper705/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper705/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Exploring Curvature Noise in Large-Batch Stochastic Optimization", "abstract": "Using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with large batch-sizes to train deep neural networks is an increasingly popular technique.

The convergence theory part mostly only cares about optimization, so I would be more interested in seeing the motivation from the generalization perspective for diagonal Fisher noise.\n2.

As the proposed Fisher noise is to account for the noise component, it is expected to have similar behavior to small-batch SGD. \n3.

We address the reviewer\u2019s concerns:\n\n-\u201cAs a caveat, I think the authors should also point out that the convergence rate would be best when C is set to 0 in the result of the theorem. This implies no noise is used during SGD updates. However, this would imply the regularization effect from the noise will also vanish which would lead to poor generalization.\u201d\n\nThe reviewer completely understands our point here. We do thank the reviewer for raising this point and in the latest version of our paper, we added this remark right after Theorem 3.1. \n\n-\u201dthe learning rate is linearly scaled proportional to the large batch-size with a warmup scheme similar to Goyal et al (2017) and ghost batch normalization is used similar to Hoffer et al (2017). The former two tricks have individually been shown on their own to close the generalization gap for large batch-size training on large datasets like ImageNet.\u201d\n\nThe learning rate scheduling in Goyal et al, 2017 (linear scaling w.r.t. batch-size) and Hoffer et al, 2017 (square-root scaling w.r.t. batch-size) indeeds helps generalization in their experiments. However, the recent paper of [1] shows that there is no optimal learning-rate scaling scheme. As long as the learning rate scheduling is consistent for all LB methods, we can accurately measure the gain in performance from utilizing diagonal Fisher. In the latest version of our paper, we added square-root scaling in Table 3 of Appendix E for completeness purposes. \n\n-\u201dFinally, the accuracy numbers for the proposed method is only marginally better than the baseline where isotropic noise is added to the large batch-size gradient.\u201d\n\nWe thank the reviewer for bring into attention this confusion in writing. In Table 1, Isotropic + GBN is not exactly the baseline with isotropic Gaussian noise. In the main body of the text, what isotropic means is isotropic Gaussian noise scaled by trace of Fisher matrix. We apologize for this lack of clarity and have revised the writing in the most recent version. What this means is that in Eqn. 2 of the paper, we choose the covariance matrix D to be square-root of trace of Fisher and not the identity matrix. In fact, this is an important point in the paper: the choice of a covariance matrix D in Eqn. 2 has strong implications for both optimization and generalization performance. The reported numbers in Table 1 demonstrates that if we choose D to be Tr(F), we improve over the baseline (taken from Hoffer et al, 2017) but not as good as our proposed method in the last column. \n\nWe add that if we choose the covariance matrix D to be identity (isotropic Gaussian noise), then the performance is significantly worse. \n\n-\u201cConcerning expected gradient over joint distribution on dataset is approximately zero\u201d\n\nWe thank the reviewer for raising this point and we change the writing accordingly to remove previous confusions.  \n\nAgain, we appreciate the insightful comments made by this reviewer.

We address the reviewer\u2019s concerns: \n\n-\u201cThe idea of exploring the curvature information in the noise in SGD has been studied in (Hoffer et al. 2017). The difference between this approach and the proposed method in the paper is the use of diagonal fisher instead of the empirical fisher.\u201d\n\nHoffer et al, 2017 discussed intrinsic curvature noise in SGD (as do many other recent papers such as Smith et al, 2017, Chaudhari et al, 2017, etc.). The proposed solutions in all these papers did not explicitly implement any form of empirical Fisher gradient noise. The main approach implemented in Hoffer et al, 2017 is the use of Ghost-Batch Normalization (GBN). GBN, similar to usual BN, should be thought as an architectural modification rather than incorporating curvature noise information. In addition, the training procedure is elongated for LB. However, extending the training regime for LB is against the very goal of using LB in the first place. In contrast, we show that using diagonal Fisher noise preserves the desirable convergence performance of LB training per parameter update and significantly improves generalization performance of LB without training longer.\n\n- \u201cAlthough there is convergence analysis provided under convex quadratic setting, I feel that the motivation behind using diagonal fisher for faster convergence is not clear to me, although in the experiment part, the comparison of some of the statistics of diagonal fisher appear similar to the small batch SGD. The intuition of using diagonal fisher for faster convergence in generalization performance is still missing from my perspective.\u201d\n\nThe intuition can be understood in the following way. In Fig 1, we notice that the empirical full Fisher update is orthogonal to the loss curvature. Thus, adding full Fisher noise to the gradients gives large perturbation in the high curvature direction, which leads to a higher expected training loss. In comparison, only taking the diagonal results in a smaller perturbation in the high curvature direction, which leads to a smaller expected training loss. \n\nThis is quantified in Theorem 3.1 for the convex quadratic setting. The overall convergence rate of the bound is O(1/k) but the constant is Tr(C^TAC). The difference between using full Fisher (C=\\sqrt{A}) and diagonal Fisher is (C=\\sqrt{diag A}) is exactly the difference between their Frobenius norms. We show that this carries over to the deep learning setting: in Figure 3a), we show that the Frobenius norm of full Fisher is much larger than that of diagonal Fisher. Finally, in Fig 3c), we showed that FB (full-batch) + diagonal Fisher attains much faster training than FB + full Fisher, which verifies the above-mentioned statement.\n\n-\u201cIn the convergence analysis, as there is a difference between the full fisher and diagonal fisher in the Tr(C\u2019AC) term. It would be interesting to see the effect of how this term play on convergence rate, and also how this term scale with batch size. But this is more of a minor issue as we are mostly caring about its generalization performance which is different from optimization error convergence.\u201d\n\nThe difference between the Frobenius norm of the Fisher matrix and diagonal Fisher matrix is independent of the batch-sizes involved. That being said, the batch-sizes are used in the coefficient \\sqrt{N-M}{NM} before the diagonal Fisher term in Algorithm 1. \n\n-\u201cThe experiments are conducted on MNIST and CIFAR-10/100, which I feel is a bit insufficient for a paper that deals with generalization gap in large batch. As in large batch training, we care more about bigger dataset such as ImageNet, and hence I would expect results reported on various models on ImageNet.\u201c \n\nThe reason that all of our experiments were conducted on smaller models and datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10/100 are due to constraints in computing resources. We did not have the computing power or budget to run experiments on ImageNet. However, we feel that the empirical analysis given in our paper addresses key research questions concerning both convergence and generalization of LB training. \n\n-\u201cAnother interesting thing to show would be the generalization error over epochs for different methods, which could give a more detailed characterization of the behavior of different methods.\u201d \nPlease see Appendix E in the latest version of our paper. \n\nIn light of the changes that we made suggested by the reviewer as well as the contributions in our meta-review, we would appreciate if the reviewer can reconsider their score.

The author reasons about the effectiveness in SGD small batch training by looking at the curvature structure of the noise. Instead of using the na\u00efve empirical fisher matrix, the authors propose to use diagonal fisher noise for large batch SGD training for DNNs. The proposed method is shown empirically to achieve both comparable generalization and the training speedup compared to small batch training. A convergence analysis is provided for the proposed method under convex quadratic setting. \n\nThe idea of exploring the curvature information in the noise in SGD has been studied in (Hoffer et al. 2017). The difference between this approach and the proposed method in the paper is the use of diagonal fisher instead of the empirical fisher. Although there is convergence analysis provided under convex quadratic setting, I feel that the motivation behind using diagonal fisher for faster convergence is not clear to me, although in the experiment part, the comparison of some of the statistics of diagonal fisher appear similar to the small batch SGD. The intuition of using diagonal fisher for faster convergence in generalization performance is still missing from my perspective. \n\nIn the convergence analysis, as there is a difference between the full fisher and diagonal fisher in the Tr(C\u2019AC) term. It would be interesting to see the effect of how this term play on convergence rate, and also how this term scale with batch size. But this is more of a minor issue as we are mostly caring about its generalization performance which is different from optimization error convergence. \n\nIn the experiments section, the authors claim that noise structure is only important for the first 50 epochs. But it would be better if the authors could show experimental results of using the same training method all the way during the experiment. The experiments are conducted on MNIST and CIFAR10 and 100, which I feel is a bit insufficient for a paper that deals with generalization gap in large batch. As in large batch training, we care more about bigger dataset such as ImageNet, and hence I would expect results reported on various models on ImageNet. Another interesting thing to show would be the generalization error over epochs for different methods, which could give a more detailed characterization of the behavior of different methods.\n\nOverall, I feel the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method is not clear enough and experimental studies are not sufficient for understanding the behavior of the proposed method as an empirical paper.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper705/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Exploring Curvature Noise in Large-Batch Stochastic Optimization", "abstract": "Using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with large batch-sizes to train deep neural networks is an increasingly popular technique.

This paper proposes to add noise sampled from diagonal \"empirical\" Fisher matrix to the large batch gradient as a method for closing the generalization gap. The authors motivate the use of empirical Fisher for sampling noise by arguing that the covariance of gradients from small batch-sizes can be seen as approximately equal to a scaled version of the Fisher matrix. It is then pointed out that using the Fisher matrix directly to sample noise could in principle close the generalization gap but would lead to slow converegence similar to SGD with a small batch-size. The authors then claim that the convergence speed is better when noise is sampled from the diagonal Fisher matrix instead of the full Fisher matrix. This claim is proven in theory for a convex quadratic loss surface and experiments are conducted to empirically verify this claim both in the quadratic setting are for realistic deep networks. Finally an efficient method for sampling noise from the diagonal empirical Fisher matrix is proposed.\n\nComments:\nI think the paper is very well written and the results are presented clearly. In terms of novelty, I found the argument about convergence using diagonal Fisher being faster compared with full Fisher quite interesting, and its application for large batch training to be insightful. \n\nAs a minor comment, for motivating theorem 3.1, it is pointed out by the authors that the diagonal Fisher acts as an approximation of the full Fisher and hence their regularization effects should be similar while convergence should be faster for diagonal Fisher. As a caveat, I think the authors should also point out that the convergence rate would be best when C is set to 0 in the result of the theorem. This implies no noise is used during SGD updates. However, this would imply the regularization effect from the noise will also vanish which would lead to poor generalization. \n\n\nHowever, there is a crucial detail that makes the main argument of the paper weak. In the main experiments in section 4.3, for the proposed large batch training method, the authors mention that they use a small batch-size of 128 for the first 50 epochs similar to Smith et al (2017) and then switch to the large batch-size of 4096, at which point, the learning rate is linearly scaled proportional to the large batch-size with a warmup scheme similar to Goyal et al (2017) and ghost batch normalization is used similar to Hoffer et al (2017). The former two tricks have individually been shown on their own to close the generalization gap for large batch-size training on large datasets like ImageNet. This paper combines these tricks and adds noise sampled from the diagonal Fisher matrix on top when switching to large batch-size after epoch 50 and reports experiments on smaller datasets-- MNIST, Fashion MNIST and the CIFAR datasets. Finally, the accuracy numbers for the proposed method is only marginally better than the baseline where isotropic noise is added to the large batch-size gradient. For these reasons, I do not consider the proposed method a significant improvement over existing techniques for closing the generalization gap for large batch training.\n\nThere is also a statement in the paper that is problematic but can be fixed by re-writing. In the paper, empirical Fisher matrix, as termed by the authors in the paper, refers to the Fisher matrix where the target values in the dataset is used as the output of the model rather than sampling it from the model itself as done for computing the true Fisher matrix. This empirical (diagonal) Fisher matrix is used to sample noise which is added to the large batch gradient in the proposed method. It is mentioned that the covariance of the noise in small batch SGD is exactly same as the empirical Fisher matrix. This claim is premised on the argument that the expected gradient (over dataset) is unconditionally roughly 0, i.e., throughout the training. This is absolutely false. If this was the case, gradient descent (using full dataset) should not be able to find minima and this is far from the truth. Even if we compare the scale of expected gradient to the mini-batch gradient (for small batch-size), the scale of these two gradients at any point during training (using say small batch-size SGD) is of the same order. I am saying the latter statement from my personal experience. The authors can verify this as well.\n\nOverall, while I found the theoretical argument of the paper to be mostly interesting, I was dissapointed by the experimental details as they make the gains from the proposed method questionable when considered in isolation from the existing methods that close the generalization gap for large batch training.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper705/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Exploring Curvature Noise in Large-Batch Stochastic Optimization", "abstract": "Using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with large batch-sizes to train deep neural networks is an increasingly popular technique.
