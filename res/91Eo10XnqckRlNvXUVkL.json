One basic approach, called Helmholtz machine, involves\ntraining a top-down directed generative model together with a bottom-up\nauxiliary model that is trained to help perform approximate inference.\nRecent results indicate that better results can be obtained with better approximate\ninference procedures. Instead of employing more powerful procedures, we here\npropose to regularize the generative model to stay close to the class of\ndistributions that can be efficiently inverted by the approximate inference model.\nWe achieve this by interpreting both the top-down and the bottom-up\ndirected models as approximate inference distributions and by defining the model\ndistribution to be the geometric mean of these two. We present a lower-bound for\nthe likelihood of this model and we show that optimizing this bound\nregularizes the model so that the Bhattacharyya distance between the bottom-up\nand top-down approximate distributions is minimized. We demonstrate that we can\nuse this approach to fit generative models with many layers of hidden binary stochastic variables\nto complex training distributions and that this method prefers significantly\ndeeper architectures while it supports orders of magnitude more efficient\napproximate inference than other approaches.\n", "pdf": "/pdf/91Eo10XnqckRlNvXUVkL.pdf", "paperhash": "bornschein|bidirectional_helmholtz_machines", "conflicts": ["iro.umontreal.ca"], "authors": ["Jorg Bornschein", "Samira Shabanian", "Asja Fischer", "Yoshua Bengio"], "authorids": ["j.bornschein@gmail.com", "shabanis@iro.umontreal.ca", "fischer@iro.umontreal.ca", "yoshua.umontreal@gmail.com"]}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "tmdate": null, "cdate": 1454464564200, "ddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "duedate": 1455833700000, "tcdate": 1454464564200, "id": "ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/-/submission", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"pdf": null, "forum": null, "replyto": null, "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*", "description": "Your displayed identity associated with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"pdf": {"order": 4, "description": "Either upload a PDF file or provide a direct link to your PDF on ArXiv.", "value-regex": "upload|http://arxiv.org/pdf/.+"}, "title": {"order": 3, "description": "Title of paper.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "abstract": {"order": 4, "description": "Abstract of paper.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}, "authors": {"order": 1, "description": "Comma separated list of author names, as they appear in the paper.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "author_emails": {"order": 2, "description": "Comma separated list of author email addresses, in the same order as above.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "conflicts": {"order": 100, "description": "Semi-colon separated list of email domains of people who would have a conflict of interest in reviewing this paper, (e.g., cs.umass.edu;google.com, etc.).", "value-regex": "^([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))+(;[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))*$"}, "CMT_id": {"order": 5, "value-regex": ".*", "description": "If the paper is a resubmission from the ICLR 2016 Conference Track, enter its CMT ID; otherwise, leave blank."}}}, "invitees": [], "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "expdate": 1463609700000}}}], "count": 1}
