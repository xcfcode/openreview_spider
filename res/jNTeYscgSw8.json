The authors conclude that the classical softmax is significantly outperformed by the other approaches, but there is no clear winner among them. Moreover, the authors have noticed two interesting facts, (1) the choice of loss function affects only upper layers of neural networks with the lower layers being very similar to each other, (2) losses that result in greater class separation also result in higher accuracy, but their features are less transferable to other tasks.\n\nI agree with the authors that the comments of Reviewer 2 are shallow and not informative. Therefore, they were not taken into account in making the final decision and, as AC, I read the paper very carefully. Regarding Reviewer 4, however, I found his comments to be valid. There is a message that the authors want to communicate, and the reader that needs to decode this message using a noisy channel. Therefore, I encourage the authors to accordingly revise the paper to make the message much clearer. \n\nThe experimental papers that compare a wide spectrum of methods are always hard to judge and this judgement is often very subjective. There are several seminal papers of this type, but not so many for several reasons. I agree with the authors that such studies are very valuable and give evaluation being not biased by authors of a given method. They are also very time- and resource-consuming. But there should be a general consensus how such an experiment should be performed. The authors of the particular methods should also be able to give right feedback to make their methods to be run appropriately. Therefore, there exist several websites and initiatives that try to fulfill these requirements. As said above, any paper of this type will be judged very subjectively.  \n\nThe discoveries made by authors should also be presented in a different way. One should start with a hypothesis that, for example, the lower layers are not affected by the loss function and then perform appropriate theoretical and empirical studies to verify the hypothesis. The same applies to the other discovery. In that way the message of the paper would be much clearer. I suppose that analysis of each of the discoveries deserves its own paper. \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Demystifying Loss Functions for Classification", "authorids": ["~Simon_Kornblith1", "~Honglak_Lee2", "~Ting_Chen1", "~Mohammad_Norouzi1"], "authors": ["Simon Kornblith", "Honglak Lee", "Ting Chen", "Mohammad Norouzi"], "keywords": ["softmax", "classification", "representational similarity", "transfer learning", "label smoothing", "dropout"], "abstract": "It is common to use the softmax cross-entropy loss to train neural networks on classification datasets where a single class label is assigned to each example.

However, for specific benchmarks (of calibration, robustness, and linear transfer), some loss functions are clear winners. Conditioning publication of a paper on the demonstration that a method performs uniformly better than others leads to papers that compare only against methods to which the method is superior, on benchmarks where the method is superior. We agree that this leads to more exciting papers, but it is not always what\u2019s best for the field.\n\nWe believe it will be useful for future work to have accuracy numbers obtained from a wide range of well-tuned baselines for their novel methods or optimization frameworks, if only to confirm that these novel methods and optimization frameworks yield real improvements. For example, as we show in Table C.3, although the recently proposed Supervised Contrastive Learning (Khosla et. al, NeurIPS 2020) method substantially outperforms a cross-entropy baseline, it does not outperform the other objectives we examine.\n\n> \u201cBut since little novel technical contribution is made and the results seem not surprising\u201d\n\nOur main goal was to probe representational properties of neural networks trained with different loss functions, not to propose a novel technical method.

However, we challenge the reviewer\u2019s claim that the novelty of our paper is limited. We address the reviewer\u2019s concerns below.\n\n> Sec 3.1 \"Regularizers and alternate losses increase accuracy\" -- what is new here?\n\nAs stated in our general response to all reviewers, we believe most of the paper\u2019s novelty lies in Sections 3.3 and Section 3.4. That said, Section 3.1 also presents some novel findings:\n- We demonstrate that cosine softmax substantially improves both log-likelihood and out-of-distribution robustness over the other losses examined.\n- We show that ImageNet top-1 and top-5 accuracies are poorly correlated among different losses.\n- We demonstrate that combining multiple output regularization schemes doesn\u2019t improve accuracy, even though output regularization and data augmentation schemes (e.g., AutoAugment and Mixup) are roughly additive.\nDo you know of a paper that shows concrete support for any of these findings?\n\n> Sec 3.2 \"Different losses produce different predictions\" : again, why is this surprising? If the losses produced the same predictions, then they would all have the same accuracy. And we know this is not the case. [...] Different losses produce different predictions. but given that top-1 accuracies are nearly the same (table 1), the difference in figure 2 must mostly be contained in the predictions where the classifiers were wrong (respect to ground truth). in other words, there shouldn\u2019t be a significant difference in the cases where the classifiers agree with ground truth -- can the authors look into this?\n\nWe believe that the questions the reviewer asks regarding Section 3.2 are already addressed in Appendix Figure D.1 of the submitted paper. The left panel of this figure replicates Figure 1a; the middle panel shows the proportion of examples on which a pair of models are both either correct or incorrect; and the right panel shows agreement only on examples that pairs of models both get wrong. Although there are differences between these plots, they all look qualitatively similar.\n\nAs the reviewer intuits, the proportion of predictions on which models disagree must be at least as large as the difference in accuracy. However, as the reviewer later notes, the differences in accuracy are very small relative to the differences in predictions. Moreover, similarity in accuracy between losses does not correspond to similarity in predictions: sigmoid cross-entropy (77.9% top-1 accuracy) yields predictions more similar to softmax cross-entropy (77.0%) than to cosine softmax (77.9%). Appendix Figure D.1 (right) eliminates any possible confound with accuracy by considering agreement only on examples both models get incorrect.\n\nClearly there cannot be a difference in top-1 predictions if both models agree on the ground truth. But even when trained with the same loss function, different initializations result in substantially different sets of correctly classified examples, as shown in Appendix Figure D.1 (middle).\n\n> The only possibly novel contribution is that losses behave similarly in the earlier layers...entanglement or separation behaving differently in earlier vs. later blocks -- was already explored in Frosst et al 2019, so again here the novelty impact is limited\n\nOur understanding is that the reviewer believes that, since Frosst et al. have previously shown that class separation increases sharply at the end of the network, their results imply that the loss function does not affect the rest of the network. This does not seem quite right. Optimizing _a_ loss clearly affects all layers of the network; freezing the bottom half of the network would substantially reduce accuracy, and there are also large changes in representations of these layers from init. Because Frosst et al. investigate entanglement only in cross-entropy-trained networks, it is unclear to us how one could infer the effect of changing the loss on early layers from their results.\n\nIn Section 3.3 of our paper, we show that changing the loss does not affect most of the layers. The investigation in this section uses centered kernel alignment (CKA), which measures similarity of activations across layers of networks trained from different random initializations, without reference to the classes to which examples belong.\n\nIn Section 3.4 of our paper, we investigate class separation in networks\u2019 penultimate layers. Our point in this section is to show that (1) better-performing loss functions seem to lead to higher class separation and (2) greater class separation is associated with less transferable features. We don\u2019t believe either of these results are discussed by Frosst et al. Nonetheless, we will add Frosst et al. to the list of previous papers investigating class separation in our related work section."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2144/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2144/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Demystifying Loss Functions for Classification", "authorids": ["~Simon_Kornblith1", "~Honglak_Lee2", "~Ting_Chen1", "~Mohammad_Norouzi1"], "authors": ["Simon Kornblith", "Honglak Lee", "Ting Chen", "Mohammad Norouzi"], "keywords": ["softmax", "classification", "representational similarity", "transfer learning", "label smoothing", "dropout"], "abstract": "It is common to use the softmax cross-entropy loss to train neural networks on classification datasets where a single class label is assigned to each example.

It appears that discussing benchmark results of different losses distracted from our key contributions. We believe the benchmark results are useful for both researchers and practitioners, but we agree that such evaluation is not the most novel part of this paper. Out of the 4.5 pages of the paper dedicated to results, <1 page is devoted to benchmarking. The majority of our results section describes characteristics of representations of neural networks trained with different loss functions, a topic that we do not believe has been investigated in previous literature. Specifically:\n\n * In Section 3.3, we show that representations in the first two-thirds of the blocks of ResNet-50 networks trained with different loss functions are indistinguishable; the choice of loss function affects only later layers.\n * In Section 3.4, we examine how losses differ in the structure they impose on the penultimate layer. Losses that result in greater class separation also result in higher accuracy, but their features are less transferable to other tasks.\n\nIt seems the reviewers have reviewed a different paper from the one that we have submitted.

We already know this, otherwise these alternatives to vanilla cross-entropy wouldn't exist.\n- Sec 3.2 \"Different losses produce different predictions\" : again, why is this surprising? If the losses produced the same predictions, then they would all have the same accuracy. And we know this is not the case.\n- \"Mixup and auto-augment improve performance \" : already known.  \n- \"label smoothing improves calibration\" : already known\n\n The only possibly novel contribution is that losses behave similarly in the earlier layers, with most of the separation happening at the final layers. But this line --i.e., entanglement or separation behaving differently  in earlier vs. later blocks -- was already explored in Frosst et al 2019, so again here the novelty impact is limited. \n\n\nminor\n- dendrogram isn\u2019t very intuitive. can the authors show a 2-d cluster representation of the model predictions (for all seeds, and for all losses?)\n\nSuggestions on improving novelty:\n- For a conference devoted to learning representations, the authors should investigated  into why, for example,  different random seeds of squared error loss disagree with each other so much, while some other losses are more self-consistent.\n\n- Different losses produce different predictions. but given that top-1 accuracies are nearly the same (table 1), the difference in figure 2 must  mostly be contained in the predictions where the classifiers were wrong (respect to ground truth). in other words, there shouldn\u2019t be a significant difference in the cases where the classifiers agree with ground truth -- can the authors look into this?\n\n- At the start of the paper it is stated that  \"our goal is instead to understand when one might want to use\none loss function or regularizer over another\" : however, I do not see the paper providing any additional insights into this beyond what is already known.\n\nIn summary, lot of space is devoted to confirming earlier results, and while the  benchmarking is appreciated, a paper purely devoted to benchmarking but that only ends up confirming earlier results does not meet the bar.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n+ Frosst et al .Analyzing and Improving Representations with the Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss, ICML 2019", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2144/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2144/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Demystifying Loss Functions for Classification", "authorids": ["~Simon_Kornblith1", "~Honglak_Lee2", "~Ting_Chen1", "~Mohammad_Norouzi1"], "authors": ["Simon Kornblith", "Honglak Lee", "Ting Chen", "Mohammad Norouzi"], "keywords": ["softmax", "classification", "representational similarity", "transfer learning", "label smoothing", "dropout"], "abstract": "It is common to use the softmax cross-entropy loss to train neural networks on classification datasets where a single class label is assigned to each example.
