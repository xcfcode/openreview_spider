By writing \"the compressive Haar basis approximately keeps the length of an input signal\", I intended to mean the difference between full and compressive Haar basis (i.e.,  $|{\\Phi}^T_j X^{\\rm in}_j|\\approx|\\tilde{\\Phi}^T_j X^{\\rm in}_j|$). I understand that we want to expect that (5) holds. However, if I do not miss something, there are neither empirical nor theoretical justifications. For example, if  is orthogonal to the compressive Haar basis , the left-hand side of (5) is  and hence (5) is not true. Therefore, the authors should use some assumptions (either about Haar basis or data distribution) implicitly. I wanted the authors to clarify them.\n\nThank you for pointing out this problem. It is a very good question, and touches the essence of Haar basis construction. We apologize for the ambiguous interpretation. We have updated the formula (5) and changed the interpretation. From construction of Haar basis, in layer $j$ of the chain, the first $N_{j+1}$ basis vectors can be reduced to the full basis in the coarser level $j+1$, and these vectors provide the approximate representation of signal on $\\mathcal{G}_j$. This approximate information means  taking the average of the input data over the nodes in the same cluster. The compressive Haar transform can thus provide a pooling strategy. We compare it to the full Haar transform, as can be seen from the new formula (5). Some information in pooling has been lost and the pooled data has been integrated with the clustering structure. We give the proof of (5) in Appendix D in the modified version of paper.\n\n>Minor comments:\n>It makes it easier to read if the authors add to Section 3 that the authors defer the detail definition of the Haar basis to the later section (i.e., Section 4).\n\nThanks. We give an overview of the HaarPooling in Section 3 to give readers an intuitive impression of HaarPooling and compressive Haar basis. So we defer the mathematical definition of the Haar basis to Section 4.\n\n>Does the authors intentionally exclude the case of  (e.g., in Definition 1)?\n\nYes. We require $N_j>N_{j+1}$, $j=0,\\dots,K-1$. This makes sense as $N_{j+1}/N_j$ is the pooling ratio, which needs to be less than 1."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper214/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper214/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "HaarPooling: Graph Pooling with Compressive Haar Basis", "authors": ["Yu Guang Wang", "Ming Li", "Zheng Ma", "Guido Montufar", "Xiaosheng Zhuang", "Yanan Fan"], "authorids": ["yuguang.wang@unsw.edu.au", "ming.li.ltu@gmail.com", "mzheng@princeton.edu", "montufar@math.ucla.edu", "xzhuang7@cityu.edu.hk", "y.fan@unsw.edu.au"], "keywords": ["graph pooling", "graph neural networks", "tree", "graph classification", "graph regression", "deep learning", "Haar wavelet basis", "fast Haar transforms"], "abstract": "Deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are instrumental in graph classification and graph-based regression tasks.

The main contributions of this paper are not clear to me, compared with other SOTAs.\n\nIn the paper, we propose a new pooling method by using wavelet representation of the graph data. Compared with existing pooling methods, HaarPooling takes account of both node information and graph structure of the data, and it has fast implementation. In particular, HaarPooling has the following features.\n1. This makes GNNs possible to deal with input graph-structured data with different size and structure;\n2. HaarPooling uses the sparse Haar representation on chain structure. In each HaarPooling layer, the representation then combines the features of input $X_j^{\\rm in}$ with the geometric information of the graphs of the $j$th and $(j+1)$th layers of the chain; \n3. HaarPooling drops the high frequency (or detailed) information of the input data. The major data information (i.e. the low frequency coefficients) is preserved in the pooling, and the loss of the information is small; \n4.

Overall graph classification and regression tasks are quite important and this work provides a new way of\ntransitioning from node based learning methods to full graph representations via hierarchical compression. Nonetheless, I find that the organization of the paper needs additional work and the experimental investigation is not sufficient and compelling enough. So I do not think the current paper is ready for publication in a top-tier venue like ICLR yet.\n\nThank you for the helpful comments. We have provided our responses below and changed the paper with your suggestion. In particular, we have improved the organization of the paper. The experimental results we provided are for benchmark data sets used in testing models for graph classification. As can be seen from  Table 2, these data sets are widely used in testing new pooling methods. We have compared with almost all recent pooling algorithms. In addition, we add a 10 graph classification experiment in Appendix F on Triangles data set which contains 45000 graph data samples. The GNN with HaarPooling outperforms the recent result by SAGPooling (Lee et al., 2019).\n\n2. In particular I find the discussion of the HaarPooling step's computational performance not particularly appealing since other parts of the hierarchical approach are computationally expensive for example, the spectral clustering or GCN steps are costly.\n\nWe focus on the computational cost of HaarPooling only as graph convolution other than GCN can be used. In Appendix F, we use GNN equipped with GIN (Xu et al., 2018) and HaarPooling on a 10 graph classification task. In addition, in Appendix G, we add Table 6 which compares the time and space complexities and other properties of HaarPooling and other pooling methods. From the table, HaarPooling is the only one which time complexity is proportional to the number of nodes.\n\nSpectral clustering is one choice. Other clustering methods can replace spectral clustering. It is adopted because it usually has better performance especially there are isolated nodes in graph. The spectral clustering per se can also be accelerated by using compressive spectral clustering algorithm, see Tremblay et al. (2016).\n\n3. It also seems that the discussion of the paper is more on the computation and viability of the compressive Haar transform than it is about using it as a compressor as part of a larger hierarchical system.\n\nWe have compressed the paper and the discussion fast computation has been reduced a bit, which takes up around one and half pages. The paper is composed of the idea, modelling, computational strategy and experiments for HaarPooling.

The first $N_{j+1}$ members of $\\phi_{\\ell}^{(j)}$, $\\ell=1,\\dots,N_{j+1}$, are defined on the finer layer $j+1$, and can be reduced into the $\\phi_{\\ell}^{(j+1)}$, $\\ell=1,\\dots,N_{j+1}$, as follows.

It is better to write differently the all-one vector and the scalar one.\n\nThanks. In (10), the '1' is the scalar one.\n\n12. page 5, section 3.1 and page 7, (8): For the node $v$ in the $j$-th graph and $v'$ in the $(j+1)$-th graph, the authors use both of $v\\in v'$ (section 3.1)\nand $v'\\in {Pa}_\\mathcal{G}(v)$ (equation (8)) to denote the parent-child relationship. It is better to align the notation.\n\nWe now consistently use the notation in Section 3.1 (${Pa}_\\mathcal{G}(v)$) in the paper. The changes include (8) and the lines 2 and 4 in the equation of the proof of Theorem 3.1 in Appendix D.\n\n13. page 13, Appendix B: Could you write in the appendix how to construct the compressed Haar from the full counterpart (I suppose we should choose bases corresponding to $k=1$)?\n\nThe compressive Haar basis (and then the resulting compressive Haar transforms) for layer $j$ (which full Haar basis has $N_j$ vectors) is to take the first $N_{j+1}$ vectors of full Haar basis. We add a paragraph in the end of Appendix B to explain the construction of compressive Haar basis.\n\nQuestions\n\n14. In the paragraph starting with Locality on page 5, the paper says that the number of different values of the Haar basis is bounded by constant. I want the authors to make this sentence more precise. To be more specific, what \"the different values\" means (I imagine that it means the number of scalar values appearing as a component of some basis) and what \"constant\" means (with respect to which variable the \"constant\" is constant?)\n\nYes. The 'different number of values' means the number of different scalar values of components in a basis vector. The 'constant' is independent of layers $j$. We changed last sentence of the 'Locality' paragraph as '... the number of different scalar values of the components of a Haar basis vector $\\phi_{\\ell}^{(j)}$, $\\ell=1,\\dots,N_j$, is bounded by a constant independent of $j$.'.\n\n15. I think that the complexity of the direct matrix product is $\\mathcal{O}(N^2 C)$, where $N$ is the graph size and $C$ is the channel size (correct me if I am wrong). Therefore the result of Figure 5 was surprising to me because the direct matrix product takes approximately time. These look inconsistent to me unless the channel size is proportional to the node size.\n\nYes. The algorithmic complexity for matrix product is $\\mathcal{O}(N^2 C)$. We updated the fitting for the data for matrix product (previously we used only late half of the data samples). The resulting order is $\\mathcal{O}(N^{2.1})$ which is consistent to theoretical analysis as you mentioned. The figure is now in loglog plot.\n\n16. Equation (5) claimed that the compressive Haar basis approximately keeps the length of an input signal. I want to know how we can justify it (theoretically or empirically). I think that it is empirically correct for the Fourier basis that signal carries 'information' in the low-frequency domains and that high-frequency areas are noisy (e.g., NT and Maehara (2019); Ma et al., 2019). If this is the case for Haar transform, too, I understand that equation (5) holds and gives the justification that the proposed method can extract the information from lower frequencies.\n\nBy equation (5), we mean that the information in the compressive Haar transforms is close to that in the full Haar transforms for a graph signal. It does not imply the length of an input signal is preserved. In the Fourier domain, the length of the signal presentation is truncated and only low frequency coefficients are preserved. We discard high frequency coefficients but the resulting truncated presentation of the data is still close to the input signal as high frequencies carry the details of the data in the Haar representation."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper214/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper214/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "HaarPooling: Graph Pooling with Compressive Haar Basis", "authors": ["Yu Guang Wang", "Ming Li", "Zheng Ma", "Guido Montufar", "Xiaosheng Zhuang", "Yanan Fan"], "authorids": ["yuguang.wang@unsw.edu.au", "ming.li.ltu@gmail.com", "mzheng@princeton.edu", "montufar@math.ucla.edu", "xzhuang7@cityu.edu.hk", "y.fan@unsw.edu.au"], "keywords": ["graph pooling", "graph neural networks", "tree", "graph classification", "graph regression", "deep learning", "Haar wavelet basis", "fast Haar transforms"], "abstract": "Deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are instrumental in graph classification and graph-based regression tasks.

The authors argued that existing graph pooling methods have drawbacks (ignored node features, ignored the hierarchical structure of a graph or, computationally expensive in terms of space or time) and that the proposed method overcame these drawbacks. The proposed method extracts the low-frequency components of signals in terms of Haar decomposition on a chain of graphs. By the property of the Haar basis, we can compute the pooling matrix with the complexity proportional to the graph size. The paper empirically compared the proposed method with state-of-the-art pooling methods and graph NNs using well-known datasets.\n\n\nDecision\n\nAlthough this paper gave a novel pooling method by incorporating the Wavelet theory, I still have questions for the effectiveness of the proposed method in the real datasets and whether the proposed method solved the problems of existing methods the authors mentioned in the introduction (see the Suggestion section).

The general method utilizes a hierarchical chain of coarsened versions of the graph (group multiple nodes into a parent 'node')  where the coarsening is achieved via spectral clustering. After obtaining the graph chain, at each level the authors apply a GCN followed by a HaarPooling, namely applying a lossy Haar Transform compression to get a representation for each cluster. \n\nOverall graph classification and regression tasks are quite important and this work provides a new way of transitioning from node based learning methods to full graph representations via hierarchical compression. Nonetheless, I find that the organization of the paper needs additional work and the experimental investigation is not sufficient and compelling enough. So I do not think the current paper is ready for publication in a top-tier venue like ICLR yet.\n\nIn particular I find the discussion of the HaarPooling step's computational performance not particularly appealing since other parts of the hierarchical approach are computationally expensive for example, the spectral clustering or GCN steps are costly. It also seems that the discussion of the paper is more on the computation and viability of the compressive Haar transform than it is about using it as a compressor as part of a larger hierarchical system. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper214/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper214/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "HaarPooling: Graph Pooling with Compressive Haar Basis", "authors": ["Yu Guang Wang", "Ming Li", "Zheng Ma", "Guido Montufar", "Xiaosheng Zhuang", "Yanan Fan"], "authorids": ["yuguang.wang@unsw.edu.au", "ming.li.ltu@gmail.com", "mzheng@princeton.edu", "montufar@math.ucla.edu", "xzhuang7@cityu.edu.hk", "y.fan@unsw.edu.au"], "keywords": ["graph pooling", "graph neural networks", "tree", "graph classification", "graph regression", "deep learning", "Haar wavelet basis", "fast Haar transforms"], "abstract": "Deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are instrumental in graph classification and graph-based regression tasks.

The approach solves dmiensional problems of applying the same model on graphs of different size and shows how to contribute to high performance in a set of graph classification tasks, while having low computational complexity.\n\nThe paper is very well written. The authors describe the concept of HaarPooling in a very detailed way and show the mathematical foundation of their approach. They further provide detailed mathematical explanations and proofs for the claimed advantages of their method, whilst using descriptive examples to ease understanding. The use of HaarPooling is then tested on five different datasets, showing a very good performance on each of them. The description of the machine learning experiments is very detailed, i.e., the methodology seems reproducable.\n\nMinor Comments:\n- In Figure 3 it seems counter-intuitive that the Graphs are arranged down-top (0-->2), whilst the equations above are arranged top-down.\n- The Related Work section could be placed earlier in the paper to get a better overview of the context and the problems that HaarPooling tries to solve.\n- All the experiments use exactly one HaarPool layer. Would it be possible to use multiple HaarPool layers, or is this not sensible or even possible (e.g. due to the dimensionality reduction). An explanation on this could be beneficial.\n- In Appendix A, weights are described with a capital 'W', which seems inconsistent with the lower case 'w' used in the rest of the paper. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper214/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper214/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "HaarPooling: Graph Pooling with Compressive Haar Basis", "authors": ["Yu Guang Wang", "Ming Li", "Zheng Ma", "Guido Montufar", "Xiaosheng Zhuang", "Yanan Fan"], "authorids": ["yuguang.wang@unsw.edu.au", "ming.li.ltu@gmail.com", "mzheng@princeton.edu", "montufar@math.ucla.edu", "xzhuang7@cityu.edu.hk", "y.fan@unsw.edu.au"], "keywords": ["graph pooling", "graph neural networks", "tree", "graph classification", "graph regression", "deep learning", "Haar wavelet basis", "fast Haar transforms"], "abstract": "Deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are instrumental in graph classification and graph-based regression tasks.
