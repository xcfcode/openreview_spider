The algorithm for computing barcodes of arbitrary function that we developed works with randomly chosen, or specifically chosen, point cloud in the function\u2019s input. It does not require a grid, thus, it expands the calculations of the barcodes of  functions beyond the dimensions of the input accessible before. To the best of our knowledge such algorithm was not described in literature. If it was, we would be grateful for a reference. \n\n----------------------------------\nHere are answers to your more specific minor questions:\n\n>  [...]What do you mean by gradient flow? [...]\nThe gradient flow is the standard  notion, which if needed can be easily looked up in the cited literature. It is the flow generated by the gradient vector field, the standard vector field used in modern optimization methods. \n\n> [...] What do you mean by \"TDA package\"?[...]\nThe reference to the paper \"Introduction to the R package TDA\"  is right next to the mentioning of this package.\n\n> [...]Right before Theorem 2.3., what does the notation F_sC_* mean? This needs to be introduced somewhere[...] \nFrom the text of the paper right before the Theorem 2.3: \"...an increasing sequence of subcomplexes (R\u2212filtration) FsC\u2217 \u2282 FrC\u2217\u2282...\" \nso as stated in the paper, FsC\u2217 \u2282 FrC\u2217\u2282... is indeed an increasing sequence of subcomplexes.\n---------------------------------------\n\nSome general remarks:\n\nOur aim was not just to demonstrate the computation of barcodes of objective functions, but to attract the attention of ML community to this tool. This notion allows to place many different concepts and experiments into a bigger overall picture which improves our understanding and gives useful insights.  \n\nAddressing your questions regarding the scalability of our method we would like to mention the following:\n\n1)All existing topological data analysis packages have scalability issues. Our algorithm permits to raise both the dimension of function\u2019s input, from 4 to 15, and the number of points, from 10^6 to 10^8;\n2)In the next version of this paper we are adding more experiments with computation of barcodes for loss functions in these dimensions which shows usefulness of this approach in other ML problems;\n3)We currently prepare a sequel paper to this paper where we show the possibility of computation of the barcodes for large-scale modern networks. But even from practical point of view it is important to understand first the behavior of barcodes in simplest examples where all hyper-parameters optimization schemes can be easily turned off.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2028/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2028/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["serguei.barannikov@imj-prg.fr", "a.korotin@skoltech.ru", "d.oganesyan@skoltech.ru", "demtsev@student.ethz.ch", "e.burnaev@skoltech.ru"], "title": "Barcodes as summary of objective functions' topology", "authors": ["Serguei Barannikov", "Alexander Korotin", "Dmitry Oganesyan", "Daniil Emtsev", "Evgeny Burnaev"], "pdf": "/pdf/b6865eed88f60717b37d68870744f22fc714e0f5.pdf", "TL;DR": "We apply canonical forms of gradient complexes (barcodes) to explore neural networks loss surfaces.", "abstract": "We apply canonical forms of gradient complexes (barcodes) to explore neural networks loss surfaces.

The authors claim that the barcodes constitute a representation of target objectives that is invariant under homeomorphisms of input to the objectives. The authors present an algorithm for computing the barcodes from graph-based representation of a surface, and present barcodes computed on toy examples in numerical analysis. \n\nIn my opinion, the main contribution of the work i.e. creation of barcodes is based on a rather trivial idea. The concept of characterizing optimization objectives through pairs of local minima and one-index saddle points is straightforward given that one can (thoroughly if not exhaustively) compute them in a computationally feasible manner; this is however hardy the case in any realistic scenario. I therefore struggle to see how the idea can be practically significant. Maybe the authors can put more emphasis on the theoretical aspect of their work, which is about the invariance nature of barcodes. They can for instance demonstrate how one can exploit the invariance property of barcodes for parameter optimization. \n\nThe authors can consider application of their work to hyper-parameter optimization, which is usually low-dimensional and one can also compare with other approaches such as Gaussian processes or other Bayesian methodologies. \n\nIn numerical experiments, for the toy task solved using neural network I don't find it very surprising that the barcodes descend lower as the capacity of the network is increased.

From what I understood, the idea is to effectively (1) take a grid over the parameters of a function (say a parameters of a neural net), (2) evaluate the function at those points, (3) compute sub-levelset persistent homology and (4) study the resulting barcode (for 0/1-dim features) (i.e., the mentioned \"canonical form\" invariants). Some experiments are presented on extremely simple toy data.\n\nOverall, the paper is very hard to read, as different concepts and terminology appear all over the place without a precise definition (see comments below). Given the problems in the writing of the paper, my assessment is that this idea boils down to computing persistent homology of the sub-levelset filtration of the loss surface sampled at fixed parameter realizations. I do not think that this will be feasible to do, even for small-scale real-world neural networks, simply due to the difficulty of finding a suitable grid, let alone the vast number of function evaluations involved.\n\nThe paper is also unclear in many parts. A selection is listed below:\n\n(1) What do you mean by gradient flow? One can define a gradient flow in a linear space X and for a function F: X->R, e.g., as  a smooth curve R->X, such that x'(t) = -\\nabla F(x(t)); is that what is meant? \n\n(2) What do you mean by \"TDA package\"? There are many TDA packages these days (maybe the CRAN TDA package?)\n\n(3) \"It was tested in dimensions up to 16 ...\" What is meant by dimension here? The dimensionality of the parameter space?\n\n(4) The author's talk about the \"minima's barcode\" - I have no idea what is meant by that either; the barcode is the result of sub-levelset persistent homology of a function -> it's not associated to a minima.\n\n(5) Is Theorem 2.3. not just a restatement of a theorem from Barannikov '94? At least the proof in the appendix seems to be .\n\n(6) Right before Theorem 2.3., what does the notation F_sC_* mean? This needs to be introduced somewhere.\n\nFrom my perspective, the whole story revolves around how to compute persistence barcodes from the sub-levelset filtration of the loss surface, obtained from function values taken on a grid over the parameters. The paper devotes quite some time to the introduction of these concepts, but not in a very clear or understandable manner. The experiments are effectively done on toy data, which is fine, but the paper stops at that point. I do not buy the argument that \"it is possible to apply it [the method] to large-scale modern neural networks\". Without a clear strategy to extend this, or at least some preliminary \"larger\"-scale results, the paper does not meet the ICLR threshold. The more theoretical part is too convoluted and, from my perspective, just a restatement of earlier results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2028/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2028/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["serguei.barannikov@imj-prg.fr", "a.korotin@skoltech.ru", "d.oganesyan@skoltech.ru", "demtsev@student.ethz.ch", "e.burnaev@skoltech.ru"], "title": "Barcodes as summary of objective functions' topology", "authors": ["Serguei Barannikov", "Alexander Korotin", "Dmitry Oganesyan", "Daniil Emtsev", "Evgeny Burnaev"], "pdf": "/pdf/b6865eed88f60717b37d68870744f22fc714e0f5.pdf", "TL;DR": "We apply canonical forms of gradient complexes (barcodes) to explore neural networks loss surfaces.", "abstract": "We apply canonical forms of gradient complexes (barcodes) to explore neural networks loss surfaces.

An algorithm is presented for the computation of barcodes, and some small-scale experiments are conducted. For very small neural networks, the barcodes are found to live at small loss values, and the authors argue that this suggests it may be hard to get stuck in a suboptimal local minimum.\n\nI believe the concept of barcodes will be new to most members of the ICLR community (at least it was to me), and I appreciate the authors' effort to convey the ideas through multiple definitions in Section 2. I wasn't able to fully appreciate the importance of Definition 3, and Definitions 1 and 2 were tough to digest owing to imprecise language, but I think I got the main point. I was also unable to fully comprehend the definitions of \"birth\" and \"death\" in this context. I'd strongly encourage the authors to improve the readability of this section so that non-experts can follow the story.\n\nIt seems like the main contribution is a new algorithm for computing barcodes of minima. I am unfamiliar with prior work in this direction, and I was also unable from the paper to infer what the main improvements were relative to the existing algorithms. I'd encourage the authors to state their explicit algorithmic improvements, and to demonstrate empirically that the new algorithm outperforms the prior ones in the expected ways.\n\nThe main experiments are on extremely tiny neural networks, presumably owing to computational restrictions. The authors state that \"it is possible to apply it to large-scale modern neural networks\", but it's not clear to me how that would work or what additional algorithmic improvements (if any) would need to be made in order to do so. I don't think that the results on tiny neural networks have much relevance to practice, so I think the empirical data presented in this paper will have very limited impact. If there were results for practical models, it would be a different story. So I'd encourage the authors to devote additional effort to scaling up the method for use on practical neural network architectures.\n\nOverall, I think there may be some really nice ideas in this paper that could help shape our understanding of neural network loss surfaces, but the current paper does not explore those ideas fully and does not convey them in a sufficiently clear manner. I hope to see an improved version of this paper at a future conference, but I cannot recommend acceptance of this version to ICLR."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2028/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2028/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["serguei.barannikov@imj-prg.fr", "a.korotin@skoltech.ru", "d.oganesyan@skoltech.ru", "demtsev@student.ethz.ch", "e.burnaev@skoltech.ru"], "title": "Barcodes as summary of objective functions' topology", "authors": ["Serguei Barannikov", "Alexander Korotin", "Dmitry Oganesyan", "Daniil Emtsev", "Evgeny Burnaev"], "pdf": "/pdf/b6865eed88f60717b37d68870744f22fc714e0f5.pdf", "TL;DR": "We apply canonical forms of gradient complexes (barcodes) to explore neural networks loss surfaces.", "abstract": "We apply canonical forms of gradient complexes (barcodes) to explore neural networks loss surfaces.
