It also explores certain properties of this value function and finds that it has many fractal-like qualities.\n\nThis paper focuses on an unconventional but intriguing topic, bringing more insight into the possible shapes of value functions. The main result, which describes the value function for the gambler's problem, seems surprisingly complex and could have some practical implications for value-learning. Unfortunately, I find the paper is difficult to follow due its organization and the presence of many typos and unclear phrases. In summary, while I believe the topic is interesting and the work seems sound, the presentation would need to be improved significantly for me to recommend acceptance.\n\nHere are certain points to be addressed:\n1) On p.2, \"The optimal value function presents its self-similar, fractal and non-rectifiable form\". It is not clear from Thm. 11 that these properties hold. Some further explanation would be helpful \n2) I think it would be helpful to include some descriptions of certain concepts that may be less familiar to the reader in the appendix.

The hardness of RL is indeed already well known, but it is not known by the community that it can be as complex and pathological as a Cantor function, while this is likely generated to a large family of RL problems. In fact, hardness is mostly observed empirically, such as sample complexity, approximation error, empirical convergence rate, and etc. Our paper discusses *why* the hardness happens, similar to what [1] discusses on the complexity of MDPs. \n\nAs an example, \"representation of such function must be inexact\" is indeed observed for years, but why it is inexact? Even it is handled by algorithms and heuristics on some famous tasks, algorithms may fail on some other tasks and new algorithms can be brought out by new insights.\n\nWe extend the implications and hope to bring more insights into possible future algorithms and applications. Our results are new and might be surprising: They are new things to the community and are orthogonal to what people already know. It is reasonable to believe that it will introduce ideas for future works. \n\nIt is very natural to expect an algorithmic approach derived by our theorems, or even a use case, but they are unlikely to be with this specific manuscript. The derivation of the theorems itself takes 20 pages, and adding more objectives to this manuscript seems too heavy from our perspective.\n\n[1] The Complexity of Markov Decision Processes, Papadimitriou 1987"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1594/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1594/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Gambler's Problem and Beyond", "authors": ["Baoxiang Wang", "Shuai Li", "Jiajin Li", "Siu On Chan"], "authorids": ["bxwang@cse.cuhk.edu.hk", "shuaili8@sjtu.edu.cn", "jjli@se.cuhk.edu.hk", "siuon@cse.cuhk.edu.hk"], "keywords": ["the gambler's problem", "reinforcement learning", "fractal", "self-similarity", "Bellman equation"], "TL;DR": "This simple problem's optimal value function is fractal and is like a Cantor function.", "abstract": "We analyze the Gambler's problem, a simple reinforcement learning problem where the gambler has the chance to double or lose their bets until the target is reached.

Below are additional notes on our response.\n\nOn 4): It is convincing and illustrative from 6:35 and 33:20 of the video [1] that the optimal value function of Mountain Car is fractal and self-similar on a substantial region of the state space. As we stated before, we believe that this property extends beyond Gambler and Mountain Car.\n\nOn 6): We would like to note that technically, it is *not* important to have this assumption just to solve the problem. Without this assumption, Section 4.1 (i.e. system (ABX)) will give two solutions: v(s), and f(0)=1, f(s)=1 otherwise. It is immediate to argue that the later is not the optimal value function. Then the former must be. We put this assumption to delay this \"f(0)=1, f(s)=1 otherwise\" solution to Section 4.2 only for a better organization of our manuscript.\n\n[1] The role of interest in prediction and control. https://youtu.be/aFXdpCDAG2g.

Your review is very helpful for us to revise the manuscript. A revision has been updated in the system that reflects these changes. \n\nThe topic of our manuscript is indeed unconventional but very intriguing. If the presentation is the most concern on our manuscript, we believe it can be improved rather quickly with the reviewers' help to be publishable.\n\nWe have addressed the raised concerns:\n\n2), 3), 5), and the typos, are addressed as pointed out.\n\n1) On p.2, \"The optimal value function presents its self-similar, fractal and non-rectifiable form\". It is not clear from Thm. 11 that these properties hold. Some further explanation would be helpful\n\nWe added a note pointing to the exact description of the self-similarity, in Corollary 13 (which is a corollary of Lemma 5's proof).\n \n4) p.3 \"the similar fractal patterns observed empirically in other reinforcement learning tasks.\" Certain concrete examples would be helpful here since I was not aware that this was common.\n\nA concrete example we know is Mountain Car (https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/), where when the optimal value function v(s) is plotted on the two-dimensional state space by a heat map, high-frequency and fractal pattern can be observed. This observation in fact was heavily discussed during a seminar the I attended by the curiosity of the audience.  Though this observation is empirical by plotting and zooming in, it is convincing enough that v(s) is likely fractal. When the dimension is greater than 2 we are not sure how this can be observed even empirically.\n\nWe have temporarily commented out this statement until more examples are founded. But intuitively, when simple problems like Gambler and Mountain Car to have this level of complexity, there suppose to be a family of MDPs that shares the same level of complexity.\n\n6) p.5 \"Otherwise an arbitrary small amount of will have a fixed probability of reaching the target 1.\" I am unsure what this sentence means.\n\nThis means if the function is nonzero when s approaches 0^+, say the limit is C, then the gambler starting with \\eps capital can reach the target capital of 1 with probability at least C. Then the expected capital increased from \\eps to at least C * 1 = C, which contradicts with the fact p > 0.5 so that expectation must decrease as the game goes.\n\nThis is revised and explained in our revised manuscript. \n\n7) Perhaps starting with the intuitive description of v(s) (the recursive form) first before presenting the closed form solution would be easier to follow.\n\nWe have added a sentence that points to the intuitive description before introducing the Theorem 11, so that the reader can find the intuitive description whenever they want so.\n\n8) Why is there no discussion/conclusion section at the end?\n\nWe have added a conclusion/future work section. Indeed, it is important to have the section to better position our paper and point out the possible future works. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1594/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1594/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Gambler's Problem and Beyond", "authors": ["Baoxiang Wang", "Shuai Li", "Jiajin Li", "Siu On Chan"], "authorids": ["bxwang@cse.cuhk.edu.hk", "shuaili8@sjtu.edu.cn", "jjli@se.cuhk.edu.hk", "siuon@cse.cuhk.edu.hk"], "keywords": ["the gambler's problem", "reinforcement learning", "fractal", "self-similarity", "Bellman equation"], "TL;DR": "This simple problem's optimal value function is fractal and is like a Cantor function.", "abstract": "We analyze the Gambler's problem, a simple reinforcement learning problem where the gambler has the chance to double or lose their bets until the target is reached.

The two new propositions do provide analysis on how a parameterized method will actually behave, by giving the error lower bound in O(1/N) and poly(ln L).\n\nWe want to clarify that per our Proposition 1, the pathology happens to the discrete case as well. It has the same fractal and self-similar structure although discrete MDP can be solved numerically in practice.

In this problem, the agent decides how much to bet in each step, doubling or losing the chosen amount. There is a chance of loss of greater than 0.5 and as a result the agent would like to minimize the number of steps. While one optimal policy is extremely simple (just bet the maximum), this paper shows that the value function is deceptively complicated due to its fractal structure. In particular, the value function is continuous only when there is no discounting and does not have well behaved derivatives. The exposition is clear and well structured. The author argues such behaviors have consequences for valued function based RL such as value iterations or Q-learning, since one of the simplest RL problem has a weird value function.\n\nThe paper presented both an interesting issue and a clear analysis, and should be accepted. The major issue is that any implications for RL seems unverified. For example, I would be very surprised if a tabular method will not solve the problem given a reasonable update order. The author also did not provide any analysis on how a parameterized method will actually behave, given that is the likely implication. So it is a bit unclear if the pathology is due to taking the continuous limit or if it is present in discrete cases as well. The final part relying on the axiom of choice is too mathy for the problem motivation (since it applies to the rather boring p=0.5 case). The paper would be more valuable to the ML community if that part is replaced with some analysis/evidence of how the issue shows up when actually running one of the solution methods.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1594/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1594/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Gambler's Problem and Beyond", "authors": ["Baoxiang Wang", "Shuai Li", "Jiajin Li", "Siu On Chan"], "authorids": ["bxwang@cse.cuhk.edu.hk", "shuaili8@sjtu.edu.cn", "jjli@se.cuhk.edu.hk", "siuon@cse.cuhk.edu.hk"], "keywords": ["the gambler's problem", "reinforcement learning", "fractal", "self-similarity", "Bellman equation"], "TL;DR": "This simple problem's optimal value function is fractal and is like a Cantor function.", "abstract": "We analyze the Gambler's problem, a simple reinforcement learning problem where the gambler has the chance to double or lose their bets until the target is reached.

Our analyses could lead insights into improving value function approximation, gradient-based algorithms, and Q-learning, in real applications and implementations.", "pdf": "/pdf/abf9a1649055c09bc23bbd69343d2beddb07e601.pdf", "paperhash": "wang|the_gamblers_problem_and_beyond", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nWang2020The,\ntitle={The Gambler's Problem and Beyond},\nauthor={Baoxiang Wang and Shuai Li and Jiajin Li and Siu On Chan},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxnMyBKwB}\n}", "full_presentation_video": "", "original_pdf": "/attachment/47beaa798a2074c127a61738a45046bfe5f9c2e9.pdf", "appendix": "", "poster": "", "spotlight_video": "", "slides": ""}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
