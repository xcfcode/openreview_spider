Inspired by the recently proposed Neural Turing Machine (Graves et al., 2014), we store the intermediate representations in stacked layers of memories, and use read-write operations on the memories to realize the nonlinear transformations between the representations. The types of transformations are designed in advance but the parameters are learned from data. Through layer-by-layer transformations, DEEPMEMORY can model complicated relations between sequences necessary for applications such as machine translation between distant languages. The architecture can be trained with normal back-propagation on sequence-to-sequence data, and the learning can be easily scaled up to a large corpus. DEEPMEMORY is broad enough to subsume the state-of-the-art neural translation model in (Bahdanau et al., 2015) as its special case, while significantly improving upon the model with its deeper architecture. Remarkably, DEEPMEMORY, being purely neural network-based, can achieve performance comparable to the traditional phrase-based machine translation system Moses with a small vocabulary and a modest parameter size.", "pdf": "/pdf/GvVr3PmmGC1WDOmRiEo6.pdf", "paperhash": "meng|a_deep_memorybased_architecture_for_sequencetosequence_learning", "conflicts": ["microsoft.com", "huawei.com", "ict.ac.cn"], "authors": ["Fandong Meng", "Zhengdong Lu", "Zhaopeng Tu", "Hang Li", "Qun Liu"], "authorids": ["mengfandong@ict.ac.cn", "Lu.Zhengdong@huawei.com", "Tu.Zhaopeng@huawei.com", "HangLi.HL@huawei.com", "liuqun@ict.ac.cn"]}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "tmdate": null, "cdate": 1454464564200, "ddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "duedate": 1455833700000, "tcdate": 1454464564200, "id": "ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/-/submission", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"pdf": null, "forum": null, "replyto": null, "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*", "description": "Your displayed identity associated with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"pdf": {"order": 4, "description": "Either upload a PDF file or provide a direct link to your PDF on ArXiv.", "value-regex": "upload|http://arxiv.org/pdf/.+"}, "title": {"order": 3, "description": "Title of paper.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "abstract": {"order": 4, "description": "Abstract of paper.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}, "authors": {"order": 1, "description": "Comma separated list of author names, as they appear in the paper.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "author_emails": {"order": 2, "description": "Comma separated list of author email addresses, in the same order as above.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "conflicts": {"order": 100, "description": "Semi-colon separated list of email domains of people who would have a conflict of interest in reviewing this paper, (e.g., cs.umass.edu;google.com, etc.).", "value-regex": "^([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))+(;[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))*$"}, "CMT_id": {"order": 5, "value-regex": ".*", "description": "If the paper is a resubmission from the ICLR 2016 Conference Track, enter its CMT ID; otherwise, leave blank."}}}, "invitees": [], "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "expdate": 1463609700000}}}], "count": 1}
