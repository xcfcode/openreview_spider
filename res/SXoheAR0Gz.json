Given the input signal $a_0...a_N$ in the time domain the algorithm approximately computes the first $O(M)$ frequencies. The running time is $O(r (N + M \\log M))$, where $r$ a parameter that controls the accuracy of the output. The algorithm itself proceeds by applying polynomial approximation to the twiddle coefficients in FFT, which makes it possible to reduce the running time.\n\nPros:\n+ Well-motivated problem: in many applications, most of the signal energy is present in the first few coefficients  and this algorithm computes them faster (albeit approximately)\n+ To the best of my knowledge the algorithm is new, although cannot tell for sure given a large body of prior work on this topic (see below)\n+ Experimental evaluation shows one order of magnitude improvement in the running time, while keeping the relative error to $10^{-6}$.\n\nCons:\n- The papers omits a significant body of prior work on computing the first few DFT coefficients faster. For example:\n  * Pruned FFT: the algorithm evaluates the first M coefficients in O(N log M) time; here, the results are *exact*. See e.g., http://www.fftw.org/pruned.html\n  * Subband FFT: this method is approximate; see e.g., these papers:\nSubband DFT\u2014part II: accuracy, complexity and applications, AN Hossen, U Heute, OV Shentov, SK Mitra - Signal Processing, 1995 - Elsevier\n Subband DFT\u2014Part I: Definition, interpretation and extensions, OV Shentov, SK Mitra, U Heute, AN Hossen - Signal Processing, 1995 - Elsevier\n Subband DFT-interpretation, accuracy, and computational complexity, OV Shentov, AN Hossen, SK Mitra\u2026 - Conference Record of the \u2026, 1991 - computer.org\n\n  There are also other methods cited in those articles. \n\n- I could not find any analysis of the trade-off between the accuracy and the values of parameters r and p. As a result, it is not clear what the runtime dependence on those parameters is. \n\nThe above two points make it impossible to compare the proposed algorithm relative to what was known before, either in theory or in practice. \n\nAdditional comments:\n- One can  assume (essentially) without loss of generality that the target frequencies lie in the interval centered at zero (i.e., that $\\mu$ is zero), as otherwise one can use Shift Theorem to shift the frequencies by multiplying each coefficient of the time signal by a phase term. This should simplify the presentation.\n\n\nOverall: the paper has interesting (and potentially very useful) ideas. However, it needs a very substantial rewrite, as per the comments above. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper650/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper650/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Fast Partial Fourier Transform", "authorids": ["~Yong-chan_Park1", "~Jun-Gi_Jang1", "~U_Kang1"], "authors": ["Yong-chan Park", "Jun-Gi Jang", "U Kang"], "keywords": ["Fourier transform", "time series", "signal processing", "anomaly detection", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Given a time-series vector, how can we efficiently compute a specified part of Fourier coefficients?

The main technique is an approximation of so called \"twiddle functions\" (which are basically trigonometric functions, or, exponents of complex units if viewed in the complex plane) using polynomials.   The resulting algorithms run in time O(N + M log M) where M is the size of the required frequency range, and N is the input.  This should be compared with Cooley and Tukey's FFT, which is O(N log N).  In fact, the main idea in the paper uses Cooley and Tukey's decomposition of the expression for Fourier transform.\n\nThe first thing I must note is, that the authors seem not to be aware of existing literature on partial Fourier transforms.  For example, Ailon and Liberty show in their paper [1] that whenever you are only interested in M Fourier frequencies then you can do exact FFT in time O(N log M).  This is done by pruning Cooley Tukey's FFT.  It is not as good as O(N + M log M), but it is EXACT, and it doesn't require the M frequencies to be in a single consecutive range.  (In fact, [1] does this for the Hadamard transform, but I am quite certain that it works for the DFT as well because the argument depends on the computational graph only, which is identical for both cases).  \n\nAdditionally, Indyk et al have written many papers on fast computation of Fourier when you know a priori that only M frequencies are nonzeros (and the rest are 0).  This setting is different from the one in this paper, but it is definitely relevant.\n\nFinally, I am inclined to say that the subject of this paper is only loosely related to the scope if ICLR.  I mean, computing Fourier coefficients is definitely a way to get a useful representation of the data, but I don't know if ICLR is the correct venue for this kind of paper.\n\nOtherwise, the paper is well written, and I assume it is correct.\n\n[1] Ailon, Liberty, \"Fast Dimension Reduction Using Rademacher Series on Dual BCH Codes. \" (Discrete and Computational Geometry, 2009)\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper650/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper650/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Fast Partial Fourier Transform", "authorids": ["~Yong-chan_Park1", "~Jun-Gi_Jang1", "~U_Kang1"], "authors": ["Yong-chan Park", "Jun-Gi Jang", "U Kang"], "keywords": ["Fourier transform", "time series", "signal processing", "anomaly detection", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Given a time-series vector, how can we efficiently compute a specified part of Fourier coefficients?

Additionally, we added the Goertzel algorithm which is one of the first methods devised for evaluating a part of Fourier coefficients in the same section. In the discussion, we showed that PFT outperforms the Goertzel algorithm, which demonstrates the benefits of our proposed method. Moreover, we added the experimental comparison between PFT and Pruned FFT in Section 4.2 of the revised paper. Figures 1(a), 1(b), and 2(a) of the revised paper show that PFT outperforms Pruned FFT, significantly extending the range of output sizes for which partial Fourier transform becomes practical.\n\n**Exact or approximate?**\n\nThe reviewer pointed out that Pruned FFT is exact, while our method is approximate. We claim that, in terms of practical use, the approximate algorithm is the more advantageous one as long as it provides the option to set an arbitrary approximation error bound. Indeed, the Fourier coefficients can be evaluated to arbitrary numerical precision with PFT by changing hyper-parameters, providing more versatility than the exact algorithm. Also, in the experiments in Section 4.2 of the revised paper, PFT was set to the same precision (<$10^{-6}$) as Pruned FFT, and showed up to 19 times faster running time than Pruned FFT. Therefore, one can reasonably argue that it is not a problem that PFT is approximate.\n\n**Trade-off between accuracy and runtime**\n\nAs the reviewer mentioned, we added the experimental results concerning the trade-off between accuracy and runtime of PFT in Section 4.4 of the revised paper. The results show that the runtime of PFT is reduced by up to 17% and 27% as the accuracy goal changes from $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-2}$, respectively.\n\n**The reason why PFT does not use Shift Theorem**\n\nThe reviewer also pointed out in the additional comments that one can assume essentially without loss of generality that the target range is centered at zero with the help of Shift Theorem, which is true. However, as we had already mentioned in the lines 5-12 of Section 3.3 of the original paper (also lines 5-12 of Section 3.3 of the revised paper), the technique requires extra $N$ (the input size) complex multiplications. By using our proposed method, one can bypass the extra computations during the run-time.\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper650/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper650/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Fast Partial Fourier Transform", "authorids": ["~Yong-chan_Park1", "~Jun-Gi_Jang1", "~U_Kang1"], "authors": ["Yong-chan Park", "Jun-Gi Jang", "U Kang"], "keywords": ["Fourier transform", "time series", "signal processing", "anomaly detection", "machine learning"], "abstract": "Given a time-series vector, how can we efficiently compute a specified part of Fourier coefficients?

Experimental results show that PFT outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithms, with an order of magnitude of speedup for sufficiently small output sizes without sacrificing accuracy.", "one-sentence_summary": "We propose a fast Partial Fourier Transform (PFT),  an efficient algorithm for computing only a part of Fourier coefficients.
