In the newly uploaded document, we marked modified parts in orange, so you can easily track the changed ones.\nNow, we provide explanations in the same order for their concerns:\n\n1: First of all, we appreciate for pointing out the logical leap that could mislead the insights of our main motivation. Without any additional explanations, the uniformly distributed characteristics of the contrastive loss can be unclear. Recently, several works have been proposed to enhance the theoretical understandings of the contrastive loss and its variants [1,2]. Specifically, [1] has proved that, asymptotically, the contrastive loss is optimizing the alignment of positive pairs and uniformity of the induced distribution. Also, minimizing the sum of alignment loss and uniform loss exhibits the identical performance to the contrastive loss empirically. The detailed equation is stated below:\n\n$\nL_{total} = L_{align}(f:\\alpha) + L_{uniform}(f:t)\n$\n\n$\nL_{align}(f:\\alpha)= E_{(x,y) \\sim p_{pos}}[\\parallel f(x) - f(y) \\parallel^{\\alpha}_2]\n$\n\n$\nL_{uniform}(f:t)= \\log E_{(x,y) \\sim p_{data}}[e^{-t\\parallel f(x) - f(y) \\parallel^{2}_2}]\n$\n\nIn this perspective, we believed that this uniformity constraint could push away the relevant instances and incur the representations to be not properly clustered. Therefore, our main motivation is to introduce the uniquely designed loss function, preserving the cluster structure of representations (e.g., uniform hypercube).\n\n\n2: We deeply appreciate your meticulous comments. As R4 says, N in Section 3.3 should be replaced with n which indicates the number of instances in a mini-batch, i.e., mini-batch size. \nPlease check the revised version of Section 3.3. \n\nIn the Equation. (1), it is essentially motivated from [3], not [4] so we mentioned [3] at the starting point of Section 3.1 Preliminaries; however, as R4 points out, we agree that descriptions around Eq. (1) can be misleading to the reader. \nTherefore, we explicitly add [3] in front of the Equation. (1) and revised the source of $d_a$ more clearly. \nPlease check the revised descriptions in Section 3.2.\n\nWe correct the Equation. (4) that it means the contrastive loss among BCAs. \nNote that the number of BCAs is K because the output size of $P^{c, k}$ is K and each vector of them has $n$ dimensions because it is a batch-wise feature.\nThe description of $c'$ and $c''$ are added as R4 suggested. \nPlease check the revised ones in Section 3.3.\n\n\n3: We also had the same concern as R4. Fortunately, the performance gap according to the choice of K seems marginal if our multi-scale clustering strategy (Section 3.4) is combined.\nFor example, we use the same set of K for both CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 regardless of the underline labels, and C2BIN works robustly for both cases.  \nWe will report additional results for the choice of K in the upcoming document.\n  \n\n4: The R4's suggestion is also attractive, but we followed the convention of existing studies for Table 7.\n\n\n5: We present the images that are randomly sampled without using the nearest neighbors. \nTo be more precise, we arbitrarily select the clusters from each cluster branch $k =10, 40, 160$ for Figure 9, 10, 11 respectively. Then, images are randomly sampled for each cluster and displayed as a group.\n\n[1] Wang et al., Understanding Contrastive Representation Learning through Alignment and Uniformity on the Hypersphere.\n\n[2] Chen et al., Intriguing Properties of Contrastive Losses. \n\n[3] Grill et al, Bootstrap your own latent: A new approach to self-supervised learning\n\n[4] Chen et al, A simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper619/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper619/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper619/Authors"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper619/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Representations by Contrasting Clusters While Bootstrapping Instances", "authorids": ["~Junsoo_Lee1", "joonleesky@kaist.ac.kr", "~Inkyu_Shin1", "storm.b@kakaoenterprise.com", "~In_So_Kweon2", "~Jaegul_Choo1"], "authors": ["Junsoo Lee", "Hojoon Lee", "Inkyu Shin", "Jaekyoung Bae", "In So Kweon", "Jaegul Choo"], "keywords": ["unsupervised", "self-supervised", "image clustering", "visual representation learning"], "abstract": "Learning visual representations using large-scale unlabelled images is a holy grail for most of computer vision tasks.

In the newly uploaded document, we marked modified parts in orange, so you can easily track the changed ones.\nWe provide comments in the same order for your concerns:\n\n1: In our updated paper, we added the following references to the related work [1, 2, 3] and conducted the representation learning experiments from the official implementation of [1]. Although our work and [1] exploit the cluster structure to learn the image representation, there is a clear difference in high-level motivation. The goal of our work is to incorporate the cluster structure with the instance-level representation learning rather than solely relying on one of those two. \n\nRecently, methods with solely bootstrapping from the cluster structure have shown remarkable performance in the representation learning [1,4,5]. However, these results are heavily dependent on the choice of hyperparameters since pseudo-labels are noisy and ambiguous, different from the instance-level representation learning. In our experiments, [1] has only achieved 51.3% as the best accuracy in the STL-10 dataset even though we strictly follow the hyperparameter tuning guide from the authors. This sensitivity to the selection of the hyperparameters is also treated as one of the main issues in the official repository.\n\nMoreover, [1,4] utilized an optimal transport algorithm to equally partition the number of instances to the given number of clusters. However, this constraint is easily satisfied when the encoder always has the same output regardless of its input, which is the constant function. The presence of such a trivial solution also makes learning to be unstable and demanding. \u2028On the other hand, our method learns the cluster representation through contrasting the batch-wise cluster assignments (BCAs). \nBy Equation. (4), each cluster representation gradually moves toward an orthogonal direction, resulting in the confidence of the cluster assignments for each instance is softly maximized. These differences prevent our method from falling into the trivial solution (constant function) in the clustering level, bringing stability and robustness to the learning process. \n\nTo support our statements, we have arranged the results of our experiments for [1] in the below table:\n\n- model: [1]\n- dataset: STL-10\n- architecture: ResNet-18\n- epochs: 200\n- batch size: 256\n\n| Prototypes(K) | LR  | Temperature | SK-epsilon  | Queue size  | Accuracy |\n|:------------------:|:----:|:-------------:|:----------------:|:------------------:|:--------------:|\n|32   | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.03 | 0   | 54.7 |\n|128 | 1.2 | 0.5 | 0.03 | 0   | 51.1 |\n|32   | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.03 | 768  | 49.7  |\n|128 | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.03 | 768  | 46.2 |\n|128 | 1.2 | 0.5 | 0.03 | 768  | 44.3 |\n|128 | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.03 | 0    | 43.8  |\n|32   | 1.2 | 0.5 | 0.03 | 768  | 41.1 |\n|128 | 4.8 | 0.5 | 0.03 | 3840 | 12.4 |\n|128 | 1.2 | 0.5 | 0.03 | 3840 | 12.2  |\n|128 | 4.8 | 0.1 | 0.05 | 3840 | 12.1 |\n|128 | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.03 | 3840 | 11.8 |\n|128 | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.05 | 3840 | 10.3  |\n|128 | 4.8 | 0.5 | 0.05 | 3840 | 10.2 |\n|128 | 1.2 | 0.5 | 0.05 | 3840 | 10.1 |\n|128 | 1.2 | 0.1 | 0.05 | 3840 | 10.0  |\n|128 | 0.3 | 0.1 | 0.05 | 3840 | 10.0  |\n|32   | 1.2 | 0.5 | 0.05 | 3840 | 10.0  |\n|32   | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.05 | 3840 | 10.0  |\n\n\n\n[1] Caron et al., Unsupervised learning of visual features by contrasting cluster assignments.\n\n[2] Gansbeke et al., Scan: Learning to classify images without labels.\n\n[3] Chen et al., Intriguing Properties of Contrastive Losses. \n\n[4] Asano et al, Self-labelling via simultaneous clustering and representation learning\n\n[5] Caron et al., Deep Clustering for Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper619/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper619/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Representations by Contrasting Clusters While Bootstrapping Instances", "authorids": ["~Junsoo_Lee1", "joonleesky@kaist.ac.kr", "~Inkyu_Shin1", "storm.b@kakaoenterprise.com", "~In_So_Kweon2", "~Jaegul_Choo1"], "authors": ["Junsoo Lee", "Hojoon Lee", "Inkyu Shin", "Jaekyoung Bae", "In So Kweon", "Jaegul Choo"], "keywords": ["unsupervised", "self-supervised", "image clustering", "visual representation learning"], "abstract": "Learning visual representations using large-scale unlabelled images is a holy grail for most of computer vision tasks.

To address the reviewer\u2019s concern for the robustness of our method in a large-scale dataset, we will report the result for ImageNet in the upcoming document.\n\n3. We agree with most of R1\u2019s concern; however, we would like to recall that there is no concrete label size given in the self-supervised representation learning task.\nThis can be considered as the main difference from the unsupervised image clustering studies, which directly utilize the pre-define label size in their networks.\nIn our work, we found that simply combining two methods with a single and arbitrary selected cluster size (Table 3. (b),(c)) does not help to improve performances and even degenerates the representation quality. \nWe guess that attaching a single cluster head after the backbone network makes its representation quality sensitive according to the head size as R1 mentioned. \nOn the other hand, using multiple but single-scale cluster heads (Table 3.(d), (e)) sometimes helps the performance as shown in previous work [4] but it is marginal in our setting.\nWe think the effect of multi-task learning seems small because each cluster head can capture similar patterns with others.\nEventually, utilizing our multiple and multi-scale clustering strategy (Table 3.(f)) shows impressive results for both LP and kNN scores. \nWe guess that the effect of multi-task learning is maximized because an identical representation vector should be informative enough to satisfy the following clusters, which are from abstract to detailed.\nTherefore, we think Section 4.4 and Table 3. demonstrate both the challenging point of this task and the effects of our main findings effectively.\nWe will report additional results for the choice of K in the upcoming document.\n\n\n4. We apologize for the misused typos especially for Equation. (4). Because the cluster contrastive loss is designed to calculate relative distances among the cluster features (BCAs), K indicates the number of clusters. \nThe reason why the denominator excludes the case of j=i is that it is the self one. \nIn our revised document, we correct misused notations and add informative descriptions for the equation. \nPlease refer to Section 3.3.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper619/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper619/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Representations by Contrasting Clusters While Bootstrapping Instances", "authorids": ["~Junsoo_Lee1", "joonleesky@kaist.ac.kr", "~Inkyu_Shin1", "storm.b@kakaoenterprise.com", "~In_So_Kweon2", "~Jaegul_Choo1"], "authors": ["Junsoo Lee", "Hojoon Lee", "Inkyu Shin", "Jaekyoung Bae", "In So Kweon", "Jaegul Choo"], "keywords": ["unsupervised", "self-supervised", "image clustering", "visual representation learning"], "abstract": "Learning visual representations using large-scale unlabelled images is a holy grail for most of computer vision tasks.

This paper claims resulting representations are better suited to non-discriminative tasks where clustering is important.\n-----\n+Strengths\\\n+This paper motivates a good direction over current unsupervised representation learning. Considering clustering performance in addition to discriminative power is a fair research question in my opinion.\n+The proposed idea is interesting and seems reasonable.\n+Evaluating representation learning on non-discriminative tasks is a good idea.\n-----\n-Concerns\\\n-A critical concern is the experiment setup, particularly the choice of ResNet18 as backbone and only evluating on CIFAR/STL. These datasets are quite small and are not used as the primary performance benchmark for modern unsupervised image representation learning work. This paper claims improvement in certain aspects over SimCLR, MoCo v2, and BYOL which all experiment on much larger capacity models and much larger datasets.

Proposed methods in the literature do not take the cluster structure of items into consideration. This paper proposes a hybrid loss function that aims to preserve the cluster structure (Equation 7)\n\n2- A wide range of experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method. C2BIN shows a significantly better performance using the kNN classifier (particularly on CIFAR100). The good performance is also evident in clustering experiments. Thus, as the method promises the cluster structure is better preserved.\n\nCons:\n\n1- The motivation part of the paper is not precise. The last sentence of the second paragraph of Section 1 states:\n\n\u201cHowever, since aforementioned instance discrimination does not consider the semantic similarities of the representations (e.g., same class), it results the learned representations to be uniformly distributed (Wang & Isola, 2020).\u201d \n\nIt is true that semantic similarities are not considered in self-supervised and contrastive learning settings. However, this is a part of the problem as class labels do not exist. Moreover, it is not clear to me why it would lead to a uniform distribution of representations. I agree that cluster structure might be lost.\n\n2- The notation used in Section 3 is confusing, I mention some possible misuses of notation or typos:\n\nSection 3.1, N is defined as the number of unlabeled images. Later in Section 3.3, second paragraph, N is used as the mini-batch size. \n \nSection 3.2 Equation (1), $P^a (z_a)$ is not properly defined. It refers to SimCLR and as I checked in the paper the same notation is not defined. Moreover, the paper should be written self-contained. Meaning that main formulation should be mentioned in the main body of the paper.\n\nFigure 3, two siamese networks, $E_\\theta$ and $E_\\phi$ are not depicted in the Figure.\n\n\nEquation 4, denominator, $i \\neq k$, should it be $i \\neq j$?\n\nAfter Equation 4, it is stated that: The vectors c\u2019 and c\u2019\u2019 are obtained from x\u2019_i and x\u2019\u2019_ i , respectively, using the encoder $F_\\theta$. This is not precise. The output of F would be r and it goes through $P^{c,k}$ to obtain z. Then c is computed using equation 3. \n\nComments and questions:\n\nTable 3 shows that the choice of set K is quite important. If we are not provided with proper K and we have no access to labels, can you recommend any strategy in this case? Do you think using a fixed K with various elements is good for any dataset?\n\nIt would be nice to sort the methods of table 7 chronologically.\n\nIt is not clear how Figure 9, 10 and 11 are produced. Are the grouped images random samples and nearest neighbors?\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper619/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper619/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Representations by Contrasting Clusters While Bootstrapping Instances", "authorids": ["~Junsoo_Lee1", "joonleesky@kaist.ac.kr", "~Inkyu_Shin1", "storm.b@kakaoenterprise.com", "~In_So_Kweon2", "~Jaegul_Choo1"], "authors": ["Junsoo Lee", "Hojoon Lee", "Inkyu Shin", "Jaekyoung Bae", "In So Kweon", "Jaegul Choo"], "keywords": ["unsupervised", "self-supervised", "image clustering", "visual representation learning"], "abstract": "Learning visual representations using large-scale unlabelled images is a holy grail for most of computer vision tasks.

Specifically, for each training batch, the authors project the instances into a clustering space and then utilize a cluster-aware contrastive loss to push the augmented samples from the same instance to belong to the same cluster, otherwise for different instances. To ensure the clustering not to collapse into a single or a few cluster to find the trivial solutions, the authors further add a penalization item keep the entropy of clustering assignment be uniform to some extent. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the representation learning performance over SoTA methods on several datasets, while also outperforms the previous methods on clustering task. Further ablation studies show that the loss is effective to ensure the learned representation more discriminative and clusterable.\n\n[Strength]\n\n1. The intuition behind the proposed method is intuitive and straightforward. It has been shown in previous work like [a] that combining them together can boost the self-supervised learning performance significantly. This paper further demonstrates the promise of this direction.\n\n[a] Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features by Contrasting Cluster Assignments. Caron et al.\n\n2. The authors performed experiments to show that the proposed method achieves better performance on both representation learning task and clustering task, on various image datasets, such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and STL-10. \n\n3. The ablation studies showed that the proposed clustering loss indeed helps to learn a better representation compared with the baseline model with a substantial margin, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n[Weakness]\n\n1. The paper has a poor literature review of previous works. In the related work, both instance-level representation learning and deep clustering methods are not fully covered and compared. More importantly, the authors missed a very relevant and recent paper as pointed above [a]. The idea behind this paper is very similar to the above one.\n\n2.  In this paper, the authors merely presented the results on relatively small datasets. Though it is a bit harsh to always request experiments on the large-scale dataset, such as ImageNet, proving the efficiency seems necessary especially when it is known that keep training on a large-scale dataset for a long time may dismiss the gap.\n\n3. In table 3, it seems that only with multi-scale clustering loss, the performance will be improved across all metrics. This indicates that the proposed algorithm is a bit sensitive to the hyperparameter settings. Even with Eq.(1) + Eq.(5), the performance drops in some scenarios, which seems counterintuitive. All of these results demonstrate that the proposed method is still a bit mysterious and vulnerable. \n\n4. The notations in the paper is hard to interpret and a bit abuse. The formula of Eq.(4) is also a bit confusing. First, what does k stands for? Second, why the denominator excludes the case of i=k if it is a regular contrastive loss.\n\n[Summary]\n\nOverall, I think this paper is a good trial of combining instance-level contrastive loss and deep clustering philosophy into a single learning regime, which I think is a promising direction to explore. However, as I pointed above, the novelty of the paper should be better explained. Also, according to the ablation study, the performance seems vulnerable to the choice of hyperparameters, such as cluster numbers. This increases the uncertainty about the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, the proposed method is not demonstrated on large-scale dataset such as ImageNet, which is supposed to be a routine setting on self-supervised learning community.
