However, we wanted to show such importance empirically first to demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving high compression and good accuracy using various compression techniques. To prove its wide impacts on the existing compression formats, we had to spend good amount of space for experimental results. Even though we tried to explain the motivation in Section 3, we believe it would be challenging in general to derive thorough analyses especially when DeepTwist involves exploring various local minima (as shown in Figure 2), since such analysis is also challenging for large-batch problems and generalization/memorization issues.

For example, quantization reduces memory footprint according to the number of bits to represent weights while low-rank approximation decomposes a large weight matrix into two much smaller matrices (both memory footprint and amount of computations are reduced). Since we do not present a new compression format in the paper (instead, we present how some well-known compression techniques can be significantly enhanced by DeepTwist), we have not discussed how hardware resources can be reduced by pruning and so on.\n\n[Distortion step values]\n- As we wrote in the footnote in the page 4, distortion step shows a low sensitivity to the accuracy for other compression techniques as well. In general, as long as distortion step is not too large (e.g., more than a few epochs) nor too small (e.g., every mini-batch), different distortion steps present similar accuracy as shown in Table 2. We will include experimental results similar to Table 2 for quantization and low-rank approximation in the future.\n\n[Removing hyper-parameters]\n- As we wrote in the introduction, distortion step is the only extra hyper-parameter (which is independent of compression techniques). On the other hand, previous strong compression techniques involve lots of model-specific hyper-parameters. For example, dynamic network surgery introduces thresholds for splicing weights while such thresholds should be separately and empirically obtained for 'each' layer. Sparse VD also involves empirical numbers required for Bayesian statistics. In Table 1, DeepTwist (with distortion step as the only one additional hyper-parameter) shows impressive compression ratio while the results with dynamic network surgery and sparse VD are based on lots of such sophisticated hyper-parameters. Hence, the sentence \"Removing lots of ...\" is rather summarizing the issues of existing advanced compression techniques.\n\n[Regularization effect]\nEven though it is difficult to visualize local minimum exploration, Figure 2(b) is an indirect way to show how vastly different local minima can be searched by DeepTwist. Table 3 also shows that DeepTwist (with high learning rates) finds different local minima and results in better accuracy even though the pruning rate is the same.\nIn many previous papers, specific numbers for hyper-parameters are provided without justification (while we show the justification in Table 2). Sometimes, even those numbers are not described in the paper (like dynamic network surgery). We borrowed numbers from those papers based on the belief that the authors did their best to obtain the best empirical results.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper359/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper359/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper359/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DeepTwist: Learning Model Compression via Occasional Weight Distortion", "abstract": "Model compression has been introduced to reduce the required hardware resources while maintaining the model accuracy.

The \u2018distortion step\u2019 related results are described mostly for the pruning and for the other approaches \u2018distortion step\u2019 was set to certain values without rigorous reasoning or experiments. More discussion and experiments with \u2018distortion step\u2019 could make the impact clearer.\n\nAnother claim is that \u201cRemoving lots of hyper-parameters required to set sophisticated prior information\u201d. I don\u2019t see much justification of this claim in the paper. Can the choice of 'distortion step' be considered as an additional hyperparameter? \n\nThe claim on regularization is not clear to me. First of all, any technique to reduce the model size plays a role of a regularizer that reduces the testing error. Can\u2019t we get similar error reduction by using different hyperparameter values of the existing methods? The impact of the proposed framework on local minimum exploration and regularization has not been explained properly in the paper. \n\nOverall, this paper needs more work in my opinion. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper359/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper359/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper359/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DeepTwist: Learning Model Compression via Occasional Weight Distortion", "abstract": "Model compression has been introduced to reduce the required hardware resources while maintaining the model accuracy.

The so-called weight distortion procedure is added into the training every several epochs. Three applications are shown to demonstrate the usage of the proposed approach.\n\nOverall, I think the novelty of the paper is very limited, as all the weight distortion algorithms in the paper can be formulated as the proximal function in proximal gradient descent. See http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/convexopt-S15/scribes/08-prox-grad-scribed.pdf for a reference.\n\nSpecifically, the proposed framework can be easily reformulated as a loss function plus a regularizer for proximal gradient. Using gradient descent (GD), there will be two steps: (1) finding a new solution using GD, and (2) project the new solution using proximal function. Now in deep learning, since SGD is used for optimization, several steps are need to locate reasonable solutions, i.e. the Distortion Step in the framework. Then proximal function can be applied directly after Distortion Step to project the solutions. In this way, we can easily see that the proposed framework is a stochastic version of proximal gradient descent. Since SGD is used for training, several minibatches are needed to achieve a relatively stable solution for projection using the proximal function, which is exactly the proposed framework in Fig. 1.\n\nPS: After discussion, I think the motivation of the method is not clear to understand why the proposed method works.

Introducing distortion step\n--> Enables 'Exploration vs. Exploitation' to search for a particular local minimum dedicated to model compression. It also reduces the amount of compression computation overhead significantly. Finding a good distortion step is more important than designing complicated distortion functions.\n2. Removing lots of hyper-parameters required to set sophisticated prior information. Our Algorithms 1,2, and 3 have the basic compression format, but they are enough to gain very high compression rates (while recent papers introduce more and more hyper-parameters) which have been only possible with stronger prior information, assumptions, and various heuristic approaches.\n3. Moreover, we do not modify underlying training algorithms unlike recent papers with heavy 'compression-aware' ideas along with significantly increased training time, which is a general concern on model compression.\n4. As a result, model compression researchers can focus on the fundamental representation format after compression with only basic prior information model on the parameters, without a lot of heuristic and hand-crafted hyper-parameters for each dedicated compression technique (that's why Algorithm 1,2, and 3 can be a lot simpler than other papers due to the concept of 'distortion step' and DeepTwist can be a general framework for model compression)\n5. We have shown that our local minimum exploration method can lead to a good regularization effect (much improved accuracy especially for RNN)\n6. We could achieve a stable retraining procedure with low-rank approximation (with surprisingly high learning rate)"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper359/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper359/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper359/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DeepTwist: Learning Model Compression via Occasional Weight Distortion", "abstract": "Model compression has been introduced to reduce the required hardware resources while maintaining the model accuracy.

If there is a straightforward and general \u2018optimization\u2019 method which can support different model compression techniques, we believe it should be considered to be of high novelty as the first attempt to solve various model compression issues using a general framework, such as \u2018stochastic\u2019 proximal gradient descent or DeepTwist. Since we present such a general optimization method for model compression for the first time associated with state-of-the-art compression rate, your suggestion that our technique can be explained with proximal gradient descent could be a strong claim that our technique solves critical problems in model compression (i.e., heuristic method dedicated to each technique with lots of additional hyper-parameters which cannot be formulated by using proximal function forms). \n\n1. It has been challenging to find a good prior probability distribution on weights for a particular model compression format. Hence, instead of searching for a regularization form, lots of heuristic ways to obtain prior information on weights have been developed. For example, weight pruning is mainly performed by their magnitude (due to practical computation issues) instead of Hessian computation which can lead to higher compression rate. Our work has shown that a systematic way to perform \u2018optimization\u2019 for model compression without such heuristics is possible.\n\n2. All the numbers of accuracy in our paper are obtained after weight distortion, not during normal training with full-precision weights. Our work is the first one that the accuracy after model compression can be achieved by a general framework (such as proximal function), unlike previous model compression which cannot be achieved by a simple and straightforward optimization (instead, all previous works modify training algorithms significantly, like adopting masking layers, temporal full-precision weights for quantization, feedforward and backward paths with different weights, and so on).\n\n3. To present more details, for low-rank approximation, retraining after SVD to enhance accuracy has been a great challenge, hence no proximal functions have existed in the literature. Masking layers which have been essential for pruning also cannot be accommodated by using proximal functions. Our work is the first one in which masking layers are not necessary.\n\n4. We are the first one that even if model compression is optimized by proximal functions, the accuracy still convergences under the constraints for model compression. To the best of our knowledge, there is no any previous papers showing that model compression can be done with a proximal function (or its variants).\n\nIn the future, it would be of great importance to further develop and analyze model compression techniques using the knowledge on proximal gradient descent. We believe your suggestion is precious since it is a strong support that our technique is not only useful for model compression but also useful for suggesting a new regularization method based on various model compression formats.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper359/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper359/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper359/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DeepTwist: Learning Model Compression via Occasional Weight Distortion", "abstract": "Model compression has been introduced to reduce the required hardware resources while maintaining the model accuracy.

Let us discuss some parts of reasons.\n\n- Training models after compression in order to recover accuracy is as important (if not more) as compressing weights. We have found that occasional distortions (not compressing weights for every mini-batch like previous techniques), relatively large learning rate, and training batches in full-precision (unlike previous ones which store compressed weights during entire training) would be the key to recovering or even increasing the accuracy.\n- Exploring large search space in much wider area is suggested in this paper through large distortion step and large learning rate (note that many compression-aware techniques perform compression at every batch has distortion step of \u201c1\u201d while much smaller learning rate for retraining that normal training is chosen). As we discussed in the paper, investigating various local minima is crucial for good model compression.\n- Our pruning method is fundamentally different from the previous ones because we do not incorporate a masking layer. While previous pruning ideas keep zero weights during training, we do not have any zero weights at any moment except at the weight distortion step.\n- Our low-rank approximation is also unique one since 1) we do not alter the structure for training even after performing SVD, 2) very high learning rate associated with transient accuracy loss is allowed for DeepTwist, and 3) we change SV spectrum continuously while the previous ones perform SVD only once (in practice, retraining low-rank approximated model has been considered to be very difficult, if not impossible). \n- Even though our pruning method is even simpler compared to the previous ones, compression rate is significantly better or very close to the one based on sophisticated Bayesian inference model.\n- Low-rank approximation results on PTB (Figure 2) shows even higher compression rate compared with weight pruning (Table 3), which is surprising to us because pruning has been known to show much higher compression ratio compared with SVD (fine-grain vs. coarse-grain or structured).\n- Quantization is performed also in a very different way. Unlike previous ones, we do not consider quatization during \n training. \u201cDo not perform quantization at every batch, but instead recover accuracy through full-precision training, high learning rate, and occasional quantization\u201d is the key message.\n- Overall, our occasional compression is a significant one since we can greatly reduce amount of computation overhead from compression.\n\nIf our technique is a simple extension from the previous ones, we could not obtain such impressive results with high compression rate and improved accuracy. We believe that our paper suggests a wide view on how model compression should be performed.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper359/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper359/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper359/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DeepTwist: Learning Model Compression via Occasional Weight Distortion", "abstract": "Model compression has been introduced to reduce the required hardware resources while maintaining the model accuracy.

Using gradient descent (GD), there will be two steps: (1) finding a new solution using GD, and (2) project the new solution using proximal function. \n\nNow in deep learning, since SGD is used for optimization, several steps are need to locate reasonable solutions, i.e. the Distortion Step in the framework.

Jumping to another local minimum from a certain minimum would not be easily achieved by convex optimization methods.\n2) Finding a particular flat minimum is the key to obtaining good model compression (and good generalization as well). Such an exploration, however, cannot be obtained by a proximal function since we need to investigate lots of different local minima with different amount of flatness in loss surface.\n3) While proximal gradient descent can be useful to find a certain local minimum close to the starting point given a convex constraint, wide exploration (associated with possibly transient accuracy loss in the initial training as shown in Figure 2.(b)) is necessary to escape from a point with sharp loss surface.  Investigating many different local minima would be only available with large learning rate (as we have chosen for our experiments) and/or large amount of weight distortion.\n4) Our effort to introduce optimal distortion step size and learning rate for a given compression problems is connected to exploration, not exploitation (which potentially supported by proximal functions where convergence matters).\n\nEven though proximal gradient descent selects step size only considering convergence, Figure 1 can lead to the results such as Figure 2(b) which cannot be obtained if only local exploitation is employed.\n\nFinding a flat minimum has been known to be a difficult work as shown in the paper \u201cOn large-batch training for deep learning: generalization gap and sharp minima\u201d, ICLR 2016. We firmly believe that our search space exploration method based on optimal distortion step size and amount of weight distortion enable us to produce better local minima well-suited to various model compression techniques.\nIn short, unfortunately, we have failed to understand how you could connect our technique to proximal functions and proximal gradient descent.\nWe strongly hope that you reconsider your decision."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper359/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper359/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper359/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DeepTwist: Learning Model Compression via Occasional Weight Distortion", "abstract": "Model compression has been introduced to reduce the required hardware resources while maintaining the model accuracy.
