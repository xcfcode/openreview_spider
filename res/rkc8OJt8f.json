I also believe that most authors in the ICLR community are aware of these (and other) limitations. There are continuous discussions about these topics, also in the context of life-long-learning, trasnfer learning, and general-AI.

The authors argue that these tasks cannot be solved by adding more supervision/data.\n\nPros\n- The example provided by the authors (Figure 1) is interesting. The OCR methods perform very poorly in the wild and the authors do a good job of highlighting this (Table 1)\n\nCons\n- The observation that adding more supervision will not solve machine vision is a popular view in the community, and has been the case for a while. This has been a fairly consistent message across the years, so this paper pointing this out is not surprising. Please also refer to https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00289 which nicely summarizes this. It's also a paper worth citing.\n\n- The entire paper presents only one \"challenge\" - Figure 1 (a single image). Essentially, that is the only image the authors talk about and the only concrete \"problem\" they talk about. The title of the paper has the word \"images\", which again is not true.\n\nI would encourage the authors to highlight problems (themes) which will be valuable for the community.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Challenging Images For Minds and Machines", "abstract": "There is no denying the tremendous leap in the performance of machine learning\nmethods in the past half-decade.
