Noticing that the feed-forward layer of a Transformer layer looks a bit like an attention over \"persistent\" memory vectors, the authors propose to explicitly incorporate this notion directly into the self-attention layer. This involves concatenating the contextual representations with global, learned memory vectors, which are attended over. \n\nThe model is tested on widedly-utilized character/word-level language modeling benchmarks, where it is found to outperform, or be on par with, existing models while using fewer number of parameters. \n\nInsofar as architectural advancements can translate to general improvements across multiple NLP tasks, this paper could be seen as important. However, I am not sure that in 2019, demonstrating arguably-marginal perplexity improvements on standard datasets is enough. I would love to see if this type of layer can result in better conditional generation models (e.g. translation, summarization), or can train GPT2/BERT/XLNet-style models whose representations better transfer to other tasks.\n\nI had some further questions/comments:\n\n- I found the motivation of the persistent memory vector as replacing the FF-layer somewhat tenuous. Eq(5) is definitely different from Eq(9)! In my opinion this work can be better motivated/presented as just a standalone modification to the Transformer layer.\n\n- While it is impressive that the proposed approach performs better (or on par with, in the case of character-level language modeling) than the previous state-of-the-art models which are larger, to me it is not immediately clear if the benefit is coming from the proposed modifications, or something else (e.g. some of the things mentioned in 4.3). I understand most of this is taking from prior work, but as we all know, in deep models various architectural/hyperparameter modifications can interact in unexpected ways. Therefore, at a minimum, I would like to see the performance of a comparable model with the same exact setting, except for the persistent attention layer (i.e. N = 0 but using the feedforward sublayers). (If I understand the work correctly, this baseline should have comparable number of parameters?)\n\n- The ablation studies are good but it would be good to see them on the word-level task as well.\n\n- What is the performance of the FF-attn baseline with the same depth? (I understand the number of parameters would be  larger, but does this model perform as well as the Dai et al. 2019 work?)\n\n- What if you combine this with the FF sublayer as well?\n\n- Have you tried qualitatively analyzing the attention distributions? What are some examples in which the persistent memory vectors are attended to most? What are some examples in which the attention distribution for this model differs considerly versus regular self-attention layers?\n\n[EDIT after author rebuttal]\nThank you very much for the rebuttal.

However, we have to respectfully disagree with the reasoning behind the rejection. We agree that having experiments like GPT2/BERT/XLNet-style would make our paper stronger, but this shouldn\u2019t be a reason for rejection. Training such large-scale experiments often take lot of efforts and resources that goes beyond the scope of this paper, and also unlikely to add any more insights to our approach.\n\nThe goal of the paper is not to push the state-of-the-art regardless of model size and complexity, but it\u2019s rather about simplifying the current architecture while maintaining its performance. We chose language modeling tasks because it\u2019s at the core of all those tasks, and rich in baselines of various architectures. However, we agree with the point about missing a same-sized baseline, so we added it in the updated version. Our model still outperforms this baseline as well as the similar-sized TransformerXL baseline. \n\nHere are our answers to your questions: \n- \u201cEq(5) is definitely different from Eq(9)!\u201d \n- Yes, they are not exactly the same. We added section 4.1 to help readers better understand the intuition behind our method, and how we come up with the idea. We modified the introduction to make our motivation more clearer. \n\n- \u201cin deep models various architectural/hyperparameter modifications can interact in unexpected ways. Therefore, at a minimum, I would like to see the performance of a comparable model with the same exact setting\u201d\n- This is a great point and we agree that training details can affect the model performance. Therefore, as suggested, we added a comparable baseline Transformer trained with our code using exactly the same setting as our model in the appendix B. Although the training diverged in near the end (deep transformer models are known to be unstable during training), we can clearly see its performance is worse than our model. \n\n- \u201cWhat is the performance of the FF-attn baseline with the same depth?\u201d\n- Comparing the depth of two different architectures is a little problematic. A transformer layer actually consists of two sublayers, so its depth could be viewed as 2. In that case we added a baseline with 44 sublayers in the appendix B as mentioned above. If the depth is the number of transformer layers, then a same-depth baseline would have 36 layers, or 72 sublayers. This means it has twice as many nonlinear layers as our model. Training a such deep transformer model is known to be very unstable. We did try to train it, but the training diverged after 157k updates as shown in the appendix B. We tried to make it more stable by reducing the gradient clipping without success.\n\n- \u201cWhat if you combine this with the FF sublayer as well?\u201d\n- Combining FF sublayer is an interesting idea that might improve the performance, but as mentioned above, the point of the paper was to simplify the architecture using a single attention mechanism, rather than pushing the limits of the SOTA.\n\n- \u201cHave you tried qualitatively analyzing the attention distributions?\u201d\n- This is a great question. We have tried looking at persistent memory attention qualitatively, but it\u2019s challenging to find any meaningful persistent vector because there are more than half a million of them. Plus, unlike context vectors, they lack any temporal structure or direct connections to input tokens. However, we have included sample attention maps in the appendix A, where we observed several different types of patterns. The attention over persistent vectors is definitely different from the one over context vectors. First they look very random, because they don\u2019t have any structure. Also, we observed that sometimes few persistent vectors would dominate the attention, which could be a focus of a follow-up work.\n\n- \u201cThe ablation studies are good but it would be good to see them on the word-level task as well\u201d\n- Yes, it would be better to have all the ablation studies on all the datasets. However, considering that even training a single word-level model takes a significant amount of resources, we decided to only perform the ablation study on a single dataset."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper617/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper617/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Augmenting Self-attention with Persistent Memory", "authors": ["Sainbayar Sukhbaatar", "Edouard Grave", "Guillaume Lample", "Herve Jegou", "Armand Joulin"], "authorids": ["sainbar@fb.com", "egrave@fb.com", "guismay@fb.com", "rvj@fb.com", "ajoulin@fb.com"], "keywords": ["transformer", "language modeling", "self-attention"], "TL;DR": "A novel attention layer that combines self-attention and feed-forward sublayers of Transformer networks.", "abstract": "Transformer networks have lead to important progress in language modeling and machine translation.

It matched the performance of our model, confirming that our simplification has not degraded the performance.

Our motivation was to simplify the Transformer architecture without degrading its performance. We hope that this simplification will lead to new insights and better analysis of the model. But the smaller number of parameters in the word-level LM task is a concrete outcome that, by itself, could justify our approach.\n\n- \u201cadding a constant dummy input (independent of the example) that would be passed forward and arbitrarily transformed\u201d: \n- This is definitely an interesting idea to explore.

The model is evaluated against a suite of baselines on the tasks of character- and word-level language modeling. Combining this \"all attention\" approach with adaptive span yields results about equivalent to the SOTA, in some cases with fewer parameters than existing models. The authors do a nice job of presenting ablation results. A key finding here, for example, is that the a model stripped of both persistent vectors and the feedforward sublayer performs poorly. \n\nOverall, I'm on the fence regarding this submission. This is solid work, and the idea of exploiting persistent representations in the transformer seems promising. But the architecture change here is relatively minor, and the gains seem somewhat minor (the exception may be in Table 2 which shows equivalent performance with half the parameters to previous SOTA, but then no other model is in the range of O(100m) parameters, so hard to know what's going on here). \n\nOne thing I would have liked is more motivation. If equivalence with fewer parameters is the main aim, then the model seems to fair reasonably well but the results are not really compelling. If, on the other hand, the authors are primarily interested in exploiting persistence, then I think this could have been investigated a bit more exhaustively, and perhaps the focus need not be on necessarily replacing the feedforward subcomponent (although that is one reasonable strategy). I do not see a huge inherent advantage to removing the feedforward layer, and it seems like there are alternative strategies --- at least equally as good --- to reduce parameters. \n\nA question for the authors: did you consider a vanilla Transformer with persistent memory vectors added? This would be something like adding a constant dummy input (independent of the example) that would be passed forward and arbitrarily transformed. I guess the meta-point here is that it doesn't seem to me that the persistent representations and the feedforward sublayer are necessarily mutually exclusive.\n\nAs a minor comment, I think Eq 13 is redundant since it literally repeats Eq. 4 save for swapping in $C_t^+$ for $C_t$."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper617/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper617/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Augmenting Self-attention with Persistent Memory", "authors": ["Sainbayar Sukhbaatar", "Edouard Grave", "Guillaume Lample", "Herve Jegou", "Armand Joulin"], "authorids": ["sainbar@fb.com", "egrave@fb.com", "guismay@fb.com", "rvj@fb.com", "ajoulin@fb.com"], "keywords": ["transformer", "language modeling", "self-attention"], "TL;DR": "A novel attention layer that combines self-attention and feed-forward sublayers of Transformer networks.", "abstract": "Transformer networks have lead to important progress in language modeling and machine translation.
