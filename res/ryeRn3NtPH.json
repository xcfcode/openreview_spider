Although we did not investigate the theoretical aspects of this new problem, we provided enough empirical evidence in our experiments to show the applicability of AITL. We respectfully disagree with the reviewer\u2019s criticism that we studied only one pharmacogenomics case. In fact, we experimented with four different pharmacogenomics datasets. The drugs that we studied have different mechanisms and are being prescribed for different cancers. For example, Docetaxel is a chemotherapy drug mostly known for treating breast cancer, while Bortezomib is a targeted drug mostly used for myeloma. We added a sentence in the experimental section to emphasize this:\n\n\u201cBased on the availability of patient/PDX datasets for a drug, we experimented with four different drugs: Bortezomib, Cisplatin, Docetaxel, and Paclitaxel. It is important to note that these drugs have different mechanisms and are being prescribed for different cancers. For example, Docetaxel is a chemotherapy drug mostly known for treating breast cancer patients (Chang et al., 2005), while Bortezomib is a targeted drug mostly used for multiple myeloma patients (Amin et al., 2014). Therefore, the datasets we have selected cover different types of drugs.\u201c\n\nMoreover, as reviewer 2 mentioned, we are presenting a new problem setting, which is similar to other novel real-world applications that lack well-established benchmark datasets. Our submission does not only propose a method to address this new problem but also provides a list of carefully selected public datasets related to precision oncology that the machine learning community can use to further develop novel methods. We leave a theoretical analysis for future work.  Finally, we would like to note that the authors of our baseline methods adopt a similar experimental design. For example, Tzeng et al., 2017 studied one application (image classification) on two different categories of datasets. Chen et al. 2017 studied one application (image segmentation) on three different datasets. We also studied one application (precision oncology) over four different drugs (datasets). \n\nAnd we added the following  sentence to the conclusion:\n\u201cMoreover, we also did not perform theoretical analysis on this new problem of transfer learning and we leave it for future work.\u201d"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper209/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper209/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "We propose Adversarial Inductive Transfer Learning (AITL), a method for addressing discrepancies in input and output spaces between source and target domains.

Thank you very much for your comments and constructive feedback. We agree that the AITL method might not be novel per se, however, we argue that it is not incremental and in fact it is quite original. As reviewer 2 mentioned, we presented a new problem and showed its real-world applications. We use precision oncology as the driving application for the proposed problem of transfer learning and suggest two other potential applications in the discussion section.  We would like to argue that AITL combines existing methods in a novel way, which enables AITL to address this problem effectively.\n\nQ 2. We agree with you that direct information exchange between different tasks may be beneficial and may improve the performance. However, we would like to point out that AITL achieves this goal indirectly, jointly training source and target domains via the multi-task subnetwork and assigning the cross-domain labels to the source domain. We added a new sentence to the conclusion to emphasize this.\n\nQ 3. We agree with you that the contribution of each component should be studied separately. We selected our baselines exactly in a way to investigate that. We had baselines without transfer learning to see whether or not transfer learning is adding any value. We had a baseline only with the global discriminator (ADDA) to see if one type of adaptation is enough. We also had a baseline with global and class-wise adaptation (Chen et al. 2017) to study the impact of further regularizing domain-invariance without the multi-task component. Finally, we studied all of these components together in our method (AITL) and showed better performance. Therefore, our experiments address your concern.  Nonetheless, to further strengthen our ablation study, we now performed experiments with three new baselines that remove different components of AITL: 1) AITL-AD which utilizes the feature extractor and the multi-task subnetwork, 2) AITL-DG which utilizes the feature extractor, the multi-task subnetwork, and the class-wise discriminators, and 3) AITL-DC which utilizes the feature extractor, the multi-task subnetwork, and the global discriminator. We extended table 1 and added table A3 (Appendix) to include these new experimental results and observed that none of these new baselines achieves the same level of performance as AITL using all of its components together; this again indicates the importance of adaptation in both spaces. We added two paragraphs to the experimental design and the results sections of the paper regarding this. \n\nIssue 1. g(.) provides the source and target tasks with the same feature space so that they will be jointly trained on that feature space with fewer parameters than alternative approaches, such as soft sharing, where there is no shared layer. Instead, in soft sharing,  separate parameters of the source and target networks are regularized to be close to each other. \n\nIssue 2. IC50 is a continuous measure, therefore it is not possible to have a discriminator for it with its raw (continuous) values. It is possible to discretize it, as we had to do for those baselines that cannot work with continuous values. However, discretizing the IC50 values with thresholding causes loss of information. The Waterfall method that we employed for those baselines is a commonly used approach that first generates a waterfall distribution for the drug sensitivity measurements (e.g., IC50) by sorting, and then computes a threshold that separates the data into binary classes based on the Pearson correlation coefficient. \n\nIssue 3.  We added a new table (Table A1 in appendix) for the definition of some of the biological terminologies. and also added the description of the data to the introduction. \n\nIssue 3 (taxonomy). Such a taxonomy is already available in (Pan & Yang, 2009) but we added a new figure to the Appendix (Figure A1) to show three types of inductive transfer learning.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper209/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper209/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "We propose Adversarial Inductive Transfer Learning (AITL), a method for addressing discrepancies in input and output spaces between source and target domains.

The paper is motivated by the application of drug response prediction where the source domain is cell line data and the target domain is patient data. Patient data are usually scarce, hence motivating transferring the knowledge learned from the more widely available cell line data to improve the predictive performance based on the patient data.  The idea of making use of adversarial networks is to learn a representation of the data points that is invariant to whether the data points come from the source domain or the target domain. Experiments on real-world data over four drugs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods compared to other methods that are not specifically designed for this scenario.\n\nThe major utility of the proposed method demonstrated by the paper is its empirical effectiveness on real-world data with four drugs. The reviewer has the following concerns:\n\n1. While the proposed method is capable of handling adaption of the output space between the source domain and the target domain, it makes use of a multi-task subnetwork component, which is a sensible modeling choice but it seems that the idea of leveraging a global discriminator and a class-wise discriminator has been exploited in previous works, as pointed out by the authors in Section 4.2. Therefore, the reviewer is concerned about the modeling contribution made in this paper is somewhat incremental given existing literature.\n\n2. The multi-task subnetwork component itself also seems to be a straightforward and naive way to deal with the different tasks addressed in the source domain and the target domain. For one thing, only the data of the source domain are used to optimize the loss in the source domain and only the data of the target domain are used to optimize the loss in the target domain. While it is understandable that such a decision is due to the lack of ground truth of binary label in the source domain and numeric response in the target domain, ideally, the discriminative process might gain further benefits from borrowing information across the two domains.\n\n3. It is also unclear from the paper how each component of the architecture contributes to the final performance. An ablation study that gets rid of the multi-task subnetwork, global discriminator, and class-wise discriminators (and potential combinations of these components) could help to provide better insights in the importance of each component and determine whether empirically these components do play a role coinciding with the description of the paper.\n\nOther issues/questions:\n1. Intuitively, what is the purpose of the shared layer g() in section 3.2.2?\n2. In the spirit of the class-wise discriminators, will it be helpful to also add a discriminator based on the value of IC50?\n3. Concepts and terminology are not well explained. e.g. what is a cell line? The authors should also provide further descriptions of what do the cell line and patient datasets look like early on in the paper. It was not until section 3 it is clear to the readers that in the dataseets consider in this paper, the source domain and the target domain have the same raw feature representation. Furthermore, in section 2, the authors could consider providing a taxonomy in table format to better explain different types of transfer learning and the three approaches to inductive transfer learning.  \n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper209/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper209/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "We propose Adversarial Inductive Transfer Learning (AITL), a method for addressing discrepancies in input and output spaces between source and target domains.

Experimental results indicate that AITL outperforms state-of-the-art pharmacogenomics and transfer learning baselines and may guide precision oncology more accurately.", "title": "Adversarial Inductive Transfer Learning with input and output space adaptation", "code": "https://github.com/tllabtl/AITL", "keywords": ["Inductive transfer learning", "adversarial learning", "multi-task learning", "pharmacogenomics", "precision oncology"], "pdf": "/pdf/8501a0a10f8badb29128089fe4923bc314417d4a.pdf", "authors": ["Hossein Sharifi-Noghabi", "Shuman Peng", "Olga Zolotareva", "Colin C.
