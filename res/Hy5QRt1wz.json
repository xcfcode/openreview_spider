The authors do this by generating an image using an adversarially-trained generator and perturbing its \"latent code\". The classifier is trained to minimize the sensitivity of its predictions to these perturbations. The authors add this regularization on top of the method from Salimans et al. (NIPS 2016). This produces strong results on two standard semi-supervised learning benchmarks.\n\nOne challenge I see for this approach is that it may depend strongly on being able to generate sufficiently good images.

Some baselines are missing. ", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "review": "The paper uses widely held assumptions about GANs in an interesting way: the assumption that GANs capture the underlying manifold structure of natural images embedded in Euclidean space, as well as the distribution of natural images over this manifold. While this assumption has been contested (Arora, Ge, Liang, Ma & Jang 2017, Arora & Zhang 2017), it seems reasonable to see if it one can make progress based on making this assumption. \n\nThe way the paper uses this assumption is using the idea of manifold regularization popularized by Belkin et al. (2016), noting that GANs offer a potentially more powerful way to model the Laplacian compared with the classic, spectral methods.\n\nExperiments seem to indicate this idea has merit, showing strong performance. Somewhat disconcerting is the strong dependence of some of the baselines on hyperparameter selection - this is not a bug of the current paper, rather a bug of the field of GAN experiments, and I thank the authors for reporting this additional finding. \n\nAn important missing baseline is comparing to classifiers using spectral Laplacian methods. One could easily train a standard DNN on a classification task and calculate the Laplacian over on the layers, using it along the lines of Belkin et al. \n\nPros:\n1. Interesting idea, novel to the best of my knowledge.\n2. Good experimental results.\n\nCons:\n1. Missing baseline\n2. Lacking discussion of the approximation method for the Jacobian. Is the Gaussian sampling acting simply as some sort of regularizer, or is the Jacobian structure truly used?  How sensitive are the results to the choice of epsilon? What would happen if instead of the \"Jacobian-like\" term one would use a simply the norm ||f|| implied by the ambient Euclidean space?
