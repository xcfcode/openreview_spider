Results show better calibration of the output probability values\ncompared to a single neural network and to pure deep ensembles, while maintaining\ngood accuracy (at least on shown results).\n\nAssessment:\n- Novelty: limited, as the method is identical to Liu and Yao (1999), but re-examined in the context of probability calibration.\n- Clarity: the paper is easy to understand.\n- Significance: this work provides a solution to an important problem.\n- Quality: results are shown, but they are not compared to any calibration method besides ensembling.\n\nDecision:\n+ A simple idea to an important problem.\n- The method is not novel, although its application to probability calibration is.\n- The method is not compared to any of the many well-known methods for probability calibration (e.g, histogram-based calibration, sigmoid calibration, isotonic regression, etc). It is therefore difficult to assess the significance and quality of this work.\n- Experiments are limited to a single dataset.\n\nOverall, this work is a good proof-of-work but the lack of experimental results (on more than one dataset, and compared to well-established baselines) makes it difficult to determine the actual significance of the contribution. For these reasons, I do not recommend this paper for acceptance.\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Diversity Regularization in Deep Ensembles", "abstract": "Calibrating the confidence of supervised learning models is important for a variety of contexts where the certainty over predictions should be reliable.
