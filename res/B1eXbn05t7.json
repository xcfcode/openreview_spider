As you mentioned, methods like [1] and [2] do perform open-ended recombination. Note that these methods perform not only texture transfer but also color transfer, while the proposed method seems to perform mostly only color transfer. As shown in Figure 6, essentially what the method does is transfer the color of the style image to the content image, sometimes with a little tweak, making the image distorted. One could say that in terms of image style transfer, the proposed method actually underperforms [1] and [2]. \n\nHence I agree with R2 that comparison is still necessary for the submission to be more convincing and complete.\n\n------------------------------\n\nThis paper proposed to use a mechanism of leakage filtering to separate styles and content in the VAE encoding, and consequently enable open-ended content-style recombination. Essentially the model tries to maximize the similarity between images in S^+ and minimize the similarity between those in S^-.\n\nI have several questions:\n\nOne concern that I have is the relationship/difference between this work and previous work on style transfer, especially universal/zero-shot style transfer as in [1,2]. In the introduction and related work sections, the authors argue that most previous work assumes that content classes in testing are the same as those in training, and that they are not general purpose. Note that various works on style transfer already address this issue, for example in [1, 2]. For those models, content is represented by high-level feature maps in neural networks, and style is represented by the Gram matrix of the feature maps. The trained model is actually universal (invariant to content and styles). Actually these methods use even less supervision than STOC since they do not require labels (e.g., digit labels in MNIST).\n\nThis brings me to my second concern on proper baselines. Given the fact that previous universal/zero-shot style transfer models focus on similar tasks, it seems necessary to compare STOC to them and see what the advantages of STOC is. Similar experiments can be conducted for the data augmentation tasks.\n\nIn Sec. 4, the authors mentioned that U-Net skip connection is used. Does it affect the effectiveness of the content/style separation, since the LF objective function is mostly based on the encoding z, which is supposed \u2018skipped\u2019 in STOC. Will this lead to additional information leakage?\n\nIt is not clear how the last term of L_{LF} is computed. Could you provide more details?\n\nThe organization and layout of figures could be improved. The title/number for the first section is missing.\n\nMissing references:\n\n[1] Universal style transfer via feature transforms, 2017\n[2] ZM-Net: Real-time zero-shot image manipulation network, 2017\n[3] Structured GAN, 2017", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1157/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Open-Ended Content-Style Recombination Via Leakage Filtering", "abstract": "We consider visual domains in which a class label specifies the content of an image, and class-irrelevant properties that differentiate instances constitute the style.

Regarding related work you cite, your references [1] and [2] are variations on the neural style transfer method of Gatys et al. [2016]. In this approach, content is defined as the image itself, and style is defined in terms of spatially invariant image statistics (the Gram matrix). This model is often described as a texture-transfer method, although the notion of texture can be quite abstract. Although this method does perform open-ended recombination (it can work for any new pair of images defining content and style), it is limited to transferring texture and not arbitrary style. For example, it could not re-render faces in different poses as in our Figure 1. It\u2019s therefore highly unlikely to work well for tasks such as face or character style transfer. The structured GAN--your reference [3]--is shown to work only with a fixed set of classes. We appreciate that the method could be extended use an embedding representation to work with open-ended content, but this extension is beyond the scope of work for a comparison. We have incorporated a discussion of the related work [1,2,3] in in our manuscript.\n\nRegarding the U-Net skip connections and their effect on the leakage filtering objective: Leakage filtering places constraints on the recombined images, rather than on the latent representations. It is therefore compatible with architectures using skip connections. Predictability minimization is a regularizer on the latent representation, and would be incompatible with skip connections, but we do not explore that case due to the poor performance of predictability minimization.\n\nRegarding how the final term of the leakage filtering loss, $L_{LF}$ is computed: the histogram loss [Ustinova et al., 2016] is used for evaluating the content in a reconstruction, exactly as we used the histogram loss for determining the content embedding in the first place.  It is a simple and elegant approach."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1157/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1157/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1157/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Open-Ended Content-Style Recombination Via Leakage Filtering", "abstract": "We consider visual domains in which a class label specifies the content of an image, and class-irrelevant properties that differentiate instances constitute the style.

Our goal is to perform content-style recombination, whereas Sohn et al. [2017] is primarily concerned with image completion and segmentation. While Tzeng et al. [2017] uses adversarial training via the GAN objective, it is otherwise not related to predictability minimization [Schmidhuber, 1992], which is a distinct adversarial method.\n \nRegarding the trade off of different losses: we explore varying the loss coefficients for CE, PM, and LF. These results are shown in Figure 8 in the Appendix. All components of STOC are needed to attain maximal performance.\n\nRegarding low-shot learning on Omniglot: We ran new simulations, included in the updated paper, showing the boost due to traditional data augmentation approaches (rigid image transformations), and showing a significant additional benefit of augmentation by synthetic examples. This puts our work on the same footing as the (still unpublished) DAGAN model by Antoniou et al. [2017], which includes some (undescribed) form of traditional data augmentation. With matched baselines, we perform comparably to DAGAN. DAGAN is designed specifically to perform data augmentation, whereas we are using data augmentation as a quantitative evaluation metric.

Experiments on MNIST, Omniglot, and VGG-Faces demonstrate that the proposed methods can learn to generate images combining the style of one image and the content of another. The proposed method is also used as a form of learned data augmentation, where it improves one-shot and low-shot learning on Omniglot.\n\nPros:\n- The paper is well-written and easy to follow\n- The proposed methods CC, CE, PM, and LF are all simple and intuitive\n- Improving low-shot learning via generative models is an interesting and important direction\n\nCons:\n- No comparison to prior work on generation results\n- Limited discussion comparing the proposed methods to other published alternatives\n- No ablations on Omniglot or VGG-Faces generation\n- Low-shot results are not very convincing\n\nCOMPARISON WITH PRIOR WORK\nThere have been many methods that propose various forms of conditional image generation in generative models, such as conditional VAEs in [Sohn et al, 2015]; there have also been previous methods such as [Siddharth et al, 2017] which disentangle style and content using the same sort of supervision as in this paper. Given the extensive prior work on generative models I was a bit surprised to see no comparisons of images generated with the proposed method against those generated by previously proposed methods. Without such comparisons it is difficult to judge the significance of the qualitative results in Figures 3, 5, and 6. In Figure 3 I also find it difficult to tell whether there are any substantial differences between the four proposed methods.\n\nThe proposed predictiability minimization is very related to some recent approaches for domain transfer such as [Tzeng et al, 2017]; I would have liked to see a more detailed discussion of how the proposed methods relate to others.\n\nOMNIGLOT / VGG-FACES ABLATIONS\nThe final model includes several components - the KL divergence term from the VAE, two terms from LF, and a WGAN-GP adversarial loss. How much do each of these terms contribute the quality of the generated results?\n\nLOW-SHOT RESULTS\nI appreciate low-shot learning as a testbed for this sort of disentangled image generation, but unfortunately the experimental results are not very convincing. For one-shot performance on Omniglot, the baseline Histogram Embedding methods achieves 0.974 accuracy which improves to 0.975 using STOC. Is such a small improvement significant, or can it be explained due to variance in other factors (random initializations, hyperparameters, etc)?\n\nFor low-shot learning on Omniglot, the proposed method is outperformed by [Antoniou et al, 2017] at all values of k. More importantly, I\u2019m concerned that the comparison between the two methods is unfair due to the use of different dataset splits, as demonstrated by the drastically different baseline accuracies. Although it\u2019s true that the proposed method achieves a proportionally larger improvement over the baseline compared with [Antoniou et al, 2017], the differences in experimental setup may be too large to draw a conclusion one way or the other about which method is better.\n\nOVERALL\nAlthough the paper is well-written and presents several intuitive methods for content/style decomposition with generative models, it\u2019s hard to tell whether the results are significant due to incomplete comparison with prior work. On the generation side I would like to see a comparison especially with [Siddharth et al, 2017]. For low shot learning I think that the proposed method shows some promise, but it is difficult to draw hard conclusions from the experiments. For these reasons I lean slightly toward rejection.\n\nMISSING REFERENCES\nSiddharth et al, \u201cLearning Disentangled Representations with Semi-Supervised Deep Generative Models\u201d, NIPS 2017\n\nSohn, Lee, and Yan, \u201cLearning structured output representation using deep conditional generative models\u201d, NIPS 2015\n\nTzeng, Hoffman, Darrell, and Saenko, \u201cAdversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation\u201d, CVPR 2017\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1157/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Open-Ended Content-Style Recombination Via Leakage Filtering", "abstract": "We consider visual domains in which a class label specifies the content of an image, and class-irrelevant properties that differentiate instances constitute the style.
