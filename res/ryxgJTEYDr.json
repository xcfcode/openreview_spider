Their approach is to decompose the policy into a bunch of primitives. Each primitive acts according to its own interpretation of the state. All the primitives are competing with each other on a given state to take an action. It turns out that these primitive policies can be transferred to other tasks as they represent subtasks of a bigger task. The paper performs extensive experiments to show that this scheme improves over both flat and hierarchical policies in terms of generalization.\n\t\n\tThis paper is well-written. I enjoyed reading it. Almost all my questions and doubts are explained when I read through the paper. The framework about using primitive policy to solve a big task is novel and original. The experiments are nice and convincing.\n\t\n\tMinor comments:\n\t\u2022 I am understanding the methods as a decomposing the policy into components. Different components are combined together using a probability distribution. To balance the competition and overlap of different primitives, different regularization objective are used.  Did you think about other simple methods, e.g., decompose the policy using linear combination work? It may worthwhile to compare your method with this baseline?\n\t\u2022 About the prior p(z), how to choose it in a meaningful way? I do not see why a unit gaussian is a good prior. It seems you want p(z|s) to be as close to a unit Gaussian as possible?\n\t\u2022 Figure 4 does not show a clear cluster structure.

These policy primitives don't need a higher-level meta-policy to stitch them together. Instead the decision is made in a decentralized manner balancing the cost of information acquisition with maximizing rewards.\nThe paper seems to build on the idea of decomposing the task primitives that specialize in different parts of the state space. A related recent paper [1] which used similar ideas, albeit with a central coordinator to do task composition is missing from related works.\n\nThere are other issues with the paper as well. \n- Decision making is not exactly \"decentralized\"? Computing $Z$ in $\\alpha_k$, still requires the values from other primitives?\n- Sec 5.1 seems tacked on. Motion Imitation is not RL. Experiment details about motion imitation unclear from description. \n- In Figure 5: Zero-shot generalization, it's unclear from the plot whether it actually generalized to solve the tasks A and B. Relative frequency of activation are meaningless without reporting the actual performance on these environments. Where do the 4 indices come from? From the plot above there were only 2 indices but plot below has 4.\n- Continuous control tasks required pretraining.\n\nOverall the experiments seem a little underwhelming. More details on transfer performance without pretraining would be quite helpful. I like the idea of a competitive ensemble figuring out a useful task decomposition and using an information bottleneck like approach makes sense.\n\n[1] https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3331671\n\n*Edit*: Updated the score after the reading the revision and the authors' responses.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper288/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper288/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Reinforcement Learning with Competitive  Ensembles of Information-Constrained Primitives", "authors": ["Anirudh Goyal", "Shagun Sodhani", "Jonathan Binas", "Xue Bin Peng", "Sergey Levine", "Yoshua Bengio"], "authorids": ["anirudhgoyal9119@gmail.com", "sshagunsodhani@gmail.com", "jbinas@gmail.com", "xbpeng@berkeley.edu", "svlevine@eecs.berkeley.edu", "yoshua.bengio@mila.quebec"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Variational Information Bottleneck", "Learning primitives"], "TL;DR": "Learning an implicit master policy, as a master policy in HRL can fail to generalize.", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning agents that operate in diverse and complex environments can benefit from the structured decomposition of their behavior.

While in principle a policy could be defined as a linear combination of sub-policies, we are interested in the sparse case, where only one primitive becomes active at a time, and thus is the sole actor at that time. A linear combination of primitives would mean that many or all of them would be acting, which, in turn, would mean that all primitives are active to some extent at any time and therefore need to know how to act in any state. This is contradictory to our main objective of achieving specialized primitives that focus on certain parts of the state space.\n\nRe prior: While this choice is somewhat arbitrary and other distributions could be employed, Gaussian priors have been used extensively in latent variable models and in settings similar to ours (e.g. [1-3]) to introduce a certain geometry in latent space. The benefits of using a Gaussian prior are, among others, efficient evaluation and analytical tractability (e.g. the reparameterization trick and analytical computation of the KL term). In short, using a Gaussian prior is mainly a matter of convenience, but it is sufficient, as the nonlinear decoder can transform it into an arbitrary distribution.\n\n[1] Variational Information Bottleneck, https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00410\n[2] InfoBot, https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10902\n[3] Information Asymmetry in KL regularized RL, https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01240\n\n\nRe figure 4: We agree that the visualization does not show a very clear structure. This is likely because there is no natural way of clustering the states of the given task. Nevertheless, many of the small clusters that emerge are mostly taken care of by a single primitive (single color in the diagram.)\nFig. 2 in the main paper is perhaps a more intuitive way of visualizing the dynamics: in the bottom panel it can be seen that individual primitives are active for certain sequences of consecutive states.\nIn addition to the static material, we provide a video showing the evolution of the dynamics. The 4 blue bars indicate the relative activation of the different primitives in the current state.\n\nVideo: https://gofile.io/?c=8hZkaW"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper288/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper288/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Reinforcement Learning with Competitive  Ensembles of Information-Constrained Primitives", "authors": ["Anirudh Goyal", "Shagun Sodhani", "Jonathan Binas", "Xue Bin Peng", "Sergey Levine", "Yoshua Bengio"], "authorids": ["anirudhgoyal9119@gmail.com", "sshagunsodhani@gmail.com", "jbinas@gmail.com", "xbpeng@berkeley.edu", "svlevine@eecs.berkeley.edu", "yoshua.bengio@mila.quebec"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Variational Information Bottleneck", "Learning primitives"], "TL;DR": "Learning an implicit master policy, as a master policy in HRL can fail to generalize.", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning agents that operate in diverse and complex environments can benefit from the structured decomposition of their behavior.

We will update the related work section to include this.\n\n\n\u201cDecision making is not exactly \"decentralized\"? Computing in Z, in a_k still requires the values from other primitives?\u201d\n\nThanks for pointing out this ambiguity. We mean decentralized in the sense that individual primitives can be trained and function individually, without a central meta controller. For instance, we can train a set of primitives on task distribution A, train a different set of primitives on task distribution B, and then  combine them together to solve task distribution C (as in fig. 5 of the paper, for instance). We realize that this terminology was unclear and will revise the paper accordingly. We will replace the term \u201cdecentralized\u201d with \u201cimplicitly decentralized\u201d or \u201cimplicit master policy\u201d.\n\n\n\u201cMotion Imitation is not RL\u201d\n\nWe agree with the reviewer. Imitation learning is a simpler problem as compared to reinforcement learning. In the given task, we intend to demonstrate that we can use a set of distinct primitives for imitation learning. We use the exact same experimental protocol as in [1]. We will expand the experiment description to clarify this.\n\n[1] Deepmimic: Example guided deep reinforcement learning of physics-based character skills (Peng et al.)\n\n\n\u201cZero-shot generalization\u201d\n\nThanks for pointing out the discrepancy in the figure. We realize that there was a mistake in the illustration in the \u201czero-shot generalization\u201d panel of fig. 5: each model should consist of 4 primitives, rather than 2; the 4 traces in the plot are correct, however. The purpose of this experiment is to show that the model consisting of multiple primitives is somewhat able to decompose the task C into its subtasks, A and B. The better this decomposition the better should the model transfer to the individual subtasks. The performance obtained on this task, which we will include in the updated paper, is as follows:\n\nTrain on task C                                                Generalization performance on tasks A and B (avg.)\n\n4 policies (Proposed method)                      72%\nMonolithic Policy                                            38%\n\n\n\u201cContinuous control tasks required pretraining.\u201d\n\nThe goal of the continuous control experiments is to show that we can repurpose the learnt primitives: we first pretrain the primitives to walk (i.e in the absence of any goal), and then transfer the trained primitives to a more complex environment (where they have to navigate to a set of distinct goals), where they are trained further. This task is challenging, as the policy gets a reward only on reaching the goals. We also compared the proposed method to other hierarchical baselines like MLSH, Option Critic, and Feudal-like architectures. While pretraining is not strictly required to solve this task, we are specifically interested in whether and how we can reuse already pretrained primitives.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper288/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper288/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Reinforcement Learning with Competitive  Ensembles of Information-Constrained Primitives", "authors": ["Anirudh Goyal", "Shagun Sodhani", "Jonathan Binas", "Xue Bin Peng", "Sergey Levine", "Yoshua Bengio"], "authorids": ["anirudhgoyal9119@gmail.com", "sshagunsodhani@gmail.com", "jbinas@gmail.com", "xbpeng@berkeley.edu", "svlevine@eecs.berkeley.edu", "yoshua.bengio@mila.quebec"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Variational Information Bottleneck", "Learning primitives"], "TL;DR": "Learning an implicit master policy, as a master policy in HRL can fail to generalize.", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning agents that operate in diverse and complex environments can benefit from the structured decomposition of their behavior.
