It starts from the observation that these attacks mostly minimize the perturbation and the classification loss, and proposes a new training strategy named Target Training. The method duplicate training examples with a special ground-truth label, to fool the adversarial attackers. Experiments are conducted on MNIST and CIFAR10 under several attacks.\n\n\\+ The proposed method is simple, and involves a little modification to the classifiers and small computation overheads.\n\n\\- In the bottom of page 5, authors claimed that \"adversary has complete knowledge of how the defense works\". Could the authors please elaborate that, and how are the attacks modified to handle the proposed defense? If the untargeted attack is conducted on a 20-way classifier (for MNIST) without modification, I am not sure this evaluation is valid. One can add an extra layer after the last layer of the classifier, mapping $(y_0,\\cdots, y_{2k-2})$ to $(y_0+y_k,\\cdots,y_{k-1}+y_{2k-1})$, and then perform attacks -- since this is how the classifier actually works.\n\n\\- In Equation Minimization 1, there is a tern $l$ which is the adversarial label. I am not sure it is appropriate here since we are doing untargeted attacks.\n\n\\- From Table 2, the proposed method seems to achieve almost the same performance compared with vanilla adversarial training.\n\n\\- In Section 4.3, authors say Target Training maintains performance on clean images, when trained with adversarial samples. This might be inaccurate -- we can say Target Training achieves same performance on clean images compared with vanilla adversarial training.\n\n---- Post rebuttal ---\nI appreciate the responses from the authors, which partially address the concerns I was having. However, I am still not fully convinced that the proposed method is significant enough.

However, since this method is defending the white-box  threat model, I believe a simple attack could break it:\n\nTo generate adversarial sample for test data $x$ whose correct label is $y$ or $y+k$, run PGD algorithm with the objective function $\\hat{x}= argmax_{x} l(f(x),y)+l(f(x),y+k)$, where $\\hat{x}$ is the adversarial example, $k$ is the number of classes (before duplication) and $f$ is the network trained by target training. Namely, this is just maximize the loss for both the real class $y$ and the duplicated class $y+k$.\nI'm not sure why the authors did not include any adaptive attacks like this one in section 5.\n\nOther flaws:\n\n-The writing is confusing, a lot of details are omitted. For example, what is perturbation size for CIFAR10 under PGD attack?\n\n-In section 4.1, the authors say \"Thus, the undefeated Adversarial Training defense cannot be used as a baseline because\nit uses adversarial samples during training for all types of attack.\" I don't buy it.

We have now removed $l$ from the Minimization formula to avoid confusion in untargeted attacks.\n\n2. As stated in the previous reply, in Algorithm 3, Target Training (TT) and Adversarial Training (AT) have the same overhead over normal training. Both TT and AT need to generate adversarial samples in each iteration of the training. This slows down the training considerably because the classifier in its current state has to be used to generate adversarial samples in each batch.\n\nIn Algorithm 1 against attacks that minimize perturbation, TT does not use adversarial samples, so this overhead is no longer there for TT. The overhead stays for AT.\n\n3. For attacks the minimize perturbation in CIFAR10, TT improves accuracy on clean data to 86.7\\% from 84.3\\%. For other attacks, it has the same limitation as AT. These results are now shown in Table 7 in the Appendix.\n\n\n4. As stated in the previous reply, Table 6 highlights cases where training with samples from attacks that do not minimize perturbation can sometimes offer defense against attacks that minimize perturbation (CarliniWagner($\\kappa=0$), DeepFool). This happens more in MNIST than in CIFAR10, and more in TT than in AT, as shown in Table 6. For example, when trained with CarliniWagner($\\kappa=40$) adversarial samples, TT achieves 71.3\\% on CarliniWagner($\\kappa=0$), whereas AT achieves 12.3\\% (correction from previous reply).\n\nWe have now added in the paper that Target Training could be extended to defend simultaneously against many attacks by having a designated class for each attack, and training with adversarial samples labeled with the designated class. However, we also state in the paper that we do not conduct experiments for such multi-attack defense in this paper.\n\n5. We implement an adaptive attack where the attack adds an extra layer with 20 inputs and 10 outputs where output $i$ is the sum of inputs $i$ and $k$. We find that Target Training withstands this adaptive attack for non-$L_\\infty$ attacks, and in MNIST even the CW-$L_\\infty$ attack. We discuss that we think that the adaptive attack fails (for non-$L_\\infty$ attacks) because the addition of the extra layer turns the classifier into an Adversarial-Trained classifier. We also discuss that we think Target Training performance against $L_\\infty$ attacks is affected by the low capacity of the classifiers we use. The results are summarized in Table 4.

Please find below answers to your remarks.\n\nThe attack you are suggesting was also suggested by AnonReviewer3. As I explained to them also, Target Training still works against this adaptive attack because what the attack achieves is to convert the Target-Trained classifier into an Adversarially-Trained classifier: the classifier that is changed becomes a classifier trained with nearby samples that are labeled correctly. Therefore, Target Training in this case would work for the same reason that Adversarial Training works.\n\nI have also implemented this adaptive attack and get: \nFor Cifar10 - 86.56\\% for DeepFool, 83.15\\% for CarliniWagner($\\kappa=0$), 75.63\\% for CarliniWagner($\\kappa=40$), 7.14\\% for PGD.\nFor Mnist - 94.88\\% for DeepFool, 95.72\\% for CarliniWagner($\\kappa=0$), 93.92\\% for CarliniWagner($\\kappa=40$), 57.93\\% for PGD.\nThe results are similar to the results of transferability attacks, but with better accuracies except for the PGD attack.\n\n-We agree that more details of the attacks should have been included. CIFAR10 under PGD had: eps=8.0, eps_step=2.0, num_random_init=0, max_iter=7, same as the PGD paper by Madry et al for CIFAR10.\n\n-Adversarial Training is known to not approach original classifier, clean image accuracy, whereas Target Training exceeds it for adversarial attacks that minimize perturbation in CIFAR10 - for example 86.2\\% for CarliniWagner($\\kappa=0$). \n\n-In Adversarial Training, a classifier needs to be trained with adversarial samples of the attack that it is supposed to counter: at each iteration of the training. In order to generate the adversarial samples, the attack needs to be known during training. This is why we state that \"Adversarial training assumes that the attack is known...\". Occasionally, it can happen that when a classifier is trained with adversarial samples from one attack, it can provide protection against other, usually similar, attacks as well. In Table 6 in our paper's Appendix, we highlight such cases. However, there are no guarantees unless the correct attack is used. Even with the correct attack used in Adversarial Training, different parameter settings lead to worse results.\n\n-The ZOO attack is very slow to run, due to which even its authors report results for only 200 randomly sampled test images. We did the same, and reported the results thinking that the size of the sample might have skewed the result.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper937/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper937/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Target Training: Tricking Adversarial Attacks to Fail", "authorids": ["~Blerta_Lindqvist1"], "authors": ["Blerta Lindqvist"], "keywords": ["adversarial machine learning"], "abstract": "Recent adversarial defense approaches have failed.

Please, find below the answers to your questions.\n1. The Minimization 1 is based on the first formulation of this Minimization by Szegedy et al. (cited in the paper). The $l$ in this minimization is a variable, not a constant. $l$ can be any of the adversarial labels. On the other hand, the $c$ in the minimization is introduced as a constant, right after $l$.\n2. In Algorithm 3, Target Training (TT) and Adversarial Training (AT) have the same overhead over normal training. Both TT and AT need to generate adversarial samples in each iteration of the training. This slows down the training considerably because the classifier in its current state has to be used to generate adversarial samples in each batch.\nIn Algorithm 1 against attacks that minimize perturbation, TT does not use adversarial samples, so this overhead is no longer there for TT.\n3. For attacks the minimize perturbation in CIFAR10, TT improves accuracy on clean data to 86.7\\% from 84.3\\%. For other attacks, it has the same limitation as AT. These results are shown in Table 5 in the Appendix.\n4. Table 6 highlights cases where training with samples from attacks that do not minimize perturbation can sometimes offer defense against attacks that minimize perturbation (CarliniWagner($\\kappa=0$), DeepFool). This happens more in MNIST than in CIFAR10, and more in TT than in AT, as shown in Table 6. For example, when trained with CarliniWagner($\\kappa=40$) adversarial samples, TT achieves 71.3\\% on CarliniWagner($\\kappa=0$), whereas AT achieves 13.2\\%.\nAlgorithm 1 and Algorithm 3 need not be exclusive of each-other (Algorithm 3 + Algorithm 3 can also be combined to protect against two types of attacks). For Algorithm 1 + Algorithm 3 combination, we would concatenate the batches of Alg. 1 and Alg. 3, and the top probabilities would be about $0.25$. This could even be extended further for more attacks. I have not implemented any of this. Another approach, used in AT, would be randomly selecting in each batch the attack(s) used for generation of adversarial samples.\n5. AnonReviewer3 and AnonReviewer1 have suggested an adaptive attack that we think TT is able to withstand. The adaptive attacker, they suggest, could add an extra layer on top of the classifier with 20 inputs and 10 outputs, where every output $i$ is the sum of inputs $i$ and $i+k$. We argue that this would effectively turn the Target-Trained classifier into an Adversarially-Trained classifier because the classifier has been trained with additional samples that are close to the original samples and which are labeled correctly (due to the relabeling from the extra layer). Against this adaptive attack, TT would work for the same reason that AT works.\nI have implemented this adaptive attack and get: \nFor Cifar10 - 86.56\\% for DeepFool, 83.15\\% for CarliniWagner($\\kappa=0$), 75.63\\% for CarliniWagner($\\kappa=40$), 7.14\\% for PGD.\nFor Mnist - 94.88\\% for DeepFool, 95.72\\% for CarliniWagner($\\kappa=0$), 93.92\\% for CarliniWagner($\\kappa=40$), 57.93\\% for PGD.\nThe results are similar to the results of transferability attacks, but with better accuracies except for the PGD attack."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper937/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper937/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Target Training: Tricking Adversarial Attacks to Fail", "authorids": ["~Blerta_Lindqvist1"], "authors": ["Blerta Lindqvist"], "keywords": ["adversarial machine learning"], "abstract": "Recent adversarial defense approaches have failed.

There, the adversarial samples are generated with a 10-way unsecured classifier. That 10-way classifier does not have the 20-way extra layer of the reviewer-suggested classifier, but the 10-way classifier should be harder to defeat because it is closer to the original architecture of the classifier (it has no extra layer). We agree that we should have mentioned this in the adaptive evaluation.\n\n-Equation Minimization 1 is based on the formulation by Szegedy et al. in the referenced paper.\n\n-We agree, Table 2 also states the same. The point of Table 2 was to show that Target Training maintained performance similarly to Adversarial Training on attacks that do not minimize perturbation.\n\n-You are right, except for one case: when Target-Trained for attacks that minimize perturbation in CIFAR10, the classifier accuracy on clean images exceeds default classifier performance: 86.7% (up from 84.3%)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper937/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper937/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Target Training: Tricking Adversarial Attacks to Fail", "authorids": ["~Blerta_Lindqvist1"], "authors": ["Blerta Lindqvist"], "keywords": ["adversarial machine learning"], "abstract": "Recent adversarial defense approaches have failed.
