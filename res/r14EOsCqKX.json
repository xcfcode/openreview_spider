For the loss landscape analysis performed for SGDR iterates, our current implementation of VGG indeed does not involve Batch Normalization. We have added new results in the appendix (Section 8.4 and Fig 13) to cover the case of VGG with BN. The results obtained are qualitatively very similar to the ones for without BN.\nFor results related to the FC freezing for large batch training, Section 10 (and Fig 15) in the Appendix includes results for 2 ResNet architectures (containing BN and skip connections).\n\n(2) Regarding practical implication: Thank you for your suggestion. We have added a brief discussion to our paper highlighting the possible practical implications of our work, and specifically: new heuristics that could improve training and fundamental research questions that our results motivate. We hope one valuable takeaway for readers would be our careful investigation of the heuristics and these new questions that our results open up. \n\nThank you for pointing out the issue with Fig 3, we have modified its caption to aid the reader\u2019s understanding.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper347/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper347/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper347/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Closer Look at Deep Learning Heuristics: Learning rate restarts, Warmup and Distillation", "abstract": "The convergence rate and final performance of common deep learning models have significantly benefited from recently proposed heuristics such as learning rate schedules, knowledge distillation, skip connections and normalization layers.

For (2), they study the effect of learning rate warmup using CCA, coming to the conclusion that learning rate warmup helps stabilize the fully connected layers. (3) They also study model distillation with CCA, finding out that the higher layers are the most similar to the teacher model. \n\nClarity: The paper is clearly written, cites lots of relevant work, and describes the experiments in detail.\n\nOriginality: This paper seems original, while the techniques used are established, they conduct thorough experiments on phenomena in deep learning that haven't been studied.\n \n\nComments on Significance and Quality:\nI liked parts (2), (3) of the paper most, as it seemed like conclusions from these parts were fairly clear: \n\nFigures 4, 5 make the effect of warm restarts in the large batch setting on FC layers clear: the restarts help the layers stabilize better. I really liked the experiment in 4(d), where they tested this hypothesis by freezing the fully connected layers for the duration of the warmup.  It was interesting to see that this had no effect on the remainder of the trajectory. This seemed to be a good demonstration and investigation of the effect of warm restarts, and I appreciate the tests on different architectures in the supplementary material. I'd be curious to see if there's some way to further incorporate this into learning rate schedules.\n\nI also liked Figure 6, exploring Model distillation, which showed that the higher layers of the shallower network were the most affected by the teacher network. The authors cite related work which suggests only training higher layers, and I'd be curious to see how only training higher layers affects accuracy.\n\nWhile I thought the experiments for part (1) SGD with Restarts were thorough, and appreciated Figure 1, which experimentally validated the use of mode connectivity, I felt there was some difficulty in interpreting the results. \n\nFirstly, in Figure 2, the claim is that SGD with Restarts does possibly bridge local minima as the mode connectivity curves increase between the two convergence points. However, we see in both 2(b) and 2(c) that the linear interpolation between both convergence points does *not* increase in loss. In which case is there any reason to believe that the increase of MC in the middle means that SGDR is climbing a basin? How do we know that the linear combination isn't closer to the path followed by SGDR? \n\nFor additional comparisons, it would be good to have the linear combination plots for Figure 1 also.\n\nIn general, it seems hard to make meaningful conclusions with low dimensional projections of a very high dimensional loss surface. We'd have to know some kind of theoretical property of MC to be able to do so.\n\nMinor Comments\n\nI think the figures in this paper could be much clearer. In Figure 2 for example, the legend blocks some of the main areas of interest of the plot. I would recommend cutting some of the raw learning rate figures and making all figures much bigger.\n\nIn figure 4(d), the text describes the process in training steps (200 training steps), but the plot is in epochs -- it would be better if the text and axis were consistent in units.\n\nConclusion:\nDespite my concerns on the first part of this paper, I think the very thorough experiments, clear presentation and the interesting results on learning rate warmups and model distillation merit its acceptance. \n\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper347/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Closer Look at Deep Learning Heuristics: Learning rate restarts, Warmup and Distillation", "abstract": "The convergence rate and final performance of common deep learning models have significantly benefited from recently proposed heuristics such as learning rate schedules, knowledge distillation, skip connections and normalization layers.

Authors mention Batch Normalization (BN) among heuristics widely used in deep learning. It is known that properties of both loss surface and activations are different between DNN architectures which include BN layers and those which do not. To emphasize generality of obtained results, it would be beneficial to conduct experiments for both types of DNN architectures as at the moment the majority of the results are presented for VGG architecture which typically does not include BN. Impact of other architecture modifications (e.g. skip connections) might be considered as well.\n\n- I find the significance of the results unclear.

The paper does not contradict the original SGDR paper and the authors correctly mention \"Loshchilov & Hutter (2016) do not claim to observe any effect related to multi-modality\". The paper clarifies that the speculations around SGDR escaping local optima introduced in more recent papers and blog posts don't have enough support (\"Huang et al. (2017)\u2019s claims about SGDR converging to and escaping from local minima might be an oversimplification\"). These speculations might be confirmed (e.g., I would not be surprised if it happens on some tricky datasets/tasks) but as the paper points out, we are currently lacking enough supporting material to make that claim. \nIn line with our observations, the paper notes (see footnote 4) that the cosine annealing part itself makes a major impact and the restarts are primarily to obtain better anytime performance or to benefit from model snapshot ensembling and early stopping. This represents a possible explanation \"why heuristics such as SGDR is successful in practice\".\nI think that the paper clarifies a few misconceptions around SGDR.
