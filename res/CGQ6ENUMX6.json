The methodology is grounded in a theoretical notion of empowerment, and theory is introduced that extends empowerment to the case of morphology. The morphology evolution itself requires no task-specific signals, but yields morphologies that generalize well to several tasks of interest.\n\n\nStrong points:\n\nThe extension of empowerment to morphologies is novel, interesting, and well-motivated.\n\nThe use of random actions is satisfying in that it is initially counter-intuitive, but well-grounded, and in line with other recent advances based in generating interesting things from random input (e.g., GANs).\n\nThe introduced space of morphologies is quite general and can capture some very interesting designs.\n\nThe ablations in Figure 5 and Table 3 are very helpful in validating the theory. Table 3 in particular verifies how empowerment can provide an advantage over more naiive diversity metrics.\n\n\n\n\nWeak points:\n\nThere are some key gaps in related work literature.\n\nOne is NS-LC (Evolving a Diversity of Creatures through Novelty Search and Local Competition,), which was used to evolve explicitly diverse high-performing morphologies (and is an example of the broader category of quality diversity algorithms). The goal of that work is different: to collect diverse morphologies, instead of finding one that is maximally general, but the methodology is related. There is generally a lack of references in the description of the evolutionary algorithm (EA) used in the paper. Is this similar to algorithms used to evolve other sorts of open-ended structures? E.g., open-ended neural network design (e.g., Evolving Deep Neural Networks)? Or EAs that include generation-by-generation updates of a model like the classifier used in this paper? E.g., surrogate-assisted methods? \n\nThere is also a missing link to recent advances in self-supervised methods.\n\n\u201cwe reset q_phi every 12 generations to prevent over-fitting to older morphologies\u201d Worth mentioning the connection of this to ideas like experience replay in RL and removing the oldest individual in Regularized Evolution.\n\nThe theory motivates the use of random actions, but the experiments use a highly restricted set of actions that are well-suited to the eventual tasks of interest, which takes away from the promise of generality and task-agnosticism of the method. Should we expect these specialized \u201cpredefined action sequences\u201d to generalize to a wide variety of morphologies and tasks, or does the experimenter need to design these by hand depending on the tasks?\n\n\u201ceach joint action is given by a cosine function of one of two possible frequencies and one of two possible phases\u201d. What are these frequencies and phases? So, each joint has 4 possible controllers. Are combinations of joints with these controllers sufficient for performing arbitrary tasks?\n\nSimilarly, the tasks in the paper are also closely-aligned with the empowerment objective. That is, the state space is low-dimensional, and task is measured in a 1- or 2-dimensional slice of the state space. Can we expect the approach could generalize to more complex tasks? E.g., can the approach handle a task that combines locomotion and reach, i.e., navigate to randomly sampled goals when the agent is not tethered? Why not evolve a single morphology that can solve all the classes of tasks in experiments (except cheetah)? Isn\u2019t this the promise of the method?\n\nThe changes from NGE to NGE-like make the method more comparable to TAME, but the paper should elaborate on what the missing parts do and whether TAME could take advantage of them. E.g., what is \u201cvalue based population pruning\u201d and why doesn\u2019t TAME use it? What is NerveNet and why doesn\u2019t TAME use it? Why was NGE-like run for 8 seeds instead of 12? Because it\u2019s slower? Why are NGE-like and TAME run on different numbers of cores?\n\nOne key baseline missing is single-task or multi-task version of the EA that TAME uses, but simply using task fitness instead of empowerment. This would give a sense of how the task-specific variant of your underlying EA compares to NGE, and validate whether the EA is at least powerful enough to take advantage of task signals when they are available.\n\n\n\nMinor comments:\n\n\u201cAdditionally, morphologies with better exploration will be able to learn to solve tasks more quickly.\u201d Is there existing work that shows this or some other explanation? It makes intuitive sense, but may not be true in general.\n\nIn Eq. 1, looks like \u201clog|J|\u201d should be \u201clog|A_j|\u201d, and the expectation \u201cE\u201d should be formatted as in the previous lines.\n\nShould TAME Cheetah be bold in Table 1 since it is within the margin of NGE-like?\n\nIn \u201cHow does Tame compare to task supervised methods?\u201d: \u201cWe hypothesize that this\u201d -> Clarify what \u201cthis\u201d is and why NGE-like is good on Cheetah (because the morphology space is more limited or structured?).\n\n-------\nBased on the author response, the rating has been updated (see comments below).\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1368/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1368/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Task-Agnostic Morphology Evolution", "authorids": ["~Donald_Joseph_Hejna_III1", "~Pieter_Abbeel2", "~Lerrel_Pinto1"], "authors": ["Donald Joseph Hejna III", "Pieter Abbeel", "Lerrel Pinto"], "keywords": ["morphology", "unsupervised", "evolution", "information theory", "empowerment"], "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning primarily focuses on learning behavior, usually overlooking the fact that an agent's function is largely determined by form.

The key idea is that instead of finding a morphology and a controller for a specific task, they propose to search for a morphology that can reach a large variety of states in a predictable way. Specifically, they developed an objective function that maximizes the mutual information between the actions and the final states of the robot. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated on a few simulated locomotion and manipulation tasks.\n\nThe paper is well written and the problem that the work is addressing is significant in my point of view.\n\nWhat I like about the work:\n1. The idea of optimizing morphology in a task-agnostic way is interesting.\n2. The proposed formulation and algorithm seems concrete and reasonable.\n3. The proposed algorithm seems effective for the designed experiments presented and compares favorably to baseline methods.\n\nMy concerns about the work:\n1. The proposed objective only considers reachability of the robot, but not the efficiency of completing the task. A good baseline would be whether the optimized design works better than some human-designed morphology. For example, does the optimized result outperform the hopper, halfcheetah, and the 2d manipulator from OpenAI gym environments?\n2. Is the algorithm sensitive to the choice of the regularizer lambda that balances adding limbs and prediction accuracy?\n3. The actions used to explore the environment is quite simplistic (sinusoidal-based for locomotion and constant for manipulation). Though it works for the presented problems, it's not clear if it will work for more complex problems. For example, if we want to design a biped robot that does not fall to the ground, random exploration would likely give us a very narrow range of states.\n\nIn general I think the paper introduces an interesting idea.

The approach is based on an information-theoretic objective that rewards morphologies for reaching diverse states and at the same time performing behaviours that are predictable. \n\nWhile the paper is interesting there are a few issues that should be addressed:\n- The approach relies on randomly sampled actions. How would it scale to more complex tasks that require non-random actions to be solved? Additionally, most of the morphologies are relatively simple, compared to some of the other work in evolving virtual creatures. Is it possible to scale the approach to produce more complex morphologies?\n- \"This is at odds with biological morphologies that seek to be functional over the largest subset of their environment as possible. \" -> I would argue the opposite. Biological morphologies are very much specialist to work well in their particular niche. \n- The approach does not seem completely task-agnostic since the actions are sampled from different distributions for each task (e.g. sine/cosine). \n- The disadvantages and limitations of the approach should be discussed in more detail\n- \"We implement a variant of the task supervised Neural Graph Evolution (NGE) algorithm from Wang et al. (2019) without value based population pruning to better isolate the effects of reward supervision. \u201c -> how well does it work with value-based population training?\n- How does the approach compare to quality diversity approaches that also aim to produce many morphologies in a single run, e.g. Novelty Search with Local Competition (\"Evolving a Diversity of Virtual Creatures through Novelty Search and Local Competition\" Lehman et al.)? \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1368/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1368/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Task-Agnostic Morphology Evolution", "authorids": ["~Donald_Joseph_Hejna_III1", "~Pieter_Abbeel2", "~Lerrel_Pinto1"], "authors": ["Donald Joseph Hejna III", "Pieter Abbeel", "Lerrel Pinto"], "keywords": ["morphology", "unsupervised", "evolution", "information theory", "empowerment"], "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning primarily focuses on learning behavior, usually overlooking the fact that an agent's function is largely determined by form.

Such rapid adaptation capability will be critical when producing physical robots from evolved designs.\n\nBy presenting a particular task-agnostic approach, they have shown that the area is ripe for incorporation of other evolutionary methods that emphasize adaptation and diversity at a population-level.\n\nThe new experiments, especially the challenging 3D locomotion+reach experiment, demonstrate that this type of approach could enable scaling beyond fitness-based approaches like NGE. And the authors have made clear that, although apparently simple, the level of complexity of this tasks is beyond that of previous work.\n\nI still think there is a notable lack of background and motivation for why evolution is the right framework for integrating empowerment with automated morphology design.

We hope to address any concerns with the following changes and additional experiments now included in the paper. We are happy to discuss any further questions.\n\n*> NS-LC* \n\nWe have subsequently added a discussion NS-LC and other QD approaches to the related work section. QD approaches like NS-LC still require a task based fitness function, and thus we believe our approach to be complementary to, not competitive with, QD approaches as the TAME objective could be substituted for task rewards to evolve a diverse population.\n\n*> lack of references in the description of the evolutionary algorithm (EA) used in the paper*\n\nWe use the most basic evolutionary approach of 1. Initialize a population 2. Compute fitness 3. Mutate 4. Repeat 2-3 until convergence. This basic evolutionary loop is similar to that of NGE and we have appropriately made reference to this in section 3.3. One critical difference between our approach and NGE is that we do not eliminate individuals from the population and continually use their data to update q_phi. We provide a more in-depth discussion of this in our later comments.\n\n*> There is also a missing link to recent advances in self-supervised methods.*\n\nWe have now added references to contrastive mutual information style methods to the related work in addition to the existing references for self-supervised skill discovery work (DIAYN, DADS).\n\n*> we reset q_phi every 12 generations*\n\nThe method section has been updated to include the listed connections and relevant citations.\n\n*> the experiments use a highly restricted set of actions that are well-suited*\n\nWe ran additional ablations to study this exact issue and discuss them under a new heading in section 4.4. Empirically, we find that even using a different primitive space our method is still competitive to the NGE-like baselines in the locomotion environments. The action sequences do encode a bias towards the type of environment the agents are in, but not necessarily the task. However, the primitives are a) easy to select from the environment before task specification and b) aren\u2019t the largest factor in performance.\n\n*> What are these frequencies and phases?*\n\nWe have added these additional experiment details to section 4.1\n\n*> Are combinations of joints with these controllers sufficient for performing arbitrary tasks?*\n\nIn general, we find that random controllers based on the pre-defined primitives are not enough to complete the task. While some agents can demonstrate forward / backward motion, most do not perform the task close to as well as with the later tuned policy. The reach task, for example, is unable to be completed with a constant torque to each joint. This is also particularly evident in the 3D environment. We encourage the reviewer to examine our video of results (https://sites.google.com/view/task-agnostic-evolution) starting at 3:18 where we show what agents look like using the random controllers versus the final trained policies. \n\n*> an the approach handle a task that combines locomotion and reach?... Why not evolve a single morphology that can solve all the classes of tasks in experiments*\n\nWe are currently running experiments on locomotion and reach. We believe this would be an easy scenario for the learned morphologies (particularly those in 2D) to handle as they can already locomote and are not biased learning locomotion in one direction during training. We have added additional discussion about the applicability of TAME at the end of section 4.4. \n\nIn our survey of literature, we found that tasks used for free topology morphology optimization were generally simple given the high-dimensional complex nature of the problem. For example,  Cheney et al 2013, Wang et al. 2019, Shaff et al 2019, Ha et al 2019, and Luck et al 2020 all use forward locomotion as the primary task. By optimizing for the multi-task case we believe we are breaching a new barrier. In designing our evaluation tasks we considered what would be desired out of agents in the given environment. While perhaps we would want agents in a plane to push boxes, its more likely that we care about their ability to navigate. \n\n... continued in part 2/2.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1368/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1368/Reviewers"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1368/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Task-Agnostic Morphology Evolution", "authorids": ["~Donald_Joseph_Hejna_III1", "~Pieter_Abbeel2", "~Lerrel_Pinto1"], "authors": ["Donald Joseph Hejna III", "Pieter Abbeel", "Lerrel Pinto"], "keywords": ["morphology", "unsupervised", "evolution", "information theory", "empowerment"], "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning primarily focuses on learning behavior, usually overlooking the fact that an agent's function is largely determined by form.

Here are some additional clarifications on NGE:\n- The pruning method from NGE  learns a GNN (with dropout) that predicts the expected reward of a given morphology using fitness data (a surrogate). Using dropout-based thompson sampling, candidate designs are chosen to add to the population. This has the effect of not wasting compute on bad mutations. Such a surrogate is inapplicable to TAME as TAME requires samples from the environment to estimate the information theoretic objective.\n- NerveNet is a GNN structure utilized by Wang et al. which was directly carried over to NGE. We did not extend the NerveNet code from NGE because despite the paper being released in 2019, the code was written in tensorflow 1.0.0 (not a newer version of TF like 1.14). Additionally, NerveNet uses internal RNN-like propagation steps making it much slower than our proposed GNN architecture.\n- Besides the GNN architectures, our baselines should be directly comparable to NGE.\n\n*> Why was NGE-like run for 8 seeds instead of 12? Because it\u2019s slower? Why are NGE-like and TAME run on different numbers of cores?*\n\nNGE was run for 8 seeds instead of 12 because of computational limitations. We could run far more seeds for TAME because of its speed. NGE requires updating policies for each agent in the population. This process was parallelized across cores. In TAME, we ran everything serially. One could parallelize the data collection process across multiple cores, but given the algorithms existing speed we didn\u2019t believe it was necessary. NGE-like was run on 8 core partitions while TAME was run on two core partitions, though it was really designed to only use one core. If anything, we believe our speed evaluation benefited NGE.\n\n*> One key baseline missing is single-task or multi-task version of the EA that TAME uses, but simply using task fitness instead of empowerment.*\nWe intended NGE-like to be this baseline. In the text we now additionally clarify that the EA we use is the same as that of NGE except that we maintain all individuals in the population. The \u201cmulti-task version\u201d with the same EA is intended to be NGE-like. Here are the exact differences between the NGE-like baseline and TAME:\n- NGE-like removes the least fit individuals from the population, TAME maintains all individuals in the population\n- NGE-like has access to task specific rewards, and uses them to learn task conditioned policies with PPO and a GNN.\n- NGE-like uses evaluations of the learned policies to estimate fitness, rather than the information theoretic objective.\nAn even weaker baseline would be to use MLP policies instead of GNN-based ones, but this would require re-learning new policies for each different topology, which in the NGE publication (Wang et al.) was found to perform far worse.

We have run additional experiments and updated the paper. Below we address the reviewers concerns:\n\n*> 1. The proposed objective only considers reachability of the robot, but not the efficiency of completing the task. \u2026 human designed morphology*\n\nWhile it is impossible to measure the efficiency of a task without any task specification, we argue that our approach does provide a proxy to this. In order to easily predict the action from the terminal state, the terminal states must be diverse. If an agent is unable to efficiently move throughout the state space, all its terminal states will be similar, making it hard to predict the agent's actions resulting in low fitness. \n\nTo compare to human designs, we have added the performances of gym-like agents to Table 1. We find that TAME is able to improve the performance of cheetah in the finetune setting above human design levels and that many of the run seeds result in comparable performance to cheetah in the random 2D setting, though the average is slightly lower. TAME outperforms the gym reacher in the push setting, but is outperformed in the reach setting. This matching of performance is consistent with Wang et al., where the evolved arbitrary topology 2D locomotion agent achieves rewards only slightly above that of the DM control cheetah, but with the additional freedom to have its limbs collide while we enforce contacts. \n\n*> 2. Is the algorithm sensitive to the choice of the regularizer lambda*\n\nWe have added an additional ablation to study the effect of the choice of lambda, which is now depicted in the ablations figure and discussed in section 4.4. We find that removing the regularization does indeed lower the performance of TAME as the evolutionary algorithm begins to favor adding more, random limbs instead of good, predictable ones. \n\n*> 3. The actions used to explore the environment is quite simplistic\u2026 complex problems\u2026 bipedal robot.*\n\nWe have added an additional ablation study and discussion on the choice of action primitives in section 4.4 along with more discussions of where TAME is applicable.\n\nWe believe the evaluation tasks chosen are general enough to be applicable to more settings: for example, multi-directional locomotion is a prerequisite to goal reaching and end-effector goal reaching is a prerequisite to manipulation. Existing work, \u201cModular Robot Design Synthesis with DeepRL\u201d, by Whitman et al. even use reachability as a supervised objective for morphology optimization.\n\nFor the more complex problems on the axis of morphology discussed in the review, TAME could be relevant in the fine-tuning setting. As now discussed in section 4.4, one could visualize the movement of variants of a base bipedal morphology under different action sequences to choose primitives for TAME. In the base setting, however, TAME is not intended to solve morphological tasks as it is designed to choose the morphology. Without constraints, it will be likely to choose whatever it finds most efficient. This is also a limitation of supervised approaches and our baselines -- learning to crawl is often easier than learning to walk, so unless one were to somehow specify a good reward function for upright bipedal locomotion on arbitrary topologies, task supervised methods would still be likely to learn efficient crawling agents rather than walking ones.\n\nThe bipedal example, however, does bring up an additional point. TAME uses short episodes of action primitives to estimate fitness, making it more difficult to discover components of the state space only introduced far away from initialization. We have added a discussion of this limitation at the end of section 4.4.\n\nThank you for your review and please let us know if you have any more questions or requested updates. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1368/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1368/Reviewers"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1368/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Task-Agnostic Morphology Evolution", "authorids": ["~Donald_Joseph_Hejna_III1", "~Pieter_Abbeel2", "~Lerrel_Pinto1"], "authors": ["Donald Joseph Hejna III", "Pieter Abbeel", "Lerrel Pinto"], "keywords": ["morphology", "unsupervised", "evolution", "information theory", "empowerment"], "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning primarily focuses on learning behavior, usually overlooking the fact that an agent's function is largely determined by form.

We hope to provide clarifications and additional results to address the highlighted issues. Please let us know if there are further questions.\n\n*> The approach relies on randomly sampled actions. How would it scale to more complex tasks\u2026*\n\nOur approach uses random actions to design morphologies, not necessarily complete the final task. We use random action primitives as a proxy for how modern RL algorithms explore, giving us an estimate of how good a given morphology will perform. If an agent is able to reach a large number of states with random actions, it's likely to be able to complete tasks involving that part of the state space. For example, the locomotion morphologies evolved by TAME would likely be able to complete goal reaching tasks. However, as you point out, this is not a guarantee. In scenarios where novel state space components are introduced far away from the initial state, TAME would be unlikely to discover them during its short primitive rollouts. We expand discussion at the end of section 4.4.\n\n*> The morphologies are relatively simple\u2026*\n\nOur environments are similar to those of contemporary literature that use Mujoco (Wang et al) though with a few critical differences. While our environment  formulation is similar to that of NGE, unlike in NGE we consider contacts between joints. This assumption is more realistic, but makes it more difficult to add joints to locomotion agents. Despite this the number of joints in our evolved agents qualitatively appears similar. To our knowledge all publications besides NGE that use the mujoco simulator (Shaff et al 2019, Luck et al 2020, Chen et al 2020.) operate on fixed topologies. While we focused on algorithmic improvements, generative encodings for more complex morphologies is another field of research (Cheney, et al. 2013) independent of our contribution that has shown to lead to more complex structures.\n\n*> This is at odds with biological morphologies*\n\nThanks for pointing this out. It is true that biological organisms evolve to fit their niche. Within this niche, however, we believe organisms develop multi-task behavior. TAME can be thought of fitting the morphology to the environment rather than the task. We have revised the paper to reflect this.\n\n*> The approach does not seem completely task-agnostic.*\n\nThe action sequences do encode a bias towards the type of environment the agents are in, but not necessarily the task. However, the primitives are a) easy to select from the environment before task specification and b) aren\u2019t the largest factor in performance. We have added a heading in section 4.4 discussing this. Empirically, we find that even using a different primitive space our method is still competitive to the NGE-like baselines in the locomotion environments.\n\n*> The disadvantages and limitations of the approach should be discussed in more detail*\n\nThis has been done at the end of section 4.4\n\n*> how well does it [NGE] work with value-based population training?*\n\nWe have run this baseline and added it to table 1. We find that value-based pruning helps performance a bit, though not extremely. Specification of the baseline is now given in section 4.2 and discussion in section 4.3.\n\n*> How does the approach compare to quality diversity approaches that also aim to produce many morphologies in a single run?*\n\nOur approach does not compete with quality diversity methods and is rather complementary to them. Quality diversity methods (Lehman & Stanley, 2011; Nordmoen et al., 2020) still require a task-based fitness function during evolution to select the best morphologies within \u201cniches\u201d or unsupervised clusters. The TAME objective could be substituted in for task-fitness in QD approaches to evolve a population of diverse agents in a completely unsupervised manner.

We have undergone another iteration of the paper to address the questions highlighted in the review and additionally added more ablations and baselines and are happy to continue iterating with your feedback.\n\n*> maybe more for a conference like ALife than ICLR though.*\n\nWe believe there is ample precedent for work along this line at ICLR, given our supervised baseline, NGE (Wang et al 2019), was featured at ICLR 2019. \n\n*> the mathematical formulation is sloppy in many places*\n\nIn the most recent version we have revised this formulation to make it more clear. We additionally encourage the reviewer to examine the revisions in the appendix where a revised full derivation can be found. \n1. We add subscripts to the expectations to make it clear what the values and distributions the expectation is being taken over.\n2. We clarify the text of the paper everywhere to make it clear that we deal with a discrete set of action primitives\n3. *J appears in the right without specification\u2026 should be a sum\u2026*: We reworked the derivation in the paper and left it in terms of expectation of overall actions. In the appendix we show how this can be decomposed into a sum and additionally reference this in section 3.2.\n4. *What is |J|?*: -- this was a typo and was supposed to be log |A_j|. It has been corrected.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for providing relevant references and ideas. We have included the citation to Klyubin, Polani, and Nehaniv in the related work.\n\nWe have additionally made all corrections listed in the \u201cdetails\u201d portion of the review.

So, how should one go about finding a morphology fit for solving tasks in a given environment? Current approaches that co-adapt morphology and behavior use a specific task's reward as a signal for morphology optimization. However, this often requires expensive policy optimization and results in task-dependent morphologies that are not built to generalize. In this work, we propose a new approach, Task-Agnostic Morphology Evolution (TAME), to alleviate both of these issues. Without any task or reward specification, TAME evolves morphologies by only applying randomly sampled action primitives on a population of agents. This is accomplished using an information-theoretic objective that efficiently ranks agents by their ability to reach diverse states in the environment and the causality of their actions. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that across 2D, 3D, and manipulation environments TAME can evolve morphologies that match the multi-task performance of those learned with task supervised algorithms.
