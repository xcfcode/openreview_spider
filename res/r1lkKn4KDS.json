We mean to say the best performing policy that was learned for the training tasks. Ideally it would be optimal, but we have no way of guaranteeing that it truly is optimal.\n\n- We clarified in the updated document how the tasks for ATARI are being generated. In short, we did the following: 1) draw a number between 2 and 10 to define how many frames are skipped after taking an action (changes transition function), 2)  draw a number between 1 and 20 and let the agent execute that many actions before starting learning (changes the initial state distribution), 3) scaling the reward by a number between 0.1 and 10 (changes the reward function).\n\n- The claim that we are making is that the proposed objective is able to learn options that generalize well across several new tasks, provided there are some similarities that can be exploited.  We are not saying that this will necessarily outperform other learning algorithms, but rather that we can learn options that can be added to the action set and will help the agent in learning.\n\n- We chose these two games because there are intuitive skills that might be learned (such as the paddle in breakout moving in one direction for a number of steps to catch a bouncing ball). We thought that being able to show that we can learn some of these behaviors would make for a compelling argument.\n\n- For this approach would extend across games similar in nature, it would depend on how states and actions are represented.  Our method does not take into account where the trajectories are coming from, it just seeks to learn options to recreate those trajectories.\nIf there is an actions set and state space that is similar enough across games, then it should generalize in those cases.\nHowever, if you are dealing with a different state space, then I wouldn't expect our method to learn good options.\n\n- I understand your concern on lifting this contrained on the duration of an option. The difficulty is that when executing an option in a state that was never seen in a demonstration, the termination function never had a chance to learn what to do. So it might choose to not terminate. \nOne way to lift this constraint might be for the termination function to also be able to update online (as the agent is learning), however, this is not a trivial change."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper62/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper62/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an increasingly active area of research in recent years.

Notice that we are not only minimizing the number of terminations, but jointly maximizing the probability of generating the given trajectories. So our objective might learn that options have to cross bottleneck states, but terminate after crossing them. \n\n- We apologize for the vagueness in 'near-optimal'. What we meant by this is that the trajectories are generated by a learned (well-performing policy), but they might not be technically \"optimal\".\n\n- The proposed approach does not ensure they are near-optimal, it assumes they are. The agent learns a policy in a few training tasks, and we assume that these policies perform well.\n\n- The sample trajectories are generated when learning on the training tasks. As the agent is learning a policy, it is generating trajectories from each updated policy. We used the trajectories generated by the policy learned at the end of the training process.\n\n- In the experiments for FR, the flattened policy is shown in the top right figured labeled \"Solution Found\". The remaining figures show the option policies, before and after learning, for each respective option.\nFor the termination functions, it is a bit difficult to visualize so many dimensions (option policy, policy over options, how the options are used, etc...). We will do our best to update the document depicting the termination functions as well.\n\n- Reviewer #1 also mentioned the multi-task setting in ATARI, and we apologize for not making this clear. We reiterate the response here:\nThe experiments in the ATARI domain include a multi-task component; in each task we changed initial state (the agent was allowed to move for a random number of steps before beginning learning), the number of frames skipped per action taken, and magnitude of the reward.\n\n- In response to your comment: \"If we already have that, it is unclear what gains do we get from the proposed method\". The point we are making is that if you have a policy that works well for the task you are currently addressing, it is likely that it won't work well for a new task. A change in the transition function or reward function will probably change how that policy performs.  However, there is useful information we can leverage from those tasks that are different, but related to the new task. We are showing that one way of doing that is to learn options that we can reuse for any novel, but related, task the agent might face.\n\n- We will update our submission to clarify many of the points we could have explained better.\n\n\n==============================\n\nI have updated the document to address some of your concerns:\n\n- Added a discussion on how our method differs from finding bottleneck states. ( Explained in introduction last paragraph)\n- Clarify what we mean by (near)-optimal policies and why we use that term (Explained in last pragraph of introduction).\n- Updates the figures in four-rroms to include a visualization of termination functions.\n\n- To comment on the difference in performance from what was reported in Harb 2018. Keep in mind that by creating task variations, we are changing what return can be achieve at any particular task.\n- We clarified how ATARI experiments are mult-task (explained in experiments section).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper62/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper62/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an increasingly active area of research in recent years.

The input to the options is given as a stack of the last two frames of the game; in our opinion that is not necessarily low dimensional.\nIn theory, continuous control can be modeled as well, but one would have to assume a family of distribution for the option policy to optimize. For example, one could assume that the option follows a gaussian distribution, and to maximize the probability of generating the observed trajectories one would optimize the mean and variance.\n\n- We apologize for the confusion, maybe we could have phrased this better. The method does not require optimal trajectories, but that is an assumption we make (or at least they are generated by a policy that performs well). The reason for this is that if the trajectories are obtained from a poorly performing policy (for example, random), the options learned will not be useful. They will fit that poor performing pattern.\nWe will update the paper to make this more clear.\n\n\n- Thank you for pointing out the work in [1], that is definitely a paper worth mentioning. However, their setting is a bit different from ours. The method [1] requires to have a task ID (one hot encoding) to learn the embeddings. That means that the number of possible different tasks must be known apriori. In our case, we only require sample trajectories to learn options that can be used across many tasks.\n\n\n\n\n==============================\n\nI have updated the document to address some of your concerns:\n\n- Clarified why we assume that the trajectories are obtained from optimal policies (Explained in section 3, before problem formulation).\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper62/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper62/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an increasingly active area of research in recent years.

The method takes a number of demonstration trajectories as input and attempts to create a set of options that can recreate the trajectories with minimal terminations.\n\nI currently recommend rejection. The evaluation of the proposed method is rather weak and does not clearly demonstrate that the author\u2019s goals have been achieved. The paper could also do a better job of situating the approach with regard to existing option learning approaches.\n\nDetailed comments:\n\n- The paper strongly emphasizes reusability of learnt options over multiple tasks as a key goal. This aspect is largely absent from the practical part of the paper, however. The proposed algorithm largely ignores the multi-task aspect beyond requiring demonstrations from different tasks - also see the next remark. In the experiments, the multi-task transfer is not emphasized. In the 4rooms domain options are learnt on training tasks and evaluated on test tasks, but the effect of task distribution or task diversity on generalisation is not investigated. Moreover, the larger scale ATARI experiments do not seem to include any multi-task aspects at all, with options immediately being learnt on the target task.\n\n- The objective in (1) omits any explicit mention of different tasks. It would be good to indicate explicitly how it depends on the distribution of tasks and what the expectation is taken over.\n\n- The authors indicate that their learning objective needs the transition function P for the MDP. This is never further discussed. Do the experiments assume known transition functions? If not, how are these functions estimated? If a model is known, does it still make sense to learn option policies from samples or would it be better to use  planning based options (see e.g.[1])?\n\n- While the paper cites a number of option learning approaches, it could do a better job of situating the research within the literature. There are a number of option induction approaches that explicitly focus on reusability of options - see e.g. [1], [4]. There have also been a large number of approaches that focus on hierarchical learning to represent a distribution over demonstration trajectories: see eg. [3],[5], [6], [7]. Some of these approaches might also be better baselines than OptionCritic which doesn\u2019t explicitly take into account learning from demonstrations or multi-task transfer. \n\n[1] Mann, T.

The authors utilize demonstrations collected beforehand and train an option learning framework offline by minimizing the expected number of terminations while encouraging diverse options by adding a regularization term. During the offline training, they add one option at a time and move onto the next option when the current loss fails to improve over the previous loss, which enables automatically learning the number of options without manually specifying it. Experiments are conducted on the four rooms environment and Atari 2600 games and demonstrate that the proposed method leads to faster learning on new tasks.\n\nOverall, this paper gives a novel option learning framework that results in some improvement in multi-task learning. While the paper is technically sound and somewhat supported by experimental evidence, the experiments are limited to low-dimensional state space and discrete action space. I do wonder if the method can scale to high-dimensional space with continuous control.\n\nMoreover, the framework requires optimal policies to generate trajectories for offline option learning, which seems to add more supervision signals than prior work such as option-critic. I wonder how the method would perform under sub-optimal demonstrations or even random trajectories generated by some RL policy.\n\nFinally, I wonder how this method can be compared to skill embedding learning methods such as [1], which have been shown to be able to compactly represent skills in a latent space and reuse those skills in high-dimensional robotic manipulation tasks.\n\n[1] Hausman, Karol, Jost Tobias Springenberg, Ziyu Wang, Nicolas Heess, and Martin Riedmiller. \"Learning an embedding space for transferable robot skills.\" (2018).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper62/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper62/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an increasingly active area of research in recent years.

The claim is that the agent is first able to learn a near-optimal policy for a small # of problems and then is able to solve a large # of tasks by such a learned policy.  The authors build on the idea that minimizing the number of decisions made by the agent results in discovering reusable options. The options are learned offline by learning to solve a small number of tasks. Their algorithm introduces one option at a time until introducing a new option doesn\u2019t improve the objective further. The ideas are interesting, However, the paper as it stands is lacking in thorough evaluation.\n\nDetailed comments:\nThe proposed approach offers two key contributions:\n-an objective function to minimize the decision states\n-incrementally constructing an option set that can be reused later, without the a priori specification of the # of options needed. \n\nThe introduction is well written, however, given the intuitions behind the objective function; in some sense, the idea here is to minimize the decisions or terminations intuitively relates to terminating only at critical or bottleneck states. It would be useful to provide such motivation in the introduction. \n\nIntuitively the objective criterion is interesting. With a cursory look at the proofs, they seem fine, although I have to admit I have not looked in detail into the proofs. \n\nPaper writing could be significantly improved. Several points are not clear and need further clarification:\n-The term near-optimal is mentioned several times, but it is not clear the policies are near-optimal with respect to what? The task or a set of tasks? \n-How does the proposed approach ensures that they are near-optimal? Please clarify.\n-\u201cWe can obtain the estimate for equation 1 by averaging over a set of near-optimal trajectories\u201d The aim as states is to learn options that are capable of generating near-optimal trajectories (by using a small # of terminations). The authors then say that \u201cgiven a set of options, a policy over options, a near-optimal sample trajectory, we can calculate..\u201d Where does the near-optimal sample trajectory come from? Please provide clarifications.\n\nIn experiments: FR rooms experiments are interesting, in the visualization of the option policies, do the figures here show the flattened policy of the options? What do the termination functions look like? \n\nAtari experiments are limited in nature in that they show only two games. Moreover, It is a bit confusing as to what is multi-task in the ATARI experiments. The authors mention the training of options and then talk about the results in the plots (4) show the training curves. However, they do not mention what are \u201cnovel tasks for Breakout/Amidar\u201d in this context. \n\nConsidering the proposed approach is closely related to the idea of selective terminations of options, it is natural to expect a comparison with Harb, 2018 and Hartyuanm 2019. The work could benefit by comparing with the aforementioned baselines. In particular, the visualization in 4b showing options learned in Amidar does not show much improvement from what was observed before in Harb, 2018.  \n\nWith the motivation of this paper, I am unable to convince myself about options being \u201creusable\u201d for multi-task here. It would be very useful for the reader to clarify what \u201cnovel tasks\u201d are here to appreciate what is learned. Looking deeper into the appendix, I understand that the authors \u201cfirst learned a good performing policy with A3C for each game and sample 12 trajectories for training.\u201d This is not at all clear in the main paper. Besides, what does it mean by a \"good\" policy? If we already have that, it is unclear what gains do we get from the proposed method.  \n\nOne obvious limitation here is that they also have a hard imposed constraint here is that the options cannot run for more than 20 time-steps in total, to make the objective function a suitable choice. \n\nOverall:\t\t\nAn interesting objective function, Learn not only option set but also the number of options needed and incrementally learn new options. \n\nPaper writing does not convey clearly what are novel tasks and could be significantly improved.\n\nSince the paper claims multi-task and mentions several lifelong learning works like [1], I was expecting rigorous baselines showing performance over multiple tasks. The experiments are lacking in that evidence except for four rooms domain, which is much simpler a domain. \n\nNear-optimal property is very much lacking the clarity to the best of my knowledge.\n\n[1]Ammar, Haitham Bou, et al. \"Online multi-task learning for policy gradient methods.\" International Conference on Machine Learning. 2014."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper62/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper62/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an increasingly active area of research in recent years.
