One can imagine the outcome, yet there\u2019s no precise definition. We would argue that the degree of ill-posedness depends on the domain. In the case of animal to animal translation, you would expect the result to contain a realistic looking animal with the same:\n    1. Semantic parts of an animal (i.e. head of a zebra to head of a giraffe). That also includes translating the correct amount of instances (i.e. 2 zebras to 2 giraffes). \n    2.  Location and scale of the objects (i.e. a small zebra at the left corner of the image should translate to small giraffe at the same location). \n    3. Pose \n    4. Background\nWhile we mostly succeed at 1-3, preserving the background is indeed problematic when translating deep features. However, this is common in UNIT. While shape non-deforming methods, such as cycleGAN, might not change the structures in the background, the color/style is typically changed. Shape deforming methods exhibit changes in both style and geometry of the background, see for example the recently proposed TransGaGa.\nWhile we made some preliminary attempts to incorporate an attention mechanism, the results were unsatisfactory, and we therefore stopped pursuing this direction, as we felt it to be outside the main focus of this work.\n\n--- One question I had, for example: could we be getting similar results if we used the VGG bottleneck as the noise vector in an InfoGAN?\nUsing a different architecture instead of cycleGAN for unpaired deep feature translation is indeed interesting. Could the reviewer please elaborate exactly how did he envision here the use of infoGAN? Is the noise composed of a domain-part (i.e., zero or one with p=0.5 for each) and the VGG bottleneck features instead of the \"traditional\" noise?\nRegardless, directly inverting the bottleneck is difficult. We refer the reviewer to the results of the inversion network proposed by Dosovitskiy and Brox on AlexNet for different layers (\"Generating Images with Perceptual Similarity Metrics based on Deep Networks\"). In addition, as we show in our ablation study, the cascaded manner of our translation further improves the result achieved by the deepest layer translation only.\n\n---Why wasn't a final translator used for the final image, conditioned on the final \\tilde{b}_1? \nWe noticed that shallow layers contribution was negligible. Thus, we omitted the use of \\tilde{b}_1.\n\n--- Is the VGG network pretrained on ImageNet? Why wasn't another task used that could be retaining more of the relevant features? eg on semantic segmentation\nYes, the VGG was pre-trained on ImageNet, we will clarify it in our revision.\nVGG pretrained on ImageNet is widely used for feature extraction, from perceptual similarity to cross domain correspondence. It is remarkable that a network pretrained only with image-level annotations can assist in the translation process.\nSemantic segmentation networks require more elaborate supervision (pixel-level annotation) and allow a different kind of translation approaches, which can directly use the segmentation maps.\n\n --- Could this be used for networks pretrained on other datasets? Presumably ImageNet has information about the animals translated in this paper. Even better, could we somehow learn these features for the domain pairs automatically somehow?\n\nYes, different networks can be used, as the approach is generic, although, a good feature extraction network, such as VGG pretrained on ImageNet, is required for a meaningful translation. Please note that while ImageNet does contain several of the animals translated in this paper, it does *not* contain giraffe and the different types of dogs and cats presented. We believe that learning the features in a self-supervised manner, will not yield the same quality as VGG features and fine-tuning VGG on the specific domains did not yield better results. \n\n--- How meaningful is the FID score really in this case?\nFID metric is still commonly used to assess how close fake and real samples are.\nFID uses layer of inception trained on ImageNet, thus, it is closely related to our deep features translation. In a sense, we minimize it directly.  \n\n --- How were the 10 GANs tuned\nThe GANs were tuned manually, experimenting with several architecture (similar to all layers), and losses. Same parameters where used for all translation tasks. We found this process to be relatively simple. \n\n--- On p.7 it is mentioned that the number of instances is preserved, however, it should be made clear that it's preserved in some (or most if that is what was observed) of the examples.\nIn most cases the number of instances was preserved, we will clarify it in our revision, thanks."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1465/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1465/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CROSS-DOMAIN CASCADED DEEP TRANSLATION", "authors": ["Oren Katzir", "Dani Lischinski", "Daniel Cohen-Or"], "authorids": ["orenkatzir@mail.tau.ac.il", "cohenor@gmail.com", "danix3d@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["computer vision", "image translation", "generative adversarial networks"], "TL;DR": "Image-to-image translation in a cascaded, deep-to-shallow, fashion, along the deep feature of a pre-trained classification network", "abstract": "In recent years we have witnessed tremendous progress in unpaired image-to-image translation methods, propelled by the emergence of DNNs and adversarial training strategies.

Are there other methods which do this ?\nWe are not aware of any image to image translation methods, translating deep features directly or applying cycle consistency on pertained features. For completeness, as we point out in the related work, LOGAN (Yin et al.) pretrain an autoencoder, for point clouds, to create an overcomplete latent space. Then, translation is achieved between point clouds encoded by vectors in this latent space. \nHowever, the deep features that we use, are known to capture higher level semantics, as they were extensively trained for classification tasks. The key contribution of our work is to leverage the power of these deep features for the UNIT task. \n\n--- No comparison to TransGaGa is provided \nUnfortunately, the authors of TransGaGa are unable to publicly release their code, thus we are unable to compare our method to them. However, as acknowledged by the author of TransGaGa, both in the Appendix and in a private communication, it is robust to the single foreground and somewhat simple background. But, when the datasets are wild, busy and collected in unconstrained environments, TransGaGa fails.\n\n--- I think the paper could be improved in explaining the conceptual novelty of the paper (especially with respect to GANimorph and TransGaGa).\nWe will try to explain this point better.\nOur conceptual novelty, can be viewed as a transfer learning for image translation as we are translating high level semantics, encoded in the deeper layers of a pre-trained classification network, a.k.a deep features. This is in contrast to existing UNIT methods, which learn to translate the images directly. GANImorph introduces architectural changes to cycleGAN, enabling higher deformation, and, as we show, we outperform this approach. TransGaGa, on the other hand, assumes intra and inter geometry consistency across the domains. This enables TransGAGA to disentangle geometry from appearance, in an unsupervised manner, and translate both separately (but this only works in limited scenarios, as explained earlier).\n\n--- An ablation study should be added (in FID scores) for a single layer (3,4, or 5).\nWe will add such an ablation in our revision.\n\n--- Would it be possible to not use pertained feature from VGG-19 ? \nVGG19 is well suited for feature extraction as it gradually reduces the spatial dimension of the input while at the same time increasing the channel dimension. It has been shown in many previous works, that VGG19 extracts meaningful high level semantics, useful for style transfer, image analogy, etc. However, for the sake of completeness we can test and report the ability to use other feature extraction networks, such as AlexNet or inception network.\n\n--- The authors could add some text on the lack of diversity for the translations in the limitation section.\nYes, the results are deterministic, similar to cycleGAN, this is indeed a limitation currently, common to UNIT methods. It would be indeed interesting to investigate how stochasticity may be added, as in many to many image translation methods, perhaps even to each layer translation separately. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1465/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1465/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CROSS-DOMAIN CASCADED DEEP TRANSLATION", "authors": ["Oren Katzir", "Dani Lischinski", "Daniel Cohen-Or"], "authorids": ["orenkatzir@mail.tau.ac.il", "cohenor@gmail.com", "danix3d@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["computer vision", "image translation", "generative adversarial networks"], "TL;DR": "Image-to-image translation in a cascaded, deep-to-shallow, fashion, along the deep feature of a pre-trained classification network", "abstract": "In recent years we have witnessed tremendous progress in unpaired image-to-image translation methods, propelled by the emergence of DNNs and adversarial training strategies.

The problem of most existing methods is that they are good in translating style  (e.g from photo to Van Gogh) but do not allow for significant changes in shape (e.g. from zebra to giraffe). The authors address this by performing the translation in a cascaded fashion starting from a semantic (deep) level (fifth layer of VGG). The underlying idea is that translating at this more semantic level puts less spatial constraints on the final resulting images (making translations from zebra to giraffe possible). After the fifth layer is translated other layers are translated conditioned on the previous translation results. \n\nThe method is compared to other translation methods including DRIT, MUNIT, GANimorph. Both visually and quantitatively as measured by FID. The results of the proposed method are superior. No comparison to TransGaGa is provided (but I could not find code for this method).\n\nMy recommendation is borderline accept. The proposed method is simple. The experimental results are limited but show both visually and quantitatively superior results. Especially FID scores are much better. I think the paper could be improved in explaining the conceptual novelty of the paper (especially with respect to GANimorph and TransGaGa).\n\n1. I like the idea of applying the cycle consistency to the deeper layers rather than at the pixel level. Are there other methods which  do this ? It could be highlighted more as part of the contribution.\n2. An ablation study should be added (in FID scores). I would like to see the necessity of the cascade (which is in the title) confirmed: results for only translating a single layer (3,4, or 5)  should be compared to translating 3,4,5 together as in proposed method. \n3. Would it be possible to not use pretrained feature from VGG-19 ? This might also be a limitation. In principle, I guess you could train everything end-to-end, or is this impractical because of the feature inversion. \n4.The authors could add some text on the lack of diversity for the translations in the limitation section. I understand there is no diversity and the translation is deterministic. \n \nIn general, I think the paper clearly explains what it does, and it also shows cases that it performs better than state-of-the-art. The paper could be much improved in its analysis of the reasons for its better performance, analyzing key aspects of its design like cycle GAN on features, pretrained VGG features and the use of cascaded generation of the final image. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1465/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1465/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CROSS-DOMAIN CASCADED DEEP TRANSLATION", "authors": ["Oren Katzir", "Dani Lischinski", "Daniel Cohen-Or"], "authorids": ["orenkatzir@mail.tau.ac.il", "cohenor@gmail.com", "danix3d@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["computer vision", "image translation", "generative adversarial networks"], "TL;DR": "Image-to-image translation in a cascaded, deep-to-shallow, fashion, along the deep feature of a pre-trained classification network", "abstract": "In recent years we have witnessed tremendous progress in unpaired image-to-image translation methods, propelled by the emergence of DNNs and adversarial training strategies.

The proposed method train cycle GAN on different levels of feature extracted by pre-trained VGG and combine the futures with the AdaIN layer to keep the correct shape from the deep features. \n\nPros:\n1. The proposed method seems to work well on different shape I2I datasets without using semantic masks compared to previous works.\n2. The idea of cascaded translators sounds simple and reasonable which can probably benefit other related tasks. The way of applying AdaIn to combine features of different levels is also a nice trick to keep the correct shape from deep features.\n3. The paper writing is OK, but some explanation and organization should be improved as mention in cons.\n\nCons:\n1. Some figures are hard to understand without looking at the text. For example, in Figure 1, the caption does not explain the figure well. What does each image, the order, and the different sizes mean?  As to Figure 3, the words \u201ctop left image\u201d, \u201cright purple arrows\u201d are a bit confusing.\n2. The \u201cCoarse to fine conditional translation\u201d section describes the conditional translation in the shallow layers. I suggest mentioning it in previous sections for easy understanding.\n3. As to the t-SNE visualization in Figure 9, different methods seem to use different N-D to 2-D mapping functions. This may lead to an unfair comparison.\n\nSuggestions:\n1. The authors use the pre-trained classification network VGG for feature extraction and then train dedicated translators based on these features. I wonder if the authors also tried finetuning VGG on the two domains or training an auto-encoder on the two domains.

It is proposed to do so by using a VGG network trained on classification (I assume on Imagenet), extracting features from the two domains and learn 5 CycleGANs to translate for each level of the feature hierarchy. At each level of the hierarchy the translation from the previous level is used to condition the translation for the current level. During inference, the final image translation is done by \"feature inversion\" (a technique proposed in Dosovitsikiy and Brox, 2016) from the final feature layer. The technique is show on example from a number of pairs of domains like Zebra-to-Elephant (and back), Giraffe-to-Zebra (and back), Dog-to-Cat (and back) and is compared with a number of baselines qualitatively and quantitatively with the FID score.  \n\n* Clearly state your decision (accept or reject) with one or two key reasons for this choice.\nWeak Reject.\n\nMajor reasons:\n- The problem itself, as stated in the introduction, seems ill-posed to me. One of the struggles I had while looking through the results was to understand what the images should be looking like. ie What should a zebra translated to a giraffe look like? The motivation for such a problem is also not immediately clear either. \n- Most of the resulting images do not seem \"translated\" to me. As stated in the paper (end of p.2) \"one aims to transform a specific type of object without changing the background.\" As one can see in eg Fig. 1 the resulting translations are completely different images with the foreground object of the new domain in roughly similar poses. The background in most cases does not persist. What I suspect is actually happening here is that the high-level semantics from the first image are used as some sort of noise to generate new images from the new domain. One question I had, for example: could we be getting similar results if we used the VGG bottleneck as the noise vector in an InfoGAN? Since the VGG network is pretrained and used in the same way in both domains, I imagine we would be seeing something very similar. (and it would be def. preferrable to tuning 10 GANs!)\n\n* Provide supporting arguments for the reasons for the decision.\nSome of the decisions made in the paper were unclear and not supported adequately. The questions (in rough order of importance) that made some of the contributions unclear to me:\n- Why wasn't a final translator used for the final image, conditioned on the final \\tilde{b}_1? \n- Is the VGG network pretrained on ImageNet? Why wasn't another task used that could be retaining more of the relevant features? eg on semantic segmentation\n- Could this be used for networks pretrained on other datasets? Presumably ImageNet has information about the animals translated in this paper. Even better, could we somehow learn these features for the domain pairs automatically somehow?\n- How meaningful is the FID score really in this case?\n- How were the 10 GANs tuned?\n\n* Provide additional feedback with the aim to improve the paper. Make it clear that these points are here to help, and not necessarily part of your decision assessment.\n- It is mentioned on p.4 that \"clamping is potentially a harmful irreversible operation\" but that harmful results were not observed. As I was reading that I was wondering how these results would actually look like. \n- On p. 6 it is mentioned that the number of images for 2 categories are reported in another paper. I think it'd take less space to actually report the number of images here.\n- On p.7 it is mentioned that the number of instances is preserved, however it should be made clear that it's is perserved in some (or most if that is what was observed) of the examples.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1465/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1465/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CROSS-DOMAIN CASCADED DEEP TRANSLATION", "authors": ["Oren Katzir", "Dani Lischinski", "Daniel Cohen-Or"], "authorids": ["orenkatzir@mail.tau.ac.il", "cohenor@gmail.com", "danix3d@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["computer vision", "image translation", "generative adversarial networks"], "TL;DR": "Image-to-image translation in a cascaded, deep-to-shallow, fashion, along the deep feature of a pre-trained classification network", "abstract": "In recent years we have witnessed tremendous progress in unpaired image-to-image translation methods, propelled by the emergence of DNNs and adversarial training strategies.
