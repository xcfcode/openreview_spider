Some of the weaknesses (discussing other relevant works, discussing other variants of FGLA, adding new experimental results) have been addressed in the updated version of the paper. One of the reviewers suggested running additional experiments on GLUE-style tasks (with a masked language model) to be really sure if the technique is convincing, and particularly try it with larger models (T5 was suggested). While adding those experiments would be a plus, I disagree that this is crucial - this paper is focusing on seq2seq tasks and is already considering several tasks: summarization, MT, and grammar correction. The results found by this paper are interesting and can foster future research extending this beyond these 3 tasks. Even if larger models can make the improvements smaller, there are many inconveniences in just increasing scale (memory consumption, energy consumption, etc.) It is my opinion that the community should value research that tries to understand the weaknesses of smaller models, rather than relying on large scale models to solve all problems."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Understanding and Improving Encoder Layer Fusion in Sequence-to-Sequence Learning", "authorids": ["~Xuebo_Liu1", "~Longyue_Wang3", "~Derek_F._Wong1", "~Liang_Ding3", "lidiasc@um.edu.mo", "~Zhaopeng_Tu1"], "authors": ["Xuebo Liu", "Longyue Wang", "Derek F.

This paper is really clearly written. The paper is easy to follow and understand.\n2. The proposed SurfaceFusion is well-motivated by a series of experiments on different Seq2Seq tasks.\n3. The experimental results are very solid.\n\n#####################   Concerns   ####################\n\nI hope the author can select several following concerns as feedback.\n\n1. In this work, the authors find that in the summarization model, almost all decoder layers focus more on the encoder embedding layer. In other words, compared with the translation model and correction model, the summarization model tends to use more surface features from the encoder embedding layer. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the summarization model will receive more improvements from the proposed SurfaceFusion. However, the experimental results in Table 1 show that the translation and correction models achieve higher improvements than the summarization model. \n\n2. Figure 1 shows that the uppermost decoder layer also pays attention to other encoder layers, why SurfaceFusion only uses the encoder embedding layer? The authors claim that \u201calthough the layer attention model partially alleviates this problem, it potentially introduces unnecessary intermediate encoder representations.\u201d Can you show some visualizations/experimental results to support this hypothesis that the intermediate encoder representations are unnecessary for the uppermost decoder layer?\n\n3. The experiments show that the encoder embedding layer is beneficial for all decoder layers, why the proposed SurfaceFusion does not consider connecting the encoder embedding layer to all decoder layers. A much wider empirical investigation would be appreciated.\n\n4. Along the same line, some relevant works are omitted [1][2][3][4][5][6], especially for the work from [1], which also considers the connections between the lower encoder layers and uppermost decoder layer, and boosts similar or even higher results on the same benchmarks (EN-DE and EN-FR) as this work. I would suggest the authors take a discussion and a comparison to that work.\n\n5. The margin of some gains in Table 1 is small. Statistical significant test and error range are highly appreciated.\n\nOverall, this paper is really clearly written, the proposed SurfaceFusion is novel and well-motivated, and experimental results are very solid. I recommend the authors to enrich this work by deepening their analysis.

Thus, when a model with FGLA is trained, it\u2019s optimized differently such that the use of each separated layer in the encoder is modeled explicitly through attention weight. As a result, the contribution of each layer found in Seq2seq with FGLA might not be the same as in the standard Seq2seq. Therefore, I think the conclusion might not be appropriate for the standard Seq2Seq model. In other words, the source representation bottleneck hypothesis might not hold true for standard Seq2seq.*\n\n  Although it is a potential threat, we have to introduce the FGLA to evaluate the contribution of each encoder layer. We believe that the bottleneck hypothesis of source representation still holds true for standard seq2seq. The difference between FGLA and the vanilla Transformer is the connections between encoder and decoder layers. If the source representation does not exist, FGLA would fail to improve the model performance, which turned out to be false in Tables 1&2 in the revised submission. These results reconfirm our hypothesis. Along this direction, we propose a novel SurfaceFusion for a better information flow for Seq2seq, which further improves the model performance.\n\n2. > *Compared to the previous fusion method that uses a scalar per layer as attention weight (i.e., Transparent Attention) in the work of Bapna et. al., 2018, FGLA generalizes it by making a vector per layer. This generalization is straightforward and simple. The later analysis in the paper is carried out on FGLA. However, I find that the same analysis can be performed with Transparent Attention. The introduction of FGLA seems not well-motivated in this regard. In terms of interpretability, Transparent Attention is more interpretable since there is one scalar per layer, whereas FGLA has to report average weight per layer (Figure 1).*\n\n  We choose FGLA instead of Transparent Attention for two reasons. First, FGLA achieves better performance in our preliminary experiments (Table 1 in the revised submission). This is consistent with previous studies (Tu et al. 2017; Choi et al. 2018), which show that a weight vector outperforms its scalar counterpart. Second, the vector weight of FGLA enables the singular value analysis (Figures 3&4) to evaluate the expressivity of attended dimensions in the encoder embedding layer, which shows that the proposed SurfaceFusion method improves model performance by extracting useful surface features as expected.

(2018) to train the models with the huge mini-batches of nearly 460K tokens, significantly improving the model performances. To clear up the misunderstanding of the existing score of En-De, we replace it with the result of the big-batch training (Ott et al., 2018) in Table 2; 2) For the summarization task, we follow Paulus et al. (2018) to disallow repeating the same trigram; 3) For the correction task, we apply a very strong regularization technique SwitchOut (Wang et al., 2018) to learn a better model. As far as we know, this is the first time to apply this technique to a correction task; 4) In particular, our Ro-En and En-Fr results are very competitive even with such a pure model architecture. \n  \n  As listed in Table 2, our reimplemented baselines achieve better or comparable results with the existing results, demonstrating the reliability of the conclusions in this paper based on the stronger baselines.\n\n  Ott, Myle, Sergey Edunov, David Grangier, and Michael Auli.

Although both methods exploit source surface features to improve target predictions, there are considerable differences: SurfaceFusion performs feature fusion at probability-level, while their method fuses features at representation level. In addition, they evaluate their approach on the shallow RNN-based model, which may fail to work on deep Transformer models. To validate our hypothesis, we re-implemented their method on top of Transformer. Experimental results show that their method fails to outperform the vanilla Transformer model (33.3 vs. 33.8 on the Ro-En dataset).

In other words, compared with the translation model and correction model, the summarization model tends to use more surface features from the encoder embedding layer. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the summarization model will receive more improvements from the proposed SurfaceFusion. However, the experimental results in Table 1 show that the translation and correction models achieve higher improvements than the summarization model.*\n\n  While we do not give a complete explanation of this phenomenon. We conjecture that it is caused by the following reasons: 1) The summarization task is different from the other two tasks, since it required more \"copy\" operations from the input document to accomplish the task. Accordingly, the vanilla Transformer model may have learned to extract more surface features from layer-by-layer abstraction and residual connection than the other two tasks; 2) The improvement of the SurfaceFusion can not be reflected by the ROUGE metric; and 3) we employ a strong baseline (better than existing works, e.g. 37.2 vs. 36.8), thus it is difficult to improve upon it.\n\n2. > *Figure 1 shows that the uppermost decoder layer also pays attention to other encoder layers, why SurfaceFusion only uses the encoder embedding layer? The authors claim that \u201calthough the layer attention model partially alleviates this problem, it potentially introduces unnecessary intermediate encoder representations.\u201d Can you show some visualizations/experimental results to support this hypothesis that the intermediate encoder representations are unnecessary for the uppermost decoder layer?*\n3. > *The experiments show that the encoder embedding layer is beneficial for all decoder layers, why the proposed SurfaceFusion does not consider connecting the encoder embedding layer to all decoder layers. A much wider empirical investigation would be appreciated.*\n\n  We give this claim based on the results of our preliminary experiments. We have validated the following variants of FGLA: 1) A simplified version of FGLA (FGLA-I) that connects the decoder output layer to only the encoder embedding and output layers, is on par with the vanilla FGLA that connects to all the encoder layers. We conclude that the intermediate encoder layers are less important for the representation fusion; 2) Another variant FGLA-II that connects all decoder layers to the encoder embedding and output layers, achieves similar performance with FGLA-I. This indicates that it may not be necessary to connect the encoder embedding layer to all decoder layers.\n\n  We include the above discussion in the revised paper to strengthen the motivation. \n\n3. > *Along the same line, some relevant works are omitted [1][2][3][4][5][6], especially for the work from [1], which also consider the connections between the lower encoder layers and uppermost decoder layer, and boosts similar or even higher results on the same benchmarks (EN-DE and EN-FR) as this work. I would suggest the authors take a discussion and a comparison to that work.*\n\n  We include your suggested relevant works [1-6] in the sections of Introduction and Related Work in the revised submission. Our work differs from previous studies in that: 1) while most of them focus on improving model performance with SurfaceFusion, we aim to give a better understanding of SurfaceFusion and consolidate confiscated findings reported by previous studies; and 2) the design of our model is motivated by the findings of FGLA, while theirs are mainly based on research assumptions. In addition to our proposed fusion strategies, we believe that the understanding and findings revealed by our paper can motivate good follow-on works in a line of research on encoder layer fusion.\n\n5. >*The margin of some gains in Table 1 is small. Statistical significance test and error range are highly appreciated.*\n\n  For translation tasks, our model significantly outperforms the baseline with p<0.01 on Ro-En and p<0.05 on En-De and En-Fr according to the significance method in Koehn (2004). For the task of summarization, the error ranges of three independent runs are 37.19 (\u00b10.02) for baseline and 37.89 (\u00b10.03) for SurfaceFusion. For the task of grammatical error correction, the error ranges of three independent runs are 53.40 (\u00b10.93) for baseline and 55.78 (\u00b10.77) for SurfaceFusion. As seen, our approach consistently outperforms the baselines in all cases.\n\n  Philipp Koehn. Statistical significance tests for machine translation evaluation.

If the encoder source embeddings are very important, and layerwise/finegrained attention perform similarly well, why not simplify the approach and simply add/concat them to the output of the encoder (or somewhere else where it makes sense)? have you tried this instead of introducing additional hyperparams?*\n\n  In our preliminary experiments, we have tried simply adding or concatenating encoder embedding to the encoder output, which fail to outperform the baseline model (28.2 / 27.9 vs. 28.9). By observing the learning curves, we found that these techniques brought a faster convergence at the beginning of training, but fell into a sub-optimal local optimum soon.\nOne possible reason is that the model is biased in learning easy-to-learn surface features from the embedding layer and thus quickly overfits. Conversely, the proposed \u201cSurfaceFusion\u201d performs fusion at probability-level to strike the right balance between the learning of both surface and abstract features, which lead to better local optimum and model performance. \n\n---\n\n2. > *What are the costs in terms of wall-clock time when introducing an additional softmax operation for every token in the decoder?*\n\n  The additional softmax brings a 10% speed slower than vanilla model (from 0.018s per token to 0.020s per token).

Thus, when a model with FGLA is trained, it\u2019s optimized differently such that the use of each separated layer in the encoder is modeled explicitly through attention weight. As a result, the contribution of each layer found in Seq2seq with FGLA might not be the same as in the standard Seq2seq. Therefore, I think the conclusion might not be appropriate for the standard Seq2Seq model. In other words, the source representation bottleneck hypothesis might not hold true for standard Seq2seq.\n\nCompared to the previous fusion method that uses a scalar per layer as attention weight (i.e., *Transparent Attention*) in the work of Bapna et. al., 2018, FGLA generalizes it by making a vector per layer. This generalization is straightforward and simple. The later analysis in the paper is carried out on FGLA. However, I find that the same analysis can be performed with Transparent Attention. The introduction of FGLA seems not well-motivated in this regard. In terms of interpretability, Transparent Attention is more interpretable since there is one scalar per layer, whereas FGLA has to report average weight per layer (Figure 1).\n\nFor experimental results, FGLA is not compared with other fusion methods. Thus it\u2019s unclear how the proposed method positions itself in the previous work on Encoder Fusion.\n\nA previous work of ([Nguyen and Chiang, 2018](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1031/)) proposed a similar way of fusing source embeddings directly to the output of the decoder. Their work can be seen as Surface fusion proposed in this paper.\n\nWhile the motivation for this kind of fusion might be obvious for machine translation, it\u2019s less so for summarization and grammatical error correction. I think it\u2019s worth spending some text/examples on why this is needed for those tasks.\n\n\n**References**\nImproving Lexical Choice in Neural Machine Translation.
