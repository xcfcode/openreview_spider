This idea might be useful in other domains too. However, I have some doubts about the paper. \n\n1) I think there are still notation inconsistencies in the revised paper and it's hard to follow. For example, till Section 2.2 it was assumed that the matrix is of size $m*d$ where $m \\leq d$. However, from Section 2.2 on wards when it is assumed that $B^\\ast$ is an orthogonal matrix, is it with $m=d$ or with $m <d$ and rows being orthogonal to each other? This confusion also arises in the statement of Theorem 2.6 where the notation indices in the first term of $G(B)$ are all in terms of $d$ whereas the last term has indices in $m$ though they both correspond to the same variable $B$. So I am wondering if the said results in this paper only hold for the case $m=d$ and $B^\\ast$ is orthogonal or they continue to hold even if $m <d$ and the rows are orthogonal to each other. I think it would be better if authors can follow a consistent notation through out the paper.\n\n2) In typical neural networks, in addition to the weight matrices, there is always a bias term present which is conspicuous by absence in this paper. So I am wondering if one introduces a bias vector $b in \\mathbb{R}^m$ in equation (1.1), do the results still hold? I suspect that inclusion of a bias term might make the analysis harder since the Hermite polynomial trick might no longer be valid. I would like to know author's thoughts on this and if this issue can be dealt with some other way."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning One-hidden-layer Neural Networks with Landscape Design", "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning a one-hidden-layer neural network: we assume the input x is from Gaussian distribution and the label $y = a \\sigma(Bx) + \\xi$, where a is a nonnegative vector and  $B$ is a full-rank weight matrix, and $\\xi$ is a noise vector.

The paper still needs some work on clarity, and authors defer the changes to the next version (but as I understood, they did no changes for this paper as of now), which is a bit frustrating. However I am fine accepting it.\n[ ============================== END OF REVISION =====================================================]\n\nThis paper concerns with addressing the issue of SGD not converging to the optimal parameters on one hidden layer network for a particular type of data and label (gaussian features, label generated using a particular function that should be learnable with neural net). Authors demonstrate empirically that this particular learning problem is hard for SGD with l2 loss (due to apparently bad local optima) and suggest two ways of addressing it, on top of the known way of dealing with this problem (which is overparameterization). First is to use a new activation function, the second is by designing a new objective function that has only global optima and which can be efficiently learnt with SGD\n\nOverall the paper is well written. The authors first introduce their suggested loss function and then go into details about what inspired its creation. I do find interesting the formulation of population risk in terms of tensor decomposition, this is insightful\n\nMy issues with the paper are as follows:\n- The loss function designed seems overly complicated. On top of that authors notice that to learn with this loss efficiently, much larger batches had to be used. I wonder how applicable this in practice - I frankly didn't see insights here that I can apply to other problems that don't fit into this particular narrowly defined framework\n- I do find it somewhat strange that no insight to the actual problem is provided (e.g. it is known empirically but there is no explanation of what actually happens and there is a idea that it is due to local optima), but authors are concerned with developing new loss function that has provable properties about global optima. Since it is all empirical, the first fix (activation function) seems sufficient to me and new loss is very far-fetched. \n- It seems that changing activation function from relu to their proposed one fixes the problem without their new loss, so i wonder whether it is a problem with relu itself and may be other activations funcs, like sigmoids will not suffer from the same problem\n- No comparison with overparameterization in experiments results is given, which makes me wonder why their method is better.\n\nMinor: fix margins in formula 2.7. \n\n\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning One-hidden-layer Neural Networks with Landscape Design", "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning a one-hidden-layer neural network: we assume the input x is from Gaussian distribution and the label $y = a \\sigma(Bx) + \\xi$, where a is a nonnegative vector and  $B$ is a full-rank weight matrix, and $\\xi$ is a noise vector.

A well-known problem is that without good initialization, it is not easy to learn the hidden parameters via gradient descent. This paper establishes an interesting connection between least squares population loss and Hermite polynomials. Following from this connection authors propose a new loss function. Interestingly, they are able to show that the loss function globally converges to the hidden weight matrix. Simulations confirm the findings.\n\nOverall, pretty interesting result and solid contribution. The paper also raises good questions for future works. For instance, is designing alternative loss function useful in practice? In summary, I recommend acceptance. The paper seems rushed to me so authors should polish up the paper and fix typos.\n\nTwo questions:\n1) Authors do not require a^* to recover B^*. Is that because B^* is assumed to have unit length rows? If so they should clarify this otherwise it confuses the reader a bit.\n2) What can be said about rate of convergence in terms of network parameters?

It's driven by the theoretical analysis of the squared loss (more intuition below), and it's novel as far as we know.\n\nThat said, we think it's also valuable to pursue a provably nice loss function without bad local minima. Note that there is no known method to empirically verify whether a function has no bad local minima, and such statements can only be established by proofs. Admittedly our first-cut design of the loss function is complicated and sub-optimal in terms of sample complexity, we do hope that our technique can inspire better loss function and model design in the future.\n\n--- \"does sigmoid suffer from the same problem?\": we did experiment with the sigmoid activation and found that the sigmoid activation function also has bad local minima. We will add this experiment to the next version of the paper. We conjecture that the activation h_2 +h_4 or the activation 1/2 |z|  has no spurious local minima.\n\n--- \"actual insights about the landscape\": Our insights is that the squared loss objective function is trying to perform an infinite number of tensor decomposition problems simultaneously, and the mixing of all of these problems very likely creates bad local minima, as we empirically observed. The intuition behind the empirical fix is that removing some of these tensor decomposition problems would make the landscape simpler and nicer.\n\n--- \"comparison with over-parameterization\":  over-parameterization is indeed a powerful way to remove the bad local minima, and it gives models with good prediction. But it doesn't recover the parameters of the true model because the training parameters space is larger. Our method is guaranteed to recover the true parameters of the model, which in turns guarantees a ``complete\" generalization to any unseen examples, even including e.g., adversarial examples or test examples drawn from another distribution. In this sense, our approaches (both the empirical fix and theoretical one) return solutions with stronger guarantees than over-parameterization can provide.\n\nOf course, it's also a very important open problem to understand better other alternatives to landscape design such as over-parametrization.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning One-hidden-layer Neural Networks with Landscape Design", "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning a one-hidden-layer neural network: we assume the input x is from Gaussian distribution and the label $y = a \\sigma(Bx) + \\xi$, where a is a nonnegative vector and  $B$ is a full-rank weight matrix, and $\\xi$ is a noise vector.
