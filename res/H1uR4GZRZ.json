The most important contribution is that the proposed algorithm can be applied post-hoc to already trained networks. Hence, the proposed algorithm (Stochastic Activation Pruning) can be combined with algorithms which prevent from adversarial examples during the training.\n\nThe proposed algorithm is clearly described. However there are issues in the presentation.\n\nIn section 2-3, the problem setting is not suitably introduced.\nIn particular one sentence that can be misleading:\n\u201cGiven a classifier, one common way to generate an adversarial example is to perturb the input in direction of the gradient\u2026\u201d\nYou should explain that given a classifier with stochastic output, the optimal way to generate an adversarial example is to perturb the input proportionally to the gradient. The practical way in which the adversarial examples are generated is not known to the player. An adversary could choose any policy. The only thing the player knows is the best adversarial policy.\n\nIn section 4, I do not understand why the adversary uses only the sign and not also the value of the estimated gradient. Does it come from a high variance? If it is the case, you should explain that the optimal policy of the adversary is approximated by \u201cfast gradient sign method\u201d. \n\nIn comparison to dropout algorithm, SAP shows improvements of accuracy against adversarial examples. SAP does not perform as well as adversarial training, but SAP could be used with a trained network. \n\nOverall, this paper presents a practical method to prevent a classifier from adversarial examples, which can be applied in addition to adversarial training.

On the other hand, I find it lacking in terms of theoretical support, other than the fact that the added stochasticity induces a certain amount of robustness. For example, how does this compare to random perturbation (say, zero-mean) of the weights? This adds stochasticity as well so why and why not this work?

We are glad that the reviewer appreciated the value of an adversarial defense technique that can be applied post-hoc and our exposition. We reply to specific points below:\n\n1. You are correct, the defender does not know the what policy any actual adversary will use, only what the optimal adversary might do, thus the objective of minimizing the worst-case performance. We are improving the draft to be clearer in this regard.\n\n2. Regarding: \u201cIn section 4, I do not understand why the adversary uses only the sign and not also the value of the estimated gradient.\u201d: The reason why we are considering only the sign is because we cap the infinity norm of the adversarial perturbation. This leads to taking a step of equal size in each input dimension and thus the gradient magnitude does not come into play. This approach is standard in the recent academic study of adversarial examples and follows work by Goodfellow et al. (2014), which showed that imperceptible adversarial examples could be produced efficiently in this manner.. \n\nOne motivation for considering the infinity norm (vs L2 or L1) for constraining the size of an adversarial perturbation is that it accords more closely with perceptual similarity. For example, it\u2019s possible to devise a perturbation with small L2 norm that is perceptually obvious because it moves a small group of pixels a large amount. \n\nNaturally, a stronger adversary might pursue an iterative approach rather than making one large perturbation. To this end, we are currently running experiments with iterative attacks and the initial results are promising - SAP continues to significantly outperform the dense model. We will add these results to the paper when they are ready.\n\n3. We are grateful for the reviewer\u2019s suggestions for improving the exposition and are currently working to revise the draft in accordance with these recommendations. To start, we have improved some of the (previously) confusing language that might have failed to distinguish between the optimal adversary and some arbitrary adversary which may not apply the optimal perturbation.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Stochastic Activation Pruning for Robust Adversarial Defense", "abstract": "Neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples.

We are glad that you appreciated both the method and the clarity of exposition. \n\n1. Regarding Fig 1.c: While dense models are susceptible to adversarial attack, they are actually quite robust to random noise. The purpose of reporting the results of this experiment is to provide context for the other results. Because dense models are not especially vulnerable to random noise, we are not surprised that they perform well here. \n\n2. Thanks for the suggestion that the analysis in the appendix should be summarized within the body of the paper. Per your request, we have added an additional subsection (5.3) in the current draft that briefly describes the baselines and we have included a corresponding figure that shows the quantitative results for each.\n\n3. While we are reluctant to present an explanation for a phenomena that we do not fully understand, we are happy to share the intuitions that guided us in developing the algorithm: \n\nOriginally we were looking sparsifying the weights and/or activations of the network. We were encouraged by results, e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00149, showing high accuracy with sparsified weights (as by pruning). We thought that by sparsifying a network, we might maintain high accuracy while lowering the Lipschitz constant and thus conferring some robustness against small perturbations. We later drew some inspiration from randomized algorithms that sparsify matrices by randomly dropping entries according to their weights and scaling up the survivors to produce a sparse matrix with similar spectral properties to the original.\n\n4. Sampling from the multinomial is fast. Without getting into detail about how many random bits are needed, given uniform samples, we can convert to a sample from a multinomial by performing a binary search. So it\u2019s roughly k log(n) where k is the number of samples and n is the number of activations. As a practical concern, sampling from the multinomial in our algorithms does not comprise a significant computational obstacle.\n\n5. As you correctly point out, In our experiments, we adopt approach from Goodfellow et al. of evaluating with adversarial perturbations produced by taking a single step with capped infinity norm. However, we generate these attacks differently for each model. Against our stochastic models, the adversary produces the attack by estimating the gradient with MC samples. \n\n6. Per your suggestions we have compared against a stronger modes of attack, namely an iterative update where we take multiple small updates, each of capped infinity norm. In these experiments, SAP continues to outperform the dense model significantly. We are currently compiling these results and will add them to the draft when ready. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Stochastic Activation Pruning for Robust Adversarial Defense", "abstract": "Neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples.

Additionally, for a more direct comparison, we compared against zero-mean Gaussian noise applied to the activations. We call this method Random Noisy Activations (RNA).
