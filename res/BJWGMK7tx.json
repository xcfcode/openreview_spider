But there aren\u2019t any comparisons to other approaches or even discussions about related work.\nThis is the objective of the paper to show that this intuition is true. A number of approaches are considering whether the structural (links) information, or the feature information, but few on both. Such works are mostly focusing on graph clustering and community detection.\nOne can find such work (for graphs, not multi-relational data) in e.g. [1], [2] and references therein. Due to page limitation, it was difficult to provide a discussion on this aspect, but we are aware that it would deserve a deeper description.\nConsidering both structural and feature information of multi-relational data for metric learning has never been considered, to the best of our knowledge.\n> Equation (1) only measures the link strength between two entities. For your Labels + Relations experiment, it is unclear how you put both constraints in Algorithm 1.\n\nAlgorithm 1 is only concerned with constraints obtained from the structure of the data. Label constraints are obtained exactly the same way as almost every metric learning algorithm, i.e. by considering that similar objects are objects having the same label (and dissimilar objects have different labels)\n\n\n> I think it is also necessary to specify what features (attributes) you used exactly. How many of them are numerical and how many are categorical (otherwise why set gamma = 0.5)? Also how do you pick the #constraints (13680, 36594)? Need to clarify.\n\nThe link strength is computed with association information, in the case of MovieLens, there is only one numerical attribute, the value of the rating. The value of gamma is not changing the link strength ordering in this case.\n\nThe number of constraints was mainly constrained by the number of possible pairs. There is no rule of thumb in metric learning community for this, but a commonly used one is to set it as function of squared number of different labels (as in ITML).\n\n[1] Yang, J., McAuley, J., & Leskovec, J.
