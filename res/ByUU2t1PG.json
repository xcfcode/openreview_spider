For example: how does the data look, how is it fed into the convolutional architecture, how does the attention mechanism work, some more comparison to previous methods to give an impression of the magnitude of the performance increase. Especially the model architecture is far from clear.\n\nThe novelty of the paper seems to be mostly the cross-modal attention layer of the antibody-antigen model. Most other parts of the model seem to be taken from the literature and especially the attention mechanism of velickovic has already been used to model protein-interactions, but of course combining existing methods in a new way that sets a new state-of-the-art is also a valid contribution.\n\nExcept for the clarity issues pointed out above, I think think this could be a valuable contribution for the ICLR workshops.

While the new architecture is motivated as being computationally more efficient, no evidence is provided of the time for learning and predicting using this architecture relative to ParaPred.\n\n2.
