In particular, it contributes to the disentanglement of content and dynamics using neural ODEs. \n\nStrength: \n1. I think it is a well-written paper with interesting experimental design, especially the \u201cswap\u201d and \u201cmulti-view\u201d experiments that measure the degree of disentanglement. \n2. The proposed model consistently outperforms well-established approaches for video prediction, including DrNet, DDPAE, and PhyDNet, which is also a PDE-based model for spatiotemporal disentanglement.\n\nWeakness:\n1. Although the effectiveness of the model has been validated on several datasets, most of them are synthetic. I strongly encourage the authors to include real human motion datasets. For example, DrNet was evaluated on KTH, and PhyDNet was evaluated on Human3.6M.\n2. The model was only compared with PKnl and PhyDNet on the Wave and SST datasets, and I am curious about how models beyond disentanglement, such as SVG and MIM, perform in this case. Also, the results in Figure 2 appear to be quite blurry and do not show significant improvement. These experiments mainly show the general ability of the proposed model for video prediction rather than spatiotemporal disentanglement. \n\nCorrectness: \nIn Eq. (12), the authors use a Gaussian prior to convey dynamic information and exclude the spatial information. Is it a good thing or a bad thing from the view of modeling temporal dynamics? A question is: can such a simple dynamic model be applied to datasets with complex motion information?\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper147/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper147/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "PDE-Driven Spatiotemporal Disentanglement", "authorids": ["jeremie.dona@lip6.fr", "~Jean-Yves_Franceschi1", "~sylvain_lamprier1", "~patrick_gallinari1"], "authors": ["J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Don\u00e0", "Jean-Yves Franceschi", "sylvain lamprier", "patrick gallinari"], "keywords": ["disentanglement", "spatiotemporal prediction", "representation learning", "dynamical systems", "separation of variables"], "abstract": "A recent line of work in the machine learning community addresses the problem of predicting high-dimensional spatiotemporal phenomena by leveraging specific tools from the differential equations theory.

We are sorry to read that you believe that our model is falsely advertised and non significant. We expose in the following factual counterarguments and hope to engage in a constructive discussion on this matter.\n\n\n# PDEs and Separation of Variables\n\n\nWe assume for modeling purposes that our observations are driven by PDEs, as discussed in Sections 1, 4.1 and C.1, but the model itself does not implement PDEs: this is a key point of the paper, driven by the separation of variables. We would like to point out that we never claimed to implement PDEs in our model. We detail this issue below.\n\nWe stated in all our work, including the title and abstract, that PDEs and the separation of variables were considered along the paper as principled tools that drive our approach to derive appropriate cost functions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one to interpret spatiotemporal disentanglement as a separation of variables in a PDE. Because it provides state-of-the-art results on several datasets, we believe that our interpretation may also be used in other settings, for example with fully observed phenomena which would not necessarily require any relaxation.\n\nAs duly noted by the reviewer and in the manuscript, we simulate latent trajectories as ODEs. This is exactly the desired goal and flows directly from the application of the method of separation of variables, as explained in the following.\n\nOur modeling assumption is that the observed phenomenon is driven by an unknown PDE. However, learning numerical or analytical solutions to this PDE is notoriously complex. Therefore, we are looking for separable solutions to this PDE, that we interpret as spatiotemporal disentanglement. We then study how to apply such separation in the context of a partially observable phenomenon and thus formulate its consequences as cost functionals and inductive priors.\n\nOur derived formulation presents few major properties:\n  - It separates the learning of the solution into time-invariant and time-varying functions. It indeed concurs with prior approaches, as noted in our related work, and confirms our interpretation of spatiotemporal disentanglement as separation of variables.\n  - The separation of variables makes the time-varying component of the overall solution obeying an ODE, simplifying the integration and learning of the PDE over time enabled by recent advances [1, 2]. Without loss of generality, we model this time dependency as a vectorial first-order ODE. Besides their continuous nature, ODEs provide interesting modeling properties. For example, the flow of an ODE being a bijection, it preserves mutual information (Sections 4.4 and C.2, and Eq. (12)) which may explain our good long-term disentanglement performances (Table 2).\n  - Compared to previous disentanglement approaches involving complex learning tools such as latent adversarial discrimination for DrNet or factorized variational autoencoding for DDPAE, the effective constraints derived from our principled modeling choices only involve regression penalties. Their relevance is discussed in an ablation study (Section F.1, Table 3, analyzed in Section 5.2).\n\nWe will deepen the discussion precising our motivations for leveraging the separation of variables in Sections 4.1 and 4.2.\n\n\n# Links and Comparisons with RNNs\n\nMuch more than a difference in degree, leveraging ODEs instead of conventional LSTMs is a fundamental choice.\n\nOf course, ODE resolution schemes are recurrent. However, the expression \u201crecurrent neural networks\u201d refers in the machine learning community to architectures such as GRU, LSTM and ConvLSTM which are fundamentally different from classical state-space dynamical systems. We used this expression in this usual sense in our submission. Therefore, our claim based on prior work and our experimental results holds: ODE-based dynamics are more adapted to model spatiotemporal phenomena than conventional networks such as LSTMs.\n\nWe reinforce our claim with additional experiments to be included in the updated submission. We reproduced our Moving MNIST experiments by replacing our latent ODE for the integration of T by a GRU, leading to the following results.\n\n|  | Prediction | (t+10) | Prediction | (t+95) | Disentangl. | (t+10) | Disentangl. | (t+95) |\n|-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n| Models | PSNR | SSIM | PSNR | SSIM | PSNR | SSIM | PSNR | SSIM |\n| Ours (GRU) | 21.66 | 0.9088 | 15.45 | 0.4888 | 17.70 | 0.8178 | 14.77 | 0.4718 |\n| Ours | **21.76** | **0.9092** | **17.89** | **0.8094** | **18.37** | **0.8344** | **16.71** | **0.7777** |\n\nAs expected, using a recurrent neural network instead of an ODE dramatically hurts the performance of the model, both in terms of prediction and disentanglement. \n\nThe study of the good performances obtained with ODE-based trajectories is beyond the scope of this paper, but is an active research direction in the literature [2, 3, 4]."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper147/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper147/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "PDE-Driven Spatiotemporal Disentanglement", "authorids": ["jeremie.dona@lip6.fr", "~Jean-Yves_Franceschi1", "~sylvain_lamprier1", "~patrick_gallinari1"], "authors": ["J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Don\u00e0", "Jean-Yves Franceschi", "sylvain lamprier", "patrick gallinari"], "keywords": ["disentanglement", "spatiotemporal prediction", "representation learning", "dynamical systems", "separation of variables"], "abstract": "A recent line of work in the machine learning community addresses the problem of predicting high-dimensional spatiotemporal phenomena by leveraging specific tools from the differential equations theory.

We will make sure to clarify them in the updated manuscript following your feedback. Please let us know if you have any additional questions; we would gladly answer them.\n\nWhen formulating a PDE, the system coordinates for space (x, y, etc.) and time (t) naturally appear as variables of the solution. Accessing spatial coordinates may be either costly or infeasible when the partial observation of the phenomenon obfuscates the knowledge of such coordinates. For example, there can be numerous unknown variables in SST that drive the evolution of the observed phenomenon, such as the temperature of the water at large depths; without prior knowledge on this phenomenon, the nature and number of these variables are unknown. Non-physical datasets such as Moving MNIST and 3D Warehouse Chairs are partially observed as well and then also share this issue: for instance, the observed chairs are only 2D projections of 3D objects. Therefore, we chose not to model the solution of a PDE as traditionally performed in parametric PDE models, i.e. as a function of the time t and space variables x, y. The dynamics in our model should then be an explicit function of t only.\n\nHenceforth, the described relaxation consists in eliminating the explicit modeling of spatial coordinates by learning dynamic and time-invariant representations accounting respectively for the time-dependent and space-dependent parts of the solution. The time-invariant representation is then supposed to learn the unknown spatial components of the system in a single vector, thus removing these unknowns from the model. This is summarized by Eq. (5) and Eq. (6).\n\n\n## Experimental Results\n\nOur model achieves state-of-the-art results on all considered tasks and datasets, both regarding disentanglement and prediction.\n\nThe only evaluation on which our model falls behind some baselines is short-term prediction for Moving MNIST. Nevertheless, short-term Moving MNIST predictions do not show that the dynamic is well-learned but rather accounts for encoding and decoding capacities of the model. In contrast, as analyzed in Section 5.2, long-term prediction results evidence that our model learns more consistent and disentangled dynamics, unlike all baselines."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper147/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper147/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "PDE-Driven Spatiotemporal Disentanglement", "authorids": ["jeremie.dona@lip6.fr", "~Jean-Yves_Franceschi1", "~sylvain_lamprier1", "~patrick_gallinari1"], "authors": ["J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Don\u00e0", "Jean-Yves Franceschi", "sylvain lamprier", "patrick gallinari"], "keywords": ["disentanglement", "spatiotemporal prediction", "representation learning", "dynamical systems", "separation of variables"], "abstract": "A recent line of work in the machine learning community addresses the problem of predicting high-dimensional spatiotemporal phenomena by leveraging specific tools from the differential equations theory.

We try to answer them in the following.\n\nImposing a Gaussian prior is a reasonable assumption in the model, like in dynamical variational models [1, 7] or for arbitrary distribution modeling [8]. We show in our ablation study of Appendix Section F.1 (Table 3), discussed in Section 5.2, that this Gaussian prior is key to achieve disentanglement as well as state-of-the-art prediction performances.\n\nMore generally, a disentangled prediction system, besides offering interpretability, simplifies the dynamics by removing information that it does not need to account for. Our ablation study shows that considering spatial information in the dynamics by removing S (thus removing the Gaussian prior as well) significantly hurts the prediction abilities, validating the search for a constrained dynamic. This is also supported by prior approaches discussed in the related work which verified this hypothesis on various spatiotemporal phenomena.\n\nMoreover, the proposed dynamic is suited to model complex motions, as indicated by our results on SST. Vectorial representations for T with an ODE resolution scheme parameterized by neural networks ensure that our temporal model can approximate any continuous function. As an illustration, ODE-based models have already been successfully leveraged in the literature for prediction, density modeling and classification, e.g. in [6, 9, 10].\n\n\n# References\n\n[1] E.

We will keep you informed about additional experimental results and make sure to update our submission accordingly as soon as possible.\n\n# Choice of Datasets\n\n## Synthetic Datasets \n\nOur choice of synthetic datasets Moving MNIST and 3D Warehouse Chairs is motivated by the necessity to be able to compute disentanglement metrics in controlled settings in order to assess the disentanglement abilities of compared models. These quantitative experiments were not considered in earlier works. Moreover, despite being synthetic, Moving MNIST (evaluating long-term accuracy in the prediction of a mechanical problem) and 3D Warehouse Chairs (involving complex shapes) are challenging for all models, hence their relevance in our comparison with the state of the art.\n\n## Human Motions Datasets\n\nAs mentioned in Appendix Section F.2 and in our conclusion, a consensus in the literature (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) indicates that human motion datasets require stochastic modeling because of the inherently highly random events occurring in these videos. Tackling this issue would require to incorporate stochasticity in our model, for example leveraging variational autoencoders like [1], or supplement it with adversarial losses on the image space, for instance like [4, 5]. These changes are feasible but are out of the scope of this paper. The goal of the present work is to find a principled spatiotemporal disentanglement model compared to prior complex deterministic approaches.\n\nNonetheless, we already investigated the realistic video dataset KTH in Appendix Section F.2 with encouraging prediction performances matching the investigated baselines (SVG and DrNet). We will include PhyDNet in this comparison. These results obtained in our deterministic setting lay promising foundations for future models deploying more involved and domain-specific tools.\n\n\n# Additional Baselines and Results on Physical Datasets\n\n## Disentanglement Evaluation of Physical Datasets\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section of this answer, evaluating the disentanglement ability of models requires a controlled setting with prior knowledge on the spatiotemporal disentanglement in the dataset. Therefore, the only disentanglement studies that could be done on SST and WaveEq consisted in showing that such disentanglement indeed improves performances and qualitatively assessing that altering the invariant component of the model indeed changes predictions. We accordingly conducted these experiments on SST and WaveEq (on which we did not consider any comparison with prior work as it was only designed for introductory experiments).\n\n## Additional Baselines\n\nWe will add in the updated submission results on SST for MIM and SVG, which we did not include as they were not originally tested on this dataset. In the meantime, we highlight that PhyDNet is reported to outperform MIM and other baselines on this dataset [6]. Since we outperform PhyDNet, we assume the same upcoming results for MIM.\n\n## Results Analysis on SST\n\nWe stress that SST is a challenging dataset involving chaotic behavior even at short time scales and remains unsolved in the state of the art. These difficulties indeed lead to a slight blur in our predictions. However, our model shows the most accurate trajectories compared to PKnl and PhyDNet, as attested by their numerical performances with respect to MSE and SSIM. In particular, we outperform both baselines with respect to SSIM, which is a metric that penalizes blurred predictions. Qualitatively, we notice that PhyDNet produces much blurrier prediction than ours (cf. also Figure 4.c. in [6]) -- hence its low SSIM -- and PKnl, while sharper, consistently predicts wrong displacements."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper147/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper147/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "PDE-Driven Spatiotemporal Disentanglement", "authorids": ["jeremie.dona@lip6.fr", "~Jean-Yves_Franceschi1", "~sylvain_lamprier1", "~patrick_gallinari1"], "authors": ["J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Don\u00e0", "Jean-Yves Franceschi", "sylvain lamprier", "patrick gallinari"], "keywords": ["disentanglement", "spatiotemporal prediction", "representation learning", "dynamical systems", "separation of variables"], "abstract": "A recent line of work in the machine learning community addresses the problem of predicting high-dimensional spatiotemporal phenomena by leveraging specific tools from the differential equations theory.

Solving high-dimensional PDEs, for deriving the exact dynamics, is difficult; hence, this work proposes learning time-invariant and time-dependent representations separately to solve this problem. To achieve this goal, the authors devised a model that incorporates a temporal ODE process. The provided experiments indicate that the method achieves good performance, although the gain is not consistent.\n\nThe overall derivation and methodology of this paper are technically sound, and I guess discarding $S^\\prime$ was a practical choice for learning time-invariant representation. Although the proposed model is generally applicable, the experiments only cover prediction results on classical image datasets. Nevertheless, the underlying timescales of datasets are sufficiently varied to demonstrate the effectiveness in general temporal sequences.\n\n[Quality]\n\nThe paper is clearly written overall. However, Section 4 was a bit hard to follow, which is the core part of this paper. For example, \"the system coordinates\" and reasons for the relaxation (Sec. 4.2) were not clearly explained for people who are not familiar with the area. It would be harder to understand the architecture if Fig. 1 was not given.\n\n[Originality]\n\nThe originality of the paper is not stellar, but sufficient for acceptance. \n\n[Significance]\n\nThe significance of this work is mainly for model architecture. I believe these kinds of approaches, which can internally model continuous dynamics, are heavily preferred when solving real-world problems. Therefore, the significance of the paper is sufficient for acceptance.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper147/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper147/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "PDE-Driven Spatiotemporal Disentanglement", "authorids": ["jeremie.dona@lip6.fr", "~Jean-Yves_Franceschi1", "~sylvain_lamprier1", "~patrick_gallinari1"], "authors": ["J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Don\u00e0", "Jean-Yves Franceschi", "sylvain lamprier", "patrick gallinari"], "keywords": ["disentanglement", "spatiotemporal prediction", "representation learning", "dynamical systems", "separation of variables"], "abstract": "A recent line of work in the machine learning community addresses the problem of predicting high-dimensional spatiotemporal phenomena by leveraging specific tools from the differential equations theory.

The results are generally good, especially for long roll-outs, and they demonstrate something like disentangling by showing that the identities of the digits can be swapped in the moving MNIST data.\n\nMy main objection with the paper is that it has nothing to do with PDEs or separation of variables. The actual latent trajectories are simulated as *ODEs*, not PDEs, which are then used to generate images. The justification in terms of separation of variables is also a bait-and-switch...a slowness penalty is added to the loss for one of the latent trajectories, that is all. Factored latent trajectories are a well-established modeling technique for time series already. The use of ODEs parameterized by neural networks rather than, say, LSTMs or other RNN architectures is also more a difference in degree than in kind from other sequence models. Much like how ResNets become neural ODEs in the limit of very deep networks, simply using Runge-Kutta updates parameterized by a neural network is still technically a kind of RNN (if you define RNN very loosely as any nonlinear iterated function learnable by gradient descent).
