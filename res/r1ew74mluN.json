While Adversarial Feature Learning attempts to avoid a discriminator being able to discern a certain set of labels that should not be inferrable from a learned representation, the proposed approach attempts to actively generate similarity between the representations learned, across the different unwanted labels. It is also shown that AFL might be unstable.\n\nThe example gives some intuition but may not exhibit the same behavior with actual high-dimensional data.\n\nNo notation is introduced in the paper, making especially the beginning very hard to follow.\nOn the other hand the entropy of a uniform distribution is elevated to Theorem status, and proven in the appendix, which is not necessary.\n\nThere is a typo in the heading of section 3. Overall the paper is quite hard to understand.\n\nThe contribution of APL merits publication, but it seems to this reviewer that it actually misses the topic of this workshop.
