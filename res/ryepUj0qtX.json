They use this model successfully in a variety of tasks.", "review": "The authors propose a generative model of networks by learning embeddings and pairing the embeddings with a prior distribution over networks. The idea is that the prior distribution may explain structure that the embeddings would not have to capture.\n\nThe motivation for doing this is that this structure is typically hard to model for network embeddings.\nThe authors propose a clean -if improper- prior on networks and proceed to perform maximum likelihood inference on it.\nThe experiments show that the approach works fine for link porediction and can be used for visualization.\n\nTwo points: \na) Why not try to do this with Variational inference? It should conceptually still work and be fast and potentially more robust.\nb) The prior seems to be picked according to properties of the observed data and expressed in a product of constraints. This seems clunky, I would have been more impressed with a prior structure that ties in closer with the embeddings and requires less hand-engineering.\n\nA key point of interest is the following: very exciting recent work (GraphRNN: Generating Realistic Graphs with Deep Auto-regressive Models by You et al ICML2018) has proposed neural generative models of networks with a high degree of fidelity and much less hand-picked features.  The work here tries to not learn a lot of these structures but impose them. Do the authors think that ultimately learning priors with models like GraphRNN might be more promising for certain applications?\nThe drawback in this model here is that ultimately networks are embedded, but not really generated during test time. A more predictive generative model that makes less hard assumptions on graph data would be interesting.\n\nUpdate After rebuttal:\nGiven the authors' rebuttal to all reviews, I am upgrading my score to a 6. I still feel that more learning (as inGraphRNN) to build a fuller generative model of the graph would be interesting, but the authors make a strong case for the usefulness and practicality of their approach.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper213/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Conditional Network Embeddings", "abstract": "Network Embeddings (NEs) map the nodes of a given network into $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^d$.

Of the suggested methods, graph convolutional and message passing neural networks need attributed graphs as inputs, and are thus not applicable.

We have added an experiment on a network of 200.000 nodes to support this.", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful review.\n\nResponses:\n- We clarified the unclear parts, and will upload the revised version asap. (Also see below for specific responses.)\n- It is unclear to us if the reviewer thinks the computational complexity is high, or the mathematical complexity.\nWith regards to mathematical complexity, we believe the model is actually rather simple (see also other reviews).\nThus, we assume computational complexity is meant. Computational complexity is discussed in detail in the manuscript though, and is certainly not higher than competing methods (in part thanks to the low mathematical complexity of the model). See also next point.\n- The datasets we used are as large as the datasets used in other related work in the area. To demonstrate CNE's superior scalability, we included another network with around 200.000 nodes and around 1.000.000 edges (http://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-Gowalla.html), run on a basic single CPU laptop. Again, CNE outperforms all other methods in accuracy by a wide margin, and is substantially faster as well. The results are included in the revised manuscript.\n\nDetailed comments:\n\n- \"In the introduction, \"it is in general impossible to find an embedding in R^d such that ...\", [...]?\"\nWe apologize for having been a bit brief here, we will clarify this in the revision (uploaded asap). We meant to say that in network embedding methods that aim to model first-order proximity (where proximity in the embedding space implies a higher probability of being linked), this is a requirement (otherwise, proximity of v and v' would imply they are likely to be linked). Thus our argument only applies to such first-order proximity methods. Methods that aim to model second-order proximities (where proximity in the embedding space implies a greater overlap between the sets of adjacent nodes), however, are similarly vulnerable. For example, there can be a 50% overlap (which is highly significant in sparse networks) between the neighborhoods of nodes A and B, as well as between the neighborhoods of nodes B and C, but zero overlap between the neighborhoods of nodes A and C. This would mean that nodes A and B need to be embedded close to each other, nodes B and C as well, but nodes A and C distant from each other. The triangle inequality makes this hard. Finally, these are but examples of how a Euclidean embedding on its own lacks representational power. We believe that our empirical results also demonstrate this without having to refer to easy-to-identify problematic situations for pure embedding-based methods.\n\n- \"In Equation (2), How is P_ij defined exactly [...]?\"\nThey are not parameters: they are numbers between 0 and 1 representing the prior probability of a link between nodes i and j (i.e. prior to seeing the embedding). These numbers are such that the prior knowledge of the types described are satisfied in expectation. In other words, they are implied and can be computed automatically and highly efficiently based on prior work, after one has decided on which prior knowledge to use.\nFor details about how P_ij are fitted given such prior knowledge constraints, and how they can be represented efficiently, we have to refer to Adriaens et al. (2017) and van Leeuwen et al. (2016). We have however summarized the relevant aspects: the fact that all probabilities P_ij, although there are n^2 of them, can be represented using much fewer parameters, and the fact that they can be fitted highly efficiently (in our experiments, even on the largest networks, this always took only a tiny proportion of the total computation time). In the new version to be uploaded soon, this will be further clarified.\n\n- \"In Equation (6), the posterior distribution should be P(X|G) [...]?\"\nNo, the equation is correct as stated. Footnote 2 warned the reader about this, as we know it is unusual. The posterior is a distribution for the network, such that finding the best embedding is indeed a maximum likelihood problem (not a maximum a posteriori problem), even though the likelihood function is computed as a posterior given a prior for the network and a conditional for the embedding given the network. We suspect that it is this unusual aspect of the CNE formulation that makes it original with respect to the state-of-the-art.\n\n- \"In Table 2 and 3, how are [...]?\"\nEquation (6) defines the posterior of the network given the embedding, which we maximize w.r.t. the embedding. It explicitly depends on the prior probabilities P_ij, which are computed based on the prior knowledge about the degrees or about the block density structure of the adjacency matrix. Thus, this information is brought into the model by considering the posterior distribution for the network, where the prior models the degrees of the nodes, or the block structure."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper213/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper213/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper213/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Conditional Network Embeddings", "abstract": "Network Embeddings (NEs) map the nodes of a given network into $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^d$.

We wish to point out that our experiments indicate CNE consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art not only for these tasks but also for multi-label classification.\n\nOur responses:\na) Variational inference is useful in particular when the partition function is hard to compute, which is not the case here. So we believe it would be overkill in this case. In any case, it is not needed to achieve the performances CNE achieves at a very modest computational complexity and fast practical runtimes.\nb) No hand-engineering is needed to use CNE even when using more informative priors modeling node degrees and block structure.\nThe degree of each node can simply be computed on the training set, so no hand-engineering is needed (just the choice to include it or not -- and it always better to include it).\nThe block structure, on the other hand, will often be part of the data specification or meta-data of the nodes. For example, the network may be a multi-partite network representing a relational database, or it may be a company social network where the nodes are employees, and generic job titles are known for each of the employees (as attributes of the nodes). The entity types in the first example, and the job titles in the second example, would then define the blocks, and the density of the parts of the adjacency matrix between any two such blocks can again easily be computed on the network. Our method imposes no constraints on such blocks (e.g. they may even be partially overlapping). Again, all that is needed is choosing whether to use a block prior for any specified attribute (in the two examples: entity type, and node attribute). Again, empirically, including it always appears to be better, so one could even avoid having to make the choice.\n\nInferring structural properties of the graph to be used in the prior (e.g. using GraphRNN), as we understand the reviewer suggests, certainly sounds potentially interesting. However, while it may improve accuracy, we do not believe that it adds value in reducing the amount of hand-engineering needed, as the amount of hand-engineering needed is very minimal already. The fact that CNE could be combined with such inferred structural properties increases its potential impact though, and this remark of the reviewer further underscores the need for methods such as CNE that can take such structural information into account.\n\nThe boost in accuracy achieved by CNE, using a model that is arguably also a lot simpler than the state-of-the-art network embedding approaches, is thus achieved without any increased need for hand-engineering."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper213/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper213/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper213/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Conditional Network Embeddings", "abstract": "Network Embeddings (NEs) map the nodes of a given network into $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^d$.
