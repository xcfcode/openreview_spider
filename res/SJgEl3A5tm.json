We will add it to our final version. We did have cited a similar paper[2] which also aims to physically perturb the stop-sign detectors. We will be glad to discuss the differences between our work and [1,2]. The discussion will also facilitate the other readers to understand the motivation of our paper better.\n\nGood physical camouflages are supposed to fail object detectors for any images taken about the camouflaged object under all conditions: object-to-camera distance, background, lighting condition, view angle, etc. When we formalize the problem and try to optimize with respect to the camouflage, however, the \u201cimaging function\u201d which transforms the camouflage to camouflaged object and eventually various images is unknown. Hence, the key challenge to learning the physical camouflage is how to tackle this unknown imaging function. \n\nBoth[1] and [2] perturb the detectors of stop signs which are planar objects whose images, under changes in camera geometry, are related by linear 2D projective transformations.  This is in contrast to non-planar objects (e.g., a car) whose images are related by more complex range-dependent nonlinear transformations. Hence, [1,2] are able to simplify such imaging function to projective transformations (cf. Section 4.2.2 in [1] and Section 4.1 in[2]) without breaking the gradient chain between the perturbation and the detector' output score. Complex nonlinear transformations, however, require a dedicated 3D simulation, for instance the one used in our paper. The 3D simulation breaks the gradient chain and turns the problem into a black-box optimization problem. In short, the non-planar objects break [1,2]'s premise since the approaches therein rely on functions that are differentiable with respect to the camouflage.\n\n\n[1] Song, Dawn, Kevin Eykholt, Ivan Evtimov, Earlence Fernandes, Bo Li, Amir Rahmati, Florian Tramer, Atul Prakash, and Tadayoshi Kohno. \"Physical adversarial examples for object detectors.\" In 12th {USENIX} Workshop on Offensive Technologies ({WOOT} 18). 2018.\n[2] Chen, Shang-Tse, Cory Cornelius, Jason Martin, and Duen Horng Chau. \"Robust Physical Adversarial Attack on Faster R-CNN Object Detector.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.05810 (2018)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1065/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1065/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1065/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CAMOU: Learning Physical Vehicle Camouflages to Adversarially Attack Detectors in the Wild", "abstract": "In this paper, we conduct an intriguing experimental study about the physical adversarial attack on object detectors in the wild.

We will address your concerns one by one.\n\nQ: the fact that this is done in the simulation is understandable but to some degree negates the authors\u2019 point that physicality matters because it is harder than images. How effective is learned camouflage in reality? It would be great to get at least some evidence of this.\n\nA: Unfortunately, we do not have any concrete evidence yet. We did have the same concern and have studied two potential solutions: 3D print and hydrographics. We will try to include them in the future work.\n\n\nQ: if the sim-2-real gap is too big it is not clear how this approach could ever be feasibly employed in the real world. Some intuition here would add value.\n\nA: The simulation-to-real gap is bounded by the baseline results in some sense: painting the car bodies using some popular colors, the detection rate is about 75% (mIoU). Additionally, there are two immediate strategies, due to our empirical findings in this work, to improve the camouflage robustness for the purpose of real-world use.\n1) More transformations. The original expectation-over-transformation [1] was proposed to solve the exact question: How do we generalize the simulated perturbation to the physical world? They show that providing more transformations leads to better simulation-to-real generalization. This is verified by our experiments of generalizing from the training locations to the previously unseen test locations, especially the transfer from the urban environment to the mountain environment. In the experiments of [1], the authors learn a perturbation applied onto the surface of a turtle in simulation against the classifier in different view angles. They find that, if sufficient view angles are presented, the perturbation also works on the surface of real-world 3D printed turtles against the classifier. \n2) Direct physical optimization. What we proposed is a generic framework for learning a vehicle camouflage to fail detectors. This framework can be readily applied to the physical world as well. One can replace our simulated transformations with physical ones. For example, we can update the physical camouflage on a real car by either painting the car body or cover it by electrochromic materials [2]. After that, we may choose some representative locations and set up cameras, take pictures at different time window, annotate them, send them to the detector for evaluation, and subsequently minimize the loss. We note this is certainly feasible although it incurs significant financial costs. \n\n[1] Athalye, Anish, and Ilya Sutskever. \"Synthesizing robust adversarial examples.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.07397 (2017).\n[2] Mortimer, Roger J., David R. Rosseinsky, and Paul MS Monk, eds. Electrochromic materials and devices. John Wiley & Sons, 2015.\n\n\nQ: the approach presented critically hinges on the quality of the clone network. Some analysis of the robustness of the approach with respect to network performance would add value.\n\nA: Thanks for the suggestion. We have studied the camouflage quality vs. the number of simulation called in Appendix E in our paper. The plots show that as more new samples join, the clone network behaves more and more like the V_t() and hence generates better camouflages. This suggests that new camouflages help the clone network to calibrate and hence the alternative optimization is necessary.\n\n\nQ: The three failure modes triggered and discussed are intuitive. But are there any insights available as to what aspect of the camouflages triggers these behaviors in the object detectors? This could also add significant value.\n\nA: Thank you for this suggestion. We acknowledge that the neural network\u2019s explainability and interpretability are an independent and challenging research topic [1]. State-of-the-art work [2] also focuses on training interpretable model instead of interpreting the existing models. The region-based networks are even harder to interpret given they yield structured predictions. We partially address this concern by visualizing the gradient heatmap of the best detector's classification score w.r.t. the input image. We found that the detector places its attention predominantly on the upper car body, i.e. roof, hood, windows, and trunk. This explains that our camouflage works better for the front view and rear view since trunk and hood camouflages are more visible. The camouflage is less effective for the side views where the detector places its attention on uncamouflaged windows. The visualization and detailed analysis have been added to the text.\n\n[1] Zhang, Quan-shi, and Song-Chun Zhu. \"Visual interpretability for deep learning: a survey.\" Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering 19.1 (2018): 27-39.\n[2] Zhang, Quanshi, Ying Nian Wu, and Song-Chun Zhu. \"Interpretable convolutional neural networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.00935 2.3 (2017): 5.\n\n\nQ: - eqs 1, 2 & 3: min_* should be argmin_*\n\nA: We have revised it."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1065/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1065/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1065/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CAMOU: Learning Physical Vehicle Camouflages to Adversarially Attack Detectors in the Wild", "abstract": "In this paper, we conduct an intriguing experimental study about the physical adversarial attack on object detectors in the wild.

We transfer and test the single camouflage under different detectors, across different locations of an environment, and in two different environments.

We will answer your questions and comments one by one.\n\nQ: Isn't there any other state of the art methods to compare with?\n\nA: Some of the existing works are closely related to ours but they are not directly applicable to our problem set, to the best of our knowledge. They are not applicable mainly due to two characteristics of our problem: 1) we aim to learn a single camouflage for the vehicle under a variety of transformations (location, camera view angle, lighting, etc.), and 2) many modules (painting the camouflage to the car body, photographing it, etc.) prevent the flow of gradients.\nTwo blackbox attack methods [1] and [2] are especially relevant to ours. [1] trains a substitution network to mimic the behavior of the blackbox model to be attacked. However, their work requires the gradients to flow between the image and the perturbation. This requirement is not met in our problem because it is hard to use an analytic function to describe how the camouflage is converted to an image of the vehicle. [2] relies on accurate single time gradient estimation. However, randomness is inevitable (and is indeed implemented by the simulator) when we paint the camouflage to the car, drive it to different locations, take picture of the vehicle, etc.\n\n[1]Papernot, Nicolas, et al. \"Practical black-box attacks against machine learning.\" Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security.

ACM, 2017.\n\n\nQ: Is the simulator used CARLA? Or is a new one? Where are the 3D assets extracted from?\n\nA: We build the simulated environments ourselves upon AirSim (https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim). CARLA was one of our candidates when we started this project. However, we soon found that AirSim offers more flexible configurations and essential functionalities for our need. We took advantage of many of AirSim\u2019s features and also implemented new features such as the external cameras, dynamic materials, texture communication via rpyc, etc. We purchased some 3D assets (e.g., Camry and the urban environment). \n\n\nQ: Two methods are proposed but I only find results for one.\n\nA: The two key techniques jointly make it possible to learn a single camouflage to physically fail the detectors. Please see Figure 4 for an illustration of the unified framework.

Not clear it will scale to real-world applications.", "review": "The authors investigate the problem of learning a camouflage pattern which, when applied to a simulated vehicle, will prevent an object detector from detecting it. The problem is frames as finding the camouflage pattern which minimises the expected decision scores from the detector over a distribution of possible views of this pattern applied to a vehicle (e.g. vantage point, background, etc). This expectation is approximated by sampling detector scores when applying the detector considered to images synthesised using a number of vantage points and scene contexts. In order to generate a gradient signal with respect to the camouflage applied (the simulated image rendering is non-differentiable) the approach considers learning a clone network which takes as input the camouflage pattern, the vehicle model and a given environment and outputs the vehicle detector\u2019s devision values. The clone network and the optimal camouflage are learned alternately in order to obtain a relatively faithful approximation. The approach is evaluated in simulation using two standard object detectors (Mask R-CNN and YOLOv3) on two vehicle models over a range of transformations.\n\nPros:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n- interesting challenge\n\n- the clone network provides an interesting solution to the challenge of having a (non-differentiable) simulator in the loop.\n\nCons:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n- the fact that this is done in simulation is understandable but to some degree negates the authors\u2019 point that physicality matters because it is harder than images. How effective is a learned camouflages in reality? It would be great to get at least some evidence of this.\n\n- if the sim-2-real gap is too big it is not clear how this approach could ever be feasibly employed in the real world. Some intuition here would add value.\n\n- the approach presented critically hinges on the quality of the clone network. Some analysis of robustness of the approach with respect to network performance would add value.\n\n- little is offered in terms of analysis of the camouflages generated. The three failure modes triggered and discussed are intuitive. But are there any insights available as to what aspect of the camouflages triggers these behaviours in the object detectors? This could also add significant value.\n\nIn summary, this work addresses an interesting problem but it is not clear how impactful the approach will be in real-world settings and hence how significant it it. Some of the more technically interesting aspects of the submission (e.g. the quality of the clone network, any learning derived from the camouflages generated) are not explored. \n\nMisc comments: \n- equs 1, 2 & 3: min_* should be argmin_*\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1065/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CAMOU: Learning Physical Vehicle Camouflages to Adversarially Attack Detectors in the Wild", "abstract": "In this paper, we conduct an intriguing experimental study about the physical adversarial attack on object detectors in the wild.

As AI starts to be present everywhere, more and more people can start to try to attack those systems. Critical systems such as security systems are the ones that can suffer more from those attacks. In this paper the case of vehicles that attack an object detection system by trying to not be detected are tackled.\n\nThe proposed system is trained and evaluated in a simulation environment. A set of possible camouflage patterns are proposed and the system learns how to setup those in the cars to reduce the performance of the detection system. Two methods are proposed. Those methods are based on Expectation over transformation method. This method requires the simulator to be differentiable which is not the case with Unity/Unreal environments. The methods proposed skip the need of the simulator to be differentiable by approximating it with a neural network.\n\nThe obtained results reduce the effectivity of the detection system. The methods are compared with two trivial baselines. Isn't there any other state of the art methods to compare with?\n\nThe paper is well written, the results are ok, the related work is comprehensive and the formulation is correct.
