We've added additional experimental results and reworked the relevant sections of the paper in response to the reviewer feedback.\n\n- Q1 Noise model \nWe believe that the simple Gaussian noise model used in the paper is a good approach to modeling real analog hardware systems, which has been confirmed previously in \"Accurate deep neural network inference using computational phase-change memory\"(https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03138)  by Joshi et al. Their experiments show (Fig 3c in Joshi et al.) that very similar measured accuracy can be achieved when weights trained with the Gaussian noise model are transferred to the actual hardware. And in fact, we are already considering modeling of key circuit blocks such as digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters within our formulation of weight and activation quantization, which we've emphasized in Section 3, paragraph 2.\n\nNonetheless, we do agree that robustness to spatially-varying or even time-varying noise models is a very interesting question. Therefore we have expanded the results in this regard by adding experiments with time-varying (temperature fluctuation) and spatially-varying (manufacturing process variation) noise models in Table 1 of Section 5.2 to broaden this aspect of the work.\n\nIn summary, we have found no significant deviation in these new experiments. The improvement from our proposed retraining method is quite consistent. We would like to thank the reviewer for suggesting these experiments which have strengthened the results of our paper. In addition to the new experimental results, we've also extended the discussion of some of the general challenges and considerations in modeling analog hardware non-idealities (Section 3).\n\n- Q2 Scaling of results over different network architectures\nWe also think this is an interesting question, so we expanded our results to provide some data. Following the reviewer's suggestion, we have added further experiments in Section 4.2 (Figure 2) to better understand the mutual information decay over both wider and deeper neural network architectures. We have also added more results in the Appendix (Figure 6) showing how our method compares to pure noise injection on different network architectures. Our results suggest that the improvement does not diminish for larger networks given the same dataset. Larger networks can be either more susceptible to noise or less so, depending on their architectures (see discussion in Section 4.2). To obtain the same amount of uplift from our method, one may need to go to lower or higher noise levels depending on the architectures.\n\nThe reviewer's observation that the benefit is less pronounced on ImageNet than on CIFAR10 is likely due to the nature of the dataset itself. As the reviewer has pointed out, ImageNet is a more difficult task, even without noise. The reason we reported relatively low noise levels on ImageNet experiments is because the accuracy degradation is already quite significant compared to the CIFAR10 cases. From a practical application point of view, pushing to even higher noise levels is arguably less interesting. Nevertheless, we understand the request for higher noise levels on ImageNet experiments. We are currently running more experiments on ImageNet. Given the short time-frame of rebuttal, we don't have the results quite yet (also more training epochs are needed for higher noise levels). We will incorporate the results in our paper as they come out.\n\n- Q3 Open sourcing code examples\nFinally, we do plan to open source code used in the paper.\nWe are currently working through an internal legal approval process to do so, but are confident we will be able to have it online before the conference.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1062/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1062/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["chu.zhou@arm.com", "pkadambi@asu.edu", "matthew.mattina@arm.com", "paul.whatmough@arm.com"], "title": "Noisy Machines: Understanding noisy neural networks and enhancing robustness to analog hardware errors using distillation", "authors": ["Chuteng Zhou", "Prad Kadambi", "Matthew Mattina", "Paul N.

Instead of waiting for practical analog hardware to become available, we think that research in the ML community can advance the practicality of analog neural networks. We've also noticed that this topic falls between the ML and hardware communities, but think that the ML community can contribute significantly in this area. As other reviewers have remarked, this is a new area for the ML community and many are probably unaware of the interesting ML challenges posed by analog neural networks. We hope to motivate other ML work in this direction. Analog deep learning hardware is a complex system level challenge and requires a system level solution. We don't claim to solve all the challenges in this one paper but rather we have carved out a well-defined ML problem from the broader challenge and presented a novel solution to it, we hope this paper can be a first step in building understanding and interest in the topic amongst the broader ML community.

We've added additional experimental results and reworked the relevant sections of the paper in response to the reviewer feedback.\n\n- Q1 Correlated noise models\nThe question of changes in the noise model as the system warms up is a good one and another reviewer was also interested in this. It is our understanding that system warming up is less likely to result in statistical correlation between weight noise but rather spatially inhomogeneous noise levels. For example, if the center of an analog chip heats up more than its edges, the NVM cells at the center may have a higher noise level than the ones close to the edges.\n\nWe have expanded the discussion of these non-idealities in Section 3, and we have also expanded the results in this regard by adding experiments with time-varying (temperature or supply voltage fluctuation) and spatially-varying (manufacturing process variation or temperature inhomogeneity due to warming up) noise models in Table 1 of Section 5.2 to broaden this aspect of the work. The spatially-varying noise model is effective non i.i.d.\n\nIn summary, we have found no significant deviation in these new experiments. The improvement from our proposed retraining method remains quite consistent. Nonetheless, we would like to thank the reviewer for suggesting these experiments which have strengthened the results of our paper.\n\n- Q2 Analog performance scaling with network depth\nWe also thought this was interesting and, again, another reviewer (#1) asked about this too.\nFollowing the reviewer's suggestion, we have added further experiments in Section 4.2 (Figure 2) to better understand the mutual information / model accuracy decay over both wider and deeper neural network architectures. We have also added more results in the Appendix (Figure 6) showing how our method compares to pure noise injection on different network architectures. We're grateful for the feedback, as these additional experiments have increased our understanding of the impact of analog noise on neural network performance.\nWe are also interested in the performance of analog RNNs, but we feel this is beyond the scope of this paper, but we are planning to look at this for future work.\n\n- Q3 Lacking non-obvious results\nFinally, regarding non-obvious results, we think that this paper is a first step in starting to understand the behavior of analog neural networks. As other reviewers have remarked, this is a new area for the ML community, and we think that many are probably not aware of the interest around analog hardware for neural networks. Therefore, this paper serves an important role, not only in introducing the ML community to the challenges of designing and training models that are robust to analog noise, but at the same time outlining an approach that achieves state-of-the-art results. Additionally, our retraining approach of combining noise injection and distillation is indeed novel as other reviewers have remarked. We have also broadened the experiments around the noise model, providing results to support our choice of noise modeling. We believe this line of work could really make deployment of analog neural network hardware possible and hope to motivate other ML work in this direction. In that regard, we hope this paper can be a first step in building understanding and interest in the topic amongst the broader ML community.

This is an important topic because analog devices allow fast and energy efficient inference, which is crucial for inference at the edge. Because of their analog nature such devices suffer from noisy computations, and in this article the case of noisy weights is studied. \n\nThe main contributions of this article are the following:\n- an analysis of the performance loss in noisy networks by means of information theory and empirical results\n- the idea of combining noise injection during training with knowledge distillation\n- experimental evidence for a LeNet5 on MNIST, CIFAR10, and ResNet-50 on ImageNet\n\nIt has been shown in the literature that noise injection during training is an effective way to increase the noise robustness of neural networks. Relevant literature in this domain is cited. The novelty of the approach is to combine noise injection with distillation, by using the noise-free network as a teacher for the noisy network, which is initialized with the weights of the teacher. This is a novel variant of distillation and sounds like a simple to implement trick with beneficial results for increasing noise resiliency of networks. It is also proposed and shown that the method works for quantized networks.\n\nThe experimental results show that the combination of distillation and noise injection outperforms pure noise injection on all networks, as well as noisy inference without retraining. The effect is even more pronounced for quantized networks.\n\n* Evaluation *\nOverall I like this paper and think it is suitable to accept for ICLR, because it addresses an important practical problem of implementing deep networks on efficient hardware. The paper is well written and simple to understand and should be easy to implement (it would really help here providing code for the examples though). To the best of my knowledge I have not seen precisely this combination of noise injection and distillation, although there is a lot of literature about each individual approach. I appreciate that the authors made an effort to not just show empirical results but also motivate their findings by theory, although the argumentation stays a bit superficial.\n\nWhat I am mainly missing are two points:\n1. The assumed noise model of i.i.D. Gaussian weights is the simplest possible, and might deviate quite a bit in actual analog hardware. I would have liked to see a noise model that is derived from actual hardware observations, or maybe even a prototype implementation in hardware, such as was done e.g. in Binas et al. 2016. At the very least I would suggest to test the model on other noise models, including temporally changing noise levels, which could be a realistic scenario due to temperature fluctuations or other events.\n\n2. The experimental results focus on MNIST, CIFAR10, and later briefly on ImageNet. While the results are quite convincing on MNIST and CIFAR, these are easier datasets with usually well separable classes, so the effect of noisy inference might not be as pronounced, as in datasets with more confusion even in the clean case. In the case of ImageNet (Table 1) it looks like the difference to pure noise injection is not as big as it was in the CIFAR case, but here also only lower noise levels were tested. I would recommend testing also the same noise range as for CIFAR to understand whether distillation always shows the desired benefits, or if this is a diminishing effect for larger networks. Overall it would help to understand how the effect scales with network depth, e.g. by comparing the information loss for different ResNet depths.\n\nI'm giving weak accept and would change to accept if there could be clarification on how the approach scales to different network architectures and noise models closer to actual hardware. I also recommend publishing some example code for this approach."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1062/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1062/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["chu.zhou@arm.com", "pkadambi@asu.edu", "matthew.mattina@arm.com", "paul.whatmough@arm.com"], "title": "Noisy Machines: Understanding noisy neural networks and enhancing robustness to analog hardware errors using distillation", "authors": ["Chuteng Zhou", "Prad Kadambi", "Matthew Mattina", "Paul N.

This is a very important topic as neural network based inference becomes uobiqutous and is required to run with very low power consumption and latency.\n\nThe manuscipt considers a system where the values of the neural network weights and biases are experiencing i.i.d Gaussian noise, which is a pretty good assumptions. However, in heavy use the system may warm up, and then there could be an effect that is correlated accross different weights. The noise model used would not be able to ensure proper inference in these conditions. I would like to see a discussion on the effect of correlations in the injected noise.\n\nThe mutual information is considered and evaluated for a the \"noisy\" and \"clean\" versions and the result is according to expectations. The some degree, I do not see this part very valuable, as it does not bring any particular insights on the analog neural network operation. Rather I woudl like to see how, the analog performance under noise scales as the neural has  more layers.  Also, the noise behavior of an analog RNN woudl be very interesting.\n\nThe authors have detected that even, if the neural network trainded without noise is not robust when the weigths fluctuate, the trained network is a good starting point for transfer learning. To some degree I do not find this to be a very inventive step as transfer learning has shown to able to cross much larger training data set alterations.\n\nGood solid work, but lacking non-obvious results, and I do not see manuscript adressing the the harder challenges.
