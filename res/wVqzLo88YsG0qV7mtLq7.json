The idea is that after training each model independently, we compute the error rate achieved by the discriminator of one model against the generator of the other model, and use this error rate to compare the models.\n\nPros:\n=====\n1) This paper tries to solve the important problem of evaluating generative models.\n\n2) I think the idea of the paper is interesting for comparing different models trained with GAN framework.\n\n\nCons:\n=====\n1) I don't think this idea is applicable to any other generative model such as VAE. The discriminator of GAN typically is good at detecting sharp edges and local structure, which is why the generator of GAN always learn to generate sharp images. However, as opposed to GAN, the generated images of VAE are often blurry images which contain some global structure. So I think it would be very hard for the VAE generator to fool a GAN discriminator into thinking that the image is real. So it would not be fair to use this evaluation method to compare a GAN model with a VAE one.\n\n2) This paper seems to be a copied section of an ICML submission by the same authors with no additional contribution.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"CMT_id": "", "title": "Generative Adversarial Metric", "abstract": "We introduced a new metric for comparing adversarial networks quantitatively.
