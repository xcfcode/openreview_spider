While I learned something about the evolution of the Hessian (in the limit of the infinitely wide NN),  I can not say that this paper will have significant impact on how I think about NN training. \n\nTo address this issue of significance and impact: What novel conclusions about Neural Network learning dynamics can you draw from your analysis?

The introduction of the NTK has indeed shown that the dynamics of DNNs is asymptotically approximated by their linearizations around initialization; if we were to follow that picture naively, however, we would get that the matrix S is zero, which we show is not the case. So, while we keep *an exact description*, we are able to show a *nontrivial difference between very wide DNNs and their linear (kernelized) approximations* during the training. \n\nThis difference can also be used to understand the cross-over between the linear/kernel regime and the so-called \"active\" regime (this is discussed in response to reviewer #2): we observe that in the linear regime the Fisher matrix I dominates the matrix S, while in the active regime, S becomes the dominant matrix (at initialization). Connecting our results with the empirical works on the Hessian is hence a way to determine what is the regime in which they are taking place. \n\nThe analysis moreover leads us to the following insights:\n\n1. The vanishing of the residual S in operator norm but not in Frobenius norm at initialization.\n\n2. The spectrum of S is not exactly symmetric because its first moment does not vanish in contrast to the observations of [Pennington and Bahri].\n\n3.

The framework in which we consider the neural networks will be made clearer: in particular, we will mention it in the abstract and in the introduction. \n\nRemark that our results shed new light also on the overparametrized active/mean-field training at initialization. We will add a discussion on how some of our results can be applied to the active regime at initialization. This regime is achieved by dividing the output of the network by the squared root of the width \\sqrt(w). Multiplying the learning rate by w, the matrix I is not changed, whereas S is scaled by \\sqrt(w). As a result, our theorems provide a full description of I and the asymptotic of the two first moments of S in the active regime (which are the same up to the new scaling). We observe that the moments of S dominate those of I. This could be a characteristic of the active regime: the \"residual\" matrix dominates the Fisher matrix. \n\nWe regret not to have mentioned this aspect in the paper and are happy to add a discussion in the final version.\n\n* In [Pennington and Bahri] they take the second derivative of the ReLU to be zero, hence almost reducing the analysis to linear networks. One of the difference is that a non-zero second derivative leads to a non-zero first moment of S. Also, in their setting they conjecture the free independence of the two matrices I and S, whereas we can prove the asymptotic mutual orthogonality of the two matrices.\n\n* We mentioned [Chaudhari et al.] for their observations that the Hessian retains negative eigenvalues even after a very long training, in our setting this appears to be related to the existence of negative eigenvalues of S, and the fact that the rank of I is much smaller than that of S. Given our results, this phenomenon can also happen in the linear regime.\n\nWe will change our wording: saying confirmation is too strong. It is more accurate to say that many empirical observations of the literature (for which it is difficult to assess in which regime they were obtained) are consistent with our theoretical results in the linear regime."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper720/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper720/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The asymptotic spectrum of the Hessian of DNN throughout training", "authors": ["Arthur Jacot", "Franck Gabriel", "Clement Hongler"], "authorids": ["arthur.jacot@epfl.ch", "franck.gabriel@epfl.ch", "clement.hongler@epfl.ch"], "keywords": ["theory of deep learning", "loss surface", "training", "fisher information matrix"], "TL;DR": "Description of the limiting spectrum of the Hesian of the loss surface of DNNs in the infinite-width limit.", "abstract": "The dynamics of DNNs during gradient descent is described by the so-called Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK).

We intend to carry out a more systematic study of this family of tensors: the generalization to other architectures would be clearer in this broader setting."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper720/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper720/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The asymptotic spectrum of the Hessian of DNN throughout training", "authors": ["Arthur Jacot", "Franck Gabriel", "Clement Hongler"], "authorids": ["arthur.jacot@epfl.ch", "franck.gabriel@epfl.ch", "clement.hongler@epfl.ch"], "keywords": ["theory of deep learning", "loss surface", "training", "fisher information matrix"], "TL;DR": "Description of the limiting spectrum of the Hesian of the loss surface of DNNs in the infinite-width limit.", "abstract": "The dynamics of DNNs during gradient descent is described by the so-called Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK).

There is no question that the subject is relevant, and the paper gives an interesting contribution to the problem.  I do support publication.\n\nMy main criticism is in the presentation of the paper: The title and the first pages are, I believe, really misleading. Unless I am missing an important point, all derivation of the papers are being made in the so-called NTK regime. In fact, this is explicitly stated in page 3 \"In the limit we study in this paper, the NTK is fixed\". While this is an interesting assumption, this is by no mean a trivial one that should be stated casually in the middle of the paper. This is an extremely strong assumption (essentially, one is either in the lazy Regime of [Chizat&Bach] with infinity small learning rate, or in the kernel regime of [Jacot&al] with astronomically large layers. This is a nice setting for mathematics, but by no means a natural one and this limits drastically the conclusion of the paper: what is studied is the behavior of the DNN in the \"Kernel\" regime, or the \"Lazy\" regime. Such a limitation should be explicitly mentioned, at least in the abstract and the introduction, if not in the title itself! It should, also, be mentioned in the conclusion (\"We have given an explicit formula for the limiting moments of the Hessian of DNNs throughout training\"). \n\nIn this respect, with the connection to the Kernel, it make sense that the Hessian is dominated by, essentially, the equivalent of Kernel PCA! This is to be expected, since one is essentially doing a Kernel Ridge Regression with random features.\n\nOther source of confusion (for me):\n* \"This is contrast to the results obtained in [Pennington&Bahri] etc....\" Is the only difference the fact that the network is more than two layers? \n* \"This gives theoretical confirmation of a number of observations about the Hessian\"... I do not believe all these references are in the NTK regimes. (e.g. Chaudhari et al., for instance). \n\nThat being said, the paper is a nice and interesting contribution to the NTK regime, that is the subject of intense studies currently. I do support acceptance if the paper clarify the range of applicability of the its results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper720/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper720/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The asymptotic spectrum of the Hessian of DNN throughout training", "authors": ["Arthur Jacot", "Franck Gabriel", "Clement Hongler"], "authorids": ["arthur.jacot@epfl.ch", "franck.gabriel@epfl.ch", "clement.hongler@epfl.ch"], "keywords": ["theory of deep learning", "loss surface", "training", "fisher information matrix"], "TL;DR": "Description of the limiting spectrum of the Hesian of the loss surface of DNNs in the infinite-width limit.", "abstract": "The dynamics of DNNs during gradient descent is described by the so-called Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK).

For understanding neural network\u2019s optimization and generalization property, understanding Hessian spectrum is quite important. \nThis paper gives explicit formula for limiting moments of Hessian of wide neural networks throughout training. \n\nIn detail, Hessian of neural networks can be decomposed into two components, denoted by H = I + S. In the infinite width I is totally described by NTK, and authors show that I and S are asymptotically orthogonal (both at initialization and during training).  Residual contribution is described by S, which captures evolution of Hessian by its first moments Tr (S) since Tr (S^2) remains constant and Tr (S^k ) for k>=3 vanishes. \n\nCorollary 1 has analytic dynamics of moment of Hessian in the case of MSE loss demonstrating power of this paper\u2019s main Theorem.  This is also supported by experiments in Figure 1. \n\nfew comments:\nAuthors should follow format given by ICLR style file. The paper is more dense than typical submission and may have violated page limit (10 pages max) if the style guide line was followed. \nSimilar to the prior comment, the reference section should be cleaned and formatted better. The reference doesn\u2019t count towards page limit and I don\u2019t understand the reason for them to be formatted badly and become eligible. \nIt would be useful if the Figure axes are more legible. \nThere have been many variations of NTK beyond vanilla FC networks(Arora et al. 2019, Yang 2019).
