Our GAN hyper-parameter tuning was *not* done in a per environment basis and our tuned hyper-parameters were shared across all the experiments. Therefore, due to computation limit, we chose to report the results with LSGAN that has the least number of hyper-parameters to tune (and in fact the hyper-parameters from the original paper worked fine, and we did not try others). \nMore precisely, when trying the other GAN methods, they would sometimes fit less accurately one \"good goals\" distribution (probably improvable with better initial tuning).

Or are we talking about merely incremental improvements?\n\nIn essence, which  of the following two statements is more true:\n\na) When using GAN for automatic goal generation it is essential to tune the hyperparameter (such as which loss function is used (standard, WGAN, etc), for it to be robust.  \n\nb) Our approach does work reliably with any type of adversarial method (and you made some good arguments why to use them in this situation).   To show the best results,  we used WGAN in our experiments. \n\n\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Automatic Goal Generation for Reinforcement Learning Agents", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful technique to train an agent to perform a task.

A goal is defined as a subset of the state space. The authors claim that this model can discover all \"goals\" in the environment and their 'difficulty', which can be measured by the success rate / reward of the policy. Hence the goal network could learn a form of curriculum, where a goal is 'good' if it is a state that the policy can reach after a (small) improvement of the current policy.\n\nTraining the goal GAN is done via labels, which are states together with the achieved reward by the policy that is being learned.\n\nThe benchmark problems are whether the GAN generates goals that allow the agent to reach the end of a U-maze, and a point-mass task.\n\nAuthors compare GAN goal generation vs uniformly choosing a goal and 2 other methods.\n\nMy overall impression is that this work addresses an interesting question, but the experimental setup / results are not clearly worked out. More broadly, the paper does not address how one can combine RL and training a goal GAN in a stable way.\n\nPro:\n- Developing hierarchical learning methods to improve the sample complexity of RL is an important problem.\n- The paper shows that the U-maze can be 'solved' using a variety of methods that generate goals in a non-uniform way.\n\nCon:\n- It is not clear to me how the asymmetric self-play and SAGG-RIAC are implemented and why they are natural baselines.\n- It is not clear to me what the 'goals' are in the point mass experiment. This entire experiment should be explained much more clearly (+image).\n- It is not clear how this method compares qualitatively vs baselines (differences in goals etc).\n- This method doesn't seem to always outperform the asymm-selfplay baseline. The text mentions that baseline is less efficient, but this doesn't make the graph very interpretable.\n- The curriculum in the maze-case consists of regions that just progress along the maze, and hence is a 1-dimensional space. Hence using a manually defined set of goals should work quite well. It would be better to include such a baseline as well.\n- The experimental maze-setting and point-mass have a simple state / goal structure. How can this method generalize to harder problems?\n-- The entire method is quite complicated (e.g. training GANs can be highly unstable). How do we stabilize / balance training the GAN vs the RL problem?\n-- I don't see how this method could generalize to problems where the goals / subregions of space do not have a simple distribution as in the maze problem, e.g. if there are multiple ways of navigating a maze towards some final goal state. In that case, to discover a good solution, the generated goals should focus on one alternative and hence the GAN should have a unimodal distribution. How do you force the GAN in a principled way to focus on one goal in this case? How could you combine RL and training the GAN stably in that case?\n\nDetailed:\n- (2) is a bit strange: shouldn't the indicator say: 1( \\exists t: s_t \\in S^g )? Surely not all states in the rollout (s_0 ... s_t) are in the goal subspace: the indicator does not factorize over the union. Same for other formulas that use \\union.\n- Are goals overlapping or non-overlapping subsets of the state space? \nDefinition around (1) basically says it's non-overlapping, yet the goal GAN seems to predict goals in a 2d space, hence the predicted goals are overlapping? \n- What are the goals that the non-uniform baselines predict? Does the GAN produce better goals?\n- Generating goal labels is\n- Paper should discuss literature on hierarchical methods that use goals learned from data and via variational methods:\n1.

They use a generator network to propose tasks for the agent accomplish. The generator network is trained with GAN.  In addition, the proposed method is also shown to be able to solve tasks with sparse rewards without the need manually modify reward functions. They compare the Goal GAN method with four baselines, including Uniform sampling, Asymmetric Self-play, SAGG-RIAC, and Rejection sampling. The proposed method is tested on two environments: Free Ant and Maze Ant. The empirical study shows that the proposed method is able to improve policies\u2019 training efficiency comparing to these baselines. The technical contributions seem sound, however I find it is slightly difficult to fully digest the whole paper without getting the insight from each individual piece and there are some important details missing, as I will elaborate more below.\n\n1. it is unclear to me why the proposed method is able to solve tasks with sparse rewards? Is it because of the horizons of the problems considered are not long enough? The author should provide more insight for this contribution.\n\n2. It is unclear to me how R_min and R_max as hyperparameters are obtained and how their settings affect the performance.\n\n3. Another concern I have is regarding the generalizability of the proposed method. One of the assumption is \u201cA policy trained on a sufficient number of goals in some area of the goal-space will learn to interpolate to other goals within that area\u201d. This seems to mean that the area is convex. It might be better if some quantitative analysis can be provided to illustrate geometry of goal space (given complex motor coordination) that is feasible for the proposed method.\n\n4. It is difficult to understand the plots in Figure 4 without more details. Do you assume for every episode, the agent starts from the same state? \n\n5. For the plots in Figure 2, is there any explanation for the large variance for Goal GAN? Given that the state space is continuous, 10 runs seems not enough.\n\n6. According to the experimental details, three rollouts are performed to estimate the empirical return. It there any justification why three rollouts are enough?\n\n7.

We summarize here the most relevant findings in this other work. Asymmetric Self-Play relies on an agent \u201cAlice\u201d proposing goals.  However, in a continuous action space, Alice is typically represented as a unimodal Gaussian policy.  Thus, rather than proposing a diverse set of goals, Alice will tend to propose goals in a small cluster around the mean of the Gaussian that represents Alice\u2019s policy.  In contrast, our Goal GAN can produce goals to match an arbitrary goal distribution, giving our method much more flexibility and leading to improved performance.\n\nFurthermore, because Asymmetric Self-play uses a goal generation agent (\u201cAlice\u201d) that is trained with reinforcement learning, the goal generator can suffer from the problem of sparse rewards when Bob makes a large improvement relative to Alice.  This instability is also described in (Florensa et al., 2017).\n\nThe goals generated by SAGG-RIAC can be seen in Figures 9 and 10 in the appendix of our paper.  As explained in Section 5.1 of our paper, \u201cSAGG-RIAC maintains an ever-growing partition of the goal-space that becomes more and more biased towards areas that already have more sub-regions, leading to reduced exploration and slowing down the expansion of the policy\u2019s capabilities.\u201d"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Automatic Goal Generation for Reinforcement Learning Agents", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful technique to train an agent to perform a task.

We have added these observations in the paper without additional details as it is not the focus of our work. As is stated in Section 4.2, all results shown in our paper, across a number of different environments, use the LSGAN with the original hyperparameters reported in Mao et al. 2017.

In the following we answer one by one the questions, and we detail the clarifications made in the paper wherever needed.\n\n1. Our proposed method is able to solve tasks with sparse rewards without modifying the reward function by automatically generating a curriculum over tasks. As our Problem Definition (Sec. 3) states in the Overall Objective (Sec. 3.2), we are seeking a policy $\\pi^*(\\cdot | s_t, g)$ that can succeed at many goals $g$, each goal corresponding to a different task with its own sparse reward $r^g(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$. But, although all tasks have a sparse reward, they are not all of the same difficulty! In particular, reaching a goal nearby the starting position is very easy, and can be performed even by the randomly initialized policy. Then, once the policy has learned to  reach the nearby goals (in our navigation settings, it implies having learned some basic locomotor skills), it can bootstrap this acquired knowledge to attempt more complex (further away) goals. As explained in our Goal Labeling (Sec 4.1), our method strives to sample goals always of  \u201cintermediate difficulty\u201d $g: R_{\\min} \\leq R^g(\\pi_i) \\leq R_{\\max}$. This means that our method will always be sampling goals such that training on them is efficient (i.e. our policy is able to receive a sufficient amount of reward such that it can improve its performance), despite their sparse reward structure. If no curriculum is applied, a prohibitively long time-horizon would be needed for the policy to learn to reach  the far away goals. Furthermore, many goals are actually infeasible, and no matter the time-horizon they always receive a reward of 0. Our method minimizes wasting rollouts trying to reach such goals because they do not satisfy our condition $R_{\\min} \\leq R^g(\\pi_i)$.\n\n2. The hyperparameters R_min and R_max have a very clear probabilistic interpretation given in Sec. 4.1, based on  analyzing Eq. (2). R_min is the minimum success probability required to start training on a particular goal. R_max is the maximum success probability above which we prefer to concentrate training on new goals. In practice, as explained in Sec. 4.3 and Appendix C, we estimate $R^g(\\pi_i)$ with the rollouts collected by our RL algorithm. Therefore, each estimation is an average over two to five binary rewards (whether the rollout succeeded or not), meaning that the lowest numbers it can get are 0 or \u2155 and the highest are \u2158 or 1. In all our experiments we used R_min = 0.1 and R_max = 0.9, but given the above analysis any $R_min \\in ]0, 0.2[$ and $R_max \\in ]0.8, 1[$ would have yield exactly the same result. We have not experimented with values outside this range because it might not be of practical interest to not train on goals that are already achieved more than 20% of the time or have a policy succeeding less than 80% of the time on the goals it is given.\n\n3. Our assumptions do not imply convexity of the goal space. For example, we do provide quantitative analysis for the Ant-Maze environment, where we report an efficient learning of our method despite the geometry of the feasible goal space being U-shaped, as seen in Fig. 4 (we have updated the legend to more clearly identify the feasible goal space). Rather, the interpolation statement refers to the smoothness of the goal space with respect to the policy, i.e. the policy for reaching a specific goal that has not been sampled during training can be inferred from sampling a sufficient number nearby goals in the continuous goal space.  The extrapolation statement should be understood along the lines of the explanation given in our point 1. of this rebuttal: \u201conce the training policy is able to reach the nearby goals ... it can bootstrap this acquired knowledge to attempt more complex (further away) goals\u201d. This is a very reasonable assumption in many learning systems, robotics in particular.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Automatic Goal Generation for Reinforcement Learning Agents", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful technique to train an agent to perform a task.  However, an agent that is trained using RL is only capable of achieving the single task that is specified via its reward function.   Such an approach does not scale well to settings in which an agent needs to perform a diverse set of tasks, such as navigating to varying positions in a room or moving objects to varying locations.  Instead, we propose a method that allows an agent to automatically discover the range of tasks that it is capable of performing in its environment.  We use a generator network to propose tasks for the agent to try to achieve, each task being specified as reaching a certain parametrized subset of the state-space.  The generator network is optimized using adversarial training to produce tasks that are always at the appropriate level of difficulty for the agent.  Our method thus automatically produces a curriculum of tasks for the agent to learn.
