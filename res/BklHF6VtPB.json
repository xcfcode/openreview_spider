About optimal outputs: The supervised learning studied in the paper is different from a typical supervised setting (as commented in Review #3). Instead of real samples, the outputs are from a special projection obtained through matrix factorization.\nThanks for the suggestion. Real training samples also exist in practice. For example, in multi-label classification (MLC), each output is a binary vector. These ground-truth vectors may be regarded as the optimal output representation. The performance of our proposed model in such MLC applications (http://mulan.sourceforge.net/datasets-mlc.html) may deserve our high attention.\n\n2. About scalability: Supervised-WTA is a special case of unsupervised-WTA, and we only consider the unsupervised setting here. As shown in Section 3.3, the complexity in each iteration is O((k+c)*d*n + d'*d*log(kc)). The complexity grows linearly with the number of samples n, which should be a reasonable requirement in big data applications.\n\nWe tested the algorithm on 10K/50K/100K/500K/1M ImageNet images (http://image-net.org/api/text/imagenet.sbow.obtain_synset_wordlist). When the hash length k=32, the training converged in ~3 minutes for n=10K, ~8 minutes for n=100K and ~100 minutes for n=1M images, which fit the complexity analysis quite well. The following two tables show the training time and testing accuracy.\n\n       n=10K/50K/100K/500K/1M\nk=2:   35.1/126.3/343.2/626.8/893.4\nk=4:   50.6/188.7/321.0/779.2/1030.5\nk=8:   79.3/286.3/376.4/920.0/1912.2\nk=16:  128.2/221.7/280.3/1428.0/2816.1\nk=32:  177.8/277.9/458.1/2674.4/6047.3\nUnsupervised-WTA training time (in seconds) on ImageNet with different number of training samples.

Finding top c entries from d elements: The 'Heapsort' algorithm can be applied with a complexity of d log(c) (Knuth 1997).\n\n2. Comparison with Fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss Projection (Ailon and Chazelle 2009, Bourgain et al. 2015): Thanks for suggesting the FJL model to us. In our experiments, FJL based projection reported accuracy highly comparable to LSH (ref. results below), yet with much faster retrieval speed than LSH.\n\n3. Comparison with PCA:\n-On speed:\nYes, PCA and unsupervised-WTA have comparable training complexity, both analytically and numerically, in computing the projection matrix. \nIn retrieval, sparse binary projections (FLY, WTA) are magnitude faster than dense projections (LSH, PCA), as reported in (Dasgupta et al. 2017), as well as faster than FJL projections.\n-On accuracy:\nSimilarity search accuracies with PCA based projections are reported below. The results of LSH/FLY/unsupervised-WTA are also copied here from the paper for easy comparison.\nWhen the hash length k is small (k=2/4/8), our WTA models have significantly better retrieval accuracies than PCA.

Existence of W: Our assumption of the projection matrix W is mostly motivated by biological evidences. Mathematically for arbitrarily given inputs X and outputs Y, the W may not exist. To address this difficulty, we designed a relaxed model in equation (3). Another potential approach is to borrow the idea of 'soft-margin' in the support vector machines algorithm, which only penalizes the violation samples. Comparatively, our model in equation (3) rewards the correct projections and penalizes the incorrect projections at the same time. \n\n2. Ground truth of Glove labels: We don't have the ground truth of Glove labels. Instead, we used the Y* (ref. paragraph 4 of page 7) as a kind of pseudo-labels, which were obtained through heavy matrix factorization and fine tuning to ensure X'X and Y'Y are close.\n\n3. About equation (3): As far as we know, equation (3) is new and firstly proposed in this paper.\n\n4. On choosing d': Biological evidences from the fruit fly suggest an example of d'=40*d. Our experience about this parameter is mostly empirical. The similarity search accuracy seems to be improved when increasing d', but not often significantly. In practice, we would recommend to set d' from 2*d to 20*d as a balance of the speed and representation quality."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper668/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper668/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Modeling Winner-Take-All Competition in Sparse Binary Projections", "authors": ["Wenye Li"], "authorids": ["wyli@cuhk.edu.cn"], "keywords": ["Sparse Representation", "Sparse Binary Projection", "Winner-Take-All"], "TL;DR": "We developed a Winner-Take-All model that learns a sparse binary representation for input samples, with significantly improved speed and accuracy.", "abstract": "Inspired by the advances in biological science, the study of sparse binary projection models has attracted considerable recent research attention.

This new paper seems to work much better than recent literature (and a lot faster than some), which is very encouraging. The derivation of the closed-form updates is clever and seems to be correct.  Overall, I am quite favorable for this paper.\n\nMy chief critical comment is that given the complexity of the model, is is feasible to compare to PCA-based projections as well. That is, usually PCA is not compared with these methods since a random projection method is faster. But this paper proposes data-dependent projection matrices, which is exactly what PCA does.  This paper has been implicitly assuming d << n and trying to avoid the O(n^2) cost of nearest neighbor search. Given that d << n, the complexity of the algorithm in the paper is, roughly (avoiding some logs), O((#iter) d^2 n ), since the constant \"c\" depends on d, and presumably d' also scales linearly with d. The (#iter) refers to the number of iterations of the alternating minimization. The actual constants are small, but it is still quadratic in d.  PCA takes O(d^2n + d^3) operations when d<n, so therefore PCA is of roughly the same complexity, and thus I'd expect you to compare to it in the numerical comparisons.\n\nWith a valid response to the issue of PCA, I would probably \"strongly accept\" this paper.\n\n(Another note on comparisons: it seems Johnson-Lindenstrauss projections would be applicable, so I'd suggest running a Fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss (Ailon and Chazelle) to compare with also).\n\nMinor notes:\n- In section 3.3, how do you get complexities like d log(c) for finding the top c entries? Please cite an algorithm textbook. I might be rusty on this, but the algorithms I can think of to do this are O(  min( d log(d), d c )) operations. Same for the  d' log(k).\n\n- A good number of sentences were grammatically incorrect or sounded awkward, e.g., paragraph 2, \"people's much attention\"; second sentence in section 2.2, the phrase \"; while the rest get inhibited and remain silent\" is not a complete phrase by itself (maybe change the semicolon to a comma).

The successful results give us strong confidence that the work provides a highly practical tool to real world applications.\n", "pdf": "/pdf/a3cfd4eeff773ab8befefe6418716c43a547cf06.pdf", "paperhash": "li|modeling_winnertakeall_competition_in_sparse_binary_projections", "original_pdf": "/attachment/a3cfd4eeff773ab8befefe6418716c43a547cf06.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nli2020modeling,\ntitle={Modeling Winner-Take-All Competition in Sparse Binary Projections},\nauthor={Wenye Li},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BklHF6VtPB}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
