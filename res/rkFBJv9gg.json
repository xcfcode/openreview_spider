Application of ML techniques to music have been limited due to scarcity of exactly the kind of data that is provided here: meticulously annotated, carefully verified and organized, containing enough \"hours\" of music, and where genre has been well constrained in order to allow for sufficient homogeneity in the data to help ensure usefulness. This is great for the community.\n\nThe description of the validation of the dataset is interesting, and indicates a careful process was followed.\n\nThe authors provide just enough basic experiments to show that this dataset is big enough that good low-level features (i.e. expected sinusoidal variations) can indeed be learned in an end-to-end context.\n\nOne might argue that in terms of learning representations, the work presented here contributes more in the dataset than in the experiments or techniques used. However, given the challenges of acquiring good datasets, and given the essential role such datasets play for the community in moving research forward and providing baseline reference points, I feel that this contribution carries substantial weight in terms of expected future rewards. (If research groups were making great new datasets available on a regular basis, that would place this in a different context. But so far, that is not the case.)

Such a dataset is extremely valuable for music information retrieval (MIR) research and a dataset of this size has never before been publicly available. It has the potential to dramatically increase the impact of modern machine learning techniques (e.g. deep learning) in this field, whose adoption has previously been hampered by a lack of available datasets that are large enough. The paper is clear and well-written.\n\nThe paper also features some \"example\" experiments using the dataset, which I am somewhat less excited about. The authors decided to focus on one single task that is not particularly challenging: identifying pitches in isolated segments of audio. Pitch information is a fairly low-level characteristic of music. Considering that isolated fragments are used as input, this is a relatively simple problem that probably doesn't even require machine learning to solve adequately, e.g. peak picking on a spectral representation could already get you pretty far. It's not clear what value the machine learning component in the proposed approach actually adds, if any. I could be wrong about this as I haven't done the comparison myself, but I think the burden is on the authors to demonstrate that using ML here is actually useful.\n\nI would argue that one of the strenghts of the dataset is the variety of label information it provides, so a much more convincing setup would have been to demonstrate many different prediction tasks for both low-level (e.g. pitch, onsets) and high-level (e.g. composer) characteristics, perhaps with fewer and simpler models -- maybe even sticking to spectrogram input and forgoing raw audio input for the time being, as this comparison seems orthogonal to the introduction of the dataset itself. As it stands, I feel that the fact that the experiments are relatively uninteresting detracts from the main point of the paper, which is to introduce a new public dataset that is truly unique in terms of its scale and scope.\n\nThat said, the experiments seem to have been conducted in a rigorous fashion and the evaluation and analysis of the resulting models is properly executed.\n\nRe: Section 4.5, it is rather unsurprising to me that a pitch detector would learn filters that resemble pitches (i.e. sinusoids), although the observation that this requires a relatively large amount of data is interesting. However, it would be more interesting to demonstrate that this is also the case for higher-level tasks. The authors favourably compare the features learnt by their model with prior work on end-to-end learning from raw audio, but neglect that the tasks considered in this work were much more high-level.\n\nSome might also question whether ICLR is the appropriate venue to introduce a new dataset, but personally I think it's a great idea to submit it here, seeing as it will reach the right people. I suppose this is up to the organisers and the program committee, but I thought it important to mention this, because I don't think this paper merits acceptance based on its experimental results alone.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Features of Music From Scratch", "abstract": "This paper introduces a new large-scale music dataset, MusicNet, to serve as a source \nof supervision and evaluation of machine learning methods for music research. \nMusicNet consists of hundreds of freely-licensed classical music recordings \nby 10 composers, written for 11 instruments, together with instrument/note \nannotations resulting in over 1 million temporal labels on 34 hours of chamber music\nperformances under various studio and microphone conditions. \n\nThe paper defines a multi-label classification task to predict notes in musical recordings, \nalong with an evaluation protocol, and benchmarks several machine learning architectures for this task: \ni) learning from spectrogram features; \nii) end-to-end learning with a neural net; \niii) end-to-end learning with a convolutional neural net. \nThese experiments show that end-to-end models trained for note prediction learn frequency\nselective filters as a low-level representation of audio.

When the authors independently check alignments for errors, our assessments are nearly identical. Our evaluation method indeed breaks down for music that is simultaneously rapid, highly polyphonic, and dissonant. However, we observe no particular decline in alignment quality as performance speed and complexity increase (if anything, additional complexity seems to aid in alignment) so we don't have reason to believe that the alignments fail in these limiting cases.\u00a0\n\nYour intuition is correct that release times are harder to verify than onsets (and our listening test does not explicitly account for release times). Typically the release of one note coincides with the onset of a new note, which implicitly verifies the release. However, we acknowledge that annotated release times at the end of phrases and movements may be less accurate. As you point out, the definition of release time may in some cases come into question. Does a note end when the bow leaves the string? When the musicians put down their instruments? When the string stops resonating audibly? These subtleties are not fully captured by our error analysis and we will clarify this.\n\nRegarding solo violin, I would guess you are referring to performance necessities such as rolling triple and quadruple stops. Here is an example of a solo violin performance with mixed in sine tones that mark the aligned label onsets:\n\nhttp://homes.cs.washington.edu/~thickstn/media/violin_markup.wav\n\nTriple stops occur at times t=5.68s, 13.25s, 21.37s, 23.63s, and 26.59s. All three labels align to the entire roll, starting at the beginning. Therefore, there is some time period at the beginning of the roll where the \"top\" note is labeled but has not yet occurred in the performance (and, depending on your definition of release time, there is a corresponding period at the end where the \"bottom\" note is labeled after it has ceased in the performance). There are reasonable interpretations of labeling under which these labels would be judged incorrect. On the other hand, if the labels are used to supervise transcription then ours is likely the desired labeling. We will be sure to mention this subtlety as well!\n\nWe will add some discussion of common types of errors to the paper.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Features of Music From Scratch", "abstract": "This paper introduces a new large-scale music dataset, MusicNet, to serve as a source \nof supervision and evaluation of machine learning methods for music research. \nMusicNet consists of hundreds of freely-licensed classical music recordings \nby 10 composers, written for 11 instruments, together with instrument/note \nannotations resulting in over 1 million temporal labels on 34 hours of chamber music\nperformances under various studio and microphone conditions. \n\nThe paper defines a multi-label classification task to predict notes in musical recordings, \nalong with an evaluation protocol, and benchmarks several machine learning architectures for this task: \ni) learning from spectrogram features; \nii) end-to-end learning with a neural net; \niii) end-to-end learning with a convolutional neural net. \nThese experiments show that end-to-end models trained for note prediction learn frequency\nselective filters as a low-level representation of audio.

Table 2 suggests that the release time of the notes is annotated very precisely, but I believe that this precision may belie the accuracy. \n\nIs there any relationship between the accuracy of the transcription and the dynamic level, e.g. are quiet passages more likely to have more errors? \n\nThe more exactly the limitations of this dataset are outlined, the more useful it will ultimately be. For example, the very definition of \u201crelease time\u201d might not be obvious (or important) for dense solo piano with a lot of pedal, yet is very informative in other contexts (e.g. analysis of certain performances, composers, expressive performance, various other cases). \n\nSimilarly, there is often an unavoidable discrepancy between score and performance in the polyphonic moments (of which there are more than a few) in solo violin music; how does this affect accuracy of annotation, if at all?\n\nGiven that the precision on the best model was generally below 50%, it would be interesting eventually to see some samples of the kinds of errors that the system makes."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Features of Music From Scratch", "abstract": "This paper introduces a new large-scale music dataset, MusicNet, to serve as a source \nof supervision and evaluation of machine learning methods for music research. \nMusicNet consists of hundreds of freely-licensed classical music recordings \nby 10 composers, written for 11 instruments, together with instrument/note \nannotations resulting in over 1 million temporal labels on 34 hours of chamber music\nperformances under various studio and microphone conditions. \n\nThe paper defines a multi-label classification task to predict notes in musical recordings, \nalong with an evaluation protocol, and benchmarks several machine learning architectures for this task: \ni) learning from spectrogram features; \nii) end-to-end learning with a neural net; \niii) end-to-end learning with a convolutional neural net. \nThese experiments show that end-to-end models trained for note prediction learn frequency\nselective filters as a low-level representation of audio.
