Distinctively, our method enables observing how individual weight vectors move from a minimum to a permutation point (see Fig 2) and equivalently how saddles emerge in between minima, therefore provides a geometric perspective on the landscape.\n\nRelation to Fort et al. 2019: Their work introduces a method that enables connecting m minima through an (m+1)-dim manifold. In our work, we prove that permutation points lie in high-dimensional plateaus of critical points (Lemma 3). In other words, one can pick any m critical points (or infinitely many) in this hyperplane and these points are connected in an n_k-dim hyperplane (n_k is the number of neurons in the next layer, this is usually bigger than 10, thus suggesting high-dimensional manifolds compared to the empirical findings in Fort 2019 for m=10). There is also an interesting connection between these two works: in their phenomenological model, the wedges intersect, suggesting connectivity of minima (see their Fig1) whereas we prove that the permutation points are connected at equal-loss (see our Fig 4 in the appendix).\n \nA lower bound on the number of critical points: We also wanted to point out to an interesting part in our paper: in addition to studying landscape connectivity, we find a lower bound for the number of permutation points corresponding to the midpoints in our pathfinding algorithm. We prove that there are at least polynomially more permutation points than the global minima (Proposition 3).\n\nRelation to Kuditipudi et al. 2019: Their method seems quite powerful while being quite general. However, their requirement of robustness against a 50% dropout, although practically no problem for big networks, is a major assumption and could actually be difficult to meet in layers with only a few units (e.g. 32 filters in an early convolutional layer).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2355/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2355/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["berfin.simsek@epfl.ch", "johanni.brea@epfl.ch", "bernd.illing@epfl.ch", "wulfram.gerstner@epfl.ch"], "title": "Weight-space symmetry in neural network loss landscapes revisited", "authors": ["Berfin Simsek", "Johanni Brea", "Bernd Illing", "Wulfram Gerstner"], "pdf": "/pdf/e867f6c9ea89d6ad1b42863cfe3db2bf43226d15.pdf", "TL;DR": "Weight-space symmetry in neural network landscapes gives rise to numerous number of saddles and flat high-dimensional subspaces.", "abstract": "Neural network training depends on the structure of the underlying loss landscape, i.e. local minima, saddle points, flat plateaus, and loss barriers.

We see our contribution in proving that there are polynomially more permutation points than global minima in the landscapes of multi-layer neural networks (Proposition 3). Furthermore, we prove that these permutation points lie in high-dimensional plateaus of critical points (Lemma 3). \n\nA new insight on \u201cneuron splitting\u201d: In addition to reviewing the results from Fukumizu and Amari, we prove that ALL permutation points are connected through continuous paths of the same loss.\n\nRelation to Garipov et al.: In Garipov et al the authors search through certain parametrized paths to connect independent minima (specifically, polygonal chains and bezier curves) and find optimal parameters that yield the lowest barrier (for a chosen parametrization). In our pathfinding method, we do not restrict our path method to a certain geometrical family. This enables finding paths of arbitrary shape and thus may lead to lower-barrier paths at the cost of connecting only the \u2018partner\u2019 minima. \n\nSaddles between global minima: We agree that the weight parameters (points on the path) created by our Algorithm 1 may not be a critical point of the loss function. However there must be at least one saddle point on the path as can be seen as follows: Either the permutation point is already a saddle or it is a local minimum of the loss. In the second case, the path must cross a point of higher loss at some point theta(d_s). By construction, at every point on the path, the derivative is zero in all directions but in d-direction, i.e. in the direction of the path. Since the loss values on the path before and after the point theta(d_s) are lower, the derivative at theta(d_s) in d-direction (along the path) must be zero as well. Thus theta(d_s) is a critical point; the saddle we were looking for.\n\nConnecting the \u201cglobal minima\u201d: In the paper we use a teacher-student setup to ensure being in a global minimum (of the student loss) before applying Algorithm 1. However we expect to find similar results for paths connecting local minima as encountered in classical network training and experiments on this are currently running."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2355/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2355/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["berfin.simsek@epfl.ch", "johanni.brea@epfl.ch", "bernd.illing@epfl.ch", "wulfram.gerstner@epfl.ch"], "title": "Weight-space symmetry in neural network loss landscapes revisited", "authors": ["Berfin Simsek", "Johanni Brea", "Bernd Illing", "Wulfram Gerstner"], "pdf": "/pdf/e867f6c9ea89d6ad1b42863cfe3db2bf43226d15.pdf", "TL;DR": "Weight-space symmetry in neural network landscapes gives rise to numerous number of saddles and flat high-dimensional subspaces.", "abstract": "Neural network training depends on the structure of the underlying loss landscape, i.e. local minima, saddle points, flat plateaus, and loss barriers.

The detailed method includes constructing/optimising a low-loss path in between two parameter vectors (incoming connections from the previous layer) of two neurons respectively, and then set the output weight vectors (outgoing connections to the next layer) to be the same without changing the output of the current layer. \n\nThe empirical results show that the proposed optimisation scheme for finding the path is indeed low-loss, which implies that there exists numerous critical points in between two equivalent local minima (which are global minima in over-parametrised models).\n\nMy major concern is that scope of the study is very limited, since only permutation is considered here. I am not an expert in this field, however, I could come up with examples which could easily generalise the method of study to rotations since rotation matrices include permutation matrices. \n\nWe can look into the loss landscape of 2D matrix factorisation in this form UV^T=W, and it is obvious that any rotation of U on the RHS of it is an optimal solution as long as the same rotation is applied to V. The perspective from this optimisation problem is that it gives us a continuous plateau and it includes permutation of the dimensions. \n\nFor neural networks with only one hidden layer. For example, consider a neural network in this form y=Uf(Vx) where U and V are parameter matrices and f() is a monotonic squashing function. It is easy to show that, when U is timed with a matrix R, where RR^T= I, as in U'= UR, there exist a V' and \\alpha that gives R^Tf(Vx) = \\alpha f(V'x) so that Uf(Vx) = URR^Tf(Vx) = U'f(V'x) for the hyperbolic tangent function. In the case where ReLU activation function is used as f(), then as long as the rotation doesn't produce negative entries, V' exists. In addition, when f is ReLU, isotropic scaling of the outputs from the first layer also gives rise to equivalent optima.  \n\nCompared to the proposed study, the aforementioned way of studying the neural networks naturally gives continuous plateaus w.r.t. U in the loss landscape, and, by studying the discontinuity of the landscape w.r.t. V, more understanding could be unveiled.

(https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06247)\n\nThey prove that a low-loss path between 2 optima exists provided you can apply a p_keep = 0.5 dropout on each of the optima without incurring a significant loss punishment for it. This paper seems very related to your approach. Would you mind commenting on the differences?\n\n-- Conclusion -- \nI like the paper and the idea in general. I appreciate the geometrical lens the authors took. My main point of confusion relates to the connection between this work and the low-loss connectivity between inequivalent optima found in literature, which (at least to me) seems to be the more interesting of the two connectivities.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2355/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2355/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["berfin.simsek@epfl.ch", "johanni.brea@epfl.ch", "bernd.illing@epfl.ch", "wulfram.gerstner@epfl.ch"], "title": "Weight-space symmetry in neural network loss landscapes revisited", "authors": ["Berfin Simsek", "Johanni Brea", "Bernd Illing", "Wulfram Gerstner"], "pdf": "/pdf/e867f6c9ea89d6ad1b42863cfe3db2bf43226d15.pdf", "TL;DR": "Weight-space symmetry in neural network landscapes gives rise to numerous number of saddles and flat high-dimensional subspaces.", "abstract": "Neural network training depends on the structure of the underlying loss landscape, i.e. local minima, saddle points, flat plateaus, and loss barriers.

I think studying the geometry of neural-nets is an interesting and important direction for understanding neural-nets, and along this direction, weight-space symmetry is an important subject. However, it seems to me this paper does not make enough contributions. Details are given below.\n \nList of contributions of the paper:\n \n1.\tPropose an algorithm to find a (low-loss) path connecting arbitrary two partner local minima and passing through a permutation point, where a permutation point is defined as a weight setting where a pair of neurons (in the same layer) have the same fan-in and fan-out weights. \n\n2.\tTheoretically prove that some permutation points are connected via paths with equal loss. (Proposition 1 and 2)\n\n3.\tProvide a lower bound for the number of permutation points and high-order permutation points (Proposition 3).\n\nCons: \n\n1.\tThe theory of this paper is a bit weak. There are three propositions.  Proposition 1 and Proposition 2 are about the equal-loss surface and theoretical existence of an equal-value path. They are kind of straightforward to prove. Prop. 3 is about counting the number of permutation points. It is a rather simple combinatorial problem, and the lower bound of the expression (an exponential bound) seems standard. \n\n2.\tSimple proofs can sometimes provide nice insight, but it is not clear how the study of partner global minima can help improve the understanding of DNN. \n    --First, partner global minima are just a special case of critical points created by \"neuron splitting\", which has been comprehensively studied in  [FA2000] (Fukumizu and Amari, 2000). Note that Theorem 1 of this paper is also directly borrowed from [FA2000]. To me, this paper does not provide much additional theoretical insight on neuron splitting. \n    --Second, what is the significance of the simulation results? Prior works have shown the existence of low-cost path; this paper shows the existence of a low-cost path containing a permutation point. The major difference is that the new low-cost path is more special. Why is this finding interesting and useful? (noting that the proof of the existence of such a path seems to be much easier than proving the existence of such a path for two general global minima).\n    \n\n3.\tIt is not clear how the path-finding algorithm helps in practice.\na)\tThe algorithm is computationally expensive. It is a double-loop algorithm: in the outer loop, d is reduced by a tiny amount at each time; in the inner loop, for a fixed d, gradient descent is run for the entire DNN (with only one parameter excluded) until convergence. The total time is (# of d) * (original running time). Here, # of d\u2019s depends on the grid: if the initial d is 10 and the grid size is 0.1, then (# of d) = 100. \n     Compared to the path-finding algorithm in Garipov et al., which only runs GD for one time, this algorithm is much more expensive, yet the benefit is unclear. \nb)\tThe motivation of the algorithm is not clear. Why choose to monotonically decrease the difference between the fan-in weights (of the chosen pair of neurons), but let all other weights freely optimized during the pathfinding algorithm? The paper does not provide a detailed explanation of this. \n\n4.\tMinor issues\n  -- The weight parameters created by Algorithm 1 may not be a critical point of the loss function, and thus not necessarily a saddle point. I think the claim \u201csince the path connects two partner minima, there must be at least one saddle point on the path\u201d is incorrect without extra assumptions. \n  --The paper mentioned \"global minima\" in the introduction; but in practical training, one does not always find global minima. Is \"global minima\" crucial for the theory and for the algorithm?
