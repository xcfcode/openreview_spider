The targets\u2019 update rule is similar to a regular tabular Q-learning update with high learning rate beta: this allows faster propagation of rewards obtained at the end of the episode (while beta=0 corresponds to regular DQN with no such reward propagation). This mechanism is shown to improve on Q-learning in a toy 2D maze environment (with MNIST-based pixel states providing cell coordinates) with beta=1, and on DQN and its optimality tightening variant on Atari games with beta=0.5.\n\nThe intuition behind the algorithm (that one should try to speed up the propagation of rewards across multiple steps) is not new, in fact it has inspired other approaches like n-step Q-learning, eligibility traces or more recently Retrace(lambda) in deep RL. Actually the idea of replaying experiences in backward order can be traced back to the origins of experience replay (\u00ab  Programming Robots Using Reinforcement Learning and Teaching \u00bb, Lin, 1991), something that is not mentioned here. That being said, to the best of my knowledge the specific algorithm proposed in this submission (Alg. 2) is novel, even if Alg. 1 is not (Alg. 1 can be seen as a specific instance of Lin\u2019s algorithm with a very high learning rate, and clearly only makes sense in toy deterministic environments).\n\nIn the absence of any theoretical analysis of the proposed approach, I would have expected an in-depth empirical validation. Unfortunately this is not the case here. In the toy environment (4.1) I am surprised by the really poor quality of the results (paths 5-10 times longer than the shortest path on average): have algorithms been run for a long enough time? Or maybe the average is a bad performance measure due to outliers? I would have also appreciated a comparison to Retrace(lambda), which is a more principled way to use multi-step rewards than n-step Q-learning (which is technically an on-policy method). Similar remarks can be made on the Atari experiments (4.2), where 10M frames is really low (the original DQN paper had results on 50M frames, and Rainbow reports 200M frames in only ~2x the training time reported here). The comparison also should have included prioritized experience replay, which has been shown to provide a significant boost in DQN, but may be tricky to combine with the proposed algorithm. Overall comparing only to vanilla DQN and its optimality tightening variant is too limited when there have been so many other meaningful improvements over DQN. This makes it really hard to tell whether the proposed algorithm would actually help when combined with a state-of-the-art method like Rainbow for instance.\n\nA few additional small remarks and questions:\n- \u00ab Second, there is no point in updating a one-step transition unless the future transitions have not been updated yet. \u00bb: should \u00ab unless \u00bb be replaced by \u00ab if \u00bb?\n- In 4.1 is there a maximum number of steps per episode and can you please confirm that training is done independently for each maze?\n- Typo in eq. 3: the - in the max should be a comma\n- There is a good amount of typos and grammar errors, though they do not harm the readability of the paper\n- Citations for \u00ab Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning \u00bb and \u00ab Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning \u00bb could refer to their conference versions\n- \u00ab epsilon starts from 1 and is annealed to 0 at 200,000 steps in a quadratic manner \u00bb: please specify the exact formula\n- Fig. 7 is really confusing, there seem to be typos and it is not clear why the beta updates appear in these specific cells, please revise it if you want to keep it", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Sample-Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning via Episodic Backward Update", "abstract": "We propose Episodic Backward Update - a new algorithm to boost the performance of a deep reinforcement learning agent by fast reward propagation.

The algorithm selects transitions in a backward order fashion from end of episode to be more effective in propagating learning of new rewards. This issue of fast propagation of updates is a common theme in RL (cf eligibility traces, prioritised sweeping, and more recently DQN with prioritised replay etc.). Here the proposed update applies the max Bellman operator recursively on a trajectory (unsure whether this is novel), with some decay to prevent accumulating errors with the nested max.\n\nThe paper is written in a clear way. The proposed approach seems reasonable, but I would have guessed that prioritized replay would also naturally sample transitions in roughly that order - given that TD-errors would at first be higher towards the end of an episode and progress backwards from there. I think this should have been one of the baselines to compare to for that reason.\n\nThe experimental results seem promising in the illustrative MNIST domain.

I'm worried that prioritized experience replay doesn't seem to work much better than Vanilla DQN (no improvement on Median score for instance), while previous work suggests it is an important ingredient (ex: Dueling networks, Rainbow).

We attempted to use the code provided at https://github.com/ShibiHe/\nQ-Optimality-Tightening, the outline in the paper and the authors\u2019 assistance to reproduce a subset of their results. \n\nObstacles to reproducibility:\nThe major obstacles we faced when attempting to reproduce the planned subset of the results were:\nDifficulty in translating the conceptual changes pointed out by the authors in their implementation and Q-Optimality Tightening (OT) codebases.\nComputational costs, and inefficiencies in the original OT code which meant that even on a Titan XP, only about 90 steps a second and 30% GPU utilization could be achieved(1). \nOutputs generated from the OT code were the only ones native to the code, therefore core evaluations (assessed and compared in the paper) couldn\u2019t be run.\nLack of original EBU implementation code coupled with a lack of prior exhaustive theoretical knowledge meant that despite the modest number of changes, implementation of EBU was very challenging.\n\nReproduced results: We were able to establish two kinds of baselines, first being the average reward per episode over each of the 40 epochs for 3 games in the Arcade Learning Environment (Breakout, Video Pinball and Pong) and secondly we were able to reproduce and confirm the run time for the OT baseline for all the 3 aforementioned games through extrapolation, noticing signs of decay as epoch progressed for Pong, when running on GTX970, and a few spikes when running Breakout and Video Pinball on Titan XP. We did this using the original hyperparameters of the paper (which were almost the same as the OT code), as specified by the authors. Due to the significant computational cost of each run, we were not able to attempt a wide variety of alternative parameters. We were however, unable to definitively reproduce the author\u2019s original results. The attempt to incorporate EBU was hampered by the size and complexity of the _do_training function and a lack of comments or documentation for the original OT code, which made correlating the pseudo code to the actual code difficult.\n\n\n\n(1).

Refer to \"run_episode\" function of \"ale_experiment.py\". \n\n2. As mentioned in the paper, we trained the agent for 40 epochs (we set 1 epoch = 62,500 steps = 250,000 frames).

Limited comparison\nWe strongly agree that we need more baseline algorithms to show the effectiveness of our algorithm. As other reviewers have suggested, we will include the performance of prioritized experience replay and retrace algorithm in the revised version.\n\n2.  Idea of replaying experiences in backward\nThank you for the reference, we will mention the relationship between Lin's idea and our methods in the revised version.\n\n3. Poor performance in MNIST DQN\nLearning curve tends to converge so fast for all algorithms when we used simple 2D maze, so it was difficult to compare different algorithms. So we used MNIST images as the state representation to make the learning process of general state transitions harder. We trained the agents for 200,000 steps, and all three algorithms (backward DQN, vanilla DQN, n-step DQN) converge to 1. In the paper, we showed the plots over 100,000 steps to show the effectiveness of our method in the early stages of training. To avoid any confusion, we will show the results until 200,000 steps in the revised version. Note that the vanilla DQN is trained for 50M steps (200M frames) in the Atari domain. Since the MNIST DQN environment is much simple, it is reasonable that the training is done for 0.2M steps. \n\n4. A few more comments on MNIST DQN:\nWe terminated the episode when the agent stays in the maze for more than 1000 time steps.\nWe trained 50 different independent agents each in a different random maze and reported the mean score. But as you suggested, mean may be a bad measure due to outliers. So we will show both mean and median of 50 agents' scores as the result in the revised version.\n\n5. Running time compared to RAINBOW\nRunning time may vary a lot depending on which device and distributed method you use. We used a single GPU to train an agent. As reported in the paper, it took 152 hours to train 490M frames (49 games x 10M frames). RAINBOW takes 10 days to train 200M frames. We will mention that the training time is not the 'mean' training time of 49 games but the 'sum' of training time in the revised version.\n\n6. The last figure\nWe apologize for the confusion. The first column and fourth rows of initialization and recursive updates part should be changed as \"s_1\" -> \"s_2\". The beta is applied only for the positions where the actions were taken in the replay memory, as the update is done from right to left.  a_T = A_2, a_(T-1) = A_1 in the example. We will make this clear in the revised version.\n\n7. Typos and Citations\nWe will correct the typos and citations as your suggestions.\n\nThank you so much for your ideas and suggestions.\nAny further comments are appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Sample-Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning via Episodic Backward Update", "abstract": "We propose Episodic Backward Update - a new algorithm to boost the performance of a deep reinforcement learning agent by fast reward propagation.
