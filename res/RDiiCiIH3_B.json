This paper introduces a general framework for learning and applying sparse sketching matrices. A two-stage procedure for learning sketches with the same sparsity pattern as CountSketch is proposed which involves first learning the sketch\u2019s non-zero entries, and then optimizing their values. They then show how to apply the obtained sketch so that it has worst case approximation error guarantees. This procedure is applied to three applications, namely least squares regression, low rank approximation (LRA) and k-means clustering. Experimental results demonstrate a substantial reduction in the approximation error compared to other baseline approaches (including classically learned sketches). On the theoretical front, it is shown for regression and LRA that the proposed approach obtains improved error guarantees for fixed time complexity.  Additionally, it is shown for LRA (under certain input distributions) that including the first stage is strictly better than not including it. Finally, a more straightforward way of retaining worst case approximation guarantees for k-means is shown. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nReasons for score: \n\nOverall, I vote for accepting the paper. The procedure for learning and applying the sketching matrix seems novel and interesting, and the empirical results (Especially for LRA and least squares regression) on real datasets suggest that the proposed method does substantially improve over other baseline methods, including the classical CountSketch. The theoretical results for least squares regression and LRA also imply that their algorithm achieves a better accuracy than the classical CountSketch approach (given the same time complexity). I do have some questions mentioned in \u201cCons\u201d and \u201cFurther remarks\u201d below which I would like the authors to clarify in the rebuttal phase. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPros:\n\n-\tPaper is in general written well barring some notational issues and explanations which were not clear to me (explained later in \u201cCons\u201d)\n-\tThe two-stage idea of learning a sketching matrix with the same sparsity pattern as in CountSketch is interesting. Instantiating the framework to problems such as: least squares regression, LRA and k-means is done nicely, and the theoretical results appear to be strong.\n-\tThe empirical evaluation on real datasets makes a convincing case for the proposed algorithm and demonstrates that learning the CountSketch matrix can indeed be substantially better than using the classical CountSketch, on real data.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCons:\n\n-\tThe sketching matrices considered in the paper are restricted to Count Sketches which have a particular sparsity pattern. So, the framework is not as general as is claimed in the abstract. \n-\tSome of the notation and explanations in Section 3 are quite unclear. For example, the loss function symbol is sometimes used as L(X), sometimes as L(S, I) etc. In Algorithm 1, I don\u2019t understand what range(n) means, and also the summation over A_i \\in A_{train} seems strange. Algorithms 1,2 have a training set \\mathcal{A}_{train} as input but I don\u2019t see how this appears for the examples in Section 4; is N =1 there? In stage 2, what does the operation S[p, range(n)] = v do? In Algorithm 3, it would be helpful to explain (with an example perhaps) what the symbol \\mathcal{M}(S,I) could look like. At the beginning of page 4, it is mentioned that learned sketches can encounter out of distribution inputs etc. But some of the guarantees in Section 4 (Theorems 4.1,4.2) apply for arbitrary inputs, isn\u2019t it?\n-\tTheorems 4.1, 4.2 assume that the learned sketch matrices are affine \\beta embeddings and hence attain a (1+\\beta) approximation for the respective problems. But it is not mentioned whether this assumption can be satisfied.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nFurther remarks:\n\n-\tI don\u2019t understand why in page 2 (\u201cOur results\u201d para) it is written that the sketches are input-independent, aren\u2019t the sketches derived in the paper a function of the input data (for e.g. in Alg. 1)?  \n-\tFor theorems 4.1 and 4.2, it will be helpful to state the corresponding guarantee for the classical algorithm in the main text to enable a direct comparison.\n-\tIn the abstract and the introduction, it is mentioned that for LRA it strictly better to include the first optimization stage. But this is shown for a couple of specific input distributions, hence should be clearly specified as such.\n-\tIn Algorithms 1,2, sometimes \"\\mathcal{A}_{train}\" is used and sometimes \"A_{train}\". If sets are being denoted with calligraphic symbols, then mention this in the notations paragraph.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nPost rebuttal: I have read the authors response and will go with my original score for this paper.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2771/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2771/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A framework for learned CountSketch", "authorids": ["~Simin_Liu1", "~Tianrui_Liu3", "~Ali_Vakilian1", "~Yulin_Wan2", "~David_Woodruff1"], "authors": ["Simin Liu", "Tianrui Liu", "Ali Vakilian", "Yulin Wan", "David Woodruff"], "keywords": ["Compression", "sketching"], "abstract": "Sketching is a compression technique that can be applied to many problems to solve them quickly and approximately.

It is true that this framework is for CountSketch matrices rather than general sparse matrices. We updated the paper and title accordingly.  \n2. We've updated the notation, which is clearer and consistent throughout the paper now. In Algorithm 1, $range(n)$ is $1,\\ldots,n$; it is used to iterate over the columns of CountSketch S. In the updated paper, we explain at the top of p. 4 that we average/sum over $A_i \\in A_{train}$ because we are performing empirical risk minimization (ERM). $A_{train}$ does not appear in Section 4, because Section 4 defines functions of an individual matrix $A$; in Section 2, we sum over such functions for $A \\in A_{train}$. \nIn Stage 2, we replaced $S[p, range(n)] = v$ with a clearer explanation; essentially, it constructs a CountSketch $S$ from a condensed $(p, v)$ representation. In Alg. 3, we have defined and illustrated $M$. In the section \"Learned sketch with worst-case guarantees\", we explained why our method provides worst-case guarantees against arbitrary inputs, including out-of-distribution inputs. \n3. Regarding the beta embedding: we have updated the paper with a more precise description of our results (Theorems 4.1 and 4.3). In particular, we have added Remarks 4.2 and 4.4 to clarify the relationship between Algorithm 3's performance, the approximation errors of the approximate solutions computed using learned and classical sketches, and the trade-off parameter $\\beta$. \n4. The definition of \"input-independent\" sketches: while learned CountSketch is data-dependent (it is optimized using sample input matrices), it is still considered input-independent in our notation because it is applied to unseen input matrices (test samples).\n5. We have noted the input distribution assumption for our LRA proof. \n6. We have also fixed all inconsistencies in our notation.

Using \"*fast* comparisons\" to retain worst-case guarantees. Although simple, a previous work took another approach (\"sketch concatenation\") which is application-specific and only proven for LRA. Our method is far more general. \n2. That said, \"sketch concatenation\" is slightly simpler. So, we expanded its applicability and proved that it works for another task, k-means. \n3. The notion of *sparsity pattern* optimization, which is crucial for *sparse* matrices. This alone gives a 12% and 20% increase in accuracy for LRA and MRR, respectively. \n\nAt a high level, we have made the sketch learning process more general and effective. \n\nWe also made several important theoretical contributions: \n1. We formulated a time-optimal algorithm for *learned sketching with guarantees*. This was challenging because our method for sketching with guarantees had to attain the same time complexity as vanilla sketching. \n2. *k-means with guarantees*: We proved that the \"sketch concatenation\" method (sketching with the concatenation of a classical and a learned sketch) can be used for k-means to obtain worst-case accuracy guarantees. \nMore specifically, we proved that classical sketches which satisfy a \"strong coreset\" property (such as CountSketch) also satisfy a \"sketch monotonicity\" property for k-means, which says that any extension to a sketch provides a better k-means solution. This result may be of independent interest.    \n3. *Greedy step analysis*: We proved that under certain assumptions (on the input distribution, matrix size, etc.), a greedy-initialized sketch is strictly better than a randomly initialized sketch. This is a new result which leverages the following insight: \n\n    the top k-rank subspace of a matrix's row span is mostly \"covered\" by the k rows with largest norm. Since sketches with a single non-zero entry per column can be viewed as hashing rows together, it is crucial for the hash to separate these largest norm rows so that their directions are preserved. The greedy algorithm essentially ensures this through its placement of the sketch's nonzero entries. \n\n\nFinally, we would like to add that the simplicity of our approach is an advantage, not a shortcoming. Simpler systems are more likely to be adopted. Our system has clear real-world applications, which we highlighted in the experiments. We had excellent empirical results on\n1. LRA and k-means on images, which has compression applications\n2. SVD/LRA on text data, which has NLP applications (namely, Latent Semantic Indexing)\n3. LRA on graph adjacency matrices, which has applications to approximately computing max cuts\n\nFurther, there is now more mainstream interest in sketching. NVIDIA has [recently looked into](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/video/gputechconf/gtc/2019/presentation/s9226-fast-singular-value-decomposition-on-gpus-v2.pdf) implementing approximate SVD (via sketching) for CUDA, their parallel computing platform. For these reasons, this approach is likely to be practically applicable. \n\n**Answers to questions**\n1. Greedy optimization is only performed on the training data, as mentioned in Algorithm \n2. Greedy and gradient optimization is not deterministic. There are two sources of randomness: mini-batch sampling and row order randomization for greedy. However, our results can be replicated by using our random seeds and hardware. \n3. Standard deviations are now reported, along with commentary. \n4. Also, we revised the Introduction and Framework sections to improve clarity. They now both have better organization and articulation. Also, the Framework section has improved notation and an illustrative example.
