The experiments show good performance.\nHowever, there are some weakness in this paper:\n\n1. (Minor issue) The Update() function in Algorithm 1 seems to be something very general. However, it seems that Update() is simply SGD or SGD with (Nesterov) momentum, according to Section 5.1. Furthermore, the authors never explicitly explain what exact Update() function is used, which is very unfriendly to the readers.\n\n2. The major issue is that the proposed algorithm and the contribution (improvement of generalization) is not novel. Phase 2 of Algorithm 2 is called local SGD, proposed in [1,2]. Local SGD also has variants with Polyak momentum and Nesterov momentum [3]. Furthermore, [4] has already proposed an algorithm, post-local SGD, which is basically the same as Algorithm 1 in this paper (run fully synchronous SGD first and then local SGD). Note that [4] also shows that post-local SGD converges to flatter minima, and results in better generalization.

Here are our clarifications:\n\n1. (Figure 1): The difference in final test accuracies between the independent and averaged models is around 0.53% (Table 1). This is barely noticeable in Figure 1 where the y-axis goes from 10% to 100%. For CIFAR100, this difference, is around ~2.5% (Table 2). In our figure we intended to show how a hypothetical averaged model behaves better than each worker\u2019s model. But agree we could have also shown a version where the final accuracy of the averaged model is obviously higher than the other ones.\n\n2. (Existing large-batch training results): The blanket statement that such methods require a \"lot\" of hyperparameter tuning is a mistake, that phrase will be removed. (You et al., 2017)  introduces only one new hyperparameter (scaling factor l). \n\n3. (Warm-up for small-batch sizes):  We concluded that using warmup for small-batch SGD was advantageous for it. We chose the hyperparameters via a grid search over warmup epochs and peak learning rate. The best settings were achieved when the peak learning rate is larger than the initial learning rate (See appendix A).\n\n4. (LARS with SWAP): Our intention is twofold, to provide an algorithm and to highlight a phenomenon. Since it is not clear why large-batch SGD should worsen the test behavior, and it is in itself an important question, we rather design experiments that probe this phenomenon. If we were to use LARS or any other choice we\u2019ll make the interpretation harder. That is not to say that the best possible algorithm would use different strategies for a large and small batch (for example LARS, mixed-precision + LARS, local-SGD NovoGrad, etc) and we intend to explore this in a sequel.\n\n5. (Switching point between phases 1 and 2): In our experience, SWAP lent itself to a simple tuning strategy which we are happy to describe: We choose a threshold training accuracy a few percentage points lower than saturation (in our experiments 90% was effective) and switch phases when that accuracy is achieved. We agree that sharing our experience might be useful for someone who might try to apply the method. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper974/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper974/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Stochastic Weight Averaging in Parallel: Large-Batch Training That Generalizes Well", "authors": ["Vipul Gupta", "Santiago Akle Serrano", "Dennis DeCoste"], "authorids": ["vipul_gupta@berkeley.edu", "sakle@apple.com", "ddecoste@apple.com"], "keywords": ["Large batch training", "Distributed neural network training", "Stochastic Weight Averaging"], "TL;DR": "We propose SWAP, a distributed algorithm for large-batch training of neural networks.", "abstract": "We propose Stochastic Weight Averaging in Parallel (SWAP), an algorithm to accelerate DNN training.

However, we believe that this is novel in a few ways:\nIt was not obvious to the authors that SWA should improve upon the output found by a large-batch algorithm. We feel that an important contribution is our observation that the initial iterations with large-batch training do not cause permanent damage to the model, and in fact, can initialize small-batch training with SWA for overall more effective training.  This points to the characteristics of the topology of the loss surface that should be better understood. \nBefore this work, we did not know if small-batch runs seeded from a large-batch output would provide diverse-enough models for the SWA ensembling to work, and in this work, we have demonstrated that they do. \nFinally, algorithms to accelerate training are of great value to the community. On this front SWAP is an algorithm that efficiently utilizes available resources and is also very simple. We believe that simplicity is a valuable characteristic for such an algorithm.\n\nOther comments: \n \n1. Choice of transition point: Choosing a transition point between phase 1 and phase 2 presents a trade-off: We would like the large-batch training to cover most of the training process while preventing overfitting. In our experiments, we observed that switching just before the training loss reaches zero, for example, when the training accuracy is 90%, works for the CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet (Top5 accuracy) datasets. We also noticed that the generalization performance is not very sensitive to the transition point, for instance, in the CIFAR datasets choosing target large-batch training accuracies in the 85% to 98% range yields very similar generalization performance.\n\n2. How large can the batch-size be?  A thorough experiment to characterize these trade-offs is important but was beyond our computational resources. In our experiments, and for our limited choice of datasets we observe that SWAP has better scaling than simple large-batch training. We expect that in the same manner, when large-batch training shows diminishing returns, SWAP will as well. For example, we observe that, as the large-batch batch-size grows the required number of small-batch epochs in phase 2 increases. Each of these epochs is slower than the large-batch epoch so at some point the time to execute these might dominate. \n\n3. The point 'LB' in Figure 2 is the output of phase 1. Recall that this point is obtained by early stopping the large-batch training (as discussed above, it can be around 90\\% training accuracy). Hence, the training error is worse than SGD. We will modify figure 2 in the revision to clarify this. \n\n4. We believe that this is not the case. As far as we understand the invariances described in Dinh et al, are changes in the weights that maintain invariant the function that the model computes. Since the function does not change, its behavior in the train and validation sets stays the same. That is to say, if one selects weights invariant in this manner, the generalization behavior of the model would be the same.  We observe something different, the model changes its generalization behavior without having to escape a basin of 'bad generalization' to reach a basin of 'good generalization'. \n\n5. Connection with local SGD: Thanks for raising this point. This was the primary concern of Reviewer 2. For brevity, we refer the reviewer to our response to reviewer 2, where we provide comprehensive scrutiny on the relation between SWAP and post-local SGD.\n\nAs for developing some theory, in Section 4.1, we try to shed some analytical light on our algorithm. Since SWA and SWAP are different ways to sample from the SGD stationary distribution, all the relevant theory contained in the original SWA references can be applied to ours. However, that does not imply that the analysis is complete since these papers use strong simplifying assumptions from Mandt et. al 2017. We believe that improving generalization with weight averaging is a powerful technique, and a complete theoretical analysis is an important open question."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper974/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper974/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Stochastic Weight Averaging in Parallel: Large-Batch Training That Generalizes Well", "authors": ["Vipul Gupta", "Santiago Akle Serrano", "Dennis DeCoste"], "authorids": ["vipul_gupta@berkeley.edu", "sakle@apple.com", "ddecoste@apple.com"], "keywords": ["Large batch training", "Distributed neural network training", "Stochastic Weight Averaging"], "TL;DR": "We propose SWAP, a distributed algorithm for large-batch training of neural networks.", "abstract": "We propose Stochastic Weight Averaging in Parallel (SWAP), an algorithm to accelerate DNN training.

For example, authors in [4] average after 32 iterations for CIFAR10 (Figure 4(a)) and after 8 iterations in ImageNet (Figure 9 in Appendix B.3.2). On the\u00a0other hand,\u00a0in SWAP experiments we synchronize \"only once\" after thousands of iterations (2910 iterations in CIFAR10 and 20,794 iterations on imagenet).\u00a0\nThis difference of 3 orders of magnitude likely indicates that different mechanisms are behind the success of SWAP and the success of post-local SGD. We believe that the phenomena we observe in SWAP is unlikely to be explained by the arguments in [1,2,3,4] where the divergence between local models is assumed to be controlled and thus the averaged model results from noisy gradient updates with gradient noise of similar shape but larger magnitude [4].\nWhile it is believable that Post-local SGD improves on generalization by a mechanism that noisifies the gradient  with the correct noise structure (thus mimicking the behavior of small-batch SGD). SWAP seems to be taking advantage of different mechanics.\u00a0 For example, a mechanism that ensembles models sampled independently from an approximate posterior distribution over weights seems more likely.\nIn any case, we believe the community would benefit from having access to both these observations, for they both are likely to hint at underlying mechanics that need to be better understood. We believe that the fact that SWAP works at all is surprising and further evidence that the strategies of Stochastic Weight Averaging are robust and valuable.\u00a0\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that not including references to local-SGD in the prior work section and a clear comparison of the work is a bad oversight, and mean to address it. \u00a0\n\nOn the minor comment 1:\nWe agree that our choice makes that section unfriendly to the reader.\u00a0 We will modify the manuscript to specify that here Update() is in fact simply SGD (with momentum and weight decay).\nThis is a mistake that stemmed from the fact that we observed similar behavior when other first-order stochastic methods are used, for example, we observed commensurate speedups with Adam.\u00a0\nSince the best behaving version was simply SGD with momentum and weight decay, we didn\u2019t include these in the manuscript.

It utilizes to phases to train the DNN. The first phase consists of distributed large-batch training, where the learning rate is scaled linearly with respect to the scale of the batch size. The second phase consists of using small batches with SWA to obtain the final model. Experiments verify that this method is able to achieve similar generalization performance as small-batch methods in less training time. A comparison against small-batch SWA, large-batch SWA, etc. \n\nStrengths:\n\nThe proposed algorithm is a natural extension to SWA, and appears to give good generalization performance. It is able to utilize large-batch training effectively, which is perhaps surprising given the amount of tuning necessary in Shallue, et al. (2018) in order to achieve good performance. The experiments are well-detailed, and some interesting visualizations, graphs, and empirical analyses are provided.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nI think that this paper is fairly complete; the only question is whether or not it contains enough novelty, as it is a natural extension of SWA to the parallelized setting. No theoretical analysis of the algorithm is given.\n\nSome questions and comments:\n\n- How sensitive is the algorithm to the choice of the transition point? How was the transition point tuned?\n- How large of a batch size can one use before this approach breaks down or is no longer efficient?\n- In Figure 2, LB is shown to obtain worse training error than SGD. What is the reason for this? This seems contrary to theory (assuming one has already converged to a neighborhood of the solution).\n- The authors comment in the conclusion that \"it is possible that regions with bad and good generalization performance are connected through regions of low training loss\". Can one check if this is related to the invariances described in Dinh, et al. (2017)? \n- What is the relationship between SWAP and methods on local SGD?\n\nThis paper is missing some classical optimization references on increasing batch sizes, which has been well-studied within that literature:\n\n[1] Byrd, Richard H., et al. \"Sample size selection in optimization methods for machine learning.\" Mathematical programming 134.1 (2012): 127-155.\n[2] Bollapragada, Raghu, Richard Byrd, and Jorge Nocedal. \"Adaptive sampling strategies for stochastic optimization.\" SIAM Journal on Optimization 28.4 (2018): 3312-3343.\n[3] Bollapragada, Raghu, et al. \"A progressive batching L-BFGS method for machine learning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.05374 (2018). \n[4] Friedlander, Michael P., and Mark Schmidt. \"Hybrid deterministic-stochastic methods for data fitting.\" SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing 34.3 (2012): A1380-A1405.\n\nAlthough developing some theory for this algorithm would be beneficial, this paper performs a comprehensive set of experiments and is well-written.
