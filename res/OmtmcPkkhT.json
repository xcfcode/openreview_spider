Instead of following standard deep-learning ideas, the method stacks linear layers, but modulates each layer with a non-linear function (e.g. Fourier or Gabor functions). It is shown that this results in a linear combination of exponentially many Fourier/Gabor functions. Extensive experiments are performed, following the complete suite of experiments in SIREN [Sitzmann 2020], and it is shown that the proposed method outperforms available neural methods, except on video representation and signed-distance functions.\n\nReasons for score.\nThe paper proposes a novel method and shows superior performance on some tasks. However, generalization performance comparison for standard signal processing is missing. Hence, I suggest a weak accept.\n\nPro.\n- simple and novel idea that fits nicely into standard frameworks\n- experiments demonstrate its superiority on several tasks, even generalization compared to Fourier Features\n- well written and easy to understand\n\nCon. \n- although theoretically shown, it remains empirically unclear if the method is able to leverage the exponential number of functions. I.e. an experiment to compare with standard Fourier and Gabor transformation should be performed. As a Fourier basis can represent any finitely sampled signal perfectly, a generalization analysis should be performed akin to pg.6 bottom. Put another way: when is the neuronal representation useful as opposed to just useing a Fourier/Gabor transform?\n- it should be worked out more carfully what's novel throughout the paper. E.g. in section 4.2. \"while ReLU fails spectacularly\" - this has already been shown in the SIREN paper, and needs emphasis for readers not aware of this.\n\n\nMinor.\n- pg. 3 top: W\u02c6{(i)} the dimensionality should be transposed, no?\n- do all the methods in Figure 1 have the same numbers of free parameters? \n- Table 3: is the relative performance stable wrt. to the number of iters? would be good to see the whole plot of performance vs. iters for all methods in the appendix.\n- Figure 4: Ground -> Ground-truth; why is there a square box for SIREN and GaborNet? (it's not in the SIREN paper)\n\n\nUdpate: with the additional experiments and corrections in the paper, I believe the paper is in good shape and contributes to the literature in the field. Hence it should be accepted.\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2666/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2666/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multiplicative Filter Networks", "authorids": ["~Rizal_Fathony1", "~Anit_Kumar_Sahu1", "~Devin_Willmott1", "~J_Zico_Kolter1"], "authors": ["Rizal Fathony", "Anit Kumar Sahu", "Devin Willmott", "J Zico Kolter"], "keywords": ["Deep Architectures", "Implicit Neural Representations", "Fourier Features"], "abstract": "Although deep networks are typically used to approximate functions over high dimensional inputs, recent work has increased interest in neural networks as function approximators for low-dimensional-but-complex functions, such as representing images as a function of pixel coordinates, solving differential equations, or representing signed distance fields or neural radiance fields.

Below are the highlights of the revision:\n- We fixed all the typos and wording problems, including:\n  * We fixed the W notation in the first paragraph of page 3 to W^{i} \\in R^{d_{i+1} x d_i}. This aligns with the usage of W in Eq (3), Eq (7), and other equations in the appendix. \n  * The weight initialization in the paragraph after Corollary 1 should be W instead of \\Omega. We fixed this.\n  * We changed the image title in Figure 4 from \u2018Ground\u2019 to \u2018Ground Truth\u2019\n  * We fixed the text in Theorem 2 to \u2018linear combination of Gabor bases\u2019 rather than \u2018Fourier bases\u2019\n- We add a note in the discussion of Section 4.2 experiment to clarify that the failure of ReLU networks has been observed previously by SIREN paper (Sitzmann et al., 2020). We focus more on the comparison between GaborNet and SIREN.\n- As requested by the reviewers, we added plots of performance vs iterations in the training progress to the appendix. \n  * In the image representation task (Figure 1), both FourierNet and GaborNet show quicker initial convergences compared to other architectures. Eventually, the final performance shows GaborNet performs the best, followed by SIREN and FourierNet.\n  * Similarly, in the video representation task (Figure 6), FourierNet and GaborNet show quicker initial convergences. But eventually, SIREN overtook both of them and maintained the best final performance, followed by GaborNet and FourierNet.\n  * In the shape representation task (Figure 9), Both GaborNet and SIREN perform very similarly during the whole training progress. They both outperform FourierNet.\n- We added visual highlights on the main differences among the compared images to the appendix, particularly for the image generalization task where the differences are clearly visible. Figure 8 now shows the highlighted differences.\n- We added a discussion on the comparison between the proposed approach and the traditional FFT upsampling method in the appendix (Section B.2). As requested by the reviewers, we ran image upsampling on the image generalization task using the \u2018Natural\u2019 and \u2018Text\u2019 dataset. As expected, the traditional FFT upsampling method performs quite well on both datasets (73.80\u00b112.20 and 66.78\u00b18.14 PSNRs, respectively). However, this standard approach also has disadvantages compared to the implicit neural representations approach (the MFNs, SIRENs, and Fourier feature networks). The standard Fourier analysis does not scale well to higher dimensions, or it does not admit to backpropagation through more complex loss functions (e.g., in neural rendering fields). The lack of scalability and non-differentiability hinders the usage of FFT based upsampling methods in an end-to-end manner and hence adds significant barriers to such methods being employed in generic tasks. In contrast, the MFNs (and other implicit neural representations) provides generic methods that apply to generic tasks where we can learn based upon derivatives, as shown in our paper and the related works (SIREN and Fourier feature networks paper)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2666/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2666/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multiplicative Filter Networks", "authorids": ["~Rizal_Fathony1", "~Anit_Kumar_Sahu1", "~Devin_Willmott1", "~J_Zico_Kolter1"], "authors": ["Rizal Fathony", "Anit Kumar Sahu", "Devin Willmott", "J Zico Kolter"], "keywords": ["Deep Architectures", "Implicit Neural Representations", "Fourier Features"], "abstract": "Although deep networks are typically used to approximate functions over high dimensional inputs, recent work has increased interest in neural networks as function approximators for low-dimensional-but-complex functions, such as representing images as a function of pixel coordinates, solving differential equations, or representing signed distance fields or neural radiance fields.

Despite this, SIREN does appear to retain some notable advantages over MFNs, such as a bias towards smoother regions in the represented function and its gradients. We can see it from the shape representation experiment (Section 4.3), where SIREN has a notable benefit in representing smooth surfaces.\nFrom the theoretical perspective, GaborNet provides a key benefit over SIREN in terms of the characteristics of the entire function represented by the network. GaborNet can simply be viewed as a linear function approximator over an exponential number of Gabor basis functions.

We now address the main concern below.\n\n- While we acknowledge that the improvement of MFNs over SIREN and Fourier features networks is slight in some experiments, we would contend that we do make some notable improvement in, for example, the image generalization tasks, specifically on the text dataset. However, the main contribution of the paper is providing a connection between the network architecture with the traditional Fourier and Gabor wavelet transform, which are extensively studied in the literature and widely used in many application domains. We show that the entire function of FourierNet and GaborNet can simply be viewed as a linear function approximator over an exponential number of Fourier or Gabor basis functions, respectively. In contrast, there is no characterization of the property of the SIREN and Fourier features networks, which makes it unclear why such representation works well for modeling low-dimensional-but-complex functions. \nThe simplicity of the MFNs, where we can express the exact linear form of the entire function, makes it easier to characterize the network and opens up opportunities for further theoretical and empirical studies on similar network architectures.\n\n- In terms of the generalization power of the encoding schemes, we have two experiments that demonstrate the capability of our networks. First, in the image generalization task (Section 4.1) where the networks need to predict unseen pixels. The second experiment is the 3D inverse rendering task (Section 4.4). In this task, the networks need to reconstruct a 3D representation of an object (in this case, Lego blocks) from the observed 2d photographs from different viewpoints. From their learned 3d representation, the networks then need to predict 2d photographs from unseen viewpoints. \nIn both of these tasks, we showed that the GaborNet outperforms the baselines approach that uses Fourier feature networks, whereas the FourierNet produces competitive results. These tasks also show some generalization capabilities of our MFNs.\n\n- In terms of the size of the networks, the MFNs have roughly similar size compared with the SIREN and Fourier feature networks. Given the similar architecture, each of those networks needs to store the same amount of parameters of the inner linear layers. GaborNet needs to learn additional parameters of \\mu and \\gamma, but their sizes are negligible compared with the size of parameters in the inner linear layers.\n\n- Thanks for the suggestion in the image comparison. We will add visual highlights on the main difference among the compared images to the appendix. \n\n- Yes, in Corollary 2, we mean \u201clinear combination of Gabor bases\u201d.\n\n- The current citation format (author year) makes it difficult to add a citation to the table. However, we will make sure that we include the citation for every baseline method at the beginning of the experiment section.\n\n- In the paragraph after Corollary 1, \\Omega^{i} should be W^{i}.

We have responded to each of your points below.\n- Regarding when using MFNs is preferable to simply using Fourier/Gabor features: Thanks for making this point - we agree that an experiment that explores the benefits of using our network vs Fourier or Gabor features would strengthen the paper. Could you provide more details on what specifically you would like to see in such an experiment? For example, we are imagining that performing the image generalization task directly using random Fourier or Gabor features (perhaps, for a direct comparison, a number of features equal to the number of parameters in the W matrices of the MFNs we use in this experiment) would address this, but it would be useful to know if you have other ideas in mind for the experiment.\n- We will add wording to clarify which experimental results are novel in this paper, as opposed to those findings that were first shown in the SIREN paper.\n- In the models trained and tested on the image representation task shown in Figure 1, the total number of free parameters varies slightly; FourierNet and GaborNet have slightly more than other models, due to the additional learnable parameters in the input layers and filter function (i.e. \\mu and \\gamma in GaborNet). But these additional parameters are of order d_i (hidden size in layer i), whereas the total number of learnable parameters is dominated by the d_i^2 parameters in the hidden-to-hidden W matrices. Thus, we note that the favorable convergence of GaborNet and FourierNet in Figure 1 is despite a slightly larger number of parameters overall.\n- Yes, thank you for pointing this out - we intended to define the dimensions of W in the reverse order (i.e., as a d_{i+1} x d_i matrix). We will fix this.\n- In general, the convergence of the models we tested is fairly stable over time on these experiments, but we will add plots of performance over time for several of these tasks in the appendix. \n- We will fix the omitted label in Figure 4. Regarding the SIREN results in this figure, these results (and all of the experiments on SIREN models in our paper) come from experiments that we ran using the SIREN implementation the authors have provided. In general we have tried to be faithful to the original training hyperparameters in those experiments, but there may have been some minor differences from the original code; most notably, we reduced the batch size in several experiments to account for smaller GPUs. More details about our training setup are also available in the supplementary material.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2666/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2666/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multiplicative Filter Networks", "authorids": ["~Rizal_Fathony1", "~Anit_Kumar_Sahu1", "~Devin_Willmott1", "~J_Zico_Kolter1"], "authors": ["Rizal Fathony", "Anit Kumar Sahu", "Devin Willmott", "J Zico Kolter"], "keywords": ["Deep Architectures", "Implicit Neural Representations", "Fourier Features"], "abstract": "Although deep networks are typically used to approximate functions over high dimensional inputs, recent work has increased interest in neural networks as function approximators for low-dimensional-but-complex functions, such as representing images as a function of pixel coordinates, solving differential equations, or representing signed distance fields or neural radiance fields.

The idea is to place nonlinearity into the feature encoding rather than network layers like ReLU, and the goal is to learn better representation with more compact models. Preliminary results outperform existing techniques on several image and video representation tasks. One generalization is shown for image completion.\n\n**Strength**\nThe idea is simple but seems effective. It's interesting to leverage Gabor filters' capability in spatial and frequency support to enable better feature encoding. Results show a better reconstruction of high frequency details and experiments are comprehensive covering multiple aspects of image and video tasks.\n\n**Weakness**\n\n    - I do not see how MFN 'largely outperforms' existing baseline methods. It is difficult to identify the quality difference between output from the proposed method and SIREN -- shape representation seems to even prefer SIREN's results (what is the ground truth for Figure 5a). The paper is based on the idea of replacing compositional models with recursive, multiplicative ones, though neither the theory nor the results are convincing to prove this linear approximation is better. I have a hard time getting the intuition of the advantages of the proposed method.\n    - this paper, and like other baselines (e.g. SIREN) do not comment much on the generalization power of these encoding schemes. Apart from image completion, are there other experiments showing the non-overfitting results, for example, on shape representation or 3D tasks?\n    - the proposed model has shown to be more efficient in training, and I assume it is also more compact in size, but there is no analysis or comments on that?\n\n**Suggestions**\n\n    - Result figures are hard to spot differences against baselines. It's recommended to use a zoom or plot the difference image to show the difference.\n    - typo in Corollary 2 -- do you mean linear combination of Gabor bases?\n    - It's recommended to add reference next to baseline names in tables (e.g. place citation next to 'FF Positional' if that refers a paper method)\n    - In Corollary 1, $\\Omega$ is not explicitly defined (though it's not hard to infer what it means).", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2666/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2666/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multiplicative Filter Networks", "authorids": ["~Rizal_Fathony1", "~Anit_Kumar_Sahu1", "~Devin_Willmott1", "~J_Zico_Kolter1"], "authors": ["Rizal Fathony", "Anit Kumar Sahu", "Devin Willmott", "J Zico Kolter"], "keywords": ["Deep Architectures", "Implicit Neural Representations", "Fourier Features"], "abstract": "Although deep networks are typically used to approximate functions over high dimensional inputs, recent work has increased interest in neural networks as function approximators for low-dimensional-but-complex functions, such as representing images as a function of pixel coordinates, solving differential equations, or representing signed distance fields or neural radiance fields.

The main insight in the paper an alternative scheme that just repeatedly applies nonlinear filters (sinusoids, gabor wavelet functions) to the networks input and multiplies together linear functions of these features.  The authors show that due to multiplicative properties of fourier/ gabor filters the end resulting mapping is also represented by a linear combination of fourier/gabor filters. Essentially the entire function is a linear function approximator over an exponential number of fourier/gabor basis functions with a low-rank, polynomial number of coefficients of the MFN network.  Experiments are done to compare the proposed FourierNet, GaborNets against past work (FF, FF with positional encoding, FF Gaussian SIREN).  The results are competitive with other methods and in certain cases GaborNets outperform in PSNR benchmarks for various problems.\n\nPros:  I like the paper very much, it is very well written and clear. The idea is novel.  \n\nCons: The empirical benchmarks are the same as used in the SIREN paper.
