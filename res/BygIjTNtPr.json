However, prior theoretical papers make assumptions that are equally or further unrealistic, as we discuss in the introduction. Common assumptions are:\n - GAN is quadratic in the discriminator and generator parameters.\n - Use full gradient, not stochastic gradients.\n(Examples of recent published work under such assumptions include: Mescheder et al., ICML, 2019; Daskalakis and Panageas, NeurIPS, 2018; Gidel et al., AISTATS, 2019.) Compared to these assumptions, convex-concavity is no more unrealistic. We believe the analyses under the different (unrealistic) assumptions provide complementary insights into the training dynamics of GANs.\n\nIn the past, the analysis of SGD for minimization in ML initially focused on the convex case. The highly cited AdaGrad paper by Duchi et al. in 2011 is one such example\nhttp://jmlr.org/papers/v12/duchi11a.html\nAs our understanding of SGD matured, attention shifted towards more realistic non-convex ML minimization setups. We believe the analysis of SGD-type methods for minimax problems will take a similar course. Currently, the minimax theory relies on unrealistic assumptions, but once our understanding matures, the field will be able to move on to more realistic setups.\n\nWe believe the validity of the convex-concavity assumption should be judged in comparison to the prior theoretical works, rather than how well the assumption matches the empirical practice. Our assumption of convex-concave (but non-differentiable and stochastic gradients) is very reasonable compared to the assumptions used in prior theoretical works.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper744/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper744/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ODE Analysis of Stochastic Gradient Methods with Optimism and Anchoring  for Minimax Problems and GANs", "authors": ["Ernest K.

Stating the result before the proof would help the reader to understand where the authors want to go.\"\n\nThank you for the suggestion. We have updated the structure to improve the readability. We avoided saying \"Theorem\" or \"convergence proof\"  to avoid discussing the existence and differentiability of solutions to the continuous-time ODEs. (We do not see such rigorous treatment of the continuous-time setup to be important since the continuous-time analysis serves merely as an illustration and inspiration for the discrete-time algorithm.)\n\n\n\"For the stochastic version of SimGD-A a new parameter is introduced without any comment or description on why it is necessary. Question) Is the condition only necessary for the proof? Does work in practice? If no, what is the best value for?\"\n\nDue to page limitations, we deferred the discussion on this matter to the appendix. The proof requires $\\varepsilon>0$, but we believe this is an artifact of the proof. In particular, we conjecture that Lemma 17 holds with $o(s/\\tau)$ rather than $\\mathcal{O}(s/\\tau)$, and, if so, it is possible to establish convergence with $\\varepsilon=0$. In practice, we observed that $\\varepsilon=0$ to work well.\n\n\"A FID above 40 for MNIST is very far from standard results.\"\n\nIndeed, our experiments are far from the state-of-the-art since it is a simple architecture without any modern techniques (e.g. spectral normalization). Our experiments only demonstrate that anchoring helps in some setups, not necessarily state-of-the-art setups. If the reviewers believe the experiments are a distraction, we are happy to remove them. We ask the reviewers to consider the theoretical contribution in their decision.\n\n\"Question) When you cite Lassale Principle you mention that if $z_\\infty$ is a limit point of $z(t)$ then starting at $z_\\infty$, you stay at a constant distance to $z_*$.

These three algorithm are first analysed in continuous time with an ODE perspective and then leverage these intuitions and techniques to analyze the discrete time versions.\n\nI think that these contributions are of interest of ICLR community, however, I have some concerns regarding the presentations of the results. \n\n*Decision*\nI vote for a weak accept that could move to an accept if the authors improve the presentation of the paper:\nThe paragraph \u201cRegularized dynamics and convergence\u2019 in Section 3.1 in quite hard to follow. This subsection is basically the proof of the convergence of the continuous version of  GD-O. Stating the result before the proof would help the reader to understand where the authors want to go. \nVery same point for The subsection 4.1\nFor the stochastic version of SimGD-A a new parameter $\\epsilon$ is introduced without any comment or description on why it is necessary. \nA FID above 40 for MNIST is very far from standard results (that are below 1). Thus I am not convinced by the practical advantage of Anchored Adam on these models that have performances results very far from the standard ones.  (for instance between 20 and 25 for CIFAR10 is very reasonable). It is maybe because you do not use convolutional layers in your architecture. I think that using a DGAN architecture (for instance the one from the pytorch tutorial https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html) would give the expected results (i.e. FID close to 0).\n\n*Questions*\n\n- When you cite Lassale Principle you mention that if $z_\\infty$ is a limit point of $z(t)$ then starting at $z_\\infty$, you stay at a constant distance to $z_*$.

First, we show that simGD, as is, converges with stochastic sub-gradients under strict convexity in the primal variable. Second, we generalize optimistic simGD to accommodate an optimism rate separate from the learning rate and show its convergence with full gradients. Finally, we present anchored simGD, a new method, and show convergence with stochastic subgradients.", "pdf": "/pdf/459366f08a19edac7812b5748f1ed399cb39c243.pdf", "paperhash": "ryu|ode_analysis_of_stochastic_gradient_methods_with_optimism_and_anchoring_for_minimax_problems_and_gans", "original_pdf": "/attachment/c00aa9883e3d604c5cda6b90d7ab1d16e48f773f.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nryu2020ode,\ntitle={{\\{}ODE{\\}} Analysis of Stochastic Gradient Methods with Optimism and Anchoring  for Minimax Problems and {\\{}GAN{\\}}s},\nauthor={Ernest K.
