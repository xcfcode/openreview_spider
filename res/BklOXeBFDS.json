The problems tackled here are important and the method is shown to improve over previous work in some cases.  On the down side, the evaluation may be missing one important method of comparison, the reasons for the proposed approach winning over previous work are not made explicit, and the empirical advantage of the approach is inconsistent (by my count, in the majority of cases the F1 advantage over previous work is within the standard error).  This paper has strengths but I feel it needs further refinement before publication.\n\nThe introduction of the paper claims that existing approaches for active learning on graphs are domain-specific and may not apply well to new domains.  But later, in the experiments, different reasons for the proposed approach's wins are given (in particular, on large graphs the proposed approach does relatively better vs. AGE which the paper suggests is due to the more complex nonlinear models used in the proposed approach).  In general, this paper\u2019s approach tends to win over the primary baseline (the AGE method from Cai et al. 2017), but the wins are relatively small and inconsistent (esp. taking into account the standard error) whether the methods are evaluated in the single-graph setting or the transfer learning setting (of the homologous or heterogeneous variety).  If the limitation of previous work was domain-specificity, I would expect to see much larger wins on the transfer learning setting.  In general, an analysis that explains more what is driving the gains of this approach over the AGE approach would help us know how to build on this paper\u2019s method in future work.\n\nI was curious why the paper does not compare against the following work, which also presents an approach that wins over AGE:\n\u201cActive Discriminative Network Representation Learning,\u201d Gao et al., IJCAI 2018\n\nLastly, the distillation-based approach, which learns graph-specific policies that are trained to fit their target graphs and to minimize their KL divergence from a single global shared policy, was interesting.  The fact that it doesn\u2019t work much better than the joint policy is somewhat disappointing, but it\u2019s still interesting.\n\nMinor:\nSec 3.2: unclosed parenthesis in first paragraph\n\u201cMoreover, we also average the struc2vec features of all previously annotated nodes to capture the historical information\u201d -- since the model has only node-level features, I didn\u2019t understand how this average across multiple nodes was fed in as a node feature.  Is it used in all nodes?

The main focus of the paper is not on the theoretical analysis. Instead, we aim at designing a method to integrate all these heuristics for prediction. Nevertheless, deriving theoretical proofs is still an important suggestion, and we will leave it as a future work.\n2.\tConsidering the correlation of data is a very intuitive suggestion. Indeed, the correlation of data is considered in our approach. This is because we leverage a GNN in our policy network, which is able to aggregate information from the neighbors of each node, and thereby capture the dependency of different nodes.\n3.\tWe will try to improve the writing and make it clearer in the revised draft.\n4.\tWe have added the details of the heuristic features in the updated draft.\n5.\tIn our paper, we formalize the problem as a sequential decision process, therefore we select different nodes step-by-step, instead of selecting all of them at once. Sorry about the confusion in writing, and we will keep polishing the writing.\n6.\tI guess that you are wondering the performance gain of using N_seed + N_budget labeled nodes for training over using N_seed labeled nodes for training. The results are presented in the figure 3. The accuracy of training with only the N_seed nodes is lower than the starting point of the curve corresponding to \u201crandom\u201d.\n7.\tThank you for pointing it out!

RL based framework is used. The labeled graph is treated as state and the action is labeling the nodes. Validation accuracy on the hold out set is used as reward. Further transfer learning framework is also proposed, where graph-specific policy and master policy are jointly learned. Experiments on benchmark dataset show the effectiveness of proposed method compared to several baselines.\n\nThe idea of applying RL on active learning with GCN seems to be new and it sounds natural and technically. Also the idea of transferring the learned policy to new graphs make sense for similar graphs. However, the empirical results are a bit weak and not convincing enough for me. Please find the detailed comments below.\n\n1. Is the state defined on node level or graph level? Eq (1) is defined on node level, but I believe it should be a global policy on graph.\n2. All the results have a rather high variance. To compare such results, the authors should make a significant test. Otherwise, one cannot say that the performance from one method is better than the other. Especially, for Table 3 and 4, DAG-distill performs not better than DAG-Joint.\n3. What do \"0-4, 5-9,...\" mean in Table 3?\n4. Can the authors show curve as in figure 2 for table 2 and 3. It is important to see the progress for active learning.\n5. Why the results differ so much in Figure 2 for only 1 query? I believe the first one should be randomly picked.
