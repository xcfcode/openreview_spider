We address below the questions:\n\n1) \"``I am very curious about the landscape or decision boundary analysis and visualization\"\n\nIn general, MMR-Universal significantly expands the regions where the classifier is affine, similarly to what MMR does. The difference is that MMR-Universal enlarges the linear regions so that all the $l_p$-balls for $p\\geq 1$ are contained. Since the decision boundary inside each linear region consists in a hyperplane and the linear regions are especially wide, the decision boundary is likely to be the union of portions of a few hyperplanes. The problem however is that this effect is in $2$ dimensions relatively limited as the differences between $l_p$-balls become much more pronounced  with increasing input dimension $d$.  In this short amount of time we could not yet come up  with a good example in $2$ dimensions resp. with an appropriate projection of the case in higher dimensions. \nWe agree with the reviewer that such an illustration will further provide intuition and is thus helpful and we will try hard to come up with this for the final version.\n\n2) \"``Try a few more classical CNN architectures\"\n\nWe will train for the final version the usual LeNet architecture and the large network from (Wong et al, 2018), as it is a standard choice for provable robustness, which is roughly 4 times larger than our current one. Moreover, we will extend the implementation of our method to handle residual connections, which do not make any difference to the algorithm from a theoretical point of view. At the moment we are running low on GPU resources due to the upcoming CVPR deadline - we are sorry that we have to postpone the additional results for larger models to the final version.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1788/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1788/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["francesco91.croce@gmail.com", "matthias.hein@uni-tuebingen.de"], "title": "Provable robustness against all adversarial $l_p$-perturbations for $p\\geq 1$", "authors": ["Francesco Croce", "Matthias Hein"], "pdf": "/pdf/d268e4313086ad7910f2635de8c10331842748f4.pdf", "TL;DR": "We introduce a method to train models with provable robustness wrt all the $l_p$-norms for $p\\geq 1$ simultaneously.", "abstract": "In recent years several adversarial attacks and defenses have been proposed.

We address the raised questions individually.\n\n1) \"The proposed regularization scheme does not come with any explicit robustness guarantee. Is it possible to show that a model that minimizes the regularized loss is guaranteed to be $l_p$ robust for some radius?\"\n\nIf the MMR-Universal regularization (stated in page 6) is successfully minimized during training and reaches zero for a particular training point, then for this point we have achieved robustness of $\\gamma_1$ wrt $l_1$ and $\\gamma_\\infty$ of $l_\\infty$, since no hyperplane, either region or decision boundary, is closer than those thresholds to any of the points of the training set (please see Theorem 2.1).\nTheorem 4.1 provides then for any $p\\in(1, \\infty)$ in Equation (7) the radius of the $l_p$-ball on which the decision does not change and is thus robust. In practice, on the test points some hyperplanes happen to be closer than the given thresholds even after training, so that the guarantees from Theorem 4.1 are smaller than the desired ones. However, since MMR-Universal expands also neighboring linear regions (where there are no training points), we can certify with the mixed-integer programming certification of (Tjeng et al, 2019) or the approach of (Wong and Kolter, 2018) $l_p$-balls with larger radii, achieving good provable robustness. As for all current certification methods we observe that the enforced robustness on the training set generalizes to the test set.\n\n2) \"In Appendix C.3, it is mentioned that the best values for $\\gamma_p$ were empirically found to be 1-2 times larger than the desired $\\epsilon_p$ robustness. Could this be formalized in theory?\"\n\nThe effectiveness of larger $\\gamma$ is an empirical observation, see also e.g. (Gowal et al, 2018). In practice, we use $\\gamma > \\epsilon$ in order to counter the fact that potentially the training is able to push the hyperplanes only partially, and not up to the desired threshold. It is an interesting question if one can \nback up this procedure with theoretical arguments.\n\n3) \"From Figure 2, it seems that there is an optimal ratio of $l_1$ to $l_\\infty$ robustness for which the $l_2$ guarantee is maximized. It would be interesting to see what this optimal ratio is for maximizing the $l_p$ guarantee, as a function of dimension d and p.\"\n\nThanks for this interesting question. We added in the Appendix A.3 the derivation of the optimal ratio as a function of $d$ for $p=2$, as well as the corresponding maximal improvement  of the bounds given by the convex hull over those obtained considering only the union of the $l_1$ and $l_\\infty$ balls. It turns out that the gain of the $l_2$-robustness guarantee of the convex hull  over to the union of the $l_1$-and $l_\\infty$-ball increases with dimension $d$ as $d^\\frac{1}{4}$. For $p\\neq 2$, it needs to be approximated numerically.\n\n4) \"In the experiments, the MMR-Universal scheme is compared with MMR+AT-$l_2$ and MMR+AT-$l_\\infty$. It would be interesting to compare it with MMR-$l_1$+AT-$l_\\infty$ or with MMR-$l_\\infty$+AT-$l_1$.\"\n\nWe have started the training and the evaluation of such models of MNIST and report them in Appendix C.5. We will add the other datasets in the final version. The preliminary analysis on MNIST suggests that the models have good provable robustness only in the norm for which MMR is used. Moreover, the model trained with MMR-$l_1$+AT-$l_\\infty$ shows non-trivial provable robustness also wrt $l_2$ (as it happens sometimes in Table 4), but comes with no guarantees wrt $l_\\infty$. In particular, we achieve no non-trivial robustness for the union of the $l_1$, $l_2$, $l_\\infty$-balls. This stresses again that enforcing provable robustness wrt\n$l_1$ and $l_\\infty$ as in MMR-Universal is the key for provable robustness wrt intermediate $l_p$-balls.\n\n5) \"In eq(1), is c intended to be the true label at x?\"\n\nYes, thanks for noticing this. We have fixed this.\n\n6) \"In Figure 2, the red curves are missing in the first and third plots.\"\n\nThe red curve is hidden by the green one, as they almost everywhere overlap and they are difficult to distinguish. The red curves can be seen for values of $\\norm{x}_1$ close to 1, zooming into the plots. We have added a note on this in the caption.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1788/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1788/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["francesco91.croce@gmail.com", "matthias.hein@uni-tuebingen.de"], "title": "Provable robustness against all adversarial $l_p$-perturbations for $p\\geq 1$", "authors": ["Francesco Croce", "Matthias Hein"], "pdf": "/pdf/d268e4313086ad7910f2635de8c10331842748f4.pdf", "TL;DR": "We introduce a method to train models with provable robustness wrt all the $l_p$-norms for $p\\geq 1$ simultaneously.", "abstract": "In recent years several adversarial attacks and defenses have been proposed.

The author proposes the MMR-Universal regularizer for ReLU based networks. It enforces l1 and l infinity robustness and leads to be provably robust with any lp norm attack for p larger than and equal to one.\n\nStrength Bullets:\n\n1. Using convex hull to enforce robustness, it is very reasonable and straightforward which highly aligns our intuition.\n2. The author provides detailed and conniving derivations and proof. And the results in table 2 do achieve the state-of-the-art provable robustness.\n3. It is the first robust regularizer that is able to provide non-trivial robustness guarantees for multiple lp balls. The lp balls don't contain any other. It also is one of the most straightforward methods among all potential similar methods.\n\nWeakness Bullets:\n\n1. I am very curious about the landscape or decision boundary analysis and visualization. For the author's MMR-Universal regularization, it should give the model a very \"good\" decision boundary which has clear marginal between any two categories. In my opinion, it is necessary to evidence to convince more readers.\n2. Try a few more classical CNN architectures. \n\nRecommendation:\n\nDue to the logical derivations and supportive experiment results, this is a weak accept."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1788/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1788/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["francesco91.croce@gmail.com", "matthias.hein@uni-tuebingen.de"], "title": "Provable robustness against all adversarial $l_p$-perturbations for $p\\geq 1$", "authors": ["Francesco Croce", "Matthias Hein"], "pdf": "/pdf/d268e4313086ad7910f2635de8c10331842748f4.pdf", "TL;DR": "We introduce a method to train models with provable robustness wrt all the $l_p$-norms for $p\\geq 1$ simultaneously.", "abstract": "In recent years several adversarial attacks and defenses have been proposed.

This result is based on the insight that a guarantee for l_1 and l_\\infty robustness of a piecewise affine classifier also guarantees robustness within the convex hull of the union of the l_1 and l_\\infty balls. The paper then proposes a regularization scheme called MMR-Universal for a ReLU neural network that simultaneously trains for l_1 and l_\\infty robustness. This scheme is based on maximizing the linear regions of the network as in Croce et al., AISTATS 2019. Using the main result of the paper, it is implied that the proposed regularization scheme also enforces l_p robustness for any p \\geq 1.\n\nMain comments: (1) The paper provides an interesting result that guarantees l_p robustness for a piecewise affine classifier based on only l_1 and l_\\infty robustness. (2) The experiments show that the proposed regularization scheme is indeed effective in simultaneously guaranteeing robustness with respect to all l_p balls.\n\nDetailed comments:\n\n- The proposed regularization scheme does not come with any explicit robustness guarantee. Is it possible to show that a model that minimizes the regularized loss is guaranteed to be l_p robust for some radius? In Appendix C.3, it is mentioned that the best values for \\gamma_p were empirically found to be 1-2 times the desired \\epsilon_p robustness. Could this be formalized in theory?\n\n- From Figure 2, it seems that there is an optimal ratio of l_1 to l_\\infty robustness for which the l_2 guarantee is maximized. It would be interesting to see what this optimal ratio is for maximizing the l_p guarantee, as a function of dimension d and p.\n\n- In the experiments, the MMR-Universal scheme is compared with MMR+AT-l_2 and MMR+AT-l_\\infty. It would be interesting to compare it with MMR-l_1+AT-l_\\infty or with MMR-l_\\infty+AT-l_1.\n\n- In eq(1), is c intended to be the true label at x?\n\n- In Figure 2, the red curves are missing in the first and third plots."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1788/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1788/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["francesco91.croce@gmail.com", "matthias.hein@uni-tuebingen.de"], "title": "Provable robustness against all adversarial $l_p$-perturbations for $p\\geq 1$", "authors": ["Francesco Croce", "Matthias Hein"], "pdf": "/pdf/d268e4313086ad7910f2635de8c10331842748f4.pdf", "TL;DR": "We introduce a method to train models with provable robustness wrt all the $l_p$-norms for $p\\geq 1$ simultaneously.", "abstract": "In recent years several adversarial attacks and defenses have been proposed.
