We believe that addressing your comments has led to a stronger version of our paper.\n\n>Relation to [1] Bender et al., ICML 2018\n\nThank you for pointing us to this interesting work. [1] indeed highlights the problems arising from training a one-shot model corresponding to multiple architectures with shared parameters, and circumvents them by randomly dropping paths during training.  However, this differs significantly from our work, where we derive a mathematical solution to address this problem. In fact, both solutions can be used jointly, and this is what is done in our experiments. Indeed, in all our architecture search experiments, ENAS relies on path dropout with a probability of 0.5, both when incorporating WPL and when not. Therefore, our experiments show that our approach can further improve the results of the strategy used in [1]. We have revised our paper so as to explain our use of path dropout and give proper credit to [1].\n\n\n> Relation to [2] Luo et al., NIPS 2018 (NAO)\n\nWe became aware of NAO shortly after the ICLR deadline. In essence, the contribution of this work is to replace the reinforcement learning portion of ENAS with a gradient based auto-encoder. This can still suffer from multi-model forgetting, and again is thus orthogonal to our work. To demonstrate this, we incorporated WPL in the NAO framework and re-ran our RNN experiments with this new search method. The details of these experiments are provided in the appendix of our revised paper. These experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our approach with respect to both [1] and [2]. In short, we observed that\nthe use of WPL reduces multi-model forgetting  in NAO, as in ENAS, and this for various dropout rates;\nwhile increasing the dropout rate indeed limits the multi-model forgetting effect, the resulting model consistently benefits from using WPL.\nWe believe that these experiments confirm that our paper addresses an important issue, occurring in many neural architecture search strategies that use shared model representations. This further strengthens our contribution.\n\n\n> Relatively low performance of ENAS on CIFAR-10\n\nTo implement our approach, we used a publicly available PyTorch implementation of ENAS for the RNN case that we further developed. For CIFAR-10, we extended this implementation to the CNN case. The choice of reimplementation of ENAS  was motivated by the simplicity and flexibility of PyTorch. \n\nTo evaluate the final cells obtained by ENAS-WPL and ENAS we trained them in a fair training, without any hyperparameter tuning. The mismatch in scores is solely due to a difference in hyperparameter tuning, both for search and training from scratch, since ENAS final training is highly optimized. However, we believe this not to be a real issue, since our point is truly to demonstrate the benefits of accounting for multi-model forgetting, which our experiments do.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper702/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper702/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper702/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Overcoming Multi-model Forgetting", "abstract": "We identify a phenomenon, which we refer to as *multi-model forgetting*, that occurs when sequentially training multiple deep networks with partially-shared parameters; the performance of previously-trained models degrades as one optimizes a subsequent one, due to the overwriting of shared parameters.

Below, we address their main concerns and have revised our paper accordingly.\n\n>Branding: Brainwashing vs forgetting\n\nIn the literature, \u201cforgetting\u201d traditionally refers to the scenario where one aims to train a single model on two different datasets. By contrast, we aim to train multiple models on a single data, which motivated our use of the term \u201cbrainwashing\u201d. We agree with the reviewer, however, that the term \u201cforgetting\u201d has recently started being used in a looser sense. Therefore, we have revised our paper to refer to our approach as \u201cmulti-model forgetting\u201d.\n\n\n>Novelty over EWC\n\nThere is clear technical novelty in our paper, which stems from the fact that, while EWC aims to maximize the posterior probability p(\\theta | D1, D2), we maximize p(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\theta_s | D), where \\theta_1 and \\theta_2 denote the parameters specific to each model and \\theta_s those shared by both models. Heuristically modifying the EWC loss to fit our two-model scenario would be mathematically unjustified, and we therefore had to derive the equations for our formalism so as to reach WPL loss.\n\nOur derivation led to a new term in Equation (3), v^T \\Omega v, which encodes the interaction between the two models. This term will never appear in EWC, nor in any single-model forgetting formulation. The fact that WPL looks similar to EWC loss is then only due to our use of a Laplace approximation of this term with the diagonal Fisher information matrix as covariance. However, other approximations, such as a Laplace one with a full covariance matrix, will lead to loss functions that differ fundamentally from the EWC one. We have clarified this in the revised paper and believe our mathematical formulation of the parameter sharing scenario and its general solution in Equation (3) to be solid technical contributions.\n\n\n>Relation to Xu & Zhu, NIPS 2018.\n\nThis paper addresses a fundamentally different problem from the one we tackle. In essence, given Model A trained on Dataset A, Xu & Zhu, NIPS 2018, use an NAS-like strategy to train Model B on a different Dataset B. While Model B shares some parameters with Model A, absolutely no forgetting occurs, because the parameters of Model A are fixed. As such, this work does not address forgetting, but rather aims to compensate for the sub-optimality of Model A\u2019s parameters for Dataset B via NAS. While interesting, this idea is orthogonal to ours. In fact, this method could benefit from relying on WPL when searching for the best Model B.

Below, we address the main concern.\n\n> Incremental advances\n\nOur work is not incremental. While weight sharing is popular, multi-model forgetting has been neither explicitly acknowledged, nor carefully studied. There is clear technical novelty in our paper, which stems from the fact that, while EWC aims to maximize the posterior probability p(\\theta | D1, D2), we maximize p(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\theta_s | D), where \\theta_1 and \\theta_2 denote the parameters specific to each model and \\theta_s those shared by both models. Heuristically modifying the EWC loss to fit our two-model scenario would be mathematically unjustified, and we therefore had to derive the equations for our formalism so as to reach WPL loss.\n\nOur derivation led to a new term in Equation (3), v^T \\Omega v, which encodes the interaction between the two models. This term will never appear in EWC, nor in any single-model forgetting formulation. The fact that WPL looks similar to EWC loss is then only due to our use of a Laplace approximation of this term with the diagonal Fisher information matrix as covariance. However, other approximations, such as a Laplace one with a full covariance matrix, will lead to loss functions that differ fundamentally from the EWC one. We have clarified this in the revised paper and believe our mathematical formulation of the parameter sharing scenario and its general solution in Equation (3) to be solid technical contributions.\n\nFurthermore, we believe that our new experiments using WPL in the NAO framework of Luo et al., NIPS 2018,  further confirm that our paper addresses an important issue that occurs in many neural architecture search strategies that use shared model representations. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper702/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper702/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper702/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Overcoming Multi-model Forgetting", "abstract": "We identify a phenomenon, which we refer to as *multi-model forgetting*, that occurs when sequentially training multiple deep networks with partially-shared parameters; the performance of previously-trained models degrades as one optimizes a subsequent one, due to the overwriting of shared parameters.

[1] discussed the properties of \u201cone-shot model\u201d, which means that several different architectures are unified into the same model by sharing model weights. Furthermore, [1] discussed \u201cneural brainwashing\u201d (although not with the same name) and how to handle it in a very simple way (by randomly dropping path).

We believe that the problem statement for brainwashing is very different from the forgetting. Throughout the paper (e.g.,  paragraph 2 of the Introduction, Section 3.1.1), we explain this difference, i.e., catastrophic forgetting happens when training a single model for multiple tasks, while the brainwashing occurs when training  multiple models on a single task.\n\nIndeed, In \u00ab overcoming catastrophic forgetting \u00bb, the authors maximize the posterior probability p(\\theta | D1, D2) while in \u00ab overcoming neural brainwashing \u00bb, we maximize p(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\theta_s | D), with \\theta_s refering to the shared parameters between two different models. Mathematically speaking, the two problems are fundamentally different. Catastrophic forgetting does not deal with parameter sharing across different models and only considers a single model with parameters \\theta.  In our paper, we focus on tackling the problem where multiple models are sharing part of their architectures. We formulate our final loss through a completely different mathematical derivation and coincidentally ends in a similar formalism."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper702/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper702/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper702/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Overcoming Multi-model Forgetting", "abstract": "We identify a phenomenon, which we refer to as *multi-model forgetting*, that occurs when sequentially training multiple deep networks with partially-shared parameters; the performance of previously-trained models degrades as one optimizes a subsequent one, due to the overwriting of shared parameters.
