For completeness, we offer the following response summarizing our incorporation of the reviewer feedback to improve future versions of our manuscript. \n\nIndeed our algorithms are both simple to understand and simple to implement, with various strengths such as determinism, performance, or runtime. In fact, we have subsequently improved the runtime from polynomial time to near-linear (or near input-sparsity) runtime. This was achieved by incorporating a reviewer's remark that the optimal solution to our SDP is not necessary to achieve our approximation guarantee. Similarly, we only need to compute an approximate SVD rather than a full SVD to achieve our guarantees, which can be done in near input-sparsity runtime rather than matrix multiplication runtime. In summary, our algorithms can be further optimized to use near-linear runtime rather than polynomial runtime. \n\nWe have also significantly expanded our experimental evaluations to incorporate empirical comparisons to the suggested state-of-the-art SPCA solvers (JOTA 2016 and CVPR 2019). Our SDP-based approach not only recovers the optimal solution in smaller datasets, but also performs competitively with the aforementioned state of the art algorithms on larger datasets. Given the comparisons with other relevant methods, we show that our algorithms can provide interpretable sparse PCA and in particular, the output of SDP-based algorithm can indeed match with the accuracy of previous methods."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2624/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2624/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Approximation Algorithms for Sparse Principal Component Analysis", "authorids": ["~Agniva_Chowdhury1", "~Petros_Drineas1", "~David_Woodruff2", "~Samson_Zhou1"], "authors": ["Agniva Chowdhury", "Petros Drineas", "David Woodruff", "Samson Zhou"], "keywords": ["Sparse PCA", "Principal component analysis", "Randomized linear algebra", "Singular value decomposition"], "abstract": "Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used dimension reduction technique in machine learning and multivariate statistics.

We agree that more thorough comparison to the works of  [d\u2019Aspremont et al., 2014] and [Papailiopoulos et al., 2013] would have been helpful in distinguishing our results. Namely, [d\u2019Aspremont et al., 2014] evaluates the SDP relaxation of the problem without theoretical guarantees on the quality of the output, whereas we give provable and explicit guarantees on the quality of our output. Similarly, the results of [Papailiopoulos et al., 2013] are expressed in terms of a ratio of eigenvalues. Thus their theoretical guarantees have limited context without any assumptions on the ratio of eigenvalues in the input. Our results do not require such an assumption.\n\nIn the updated version, along with other relevant methods, we also included a comparison of our algorithms with the spannogram-based method of [Papailiopoulos et al., 2013] and found that our Algorithm 5 indeed results in a solution very similar to their output. However, we also note that in larger datasets, to get a highly accurate output from [Papailiopoulos et al., 2013], one typically needs d > 3, which makes the implementation significantly slow. \n\nOn the other hand,  in our context, [d\u2019Aspremont et al., 2014] did not seem to provide any explicit implementation that returns a k-sparse vector and therefore, we did not have any algorithmic results for a direct comparison.\n\nUsing the pitprops dataset, we plotted the lower bounds of our theoretical guarantees along with [Papailiopoulos et al., 2013] to verify the tightness of our bounds. We assume epsilon=0.1 and found that the lower bound of our SDP-based method (Algorithm 5) is indeed very close to that of [Papailiopoulos et al., 2013] (with d=3). However as mentioned before, the accuracy parameter of [Papailiopoulos et al., 2013] typically relies on the spectrum of A. For a highly accurate output of [Papailiopoulos et al., 2013], epsilon can be much smaller depending on the structure of A, in which case the difference between the lower bounds of our Algorithm 5 and [Papailiopoulos et al., 2013] is even smaller.\n\nWe do note that although the current analyses of our Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3 are based on exact SVD, in our implementations we have used fast SVD algorithms to speed up the running time. As suggested by AnonReviewer1, we have also included the corresponding analyses using approximate SVD in the revised version.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2624/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2624/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Approximation Algorithms for Sparse Principal Component Analysis", "authorids": ["~Agniva_Chowdhury1", "~Petros_Drineas1", "~David_Woodruff2", "~Samson_Zhou1"], "authors": ["Agniva Chowdhury", "Petros Drineas", "David Woodruff", "Samson Zhou"], "keywords": ["Sparse PCA", "Principal component analysis", "Randomized linear algebra", "Singular value decomposition"], "abstract": "Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used dimension reduction technique in machine learning and multivariate statistics.

We respectfully disagree with the notion that none of our algorithms really work; we instead emphasize the advantages of each algorithm.\n\nOur first algorithm is deterministic, which is often necessary for settings in which randomness is expensive and also interesting for theoretical purposes. For example, deterministic algorithms are sometimes needed in the presence of adaptivity - one cannot use the same randomness for randomized algorithms if you update the matrix in a way that depends on the previous answer, e.g., if the input is chosen adversarially. \n\nAlthough our second algorithm is randomized, it is simple to implement and very fast in practice. Thus our second algorithm is especially useful in settings where extremely high accuracy is not necessary. Our third algorithm is more complicated than the previous algorithms, but it also performs the best in practice. In fact, our experiments show that our third algorithm is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms, even though we have not fully optimized its performance. \n\nWe agree with the observation that the variance of the sparsity could be large even though the expectation is small. However, note that we can upper bound the probability that the sparsity of a single instance is bad, using Markov's inequality.

Although we make no assumptions on the leading eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, the leading eigenvector is indeed usually sparse in many applications. For example, [d'Orsi, et. al., 2020] assumes that the covariance matrix is formed by an outer product of a single sparse vector and some Gaussian noise. It should be noted that even under these assumptions, [d'Orsi, et. al., 2020] show lower bounds for non-negligible optimality gaps. \n\nAlthough their gap is significantly better than ours, their results may indicate stronger lower bounds for non-negligible optimality gaps in our setting, where we do not assume any input distribution. Thus an interpretation of our error guarantee is that our algorithm performs well especially when the top eigenvector is sparse, but its performance decays gracefully as the top eigenvector contains more nonzero entries. Moreover, we empirically show that the parameter alpha is Theorem 4.1 is quite small in practice.\n\nAs noted after Theorem 2.2, we agree that our analysis obtaining 3/8 probability of success can be generalized to arbitrary 1-delta probability of success.

The theoretical findings in this paper is presented clearly and looks solid. However, my major concern is the meaningfulness of the problem (in particular, the setting that imposes no assumption on the input matrix) studied in this paper (see cons below). Hopefully the authors can address my concern in the rebuttal period. \n\n \n##########################################################################Pros: \n\n \n1. The paper studies the sparse PCA problem. While no assumptions is imposed on the input covariance matrix, the authors give theoretical guarantees on the optimality gap (i.e. the gap between the optimal value and the objective value achieved by the solution) as well as the sparsity level of the solution. \n\n2. The authors provide numerical experiments to illustrate their theoretical findings for the three presented algorithms.\n\n \n##########################################################################\n\nCons: \n\n \n1. The sparse PCA problem studied in prior literatures aims to estimate the leading eigenvectors of a covariance matrix under the high dimensional setting, when the leading eigenvectors are assumed to be sparse. This paper imposes no constraint on the input covariance matrix. This leads to my major concerns as follows:\n\n(i) Is the problem still meaningful when we do not assume that the leading eigenvectors of the input covariance matrix are not sparse? If this is the case, I think it is not reasonable to seek for a sparse estimate of the leading eigenvector.\n\n(ii) In the case when the top eigenvector is sparse, the theoretical findings in this paper does not provide guarantees that the output of the three algorithms are reliable approximation of the top eigenvector. For Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3, the results in Theorem 2.2 and 3.1 indicates that there is a nonnegligible optimality gap, which can be as large as half the optimal value. For Algorithm 3, the results in Theorem 4.1 also relies on the properties of the SDP solution (through constants $\\alpha$ and $\\kappa(Z)$), which also might result in a large optimality gap. \n\nI understand that the main purpose of this paper is to study SPCA problem under no assumptions on the covariance matrix, so it might not be necessary to address (ii). In that case, I suggest the authors provide more explanations for the meaning of solving SPCA problem (equation (1)) for general input covariance matrix, as well as the implications of the theoretical guarantees (e.g. the reason why the outputs of the three algorithms are reliable/meaningful estimates, given the fact that they satisfy the theoretical guarantees shown in the theorems) to help address (i).\n\n2.

The analysis of Algorithm 2 and 3 are based on full SVD whose complexity is $O(n^3)$. The authors also mentioned that we can use iterative methods to replace full SVD in practice.  Hence, I think it is necessary to provide the theoretical analysis for the proposed frameworks with inexact SVD and establish the error bounds contain the error from approximation of SVD. Similarly, it is also desired to give the results for Algorithm 5 when we only obtain an approximate solution of problem (2).\n\n2. It is prefer to test the proposed algorithms on large scale datasets, which could make the paper be more convincing to machine learning community. Additionally, since  $O(n^3)$ is unacceptable for large $n$, it is necessary to implement the ideas of this paper with inexact SVD and report the corresponding empirical results.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2624/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2624/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Approximation Algorithms for Sparse Principal Component Analysis", "authorids": ["~Agniva_Chowdhury1", "~Petros_Drineas1", "~David_Woodruff2", "~Samson_Zhou1"], "authors": ["Agniva Chowdhury", "Petros Drineas", "David Woodruff", "Samson Zhou"], "keywords": ["Sparse PCA", "Principal component analysis", "Randomized linear algebra", "Singular value decomposition"], "abstract": "Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used dimension reduction technique in machine learning and multivariate statistics.
