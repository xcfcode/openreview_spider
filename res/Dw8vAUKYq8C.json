Instead of training with reinforcement learning (as is typical), the authors develop a procedure for generating \"glimpse sequences\" that can be effectively used as supervision. Models trained in this way produce qualitatively \"better\" glimpse sequences, higher accuracy, and converge in fewer steps. There was some disagreement and discussion about the merits of the paper. Overall, there were some major concerns:\n- The process for obtaining glimpse sequences is very computationally expensive. The authors argue that this cost can be amortized because the same glimpse sequences can be computed once for a given dataset and reused. However, there was limited real-world motivation for this setup, apart from mentioning neural architecture search (a niche method that is not widely used, and probably has never been used to develop hard-attention models).\n- The method relies on a \"convincing\" generative model for a given dataset. This limits experiments to simple datasets with unrealistically-constrained visual structure. The authors point out that as generative models get better, their method could be applied to more realistic datasets, but as it stands the experimental validation is correspondingly weak.\n- The improvement in performance is not huge - the \"WSRAM\" baseline outperforms the use of \"near-optimal\" glimpse sequences. While it is certainly true that the proposed method converges faster, the fact that the proposed method requires such an expensive preprocessing step downgrades this benefit significantly\n- While the authors provided insightful distillation-based baselines in the rebuttal, it remains to be seen whether simple distillation from stronger RAM models (e.g. WSRAM which outperforms the proposed method) could be made to work better/more efficiently.\nThese factors lead to a reject decision overall."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Near-Optimal Glimpse Sequences for Training Hard Attention Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~William_Harvey1", "~Michael_Teng1", "~Frank_Wood2"], "authors": ["William Harvey", "Michael Teng", "Frank Wood"], "keywords": ["attention", "hard attention", "variational inference", "bayesian optimal experimental design"], "abstract": "Hard visual attention is a promising approach to reduce the computational burden of modern computer vision methodologies.

It uses BAYESIAN OPTIMAL EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN to achieve this. Using the obtained annotations, hard attention can be trained with a partially supervised way.\n\nMy concerns mainly focus on the motivation and evaluation. Specifically, the authors claim using hard attention to do image classification may enable the use of modern approaches to computer vision in low-power settings such as mobile devices. But from the paper (besides the computation of glimpse sequence is computationally expensive.) at the end, the proposed method needs to run the glimpse network several times, and the structure of the glimpse network is similar to standard classification network, which needs only a single forward pass on the whole image. I'm doubt adopting the proposed approach can truly lead to a low power solution.  Image classification seems like an unsuitable task to show the benefits of hard attention.  Even if we would like to test on image classification, we need to include more baselines, such as standard convnets and compare them to the proposed method in terms of computational complexity and effectiveness. \n\nOther issues:\n  Stochastic image completion involves creating an empirical image distribution with 1.5 million images. Will this lead to an unfair comparison or data leakage?\n  It's better to include standard datasets for image classification such as ImageNet, CIFAR, stc. \n  It's interesting to see whether a hard attention method trained with REINFORCE will obtain a similar glimpse sequence and the proposed annotation method.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2567/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2567/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Near-Optimal Glimpse Sequences for Training Hard Attention Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~William_Harvey1", "~Michael_Teng1", "~Frank_Wood2"], "authors": ["William Harvey", "Michael Teng", "Frank Wood"], "keywords": ["attention", "hard attention", "variational inference", "bayesian optimal experimental design"], "abstract": "Hard visual attention is a promising approach to reduce the computational burden of modern computer vision methodologies.

We view the primary contribution of this work as a method for speeding up hard attention training. Although this involves initially annotating the data with glimpse sequences, the primary purpose of these is to use in our method for faster training. We will ensure this is clear in the paper.\n\n2. First, we would like to clarify that we only require multiple runs in that the glimpse network is used at each timestep 1,...,T. We run the hard attention network (for T steps) only once to classify each image. This is in contrast to e.g. \u201cMultiple Object Recognition with Visual Attention\u201d (Ba et al., 2015), who average classification outputs over multiple runs of a hard attention network. We will edit the manuscript to state this explicitly. Regarding the comparison with a standard CNN, we have updated the appendix with preliminary results of such a comparison (see Appendix D). This shows that, by using a form of \u201cearly stopping\u201d, where the network can choose to take less than $T$ glimpses, hard attention can outperform state-of-the-art CNNs (at least for less than $7 \\times 10^5$ FLOPs). Before the camera-ready, we will provide a more systematic study and investigate whether different hard attention architectures can provide better performance for regimes where more FLOPs are allowed.\n\n3. We show examples of near-optimal glimpse sequences for CUB in Figure 13. For CelebA-HQ, we show heatmaps of glimpse locations trained with PS-NOGS in Figures 4 and 9-11. Although these are not exactly the near-optimal glimpse sequences, they follow a very similar distribution. We have not observed any patterns of note that are not visible in these figures, or described in the captions.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2567/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2567/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Near-Optimal Glimpse Sequences for Training Hard Attention Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~William_Harvey1", "~Michael_Teng1", "~Frank_Wood2"], "authors": ["William Harvey", "Michael Teng", "Frank Wood"], "keywords": ["attention", "hard attention", "variational inference", "bayesian optimal experimental design"], "abstract": "Hard visual attention is a promising approach to reduce the computational burden of modern computer vision methodologies.

We have updated the paper with a new \u201cPS-RAM\u201d baseline. Based on your suggestion, it takes a network trained with RAM and uses it to generate supervision sequences. We then train later networks using our partially supervised training objective with these supervision sequences. To summarise the results, we find that PS-RAM leads to faster training than RAM with a small cost to accuracy (0.1% on average for CelebA-HQ and 0.5% for CUB). Comparing PS-RAM to PS-NOGS, we see that they reach the same accuracy on CelebA-HQ but PS-NOGS trains 20% faster. On CUB, we see that PS-NOGS achieves a final accuracy 1.2% higher. The difference in performance may be explained by the effect shown in Figure 4: glimpses sampled with RAM are almost uniformly distributed after the first time step, whereas glimpses made with PS-NOGS are concentrated on the salient regions and so may provide a better learning signal"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2567/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2567/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Near-Optimal Glimpse Sequences for Training Hard Attention Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~William_Harvey1", "~Michael_Teng1", "~Frank_Wood2"], "authors": ["William Harvey", "Michael Teng", "Frank Wood"], "keywords": ["attention", "hard attention", "variational inference", "bayesian optimal experimental design"], "abstract": "Hard visual attention is a promising approach to reduce the computational burden of modern computer vision methodologies.

Concatenating the mask would then be necessary to know that this was observed and grey, rather than simply unobserved. While it is unclear whether this would be an issue in practice, concatenating the mask prevents any such problems for very little cost.\n\n**Is $g_{AVP}$ trained with random glimpses?** The glimpses are random in the sense that their locations are sampled randomly. This will mean that they are sometimes taken in an \u201cuninformative\u201d location and the label cannot be accurately guessed. This is not a problem: we merely need $g_{AVP}$, to approximate the posterior over class labels given a series of glimpses; it does not need to \u201ccorrectly\u201d guess the class label every time. \n\n**Why do we name it the attentional variational posterior?** We use \u201cattentional\u201d to emphasise that the distribution is conditioned on the parts of the images that have been attended to and not, for example, the whole image.\n\n**Do we need to train a different $r_{img}$ every time before testing on a new dataset? Is it possible to only condition on the current image to create glimpse supervisions with instead of using image completion?** We do indeed need to create $r_{img}$ separately for every dataset. The method you suggest of using the current image would mean estimating the expectation in Eq. 5 with only a single sample of $\\mathcal{I}$, so is unlikely to work well.\n\n**Can we if tell the generated supervision sequences might hurt the performance?** We can only suggest training both with and without supervision, and comparing the results, although this is an interesting avenue for future work.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2567/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2567/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Near-Optimal Glimpse Sequences for Training Hard Attention Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~William_Harvey1", "~Michael_Teng1", "~Frank_Wood2"], "authors": ["William Harvey", "Michael Teng", "Frank Wood"], "keywords": ["attention", "hard attention", "variational inference", "bayesian optimal experimental design"], "abstract": "Hard visual attention is a promising approach to reduce the computational burden of modern computer vision methodologies.

Is $g_{AVP}$ trained through some form of model distillation with the attention model?\n\nWhat types of hand-crafted glimpse sequences are beneficial for the model? CUBs annotated features were not intended to be a glimpse sequence, so how was the order of the annotations chosen?\n\nCan the authors provide a pseudo-code description of the attention algorithm? This would help clarify the pipeline of how $g_{AVP}$ is both trained and integrated into the larger model.\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2567/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2567/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Near-Optimal Glimpse Sequences for Training Hard Attention Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~William_Harvey1", "~Michael_Teng1", "~Frank_Wood2"], "authors": ["William Harvey", "Michael Teng", "Frank Wood"], "keywords": ["attention", "hard attention", "variational inference", "bayesian optimal experimental design"], "abstract": "Hard visual attention is a promising approach to reduce the computational burden of modern computer vision methodologies.

With the methodology from BOED literature, this paper approximate the optimal behavior to generate 'near optimal' sequences to partially supervise the learning of hard attention.\nOverall, I think the paper is easy to read, the proposed idea is solid and well-motivated, although the actual implementation seems to be quite complicated which involves additional two different models (attentional variational posterior and image completion model). It is hard to tell how the learning of these modules will affect the final performance. \n\nAdditionally I have some specific questions regarding to the paper:\n(1) I am a bit confused with Figure 3 and Sec 4. It is mentioned that the mask is concatenated as an additional channel. However, since you already mask the unobserved pixels to zero, why it is still needed?\n(2) Following Eq (7), is $g_{AVP}$ trained with randomly sampled glimpses? How can we make sure we can predict the label correctly from a random glimpse? Also, why it is called \"attentional\" posterior?\n(3) How the quality of $r_{img}$ will impact the results? Do we need to train a different $r_{img}$ first every time before testing on a new dataset? Is it possible to only condition on the current image to create glimpse supervisions with $g_{AVP}$ instead of using image completion?\n(4) How to inspect if the generated supervisions might hurt the performance? For instance, as the supervisions are generated to approximately maximize the entropy reduction, it is still possible that such attention is not optimal for neural network to predict the final label. \n\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2567/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2567/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Near-Optimal Glimpse Sequences for Training Hard Attention Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~William_Harvey1", "~Michael_Teng1", "~Frank_Wood2"], "authors": ["William Harvey", "Michael Teng", "Frank Wood"], "keywords": ["attention", "hard attention", "variational inference", "bayesian optimal experimental design"], "abstract": "Hard visual attention is a promising approach to reduce the computational burden of modern computer vision methodologies.
