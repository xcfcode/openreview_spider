The right hand side of Eq(1) does not satisfy the rule of the probability. i.e., it does not satisfy $\\sum_y P(y|x) = 1$ when $\\sum_y P(y\u2019|x) = 1$ and $m$ is a non-zero constant.\nThus the difference between two KLs around Eq.(5) does not make sense because $KL[P|Q]$ works as a valid divergence only when $P$ and $Q$ are probability distributions.\n2. We cannot derive Eq.(3) from Eq.(1)\n3.  If we add $m$ inside the exponential at the numerator for all the class $i$, it is equivalent not to add anything because it vanishes after normalization.\n4. There is a lack of the explanation why the adversarial training is not sufficient. It seems for me adversarial training will be a natural choice if we want to make the model robust to the adversarial training. \n\nStrange statement\\\nThe authors wrote \u201cSince the ground truth distribution of training data is **known**, $H(P(y))$ is a constant and hence,\u201d\nUsually we assume the ground truth distribution is **unknown**, if we know the ground truth distribution, there is no need to train the model. We can get immediately the minimizer of the loss. This may be a typo, but even if it is the mistake of \u201cunknown\u201d, still the statement is strange because it does not relate to whether $H(P(y))$ is a constant or not.\n\nExperiment is not convincing\\\nThe adversarial training works well for this experiment. Although the authors claim the adversarial training has a noticeable sacrifice of accuracy on clean examples. The mechanism is not well studied.\nAlso the authors tested their method only on MNIST and CIFAR10. It is not so appealing.\n\nReference\\\nThe intuition of the authors claim has a relationship with the distributional robust learning.

The proposed method does share a similar motivation with label smoothing and large margin learning, yet with noticeable difference. The motivation discussed in the original submission is not well prepared and may confuse the readers and hence, we alternate our analyses of motivation in the revised version by clarifying the relations with label smoothing and large margin learning. Specifically, we identify that label smoothing could be viewed as a regularization of margin between the true label distribution and the output distribution, while the resultant model prefers a large margin between the features of different classes. Also considering the monotonical increasing property of softmax, the margin induced from label smoothing is similar to the large margin idea used in like arcface or cosface, at least in the perspective of the margin property of the well-trained models using label smoothing or a large margin-based loss. This is what we are trying to explain in the original submission, and is how the inference region comes.\n\nNext we explain the difference between our method and cosface. While the proposed method could be viewed as a margin-based loss, the difference to the arcface or cosface is how the margin (or inference information) is applied to the logits. Arcface or cosface normalizes the features and the weights such that the resultant features are located on a hyper-sphere, and the training process regresses the class targets along the surface of the hyper-sphere. Instead, the proposed method only normalizes the features but not the weights in order to locate the features in a free space, in which case the regression process can be performed in any direction. We advocate that freeing the sphere constraint will bring performance improvement of adversarial defencing, which is demonstrated in the experiments. The reason of the effectiveness may be that the adversarial perturbation causes a large variation in the feature space. Constraining the features on a hyper-sphere would bring a large feature shift if the normalization direction (to the sphere) is undesirable. By contrast, the proposed method prefers isotropic tolerance to feature perturbations, hence being better.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1638/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1638/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1638/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1638/Authors"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1638/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving robustness of softmax corss-entropy loss via inference information", "authorids": ["~Bingbing_Song1", "hewei@mail.ynu.edu.cn", "liurenyang@mail.ynu.edu.cn", "~Shui_Yu1", "~Ruxin_Wang1", "~Mingming_Gong1", "~Tongliang_Liu1", "zwei@ynu.edu.cn"], "authors": ["Bingbing Song", "Wei He", "Renyang Liu", "Shui Yu", "Ruxin Wang", "Mingming Gong", "Tongliang Liu", "Wei Zhou"], "keywords": ["Adversarial defense", "Loss function", "Neural networks robustness"], "abstract": "Adversarial examples easily mislead the vision systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with the softmax cross entropy (SCE) loss.

Unless we could generate all kinds of adversarial examples, the robustness of the adversarial model could be restricted. In contrast, the proposed method does not rely on the number of adversarial examples, but on the characteristics of the solution space. That is, the proposed method favours a solution that poses large margins between different classes, in which case the perturbation hardly drives the samples across the decision boundary.\n\nThe datasets used in experiments follow the settings of existing adversarial defencing papers. Here, we follow the suggestion of the reviewer and are conducting a series of experiments on a large-scale dataset, Stanford Dogs. But due to the limited time of rebuttal, the results are not yet available by the deadline. We will complement the results in the final version if this paper is accepted. \n\nRegarding the references pointed by the reviewer, we identify that those methods characterize the adversarial perturbation (or specifically, the worst disturbance to the distribution of clean data) by using the Wasserstein divergence, where the Wasserstein ball has a good property of modelling robustness of unknown data. It is theoretically guaranteed that the resultant optimization problem is strong convex, hence being computationally efficient. Instead, we address the adversarial defencing problem from a different viewpoint, which produces an easy-to-implement, plugin-in, interpretable, and effective loss function that yields improved performance.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1638/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1638/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1638/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1638/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1638/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving robustness of softmax corss-entropy loss via inference information", "authorids": ["~Bingbing_Song1", "hewei@mail.ynu.edu.cn", "liurenyang@mail.ynu.edu.cn", "~Shui_Yu1", "~Ruxin_Wang1", "~Mingming_Gong1", "~Tongliang_Liu1", "zwei@ynu.edu.cn"], "authors": ["Bingbing Song", "Wei He", "Renyang Liu", "Shui Yu", "Ruxin Wang", "Mingming Gong", "Tongliang Liu", "Wei Zhou"], "keywords": ["Adversarial defense", "Loss function", "Neural networks robustness"], "abstract": "Adversarial examples easily mislead the vision systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with the softmax cross entropy (SCE) loss.

They propose I-SCE to mitigate the overfitting issue and show good performance in several adversarial attacks benchmarks. \n\nThe main concern from my point is the originality of this paper.  The author claims that avoiding overfitting can help improve the robustness under adaptive attacks. So the proposed method can be regarded as a regularization method to prevent overfitting issues. However, I think the proposed method shares a lot of similarity with label/model smoothing[1,2]. Also, the objective function eq8 basically is the same as Cosface loss function [3]. \n\n1) For eq. 1 and section 3.2, the authors state that the proposed method tends to produce the model prediction Q(y) close to P(y)-m instead of P(y). I think this is also the claim of label smoothing which avoids the model to output overconfident predictions w.r.t ground truth. \n2) For eq.8, I would say the objective function is almost exactly the same as cosface loss ([3] eq.4) where s is the scale factor, m is the margin.  The cosface loss improves the model inter-class separability by setting a margin. I am not sure whether the proposed method benefits from inter-class separability or claimed label smoothing. \n\nOverall, though the paper achieves good performance in several adaptive attacks benchmarks, I think the novelty of this paper is limited. Specifically, it shares a similar motivation and objective function to label smoothing and cosface. I hope the authors can elaborate on the difference between your work and label smoothing.\n\n[1] Regularizing Neural Networks by Penalizing Confident Output Distributions, Gabriel Pereyra et al.\n[2] Confidence Regularized Self-Training, Yang Zou et al.\n[3] CosFace: Large Margin Cosine Loss for Deep Face Recognition, hao et al.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1638/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1638/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving robustness of softmax corss-entropy loss via inference information", "authorids": ["~Bingbing_Song1", "hewei@mail.ynu.edu.cn", "liurenyang@mail.ynu.edu.cn", "~Shui_Yu1", "~Ruxin_Wang1", "~Mingming_Gong1", "~Tongliang_Liu1", "zwei@ynu.edu.cn"], "authors": ["Bingbing Song", "Wei He", "Renyang Liu", "Shui Yu", "Ruxin Wang", "Mingming Gong", "Tongliang Liu", "Wei Zhou"], "keywords": ["Adversarial defense", "Loss function", "Neural networks robustness"], "abstract": "Adversarial examples easily mislead the vision systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with the softmax cross entropy (SCE) loss.

This idea is presented in Eq. (7), where the logit term is stretched using the affine function x -> sx + m\n\nThis idea is introduced in the paper higher up, at Eq. (1) with adding a constant term to a probability! I had never seen a probability that is obtained from another one by adding a constant to the former. The reason being that adding a constant will break the \"sum to one\" property of a probability density function.  This is the first misleading / confusing math formula, which is used again in Eq. (3) & (4)\n\nAnother mathematical flaw in the paper is the text following Eq. (5): \"This equation indicates that DKLI (P (y)\u2225Q(y)) \u2212 DKL(P (y)\u2225Q(y)) < 0, showing how inference KL divergence avoids the overfitting scenario.\". I do not see why the difference of KL divergences being negative implies that overfitting is avoided. Perhaps authors can explain?\n\nFigure 1 is not related to the text: why don't we have m but delta instead here? I don't get what this figure means\n\nFigure 2 is misleading as well: which one is x, which one is y which is z axis, and what is presented here? can you add text to the axes so that I could understand what is going on there? how does this represent an adversarial attack anyway? \n\n\n\n \n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1638/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1638/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving robustness of softmax corss-entropy loss via inference information", "authorids": ["~Bingbing_Song1", "hewei@mail.ynu.edu.cn", "liurenyang@mail.ynu.edu.cn", "~Shui_Yu1", "~Ruxin_Wang1", "~Mingming_Gong1", "~Tongliang_Liu1", "zwei@ynu.edu.cn"], "authors": ["Bingbing Song", "Wei He", "Renyang Liu", "Shui Yu", "Ruxin Wang", "Mingming Gong", "Tongliang Liu", "Wei Zhou"], "keywords": ["Adversarial defense", "Loss function", "Neural networks robustness"], "abstract": "Adversarial examples easily mislead the vision systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with the softmax cross entropy (SCE) loss. Such a vulnerability of DNN comes from the fact that SCE drives DNNs to fit on the training samples, whereas the resultant feature distributions between the training and adversarial examples are unfortunately misaligned. Several state-of-the-arts start from improving the inter-class separability of training samples by modifying loss functions, where we argue that the adversarial examples are ignored and thus limited robustness to adversarial attacks is resulted.
