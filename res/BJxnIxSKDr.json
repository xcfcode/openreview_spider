We have uploaded a revised version of the paper to address your feedback and concerns.\n\n1) Questions regarding tensor factorization-based approaches to multi-task learning.\nThank you for pointing out this related literature. We have added a discussion and cited all of these methods in Section 5. We also ran experiments with [1] on MT10 and found that it did not perform well, achieving only 10% success rate. We will work to tune the implementation of this method before the final version. We note that, while tensor factorization approaches are general and interesting approaches, Mint is simpler and easier to implement and build upon, which we view as a benefit. Further, Mint is less computationally expensive, as it required about 2-3x less computation. \n\n2) \"The interpretation of why Mint works is not clear: it is not clear that the universality is what makes it work, and there are no experimental analyses of what Mint learns. \nBeyond performance, analysis on what Mint actually learns would be clarifying. Can the sharing behavior be analyzed by looking at the trained Mint layers? Is Mint actually able to learn both of the extreme settings in practice? The non-synthetic experiments in the paper are only performed on tasks that are closely related.\"\nIn light of your feedback, we have performed an additional experiment in a multi-task regime where one task is duplicated. In this case, we show that the task-specific matrices learned by Mint for the two instances of this duplicate task are more similar than the comparison between one of the duplicate task\u2019s matrices and the matrices of other distinct tasks. See Section 6.1 for a more detailed analysis.\n\n3) \"However, in the Mint experiments, a non-linear activation is added between the two components of each layer. This could void the universality property. Is there some reason why this is not an issue in practice?\" \nWe have corrected the figure in our paper to reflect our implementation of Mint in which the task-specific matrices and shared matrices are not separated by a non-linearity.\n\n4) \"More generally, it is not clear that universality is the important advantage of Mint. Some existing DMTL methods already have this property, including Cross-stitch, which is compared to in the paper. The intriguing difference with Mint is that shared and unshared structure are applied sequentially instead of in parallel. Could there be an advantage in this difference? E.g., is Mint a stronger regularizer because it forces all tasks to use all shared layers (learning the identity function for shared layers is hard), while something like cross-stitch could more easily degenerate to only use task-specific layers even when tasks are related?\"\nThe usage of a sequential, rather than parallel, flow of data is significant. As the reviewer indicates, it is possible that this architecture might act as a regularizer due to the difficulty of learning to ignore useless shared transformations. In addition, we note the phenomenon observed in residual networks where many residual blocks do not learn useful features and simply converge to the identity function, suggesting that encouraging the network to take advantage of all parallel processing streams is difficult. Using a sequential flow of information prevents this degeneracy.\n\n5) \"As a final note, adding layers to non-Mint models to make the topologically more similar to Mint models may not help these other models. It may make them more difficult to train or overfit more easily, since they are deeper, but do not have Mint method to assist in training. Comparisons without these extra layers would make the experiments more complete.\"\nWe performed such comparisons and added the results to the revised version of the paper (see the plot on the right in Figure 4). Mint still outperforms the baselines without the extra layers in the setting of MT10.\n\n6) \"What exactly are the 'two simple neural networks' that produce the goal-specific parameters for goal-conditioned RL? Do these maintain the universality property?\"\nThey are 2-layer ReLU networks that take in the goals and return the goal-specific Mint layers. We have added this information to Section 4 in the revised version of the paper. In Lemma 1 in the paper, there are no requirements on the Mint layers, and thus the universality property is still maintained.\n\n7) \"Can Mint be readily extended to layer types beyond FC layers? This may be necessary when applying to more complex models.\"\nConceptually, Mint can be readily extended to any type of layer in the sense that we can include blocks of \u201ctask specific -> shared\u201d layer for any type of neural network layer. However, the requirement on invertibility (required for universality) is a stronger assumption in layers such as convolutions."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2338/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2338/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["tianheyu@cs.stanford.edu", "szk@stanford.edu", "eric.anthony.mitchell95@gmail.com", "abhigupta@berkeley.edu", "hausmankarol@gmail.com", "svlevine@eecs.berkeley.edu", "cbfinn@cs.stanford.edu"], "title": "Mint: Matrix-Interleaving for Multi-Task Learning", "authors": ["Tianhe Yu", "Saurabh Kumar", "Eric Mitchell", "Abhishek Gupta", "Karol Hausman", "Sergey Levine", "Chelsea Finn"], "pdf": "/pdf/9952c44c316b179940819cf5e805b9a3a954a0d9.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose an approach that endows a single model with the ability to represent both extremes: joint training and independent training, which leads to effective multi-task learning.", "abstract": "Deep learning enables training of large and flexible function approximators from scratch at the cost of large amounts of data.

We have uploaded a revised version of the paper to address all of your concerns. Below, we address the feedback that you provided.\n\n(1) \u201cSection 2 did not clearly illustrate what's being trained and what's being tested, and whether we care about the generalization performance of each task, or the generalization performance to new tasks (generated from P(T)).\u201d\nThank you for pointing out this lack of clarity. We have revised Section 2 to explain that we care about performance across all the tasks that we train on. Specifically, we have a fixed set of K tasks, and we wish to obtain high performance across all of these K tasks. We do not care about generalization performance.\n\n\u201cSome notations are confusing there--for instance, i seems to be indicating tasks, but then there is a z_k as task indicator.\u201d\nWe have changed the notations so that the tasks are denoted by T_k and the task indicators are z_k. The distinction between T_k and z_k is that T_k is the task itself whereas z_k is an indicator of the task that is provided as input to a neural network. \n\n(2) \u201cWhile having an universal expressive power is good, it is easily achieved by adding an indicator variable (z_k) per layer (similar to task-specific-all-fc in the experiments). So the guarantee does not seem to be closely related to explaining the proposed approach.\u201d\nAdding an indicator variable per layer is not sufficient for achieving universal expressive power. Specifically, using task-specific weights in this way amounts to adding task-specific bias terms to the activations of the network which processes the inputs. We have extended the theory (Lemma 1 and its proof) to the case where a task indicator is added to each layer to explain why this does not achieve universal expressive power. \n\n\u201cIt is strongly suggested to introduce FiLM in more detail and compare it with the proposed approach more clearly in design, theory, and experiments.\u201d\nWe have added a more in-depth discussion and theoretical comparison of Mint, FiLM, and task indicator conditioning in Section 3.2, and we have a direct empirical comparison to FiLM in the MT10 experiments (see Figure 3).\n\n(3) \"I believe the authors have *not* answered their first proposed question \"does our method enable effective multi-task learning both in settings where there is substantial overlap in tasks and where there is little overlap\" properly. \"\nWe agree that defining \u201clittle overlap\u201d and \u201csubstantial overlap\u201d between tasks is difficult. In our RL experiments, we selected MT10 and MT50 to highlight multi-task learning with relatively little overlap, as the agent must learn distinct skills. In contrast, we selected the goal-conditioned pushing environment as a multi-task learning environment with relatively larger overlap between tasks. In both experiments, we observed the benefits of Mint over other multi-task learning approaches.\n\n(4) \"It is suggested to analyze the matrices learned by the proposed approach. Do the matrices contain reasonable task correlations?\"\nTo perform this analysis, we ran a multi-task experiment among a set of tasks where two tasks are exactly the same, and compared the matrices learned for these two tasks, in comparison to those from two different tasks. Specifically, we computed the L1 norm of the difference between the two matrices of the same task and compared that with the L1 norm of the difference between two task matrices corresponding to different tasks. We have added this analysis to Section 6.1 (see Figure 4). \n\n(5) \"It looks a bit strange to me that there is no discussion on regularizing the linear transformation matrices...Have the authors considered the possibility?\"\nWe experimented with regularizing the linear transformation matrices of Mint by maximizing the pairwise cosine distance between them. We found that this regularization did not impact the performance of Mint.\n\n(6) \"The authors are overly-emphasizing what they want to do (interpolating between independent networks and shared network). This occupies multiple redundant paragraphs in the early sections. \"\nWe reduced the redundancy in Section 3.1.\n\n(7) \"One baseline that could have been considered is to just train a fully-shared network (without z_k), and a fully-independent one.\"\nIn the MT10, MT50, and goal-conditioned pushing experiments, we used a fully-shared network (SAC) and a fully independent one (independent) and compared these methods to Mint. See Figures 3 and 4.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2338/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2338/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["tianheyu@cs.stanford.edu", "szk@stanford.edu", "eric.anthony.mitchell95@gmail.com", "abhigupta@berkeley.edu", "hausmankarol@gmail.com", "svlevine@eecs.berkeley.edu", "cbfinn@cs.stanford.edu"], "title": "Mint: Matrix-Interleaving for Multi-Task Learning", "authors": ["Tianhe Yu", "Saurabh Kumar", "Eric Mitchell", "Abhishek Gupta", "Karol Hausman", "Sergey Levine", "Chelsea Finn"], "pdf": "/pdf/9952c44c316b179940819cf5e805b9a3a954a0d9.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose an approach that endows a single model with the ability to represent both extremes: joint training and independent training, which leads to effective multi-task learning.", "abstract": "Deep learning enables training of large and flexible function approximators from scratch at the cost of large amounts of data.

In this setup, Mint outperforms independent training and performs slightly better than joint training.\n\n\u201cWhat does \u2018when the shared weight matrices are not learned\u2019 mean?\u201d\nWe have removed this statement to avoid confusion and revised the text. What we meant by this statement was that even if the shared weight matrices are no longer changing (e.g. they have been fully optimized), there exist task-specific Mint layers which can allow the Mint network to express the same transformations of the input as an optimal task-specific network.\n\n\u201cTheorem 1 requires that each W^(l) is invertible, which implies that W^(l) is a square matrix. This requirement may not be satisfied in many neural networks. In this case, does Theorem 1 still hold? If not, Theorem 1 is not so useful.\u201d\nIn practice, we can design the Mint network such that W^(l) is always an MxM square matrix for some M (M can be different for each layer), and thus satisfy the conditions of the theorem. Specifically, we can first apply a Mint layer which consists of an MxN weight matrix and then apply the shared fully-connected layer which consists of an MxM weight matrix. Therefore, the Mint layer will transform an N-dimensional input to an M-dimensional output, and the shared network contains only square matrices. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2338/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2338/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["tianheyu@cs.stanford.edu", "szk@stanford.edu", "eric.anthony.mitchell95@gmail.com", "abhigupta@berkeley.edu", "hausmankarol@gmail.com", "svlevine@eecs.berkeley.edu", "cbfinn@cs.stanford.edu"], "title": "Mint: Matrix-Interleaving for Multi-Task Learning", "authors": ["Tianhe Yu", "Saurabh Kumar", "Eric Mitchell", "Abhishek Gupta", "Karol Hausman", "Sergey Levine", "Chelsea Finn"], "pdf": "/pdf/9952c44c316b179940819cf5e805b9a3a954a0d9.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose an approach that endows a single model with the ability to represent both extremes: joint training and independent training, which leads to effective multi-task learning.", "abstract": "Deep learning enables training of large and flexible function approximators from scratch at the cost of large amounts of data.

The approach has some very satisfying properties: it forces all sharable structure to be used by all tasks; it theoretically captures the extremes of total sharing and total task independence; it is easy to implement, so would be a very useful baseline for future methods; and it is able to effectively exploit task similarities in experiments, and outperforms some alternative DMTL methods.\n\nI have two main concerns with the work: (1) It is most closely related to MTL factorization methods, but does not discuss this literature, or provide these experimental comparisons; (2) the interpretation of why Mint works is not clear: it is not clear that the universality is what makes it work, and there are no experimental analyses of what Mint learns. \n\nW.r.t. (1), there are several DMTL approaches that factorize layers across shared and task-specific components, e.g., [1], [2]. Such approaches are extensions of factorization approaches in the linear setting, e.g., [3], [4]. Compared to previous DMTL approaches, Mint is more closely related to these linear methods, as it takes the idea of factorizing each model matrix into two components and applies it to every applicable layer. In particular, the formal definition (i.e., without nonlinear activation between M and W) of Mint appears to be a special case of the more general factorizations in [1]; an experimental  comparison [1] would make the conclusions more convincing, e.g., that universality is important.\n\nHowever, in the Mint experiments, a non-linear activation is added between the two components of each layer. This could void the universality property. Is there some reason why this is not an issue in practice? \n\nMore generally, it is not clear that universality is the important advantage of Mint. Some existing DMTL methods already have this property, including Cross-stitch, which is compared to in the paper. The intriguing difference with Mint is that shared and unshared structure are applied sequentially instead of in parallel. Could there be an advantage in in this difference? E.g., is Mint a stronger regularizer because it forces all tasks to use all shared layers (learning the identity function for shared layers is hard), while something like cross-stitch could more easily degenerate to only use task-specific layers even when tasks are related?\n\nBeyond performance, analysis on what Mint actually learns would be clarifying. Can the sharing behavior be analyzed by looking at the trained Mint layers? Is Mint actually able to learn both of the extreme settings in practice? The non-synthetic experiments in the paper are only performed on tasks that are closely related. \n\nAs a final note, adding layers to non-Mint models to make the topologically more similar to Mint models may not help these other models. It may make them more difficult to train or overfit more easily, since they are deeper, but do not have Mint method to assist in training. Comparisons without these extra layers would make the experiments more complete. Do cross-stitch and WPL share the conv layers across all tasks like Mint in Table 1? They should to make it a clear comparison.\n\nOther questions:\n-\tWhat exactly are the \u201ctwo simple neural networks\u201d that produce the goal-specific parameters for goal-conditioned RL? Do these maintain the universality property?\n-\tCan Mint be readily extended to layer types beyond FC layers? This may be necessary when applying to more complex models.\n\n\n[1] Yang, Y. & Hospedales, T.

Learning each of the tasks independently from scratch can actually perform better in such settings, but it does not benefit from the representation sharing that multi-task learning can potentially provide. In this work, we develop an approach that endows a single model with the ability to represent both extremes: joint training and independent training. To this end, we introduce matrix-interleaving (Mint), a modification to standard neural network models that projects the activations for each task into a different learned subspace, represented by a per-task and per-layer matrix. By learning these matrices jointly with the other model parameters, the optimizer itself can decide how much to share representations between tasks.

The authors prove that the addition of such a layer keeps the expressive power of the network for each task. They also discuss how the linear transformation (parameterized by a transformation matrix and a bias vector) can be represented in a discrete manner in usual multi-task supervised learning and in a continuous manner (by two other neural networks) in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed single-network approach.\n\nThe proposed approach is single and elegant. It is recommended to weak-reject the paper because of the following key reasons.\n\n(1) Problem formulation is far from clear, perhaps because of the lack of clarity in writing. In particular, the super short Section 2 did not clearly illustrate what's being trained and what's being tested, and whether we care about the generalization performance of each task, or the generalization performance to new tasks (generated from P(T)). Some notations are confusing there---for instance, i seems to be indicating tasks, but then there is a z_k as task indicator. Even for the main proposed approach in Section 3.1, the notations are loosely used in nature. For instance, it is hard to understand what the authors mean by \"train separate neural networks to output the Mint matrices and biases\"---there is no information about the \"training data\" for learning those neural networks.\n\n(2) Theoretical justification is at best shallow, or at least in the context that the authors have put it. While having an universal expressive power is good, it is easily achieved by adding an indicator variable (z_k) per layer (similar to task-specific-all-fc in the experiments). So the guarantee does not seem to be closely related to explaining the proposed approach (though the guarantee is nice to have). The authors contrast the guarantee with what FiLM (a competitor approach) can do, but in the experiments FiLM is not taken as a competitor in multi-task supervised learning, leaving a big gap between theory and practice. In the flow presented by the authors, it is strongly suggested to introduce FiLM in more detail and compare it with the proposed approach more clearly in design, theory and experiments.\n\n(3) It is hard to understand whether the experiments are reasonably designed. In particular, the two settings take different sets of competitors, and there is little information on why those competitors are selected, whether they represent state-of-the-art, etc.. The authors highlight that the proposed approach uses much fewer parameters but other than that it is hard to infer why the proposed approach is better. Is it better because there is more overfitting for the competitor's approaches given more parameters? Is it better because it is easier to tune? The task-specific-all-fc (which is of similar # parameters to the proposed approach) result particularly looks suspicious to me but there is no other information to double-check on why the proposed approach is better. In particular, I believe the authors have *not* answered their first proposed question \"does our method enable effective multi-task learning both in settings where there is substantial overlap in tasks and where there is little overlap\" properly---their best evidence may have been MT10 and MT50 experiments, but even in those experiments, I am not sure whether the authors want to take the results as suggesting there are \"substantial overlap\" or \"little overlap.\" \n\nSome other suggestions:\n\n(4) It is suggested to analyze the matrices learned by the proposed approach. Do the matrices contain reasonable task correlations (i.e. for two similar tasks, are the matrices somewhat similar) to understand more about the proposed approach.\n\n(5) It looks a bit strange to me that there is no discussion on regularizing the linear transformation matrices, as it seems possible to embed the task relations through the regularization. Have the authors considered the possibility?\n\n(6) The authors are overly-emphasizing what they want to do (interpolating between independent networks and shared network). This occupies multiple redundant paragraphs in the early sections. It is better to remove some of those and use the space for more solid results, such as clarifying the notations.\n\n(7) One baseline that could have been considered is to just train a fully-shared network (without z_k), and a fully-independent one. Then, use validation to select the better network and compare with the proposed approach.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2338/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2338/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["tianheyu@cs.stanford.edu", "szk@stanford.edu", "eric.anthony.mitchell95@gmail.com", "abhigupta@berkeley.edu", "hausmankarol@gmail.com", "svlevine@eecs.berkeley.edu", "cbfinn@cs.stanford.edu"], "title": "Mint: Matrix-Interleaving for Multi-Task Learning", "authors": ["Tianhe Yu", "Saurabh Kumar", "Eric Mitchell", "Abhishek Gupta", "Karol Hausman", "Sergey Levine", "Chelsea Finn"], "pdf": "/pdf/9952c44c316b179940819cf5e805b9a3a954a0d9.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose an approach that endows a single model with the ability to represent both extremes: joint training and independent training, which leads to effective multi-task learning.", "abstract": "Deep learning enables training of large and flexible function approximators from scratch at the cost of large amounts of data.
