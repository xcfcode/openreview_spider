It is similar in spirit to several other recent models, with the main exception that it is able to predict answers of different lengths, as opposed to single words/tokens/entities. The authors compare their model on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), and show improvements over the baselines, while apparently lagging quite far behind the current state of the art reported on the SQuAD leaderboard.\n\nTHOUGHTS: The main novelty of the method is to be able to identify phrases of different lengths as possible answers to the question. However, both approaches considered -- using a POS pattern trie tree to filter out word sequences with POS tags matching those of answers in the training set, and brute-force enumeration of all phrases up to length N -- seem somewhat orthogonal to the idea of \"learning end-to-end \" an answer chunk extraction model. Furthermore, as other reviews have pointed out, it seems that the linguistic features actually contribute a lot to the final accuracy (Table 3). One could argue that these are easy to obtain using standard taggers, but it takes away even more from the idea of an \"end-to-end trained\" system.\n\nThe paper is generally well written, but there are several crucial sections in parts describing the model where it was really hard for me to follow the descriptions. In particular, the attention mechanism seems fairly standard to me in a seq2seq sense (i.e. there is nothing architecturally novel about it, as is for instance the case with the Gated Attentive Reader). I may be missing something, but even after the clarification round I still don't understand how it is novel compared to standard attention used in for instance seq2seq models.\n\nFinally, although the method is shown to outperform the baseline method reported in the original paper introducing the SQuAD dataset, it currently seems to be 12th (out of 15 systems) on the leaderboard (https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/). Of course, it may be that further training and hyperparameter optimizations may improve these results.\n\nTherefore, given the lack of model novelty (based on my understanding), and the lack of strong results (based on the leaderboard), I don't feel the paper is ready in its current form to be accepted to the conference.\n\nNote: The GRU citation should be (Cho et al., 2014), not (Bengio et al., 2015).", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "End-to-End Answer Chunk Extraction and Ranking for Reading Comprehension", "abstract": "This paper proposes dynamic chunk reader (DCR), an end-to-end neural reading comprehension (RC) model that is able to extract and rank a set of answer candidates from a given document to answer questions.

Compared to earlier systems, the proposed model is able to extract and rank a set of answer candidates from a given document.\n\nThere are many recent models focusing on building good question answering systems by extracting phrases from a given article. It seems that there are two different aspects that are unique in this work:\n\n1.\tThe use of convolution model, and\n2.\tDynamic chunking\n\nConvolution network is often only used for modeling character-based word embeddings so I am curious about its effectiveness on representing phrases. Therefore, I wish there could be more analysis on how effective it is, as the authors do not compare the convolution framework to other alternative approaches such as LSTM. The comparisons are important, as the authors uses uni-gram, bi-gram and tri-gram information in the convolution network, and it is not clear to me that if tri-gram information is still needed for LSTM models.\n\nThe dynamic chunking is a good idea, and a very similar idea is proposed in some of the recent papers such as [Kenton et al, 16], which also targets at the same dataset. However, I would like to see more analysis on the dynamic chunking. Why this approach is a good approach for representing answer chunks? Given the representation of the chunk is constructed by the first and the end word representations generated by a convolution network, I am not sure about the ability of this representation to capture the long answer phrases.\n\nThe authors do not use character base embedding but use some of the previous trained NLP models. It would be interesting if the authors could show what are the advantages and disadvantages of using linguistic features compared to character embeddings.\n\nIn short, there are several good ideas proposed in the paper, but the lack of proper analysis make it difficult to judge how important the proposed techniques are.\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "End-to-End Answer Chunk Extraction and Ranking for Reading Comprehension", "abstract": "This paper proposes dynamic chunk reader (DCR), an end-to-end neural reading comprehension (RC) model that is able to extract and rank a set of answer candidates from a given document to answer questions.

We create multiple representations for each chunk using l-grams. So each chunk has multiple comparisons to the question from different perspectives (3 comparisons to be exact, using unigram, bi-gram and tri-gram representation of the chunk, respectively) and we use a fully connected layer to consider all these perspectives together.\n\n3) It is more likely due to the data distribution, where questions with answer length 9 are relatively easier.
