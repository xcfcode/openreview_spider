This family incorporates popular existing methods like Adam, AdaGrad and AMSGrad. The analysis relies only on standard assumptions like Lipschitz smoothness and bounded gradients.\n\nIndividual Comments/Questions:\n\n- In Table 1, the characterization of Adam ignores the fact that, in practice, Adam adds a positive epsilon to the $\\hat{v}_t$ in the denominator. I would like the authors to at least comment on that in the paper. I assume that AdaFom and AMSGrad also need such an epsilon in practice. Could the author comment on whether (and how) this would affect their analysis of those methods? In particular, in Theorem 3.1, can we really assume the term $\\Vert \\alpha_t m_t / \\sqrt{\\hat{v}_t} \\Vert$ to be bounded by a constant without such an epsilon?\n\n- In the first bullet point in Section 3.1, the authors relate the term\n\n$$ \\sum_t \\Vert \\alpha_t g_t / \\sqrt{\\hat{v}_t} \\Vert^2 $$ (*)\n\nto the term $\\sum_t \\alpha_t^2$ in the analysis of SGD. I don't think this is a fair analogy. The effective step size of Adam-type methods is $\\alpha_t / \\sqrt{\\hat{v}_t}$, while the aformentioned term also contains the magnitude of the stochastic gradient $g_t$. So, while the SGD analysis only poses a condition on the step sizes, bounding (1) also poses a condition on the magnitude of the stochastic gradient.\n\n- In the experiments of Section 3.2.1, the authors use a step size of 0.01 for SGD (which really is gradient descent, since this is a non-stochastic problem). Existing theory tells us that GD only converges for step sizes smaller than 2/L where L is the Lipschitz constant of the gradient, which is L=200 in this example. So this is literally setting the method up for failure and I don't really see any merit in that experiment.\n\n- The experiments in Section 4 are of course very limited, but this paper makes a significant theoretical contribution, so I don't really see the need for extensive experiments.\n\n- To my knowledge, under similar assumptions, plain SGD has been show to converge at a rate of O(1/sqrt(T)). The convergence analysis presented here has an additional log(T) factor, so it is not really suitable to explain any possible benefits of these adaptive methods over SGD. This is totally fine in and of itself; after all the analysis of theses methods is hard and this is a great first step. The issue I have is that this is not mentioned in the paper at all. \n\nOriginality:\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, the convergence analysis of the Adam-type methods (including established methods AdaGrad, RMSprop, Adam, AMSGrad) in the _non-convex_ setting is a novel, original contribution. The authors also propose a new algorithm, AdaFom. This exact algorithm is proposed in [1], which was uploaded to arXiv before the ICLR deadline. However, this can be considered concurrent work.\n\nSignificance:\n\nThe convergence properties of popular optimization methods in machine learning (e.g., Adam) are generally very poorly understood in \"realistic\" settings. The analysis presented in this paper is an important step to better theoretical understanding of these methods which, in my opinion, is highly significant.\n\nCorrectness:\n\nThis was a short-notice emergency review and I did not check any of the proofs in the appendix. I will try to verify at least parts of the proofs in the coming days.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is an original paper making a significant theoretical contribution. I can't comment on the correctness of the mathematical analysis (yet). I'm cautiously recommending acceptance for now, but would be willing to upgrade my rating if the authors respond to my comments/questions.\n\n\n[1] Zou and Shen.

Specifically, we will add \u201cAssume that $\\|(g_{1})_i| \\geq c,  \\forall i$\u201d in the Corollary 3.1 and 3.2. \n\n\nAnalysis after adding $\\epsilon$:\n\nYour comment on $\\epsilon$ is very helpful! We will add more discussion on effect of $\\epsilon$ in our next version (or a future arxiv version if adding a few corollaries will be considered too much). \n\nAfter going through the proof with $\\epsilon$ added, we find that adding a proper $\\epsilon$ can indeed help with worst-case convergence rate in our analysis. Meanwhile, with $\\epsilon$ added, we do not need to assume that no gradient coordinate is zero at the first iteration.\n\nSince we are not able to modify the paper at this stage, we go through what will happen in the proof of Corollary 3.1 here (it is just a simple modification of the original proof). \n\nWe consider adding $\\epsilon$ as replacing S4 in Algorithm 3 (AMSGrad) to $x_{t+1} = x_t - \\alpha_t m_t / (\\sqrt{\\hat{v}_t} + \\epsilon)$. This resulting algorithm is also a special case of Algorithm 1 because $(\\sqrt{\\hat{v}_t} + \\epsilon)$ is still a function of all past gradient (Theorem 3.1 still holds). Then we can use (5) to analyze the convergence of the new Algorithm 3. Briefly speaking, the analysis requires only a few modifications in the proof of Corollary 3.1 ($(\\hat{v_1})_j \\geq c$ replaced by ($(\\hat{v_1})_j + \\epsilon \\geq \\epsilon$ and $(\\hat{v_t})_j \\leq H$ replaced by $(\\hat{v_t})_j + \\epsilon \\leq H + \\epsilon)$).\n\nNow we provide a detailed discussion on modifications in the proof of Corollary 3.1 if $\\epsilon$ is added. Our following discussion is based on Section 6.2.3 in the paper. As the reviewer may already noticed, our proof of Corollary 3.1 relies on upper bounding Term A and Term B in (5) of Theorem 3.1 and finding G in the assumption $\\| \\alpha_t m_t / \\sqrt{\\hat{v}_t} \\| \\leq G$. With $\\epsilon$ added in the denominator, we can easily have $\\| \\alpha_t m_t / \\sqrt{\\hat{v}_t} \\| \\leq H/\\epsilon$ because we have $\\|m_t\\| \\leq H$ (due to $\\|g_t\\| \\leq H$).\n\nWe now discussed how $\\epsilon$ affects the rest of the proof. \n\nAbove the first unnumbered inequality in page 27, we have assumed that $(\\hat{v}_1)_j \\geq c > 0$. With $\\epsilon$ added, we have $(\\hat{v}_1)_j + \\epsilon \\geq \\epsilon$. Thus we can replace $c$ in the remaining proof to $\\epsilon$ and allow $(\\hat{v}_1)_j = 0$ (which removes the assumption that the first gradient is non-zero at every coordinate). \n\nThe rest of the proof will easily go through by replacing $\\hat{v}_t$ to $\\hat{v}_t+ \\epsilon$ until (41). ( $\\hat{v}_t+ \\epsilon$ is still monotonically increasing since $\\hat{v}_t$ is, this enables the telescoping sum in (40)).\n\nNotice that we have used $(\\sqrt{\\hat{v}_t})_j \\leq H$ below (41), with $\\epsilon$ added, we replace it by $(\\sqrt{\\hat{v}_t})_j + \\epsilon \\leq  H + \\epsilon$. Then the $1/H$ will be replaced to $1/(H+\\epsilon)$ from the unnumbered inequality below (41) to the inequality below (42). Then we can substitute $G=H/\\epsilon$ and expression of $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4$ (at the end of Section 6.2.2) into the final bound at the end of the proof.\n\nIn the end, the RHS of the last inequality before the end of the proof has the form $A/\\epsilon^2 + B/\\epsilon + C \\epsilon + D$ with $A,B,C,D$ being numbers independent of $\\epsilon$. Thus a proper $\\epsilon$ can be chosen to minimize the upper bound.\n\nIt is easy to see that the optimal $\\epsilon$ is neither $\\infty$ nor 0 but something in between. Intuitively, this is because when $\\epsilon$ is very large, the effective stepsizes will be very small and the algorithm will not make fast progress. When $\\epsilon$ is very small, the algorithm may move unpredictably due to very large effective stepsizes at the early stage of optimization. Again, the theoretical bound agrees with what people observe in practice.\n\nThe analysis of AdaFom at the presence of $\\epsilon$ will be similar (even simpler than the current proof of Corollary 3.2 because it is easier to bound Term A in (5)).\nThe main reason for ignoring $\\epsilon$ in our original version is its simplicity in convergence analysis. However, based on the discussion with the reviewer, we think it is very interesting to see how $\\epsilon$ affects the performance of AMSGrad and AdaFom. Again, we will add more discussion on adding $\\epsilon$ in our next version . We sincerely hope that our response have addressed the reviewer\u2019s concern. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1048/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1048/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1048/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On the Convergence of A Class of Adam-Type Algorithms  for Non-Convex Optimization", "abstract": "This paper studies a class of adaptive gradient based momentum algorithms that update the  search directions and learning rates simultaneously using past gradients.

We respond your comments and questions point by point.\n\nAdding $\\epsilon$:  \nFor  Generalized Adam (Algorithm 1), adding $\\epsilon$ to $\\hat{v}_t$ does not affect our convergence analysis. Our Theorem 3.1 still holds since in Algorithm 1, $\\hat{v}_t$ takes a very general form that can cover the cases where $\\hat{v}_t$ is lower bounded by manually adding an $\\epsilon$.\nThen the real question is for specific algorithms, can the term $\\Vert \\alpha_t m_t / \\sqrt{\\hat{v}_t} \\Vert$ in Theorem 3.1 be upper bounded by a constant? \n\nFirst, the reviewer is correct that adding epsilon helps in this regard because it lower-bounds $\\hat{v}_t$ by epsilon and $\\Vert \\alpha_t m_t / \\sqrt{\\hat{v}_t} \\Vert$ can be easily upper bounded. In this case,our theory still holds. We have clarified this point after Theorem 3.1.\n\nHowever, for specific algorithms AdaFom and AMSGrad, we actually does not need to add $\\epsilon$ to ensure convergence. In particular, by assuming $\\|g_t\\|$ is upper bounded as in Assumption A2, the upper boundedness of $\\Vert \\alpha_t m_t / \\sqrt{\\hat{v}_t} \\Vert$  is automatically satisfied. The upper boundedness is verified at the end of Section 6.2.3 and Section 6.2.4. We added a comment after Theorem 3.1 that the upper boundedness of the term is automatically satisfied by AdaFom and AMSGrad according to your suggestion. \n\nAnalogy to SGD:\nYou are right. Rigorously, $\\sum_{t} \\| \\alpha_t m_t / \\sqrt{\\hat{v}_t} \\|^2$ should be an generalization of $\\sum_{t} \\| \\alpha_t g_t \\|^2$ in SGD. We made the analogy because under the assumption that $\\|g_t\\| \\leq G$, $\\sum_{t} \\| \\alpha_t m_t / \\sqrt{\\hat{v}_t} \\|$ is upper bounded by  $G^2 \\sum_{t}  \\| \\alpha_t / \\sqrt{\\hat{v}_t} \\|^2 $. The latter transfers to $\\sum_{t}\\alpha_t^2 $  when ignoring other constants (G and dimension d). We have changed $\\sum_{t}\\alpha_t^2$ to $\\sum_{t} \\| \\alpha_t g_t \\|^2$ in the paper to avoid confusion.\n\n\nExperiments in Section 3.2.1: \nThe purpose of the experiment in Section 3.2.1 is to show that Adam-type algorithm may diverge when term A in (5) grows too fast. Both the divergence of Adam and SGD serve as support to the aforementioned claim. For SGD, we intentionally set up an experiment to make it diverge and observe whether the growth of term A in (5) agrees with our theory. This is only to verify our theory and the purpose is not to provide new insights about SGD (since SGD is well-studied ). \n\nOn the contrary, the divergence of Adam in the experiment is the interesting part and it provides some new insights. The experiment says that even for batch versions, Adam is not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point using a small constant stepsize (this is different from batch GD which is guaranteed to converge using a  stepsize smaller than 2/L). This is a new discovery in our experiment.  The  message we want to convey is the following: the convergence requirement of limiting the growth rate of term A to be slower than that of accumulation of effective stepsizes in (5) is not an artifact, or being too restrictive; because  SGD and Adam can diverge even when term A grows with the same speed as the accumulation of effective stepsizes.\n \nExperiments in Section 4: \nThank you for your support. To make our experiments more convincing, we have added experiments on larger problems (training CIFARNET on CIFAR-10) in the revised paper (Section 4).\n\n\nPossible benefits:  \nThank you for pointing out this possible confusion. In our new version, we explicitly point out that the possible benefits of adaptive methods may not lie in the worst case convergence rates, but can be explained by other factors such as robustness to choices of stepsizes (the last paragraph in Section 3.3).\n\nAs mentioned, we are not explaining the benefits by claiming faster worst-case convergence rate. The main benefit we are showing is the robustness to the choice of stepsizes compared to SGD. You may find experiments in Section 6.1.1 interesting where we compare performance of SGD and adaptive methods under different choices of stepsizes. The message obtained from the experiments is that, adaptive methods may converge or converge faster for a larger range of stepsizes compared to SGD. Therefore adaptive methods may perform much better on average if we choose stepsizes randomly (which is usually the case in practice since it is time consuming to test all possible values of stepsizes). In the future, we will try to show the possible benefits of certain adaptive methods in a more rigorous way .\n\nWe have also commented on the presence of the additional log term in convergence rates at the end of Section 3 in the revised manuscript.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1048/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1048/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1048/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On the Convergence of A Class of Adam-Type Algorithms  for Non-Convex Optimization", "abstract": "This paper studies a class of adaptive gradient based momentum algorithms that update the  search directions and learning rates simultaneously using past gradients.

This class, which we refer to as the ''``Adam-type'', includes the popular algorithms such as Adam, AMSGrad, AdaGrad. Despite their popularity in training deep neural networks (DNNs), the convergence of these algorithms for solving  non-convex problems remains an open question. In this paper, we develop an analysis framework and a set of mild sufficient conditions that guarantee the convergence of the Adam-type methods, with a convergence rate of order   $O(\\log{T}/\\sqrt{T})$ for non-convex stochastic optimization. Our convergence analysis applies to a new algorithm called AdaFom (AdaGrad with First Order Momentum). We show that the conditions are essential, by identifying concrete examples in which violating the conditions makes an algorithm diverge.
