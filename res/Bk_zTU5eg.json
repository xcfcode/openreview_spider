Similar results are already known (at least as folk theory) in simpler regimes, but this result is novel. The reviewers are mixed in their opinions of the paper, but AnonReviewer4 brings up a point that deserves further attention: the analysis assumes that the same step-size is used for different mini-batch sizes. Because of this assumption, the conclusion of the paper is misleading. One of the effects of increasing the mini-batch is to decrease the variance of the estimator, which allows a larger step-size. With this larger step-size the net effect of increasing the mini-batch can actually be positive even in terms of the number of examples. Fixing the step-size removes the chance for the mini-batch strategy to do better in theory, and there is indeed a large amount of empirical evidence that mini-batches can lead to practical improvements.

A similar behavior is discussed for using multiple learners in asynchronous SGD. This behavior has been known in convex optimization (e.g., \"Better Mini-Batch Algorithms via Accelerated Gradient Methods\", NIPS 2011). There, the convergence is of the form O(1/\\sqrt{bT}+1/T), and so using bT samples only lead to \\sqrt{b} time improvement. This paper extends a similar result to the nonconvex case (but the underlying mathematics is mainly from [Ghadimi & Lan, 2013]). However, this behavior is also known and indeed has been summarized in the deep learning textbook (chapter 8). Hence, the novelty is limited.\n\nThe theoretical results in this paper suggest that it is best not to use mini-batch. However, using mini-batch is often beneficial in practice. As discussed in the deep learning textbook, using mini-batch allows using a larger learning rate (note that this paper assumes the same learning rate for both mini-batch sizes). Moreover, multicore architectures allows parallel execution of mini-batch almost for free. Hence, the practical significance of the results is also limited.\n\nOther comments:\n- Equation (4): since the same number of samples (S) is processed and S=MK, where M is the mini-batch size and K is the number of mini-batches processed (as mentioned in the first paragraph of section 2), when two different mini-batch sizes are considered (M_l and M_h), their K's should differ.

The results are then translated to analyze the influence of the number of learners on ASGD. I find the problem addressed in the paper relevant and the theoretical part clearly written. The experimental evaluation is somehow limited though. I would like to see experiments on more data sets and more architectures, as well as richer evaluation, e.g. N=16 is a fairly small experiment. It would also enhance the paper if the experiments were showing a similar behavior of other popular methods like momentum SGD or maybe EASGD (the latter in distributed setting).

We justify it theoretically by showing that prior to the asymptotic regime ASGD's convergence can get slower as we increase the number of learners.

This slow convergence corresponds to the practical observations of lack of linear speed-up often observed while using ASGD.

The two issues are  related.  Larger minibatch and more learners may still bring practical advantages (as the reviewer commented) on current systems as they can better tolerate noise and/or better utilize the computing resources (e.g., multicore machines, a cluster of machines, and GPUs). Suppose for 2 learners it takes 1.5x samples to reach convergence. Then ignoring communication cost, having 2 learners is be better than 1. In the parallel setting, our analysis suggests that we do not expect to see linear speedup (even without communication cost). It is not known yet how exactly the number of samples required increases with the number of learners. It is an important question to ask, especially considering the explosion of data. If we want to use thousands of learners, the increase in the number of samples needed for convergence (combined with communication cost) may make such parallel deployment impractical.
