review and I have consequently updated my rating accordingly.\n\nSummary:\nModel-free reinforcement learning is inefficient at exploration if rewards are\nsparse / low probability.\nThe paper proposes a variational model for online learning to backtrack\nstate / action traces that lead to high reward states based on best previous\nsamples.\nThe backtracking models' generated recall traces are then used to augment policy\ntraining by imitation learning, i.e. by optimizing policy to take actions that\nare taken from the current states in generated recall traces.\nOverall, the methodology seems akin to an adaptive importance sampling\napproach for reinforcement learning.\n\nEvaluation:\nThe paper gives a clear (at least mathematically) presentation of the core idea\nbut it some details about modeling choices seem to be missing.\nThe experimental evaluation seems preliminary and it is not fully evident when\nand how the proposed method will be practically relevant (and not relevant).\n\nMy knowledgable of the previous literature is not sufficient to validate the\nclaimed novelty of the approach.\n\nDetails:\nThe paper is well written and easy to follow in general.\n\nI'm not familiar enough with reinforcment learning benchmarks to judge the\nquality of the experiments compared to the literature as a whole.\nAlthough there are quite a few experiments they seem rather preliminary.\nIt is not clear whether enough work was done to understand the effect of the\nmany different hyperparameters that the proposed method surely must have.\n\nThe authors claim to show empirically that their method can improve sample\nefficiency.\nThis is not necessarily a strong claim as such and could be achieved on\nrelatively simple tests.\nIn the discussion the authors claim their results indicate that their approach\nis able to accelearte learning on a variety of tasks, also not a strong claim.\n\nThe paper could be improved by adding a more clear explanation of the exact way\nby which the method helps with exploration and how it affects finding sparse\nrewards (based on e.g. Figure 1).\nIt seems that since only knowledge of seen trajectories can be used to generate\npaths to high reward states it only works for generating new trajectories\nthrough previously visited states.\n\nQuestions that could be clarified:\n- It is not entirely obvious to me what parametric models are used for the\nbacktracking distributions.\n- Does this method not also potentially hinder exploration by making the agent\nlearn to go after the same high rewards / Does the direction of the variational\nproblem guarantee coverage of the support of the R > L distribution by samples?\n- What would be the effect of a hyperparameter that balances learning the recall\ntraces and learning the true environment?\n- Are there also reinforcement learning tasks where the proposed methods'\nimprovement is marginal and the extra modeling effort is not justified (e.g.\ndue to increase complexity).\n\nPage 1: iwth (Typo)\nPage 2: r(s_t) -> r(s_t, a_t)\nPage 6: Prioritize d (Typo)\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the

We are glad that the reviewers found our paper to be  \"solid  contribution with well-written motivation with theoretical interpretations\" (reviewer 2) and \"well written in general\" (reviewer 1). \n\nWe made the following changes to the manuscript to address the reviewers comments.\n\n- We conducted more ablation experiments for the 3 hyper-parameters associated with our model, as asked by the Reviewer 1.\n\n- Training backtracking model by using demonstrations (Reviewer 2)  and then using the backtracking model for training another policy from scratch. We did experiments on Ant env from mujoco and Seaquest from atari, where we first train a backtracking model from the expert demonstrations, and then use that for training policy. We achieve 2.5x and about 2x sample efficiency in our very preliminary experiments. \n\n- Comparison with the forward model (Section G and H) as pointed by Rev 2. Rev 2 mentioned an interesting point of training forward and backward model.  Our conclusion is building the backward model is necessarily neither harder nor easier. Realistically, building any kind of model and having it be accurate for more than, say, 10 time steps is pretty hard. But if we only have 10 time steps of accurate transitions, it is probably better to take them backward.\n\nWe feel that by conducting extra experiments have improved the quality of the paper a lot, and we are grateful to reviewers for  very useful feedback.

As We evaluate it on a large number of very different domains (when the backtracking model is given as well as when we are learning the backtracking model as in off policy case and on-policy case)  and find that in all cases it improves performance. But we also think, that for some environments the backtracking model can be very hard to learn. For other problems, learning a model of the environment is difficult in either direction so those problems would be hard as well. The first issue would be severe if the forward dynamics are strongly many-to-one, for example. The second case applies to any complex environment and especially partially observed ones. Our method shines most when the dynamics are relatively simple but the problems are still hard due to sparse rewards.  \n\nOn the other hand, the backtracking model could also be used in practical settings like robotics, that involve repeatedly attempting to solve a particular task, and hence resetting the environment between different attempts. Here, we can use a model that learns both a forward policy and a backtracking model, and resetting of the environment can be approximated using the backtracking model. By learning this backtracking model, we can also determine when the policy is about to enter a non-reversible state, and hence can be useful for safety. It remains future work, to investigate this. \n\n>> Does this method not also potentially hinder exploration by making the agent learn to go after the same high rewards / Does the direction of the variational problem guarantee coverage of the support of the R > L distribution by samples?\n\nThis is a tricky subject and it is hard to come up with principles that will improve exploration in general and to be sure that something doesn't hinder exploration for some problems. In our setup, the exploration comes mostly from the goal generation methods. The backwards model helps more to speed up the propagation of high value to nearby states (indirectly), such that fewer environment interactions are needed but that could perhaps lead to fewer trips to locations with incorrectly assumed low value. On the other hand, the method might cause the exploration of different (better) paths to the same high value states as well, which should be a good thing. In general, since we are seeking high value (i.e. high expected return), so it shouldn't hinder exploration much. But instead if we seek \u201chigh reward\u201d states, then it would hinder performance, (as our experiments show). \n\n\nClosing:\nThank you for your time.

But we observe that sampling more traces actually helps for more complex environments. This is also again in contrast as compared to the forward model.  .  \n\nQ2)  How many steps each trace should be sampled for ?\nIn practice, if the agent is limited to one or a few initial states, a concern related to the length of generated backward traces is that longer traces become increasingly likely to deviate significantly from the traces that the agent can generate from its initial state. Therefore, in our experiments, we sample fairly short traces.  Figure 8 (Appendix, Section B) shows the Performance of our model (with TRPO) by varying the length of traces from backtracking model. All the time-steps are in thousands i.e (x1000). As evident by the figure, sampling very long traces seems to hinder the performance on all the domains.\n\nQ3) Effect of a hyperparameter that balances learning the recall traces and learning the true environment\n\nWe have added a Section H in the Appendix containing ablations for the four-room environment and some Mujoco tasks which tells about the effect this hyperparameter has on effective performance. \n\nIn Figure 17(Appendix, Section H) we noticed that as we increase the ratio of updates in the true environment to updates using recall traces from the backward model, the performance decreases. This highlights again the advantages of learning from the recall traces. In the second experiment, we see the effect of training from the recall traces multiple times for every iteration of training in the true environment. Figure 18(Appendix, Section H) shows that as we increase the number of iterations of learning from recall traces, we correspondingly need to choose a smaller trace length. For each update in the real environment, making more number of updates from recall traces helps if the trace length is smaller, and if the trace length is larger, it has a detrimental effect on the learning process. \n\nIn Figure 19(Appendix, Section H) we again find that for Mujoco tasks doing more updates using the recall traces is beneficial. Also for more updates we need to choose smaller trajectory length.\n\nIn essence, there is a balance between how much we should train in the actual environment and how much we should learn from the traces generated from the backward model. In the smaller four room-environment, 1:1 balance performed the best. In Mujoco tasks and larger four room environments, doing more updates from the backward model helps, but in the smaller four room maze, doing more updates is detrimental. So depending upon the complexity of the task, we need to decide this ratio. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1299/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1299/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1299/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Recall Traces: Backtracking Models for Efficient Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "In many environments only a tiny subset of all states yield high reward.

We demonstrate that the effectiveness by comparing the proposed algorithm in case when the true backtracking env. was avaliable, as well as when we learned the backtracking model too. We compare our methods to the state-of-the-art SAC algorithm on MuJoCo tasks in OpenAI gym (Brockman et al., 2016) and in rllab (Duan et al., 2016). We use SAC as a baseline as it notably outperforms other existing methods like DDPG, Soft-Q Learning and TD3. The results show that our method outperform on par with SAC in simple domains like swimmer, walker etc. They also provide evidence that the proposed method outperform SAC in challenging high dimensional domains like humanoid and Ant (Figure 7, Main Paper).\n\n\"It is not entirely obvious to me what parametric models are used for the backtracking distributions.\"\n\n\nThe backtracking model we used for all the experiments consisted of two multi-layer perceptrons: one for the backward action predictor Q(a_t | s_t+1) and one for the backward state predictor Q(s_t | a_t, s_t+1). Both MLPs had two hidden layers of 128 units. The action predictor used hyperbolic tangent units while the inverse state predictor used ReLU units. Each network produced as output the mean and variance parameters of a Gaussian distribution. For the action predictor the output variance was fixed to 1. For the state predictor this value was learned for each dimension.

We appreciate that the reviewer finds that our method is clearly explained.\n\n\"how does the backtracking model correspond to a forward-model? And it doesn't seem to be contradictory to me that the two can work together.\"\n\nThe reviewer raises a good point. This is indeed very useful. The Dyna algorithm uses a forward model to generate simulated experience that could be included in a model-free algorithm. This method was used to work with deep neural network policies, but performed best with models which are not neural networks (Gu et al., 2016a). Our intuition (and as we empirically show, Figure 19, Section H of Appendix) says that it might be better to generate simulated experience from a backtracking model (starting from a high value state) as compared to forward model, just because we know that traces from the backtracking model are good traces, as they lead to high value state, which is not necessarily the case for the simulated experience from a forward model.\n\nWe have added Figure 16 in Appendix( Section G) where we evaluate the Forward model with On-Policy TRPO on Ant and Humanoid Mujoco tasks. We were not able to get any better results on  with forward model as compared to the Baseline TRPO, which is consistent with the findings from (Gu et al., 2016a).\n\nIn essence, building the backward model is necessarily neither harder nor easier. Realistically, building any kind of model and having it be accurate for more than, say, 10 time steps is pretty hard. But if we only have 10 time steps of accurate transitions, it is probably better to take them backward model from different states as compared to from forward model from the same initial state. (as corroborated by the findings in Fig 16 of Appendix G, and Figure 19 of Appendix H). \n\nSomething which remains as a part of future investigation is to train the forward model and backtracking model jointly. As the backtracking model is tied to high value states, the forward model could extract the intended goal value from the high value state. When trained jointly, this should help the forward model learn some reduced representation of the state that is necessary to evaluate the reward. Ultimately, when planning, we want the model to predict the goal accurately, which helps to optimize for this \u201dgoal-oriented\u201d behaviour directly. This also avoids the need to model irrelevant aspects of the environment. We also mention this in Appendix (Section G).\n\n\n[1] (Gu et al, 2016) Continuous Deep Q-Learning with Model-based Acceleration http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/gu16.html\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1299/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1299/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1299/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Recall Traces: Backtracking Models for Efficient Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "In many environments only a tiny subset of all states yield high reward.

Yes, it's possible to train the backtracking model offline by watching demonstrations. And hence, the proposed method can also be used for imitation learning. In order to show something like this, we conducted the following experiment. We trained an expert policy on Mujoco domain (Ant) using TRPO. Using the trained policy, we sample expert trajectories, and using these trajectories we learned the backtracking model in an offline mode. Now, we trained another policy from scratch, but at the same time we sample the traces from the backtracking model.  This method is about(2.5)x more sample efficient as compared to PPO, with the same asymptotic performance.  We have not done any hyperparameter search right now, and hence it should be possible to improve these results.\n\nWe conducted additional experiments for Atari domain(Seaquest) too. For atari we trained an expert policy using a2c. And then using samples from the expert policy we learned a backtracking model.  And then we use this backtracking model for learning a new policy from scratch. This method is about(1.8)x more sample efficient as compared to A2C, with the same asymptotic performance. These results are very preliminary but it shows that it may be possible to train the backtracking model in offline mode, and use it for learning a new policy from scratch. \n\nPlease let us know if anything is unclear here, if you\u2019re uncertain about part of the argument, or if there is any other comparison that would be helpful in clarifying things more. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1299/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1299/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1299/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Recall Traces: Backtracking Models for Efficient Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "In many environments only a tiny subset of all states yield high reward.
