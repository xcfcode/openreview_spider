It consists of MNIST digits, sometimes transformed in various ways, and labeled with a variety of attributes. This dataset is used to measure statistics of various learned models.\n\nMeasuring disentanglement is certainly an important problem in our field. This dataset seems to be well designed, and I would recommend its use for papers studying disentanglement. The experiments are well-designed. While the reviewers seem bothered by the fact that it's limited to MNIST, this doesn't strike me as a problem. We continue to learn a lot from MNIST, even today.\n\nBut producing a useful dataset isn't by itself a significant enough research contribution for an ICLR paper. I'd recommend publication if (a) it were very different from currently existing datasets, (b) constructing it required overcoming significant technical obstacles, or (c) the dataset led to particularly interesting findings.\n\nRegarding (a), there are already datasets of similar complexity which have ground-truth attributes useful for measuring disentanglement, such as dSprites and 3D Faces. Regarding (b), the construction seems technically straightforward. Regarding (c), the experimental findings are plausible and consistent with past findings (which is a good validation of the dataset) but not obviously interesting in their own right.\n\nSo overall, this seems like a useful dataset, but I cannot recommend publication at ICLR.\n", "confidence": "4: The area chair is confident but not absolutely certain", "recommendation": "Reject", "title": "a useful dataset, but not enough of a contribution for an ICLR paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper742/Area_Chair1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper742/Area_Chair1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Morpho-MNIST: Quantitative Assessment and Diagnostics for Representation Learning", "abstract": "Revealing latent structure in data is an active field of research, having introduced exciting technologies such as variational autoencoders and adversarial networks, and is essential to push machine learning towards unsupervised knowledge discovery.

We absolutely agree that a generative model needs to learn about colour, texture, and low-level pixel relations to be able to extract its representations and to produce reasonable samples. Regarding the reviewer\u2019s statement that \u201cthe authors have assumed that the latent space of the generative models are influenced only by the morphological properties of the image\u201d, we would like to stress that we never made such assumptions nor have we claimed that the latent space of models trained on MNIST capture exclusively shape variations. What the Morpho-MNIST methodology aims to answer is: \u201cto what extent has my model learned to represent these specific factors of variation in the data?\u201d If colour and texture are important factors for a given application or dataset, it suffices to design the relevant scalar metrics and include them in the very same framework.\n\nThis brings us to the second point. As far as we are aware, this is the first attempt in *any* context to quantitatively characterise inferential and generative behaviour of learned representations. We propose to do it in terms of measurable features: here we exploit shape attributes, and in the conclusion we point to various possible extensions involving colours or object properties. In our view, it just makes sense that the first step in that direction builds on a simple dataset with well understood and easily measurable factors of variation.\n\nFinally, although it is correct that there are no generalisability guarantees, that is the case for any model evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR-10, or even ImageNet (cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00451, for example). As argued above, we are proposing a toolset to inspect and diagnose trained generative models that works with any collection of measurable attributes.

This is a very important and necessary problem.\n\nHowever, this paper lacks in terms of experimental evaluation and has some technical flaws.\n1. Morphological properties deals with only the \"shape\" properties of the image object. However, when the entire image is subject to the generative model, it learns multiple properties from the image apart from shape too - such as texture and color. Additionally, there are lot of low level pixel relations that the model learns to fit the distribution of the given images. However, here the authors have assumed that the latent space of the generative models are influenced only by the morphological properties of the image - which is wrong.

We strongly believe that the overall recommendation based on the reviewer\u2019s comments is unjustified.\n\nRegarding the first statement \u201cI am not sure generating data is sufficient contribution for a paper\u201d:\n\nGenerating a dataset is a relatively minor portion of this work; please refer to Sec. 1.1 for a clear outline of the main points. The bulk of our paper is about how morphometrics enable quantitative evaluation of learned representations (Section 4), and how the proposed image perturbations can enrich this evaluation and also open up a variety of new supervised tasks (explored in Appendix D). \n\nRegarding the second statement \u201cI am not sure what conclusion I should draw from Fig 5 and Fig 6 about the data\u201d:\n\nAs described clearly in the text, Fig. 5 shows quantitative results for _inferential_ disentanglement (i.e. from real MNIST test data to latent codes) of two different InfoGANs, and Fig. 6 for _generative_ disentanglement (from latent codes to generated samples). In the paper we state \u201cas the tables are mostly indistinguishable, we may argue that in this case the inference and generator networks have learned to consistently encode and decode the digit shape attributes.\u201d To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that partial correlations have been used to illustrate and quantitatively characterise the performance of representation learning, thanks to extracted morphometric attributes as proposed in the paper.\n\nThe final statement \u201cEventually this data can become a benchmark data when it is paired with a method. Then that method/data are a benchmark\u201d is not very clear to us. Our paper introduces both a novel quantitative assessment _methodology_ and new _datasets_ for experimentation and benchmarking of representation learning methods.

We thank the reviewer for bringing up this potential confusion, and we will add further clarification to make sure there is no ambiguity about this in our paper.\n\nAs a matter of fact, we believe that the current focus of research towards generating natural images can be misleading (or at least gives an incomplete picture) in the context of representation learning, as the quality of sampled images generally tells us little about how well the learned representations capture the known factors of variation in the training distribution.\n\nWith Morpho-MNIST, we aimed to address this issue by providing an objective methodology for evaluating representation learning, i.e. quantitatively measuring how expressive a trained generative model is and how well it covers the variability in the data, in our case defined by morphometry of shapes represented as grayscale images. In fact, we make no statements about measuring sample _quality_, only the _diversity_ of shape attributes. Our conclusion does point to possible extensions of this framework to other measurable content attributes for different types of images.\n\nThe fact that VAE and GAN performed similarly under our metrics shows only that, for this data and similar model capacities, the representations they learned are comparably expressive. We actually believe this is an important message to convey, as a large body of work focusing on the crispness of generated images might incorrectly lead to a conclusion that VAEs are generally inferior to GANs with respect to representation learning. Here, we can demonstrate quantitatively that for the considered type of distribution (morphometry of rasterised shapes) this is not the case.\n\nOn your point of \u201cwhether evaluating on MNIST is a good proxy for the performance of the model on colored images with backgrounds or not\u201d we would say the answer is clearly no. But, as mentioned above and hopefully made more clear in our revision, it was never our intention to imply otherwise. We also couldn\u2019t agree more with your statement \u201cI'm not convinced that [the] ability of a model in disentangling thickness correlates to their ability in natural image generation.\u201d These are very different problems.\n\nHowever, we would like to reiterate some of our reasons for focusing on MNIST, as presented in the introduction: few and simple factors of variation, sufficient size for its complexity, low computational requirements, and availability. Importantly, MNIST is a standard baseline on which a great number of generative models proposed in the literature are evaluated. This means that our framework can also be applied to these models retrospectively, adding novel insights about their performance in a more objective and quantitative manner.

We further propose a set of quantifiable perturbations to assess the performance of unsupervised and supervised methods on challenging tasks such as outlier detection and domain adaptation.", "keywords": ["quantitative evaluation", "diagnostics", "generative models", "representation learning", "morphometrics", "image perturbations"], "authorids": ["d.coelho-de-castro15@imperial.ac.uk", "j.tan17@imperial.ac.uk", "b.kainz@imperial.ac.uk", "kender@vision.ee.ethz.ch", "b.glocker@imperial.ac.uk"], "authors": ["Daniel C.
