Even though the results are good, it is hard to tell the novelty. The authors basically tried various network architectures and tuned configurations.  In addition, it was observed that a single model couldn't give the best performance across all the tasks (SNRs and types of modulation). So another classifier has to be trained to specifically classify the QAM signals.  It is not clear from the paper that how this is carried out. Is it a two-stage design, namely one first classifies the type of modulation and if it is QAM the signals go to the SVM with the expert features? \nOverall, I find this work not very inspiring.

Moreover, the experiments are not convincing. I therefore recommend to reject the paper.\n\nDetailed review:\n\nSection 2: \n- The features used are not clear: is it FFT ? the complex spectrum seems to be used, the authors should explain why (my understanding is that keeping the signal phase is important for the task).\n\n- The database seems to be split into train and test, without validation. This is a problem, as the architecture was tuned on the test set. Thus the main claim of the paper of reaching the best accuracy is questionable. The authors should use a validation set to tune the hyper-parameters and report the results on another test set. \n\nSection 3 :\n- the last paragraph is very hard to understand: the \"cumulant\" features should be presented, the classifier explained in more details and the experimental setup clarified (is it the same as the previous experiments?). The authors should also explain why they use a SVM in this case.
