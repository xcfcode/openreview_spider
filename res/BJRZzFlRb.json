The proposed method can reduce more than 90% memory consumption while keeping original model accuracy in both the sentiment analysis task and the machine translation tasks.\n\nOverall, the paper is well-written. The motivation is clear, the idea and approaches look suitable and the results clearly follow the motivation.\n\nI think it is better to clarify in the paper that the proposed method can reduce only the complexity of the input embedding layer. For example, the model does not guarantee to be able to convert resulting \"indices\" to actual words (i.e., there are multiple words that have completely same indices, such as rows 4 and 6 in Table 5), and also there is no trivial method to restore the original indices from the composite vector. As a result, the model couldn't be used also as the proxy of the word prediction (softmax) layer, which is another but usually more critical bottleneck of the machine translation task.\nFor reader's comprehension, it would like to add results about whole memory consumption of each model as well.\nAlso, although this paper is focused on only the input embeddings, authors should refer some recent papers that tackle to reduce the complexity of the softmax layer. There are also many studies, and citing similar approaches may help readers to comprehend overall region of these studies.\n\nFurthermore, I would like to see two additional analysis. First, if we trained the proposed model with starting from \"zero\" (e.g., randomly settling each index value), what results are obtained? Second, What kind of information is distributed in each trained basis vector? Are there any common/different things between bases trained by different tasks?", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Compressing Word Embeddings via Deep Compositional Code Learning", "abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) models often require a massive number of parameters for word embeddings, resulting in a large storage or memory footprint.

Hope our response can answer your question.\n\n1. About compressing the Softmax layer\n\nWe spent a significant period of time trying to apply the proposed method to the softmax layer, though without a successful result. It can be caused by the code sharing problem (multiple words get the same code) or the loss function. However, we are still optimistic that the compositional coding approach can also be applied to the softmax, which should be our future work. We will refer the readers to some recent papers that reduce the size of the softmax layer using pruning techniques.\n\n2. About the total model size\n\nThe full sizes of the baseline models are summarized in the following table:\n\nTask                          Embed      Full size   Ratio of embed\nIMDB                         78 MB        79.1 MB         98.6%\nIWSLT De-En           35 MB         94   MB         37.2%\nASPEC En-Ja            274 MB       506 MB         54.1%\n\nWe will put the information of full model sizes into the tables in the experiment section.\n\n3. Experiment with random code assignment\n\nWe tried to initialize a set of 32 x 16 codes to be random numbers and see the performance in the \u0010IMDB task. With the random code assignment, the accuracy is much lower than the baseline.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nModel                                                            Accuracy\nBaseline                                                        87.18\nRandom code + trained codebooks           84.19\nRandom code + random codebooks          84.72\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4. Analysis of information distributed in the codes\n\nAs the codes are learned by a neural net, the interpretability is not guaranteed. However, we found some interesting relations in the codes.\n\nFor animal names, the 3rd subcode is normally a \"5\" for the plural nouns. For the verbs, we found the 2nd subcode is normally a \"0\" if the verb is in the past tense. Although there are also violations, we believe the model learned to arrange the codes in an efficient way.\n\n----\ndog        7 7 0 1 7 3 7 0\ndogs      4 7 5 1 7 3 4 0\n\ncat        0 7 0 1 7 3 7 0\ncats      4 7 5 1 7 3 4 0\n\npig        7 3 6 1 7 3 4 7\npigs      7 3 5 1 7 3 4 0\n\nfish       7 7 6 1 4 3 4 7\nfishes    7 2 5 0 7 3 4 6\n\nfox        6 5 7 1 4 3 0 0\nfoxes    6 2 5 1 7 3 4 6\n----\nbuy          0 7 2 1 4 3 3 1\nbought    0 0 2 1 4 3 3 1\n\nkick        7 6 1 1 4 3 0 0\nkicked    7 0 1 1 4 3 2 0\n\ngo         7 7 0 6 4 3 3 0\nwent    4 0 7 6 4 3 2 0\n\npick        7 6 7 1 4 3 3 0\npicked    7 0 7 1 4 0 3 0\n\ncatch       7 7 1 6 4 3 6 0\ncaught     7 0 7 4 4 3 2 0\n----"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Compressing Word Embeddings via Deep Compositional Code Learning", "abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) models often require a massive number of parameters for word embeddings, resulting in a large storage or memory footprint.
