In particular, they propose a NAS algorithm based on neural dendritic branching, and apply it to three different segmentation tasks (namely cell nuclei, electron microscopy, and chest X-ray lung segmentation). The authors share their codes with the scientific community, which is highly appreciated. \n\n- I have a concern about one of the main motivations of the paper. The authors say that they \"take inspiration from the brain because it has the most efficient neuronal wiring of any complex structure\" (lines 7 and 8 in the Abstract). My question is: What is the problem with using biologically implausible NAS methods or with the fact that some approaches are incompatible with current understandings in neuro-biology? I consider that all proposals to improve neural networks (NNs) training and design are welcome, but I do not see the relevance of explicitly searching for biologically realistic algorithms in NNs. As Yann LeCun would say (http://matt.colorado.edu/compcogworkshop/talks/lecun.pdf): \"Let's be inspired by nature, but not too much\". It is indeed nice to imitate nature, but we mainly need to understand what is actually relevant for our practical purposes. For instance, as pointed out by LeCun, in the case of airplanes, we developed aerodynamics and compressible fluid dynamics, and we figured out that feathers and wing flapping were not crucial. In this sense, I'd like to see a better justification and contextualization of this dendritic branching approach.\n\n- The paper, in my humble opinion, is a bit confusing, because the different contributions and overall structure of the paper dilute the main focus of the paper. The paper first starts with the presentation of a novel bioinspired NAS method. Then, we move towards medical imaging segmentation and the limitations of U-Net, and later we discover that there are also evolutionary computation algorithms involved (as a primary contributions that is not even cited in the Abstract). I would encourage the authors to rewrite the paper in a clearer way, identifying the core contribution and challenges, as well as the motivation and the rationale behind the approach they use. In particular, I'd like to better understand how the submitted paper compares (quantitatively and qualitatively) to prior art, and what are the conceptual or empirical advantages of the proposed approach.\n\n- Why other NAS algorithms were not included in the experimental comparison (apart from Weng et al. (2019))? Regarding the competitor methods, why not to introduce in the comparison methods like Neuron-Evolution for Augmenting Topology (NEAT) [1], HyperNEAT [2], ENAS [3] or [4], that represent popular methods in neural architecture search? Without a more extensive experimental comparison with prior methods and different strategies is difficult to elucidate the actual empirical contribution of the proposed method. \n[1] Kenneth O.

From this point of view, statements like \"Within the last five years, advances in NAS have branched into different areas, including evolutionary algorithms (Real et al., 2018)\" look insufficient. The related works section is, in my opinion, not complete and clear enough. See the following papers as example:  \n[5] Miller, Geoffrey F., Peter M. Todd, and Shailesh U. Hegde. \"Designing Neural Networks using Genetic Algorithms.\" ICGA. Vol. 89. 1989.\n[6] de Garis, H. (1990). \"Genetic programming: Modular evolution for Darwin machines\".

Proceedings of the IEEE, 87(9), 1423-1447.\n\n- In relation to the proposed model itself (called Bractivate), there are many aspects that remain unclear:\n(1) What do the authors mean by semi-random evolutionary algorithm?\n(2) What evolutionary algorithm do they use? It appears that they just apply a mutation operator on the most active block in the best architecture found so far. \n(3) The authors propose a loss that includes the number of model parameters and the training time per epoch. In this sense, what do the authors mean by BCE in Equation 3? I guess they actually refer to BCL, right?\n(4) If I understood correctly, Bractivate does not allow to create or insert new blocks but it only branches already existing blocks (using two skip connection operator types: concatenation or addition). This seems a severe limitation in the neural architectures it can generate. Am I correct? \n(5) The authors state that \"Our ablation study most strongly confirms our hypothesis that dendritic branching to active blocks significantly improves segmentation performance\". Did the authors employ several independent runs, some experimental validation protocol (like Cross-validation) and statistical tests to verify the existence of statistically significant differences between the methods under comparison?

If so, why do not we directly use densely connected network?\n3.\tThe experiment results show your model cannot reach SOTA in 2/3 datasets. \n4.\tNo ablation study of the proposed efficient loss.\n5.\tI suggest you improve your set type. It is not easy to detect the main text and the caption of Figure 3 and Figure 5. \n6.\tIn Figure 6. You should explain the meaning of the color. In caption, you should explain the effectiveness with more detail. Such as which part of the image is highlight and what does it mean.\n7.\tYou need to improve you writing. There are too many strange expressions in your paper. In Sec 3.3 you can say \u201cNAS methods often focus on accuracy, which is regarded as the main performance metric\u201d. In Sec 4.4 you can say \u201cWe experiment with the standard binary BCL loss function in Equation 2, and the ELs function in Equation 3.\u201d You may need lots of efforts working on this. \n\nOverall Review:\nThis paper borrows neuroscience concepts into NAS problems, which is a good story. However, this paper has too many problems to be solved, as mentioned above. You may need lots of effort improving your paper.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper847/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper847/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Bractivate: Dendritic Branching in Medical Image Segmentation Neural Architecture Search", "authorids": ["~Leila_Abdelrahman1"], "authors": ["Leila Abdelrahman"], "keywords": ["Neural Architecture Search", "Segmentation", "Computer Vision"], "abstract": "Researchers manually compose most neural networks through painstaking experimentation.\nThis process is taxing and explores only a limited subset of possible\narchitecture. Researchers design architectures to address objectives ranging from low\nspace complexity to high accuracy through hours of experimentation. Neural architecture\nsearch (NAS) is a thriving field for automatically discovering architectures\nachieving these same objectives. Addressing these ever-increasing challenges in\ncomputing, we take inspiration from the brain because it has the most efficient\nneuronal wiring of any complex structure; its physiology inspires us to propose\nBractivate, a NAS algorithm inspired by neural dendritic branching. An evolutionary algorithm that adds new skip connection combinations to the most active blocks in the network, propagating salient\ninformation through the network. We apply our methods to lung x-ray, cell nuclei\nmicroscopy, and electron microscopy segmentation tasks to highlight Bractivate's robustness.\nMoreover, our ablation studies emphasize dendritic branching's necessity: ablating\nthese connections leads to significantly lower model performance. We finally\ncompare our discovered architecture with other state-of-the-art UNet models,\nhighlighting how efficient skip connections allow Bractivate to achieve comparable\nresults with substantially lower space and time complexity, proving how\nBractivate balances efficiency with performance.
