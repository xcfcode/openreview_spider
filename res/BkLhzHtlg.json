Some of the explanation in the discussion below has been helpful (e.g. see my earlier questions about Fig 4 and 5); the paper would benefit from including more such explanations. \n\nIt may be worthwhile very briefly mentioning the relationship of \"diagonal\" connections to other emerging terms for similar ideas (e.g. skip connections, etc). \"Skip\" seems to me to be accurate regardless of how you draw the network, whereas \"diagonal\" only makes sense for certain visual layouts.\n\nIn response to comment in the discussion below: \"leading to less over-segmentation of action bouts\" (and corresponding discussion in section 5.1 of the paper): I would be like to have a bit more about this in the paper. I have assumed that \"per-bout\" refers to \"per-action event\", but now I am not certain that I have understood this correctly (i.e. can a \"bout\" last for a few minutes?): given the readership, I think it would not be inappropriate to define some of these things explicitly.\n\nIn response to comment about fly behaviours that last minutes vs milliseconds: This is interesting, and I would be curious to know how classification accuracy relates to the time-scale of the behaviour (e.g. are most of the mistakes on long-term behaviours? i realize that this would only tell part of the story, e.g. if you have a behaviour that has both a long-term duration, but that also has very different short-term characteristics than many other behaviours, it should be easy to classify accuractely despite being \"long-term\"). If easy to investigate this, I would add a comment about it; if this is hard to investigate, it's probably not worth it at this point, although it's something you might want to look at in future.\n\nIn response to comment about scaling to human behavior: I agree that in principle, adding conv layers directly above the sensory input would be the right thing to try, but seriously: there is usually a pretty big gap between what \"should\" work and what actually works, as I am sure the authors are aware. (Indeed, I am sure the authors have a much more experiential and detailed understanding of the limitations of their work than I do). What I see presented is a nice system that has been demonstrated to handle spatiotemporal trajectories. The claims made should correspond to this. \n\nI would consider adjusting my rating to a 7 depending on future revisions.\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Learning Recurrent Representations for Hierarchical Behavior Modeling", "abstract": "We propose a framework for detecting action patterns from motion sequences and modeling the sensory-motor relationship of animals, using a generative recurrent neural network.

This could happen if the learnt bias for an action results in a lower threshold on the classification score, leading to less over-segmentation of action bouts.

I apologize for the late response which is due to my travels.\n\nWe state in the introduction that this work focuses on going from trajectories to actions, with emphasis on modeling the dynamics of behavior rather than feature extraction. We take advantage of the fact that we can obtain such data for flies behaving naturally in a controlled environment, which cannot be easily obtained for humans. Thus, the fruit fly can be used as a model organism, not only for science but also for AI research. Modeling human behavior is not our only end goal, the modeling of laboratory-animal behavior is very useful for the behavior science community. \n\nWe do test our model on a subset of human behavior, online handwriting, that fits easily into our framework. Should we apply the framework to human motion capture with video as sensory input we would not directly apply the framework but, for instance, put a convolutional neural net between the sensory input and our network to extract a higher level sensory representation before feeding it to the dynamical system.\n\nI would also like to point out that the data on which we evaluate our framework also has some of the complexities you mention:\n**Sparsity of labeled data. This can mean that:\na) Data is partially and intermittently labeled. Our framework handles this by computing loss only on frames where labels are provided (and that loss gets propagated back to preceding input frames that may be themselves not be labeled). \nb) In a fully labeled dataset, behaviors of interest are rare and the *null* category takes up majority of the frames. This is the case with our fly behavior data where majority of actions take up less than 1% of the frames. \n**Individual idiosyncrasies. This is the main challenge of the handwriting data.\n**Long time scales. Fly behaviors are performed at various time scales, some actions are as short as a millisecond while others can take up several minutes (this is the case within and across action classes).\n\nBest,\nEyrun"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Learning Recurrent Representations for Hierarchical Behavior Modeling", "abstract": "We propose a framework for detecting action patterns from motion sequences and modeling the sensory-motor relationship of animals, using a generative recurrent neural network.

In general, we would like our system to be able to model nondeterministic behavior. \n\nGANs are not directly relevant when considering output being nondeterministic given the input. The adversarial part of GANs effectively serves as a loss function for the generative model, pushing it to produce more realistic outputs, but it does not make the generative model non-deterministic. The generative model is commonly deterministic, conditioned on random noise. In our setting we explicitly model the distribution over possible outputs given an input.\n\nThe training signal we use for motion prediction is the ground truth future motion of an agent.

The system is not restricted to modeling behavior when it is correlated with the agent\u2019s motion patterns, it can disambiguate between action classes with similar motion patterns by two means:\n\n1) Visual context. The input to the network is not only the motion sequence of an animal but also a sequence of sensory inputs. In the case of a fruit fly, sensory inputs represent the position of other agents and the chamber walls relative to the fly. If the system were applied to humans, the motion sequence might be the output of wearable motion sensors or a tracked skeleton and the sensory input the output of a 1st person camera or an overhead camera. While the motion pattern for \u2018drinking\u2019 and \u2018eating\u2019 might be similar, the visual context could disambiguate between the two.\n\n2) Temporal context. Action labels are embedded in the recurrent cells, in our case the gated recurrent units, which gives the system a long short term memory of actions. \u2018Starting a car\u2019 would thus be more likely than \u2018opening a door\u2019 after a sequence of \u2018opening a door\u2019 and \u2018sitting down\u2019 has been observed (given that the sequence \u2018opening a door\u2019 --> \u2018sitting down\u2019 --> \u2018starting a car\u2019 appears more often in the training labels than \u2018opening a door\u2019 --> \u2018sitting down\u2019 --> \u2018opening a door\u2019).\n\nSincerely,\nEyrun"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Learning Recurrent Representations for Hierarchical Behavior Modeling", "abstract": "We propose a framework for detecting action patterns from motion sequences and modeling the sensory-motor relationship of animals, using a generative recurrent neural network.
