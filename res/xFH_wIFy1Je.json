Recent works attribute this to a phenomenon peculiar to the extraction of node features in graph-based tasks, i.e., the need to consider multiple neighborhood sizes at the same time and adaptively tune them. In this paper, we investigate the recently proposed randomly wired architectures in the context of graph neural networks. Instead of building deeper networks by stacking many layers, we prove that employing a randomly-wired architecture can be a more effective way to increase the capacity of the network and obtain richer representations. We show that such architectures behave like an ensemble of paths, which are able to merge contributions from receptive fields of varied size. Moreover, these receptive fields can also be modulated to be wider or narrower through the trainable weights over the paths.", "pdf": "/pdf/d07e33bf2a9acfd087781116246f3da651cb162a.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|dont_stack_layers_in_graph_neural_networks_wire_them_randomly", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021dont,\ntitle={Don't stack layers in graph neural networks, wire them randomly},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to ICLR 2021 Workshop on Geometrical and Topological Representation Learning},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=xFH_wIFy1Je},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615225929161, "tmdate": 1615967298665, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
