We will change the title as suggested. We think, as other reviewers have mentioned, that this work is exciting because it introduces the idea that deep neural networks can be used in a neural modeling context with limited experimental data. In particular, the framework we introduced for sharing information across neurons allows us to fit richer models given less data, and we believe this will be a powerful approach for modeling data from a number of other brain areas - most of which are much less studied / understood than the retina.\n\nYes, a model with free parameters or more complicated structure could eventually outperform the shared model with enough training data but there are real biological and experimental limitations to the amount of data one can collect in these experiments and more broadly in most neuroscience experiments. \n\nWe also believe we have taken important first steps to understanding the model improvement through model comparisons. Whether the gap between linear-nonlinear model performance and optimal performance could be explained by a combination of  long-range spatial interactions and spatial and temporal nonlinearities might seem simple, but it is an important question in the field that has been difficult to address.  We showed that the former is not true (at least up to the level of RNN performance) and that both spatial nonlinearities and nonlinear temporal processing are important. These results can guide future research and experiments and further demonstrate the utility of our approach.  This is a first step: in future work, we plan to further interrogate the RNN models to understand more specifically what information they are capturing. As noted above, we also plan to apply this framework to non-retinal neurons where there are larger gaps between what current models capture and the optimal predictions. In these systems, there is more room for improvement and more basic questions can be answered using our approach. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Multilayer Recurrent Network Models of Primate Retinal Ganglion Cell Responses", "abstract": "Developing accurate predictive models of sensory neurons is vital to understanding sensory processing and brain computations.

A multilayer rnn is trained to imitate the stimulus-response mapping measured from actual retinal ganglion cells in response to a sequence of natural images.  The rnn performs significantly better, especially in accounting for transient responses, than conventional LN/GLM models.\n\nThis work is an important step in understanding the nonlinear response properties of visual neurons.  Recent results have shown that the responses of even retinal ganglion cells in response to natural movies are difficult to explain in terms of standard receptive field models.  So this presents an important challenge to the field.  If we even had *a* model that works, it would be a starting point.  So this work should be seen in that light.  The challenge now of course is to tease apart what the rnn is doing.  Perhaps it could now be pruned and simplified to see what parts are critical to performance.  It would have been nice to see such an analysis.   Nevertheless this result is a good first start and I think important for people to know about.\n\nI am a bit confused about what is being called a \"movie.\"  My understanding is that it is essentially a sequence of unrelated images shown for 1 sec. each.  But then it is stated that the \"frame rate\" is 1/8.33 ms.  I think this must refer to the refresh rate of the monitor, right?   \n\nI would guess that the deviations from the LN model are even stronger when you show actual dynamic natural scenes - i.e., real movies.  Here I would expect the rnn to have an even more profound effect, and potentially be much more informative.\n", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Multilayer Recurrent Network Models of Primate Retinal Ganglion Cell Responses", "abstract": "Developing accurate predictive models of sensory neurons is vital to understanding sensory processing and brain computations.

I think the title should thus include the word \u201cactivity\u201d at the end for otherwise it is actually formally incorrect.\n\nAnyhow, this paper proposes more specifically a recurrent network for this time series prediction and compares it to what seems to be the previous approach of a generalized linear model. Overall the stated paradigm is that when one can predict the spikes well then one can look into the model and learn how nature does it. \n\nIn general the paper sounds plausible, though I am not convinced that I learned a lot. The results in figure 2 show that the RNN model can predict the spikes a bit better. So this is nice. But now what? You have shown that a more complicated model can produce better fits to the data, though there are of course still some variations to the real data. Your initial outline was that a better predictive model helps you to better understand the neural processing in the retina. So tell us what you learned. I am not a specialist of the retina, but I know that there are several layers and recurrencies in the retina, so I am not so surprised that the new model is better than the GLM. \n\nIt seems that more complicated recurrent models such as LSTM do not improve the performance according to a statement in the paper. However, comparisons on this level are also difficult as a more complex models needs more data. Hence, I would actually expect that more layers and even a more detailed model of the retina could eventually improve the prediction even further. \nI was also a bit puzzled that all the neurons in the network share all the same parameters (weights). While the results show that these simplified models can capture a lot of the spike train characteristics, couldn\u2019t a model with free parameters eventually outperform this one (with correspondingly more training data)?\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Multilayer Recurrent Network Models of Primate Retinal Ganglion Cell Responses", "abstract": "Developing accurate predictive models of sensory neurons is vital to understanding sensory processing and brain computations.

We fit models to these two experiments separately due to animal to animal variability in cell properties, such as receptive field size and firing rate.\n2) The movies consisted of a series of images presented for one second each. Within each second, the image is spatially jittered to replicate small eye movements. At the end, the image is replaced with a new image.\n3) Test and training movies are interleaved because sometimes neural responses systematically drift over time. Interleaving means that the testing data spans the same period of time as the fitting data, and therefore is experiencing the same range of conditions.  This is a standard protocol in sensory neuroscience.\n4) We have repetitions of the test movie so that we predict the average firing rate over multiple trials. On each trial, we assume that spikes are drawn from the average firing rate using a Poisson distribution, so averaging over repetitions produces a less noisy estimate of the true firing rate.\n5) As shown in the legend, the light and dark colors indicate the results from the two different experiments throughout the manuscript.\n\nWe have uploaded a revision clarifying these details of the experimental set-up in Section 3.1"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Multilayer Recurrent Network Models of Primate Retinal Ganglion Cell Responses", "abstract": "Developing accurate predictive models of sensory neurons is vital to understanding sensory processing and brain computations.

You only run the models with a relatively coarse time binning though. Have you explored running the RNN at a time scale which is on the order of spike time precision when we can precisely characterize the inputs to a neuron (eg, 1 ms or less)? It might be that at shorter time scales, the improved ability of the RNN to match spike timing causes it to more dramatically outperform traditional techniques.\n\nSimilarly, though I recognize it may be out of scope for this paper, are you planning to give the RNN access to recorded spike trains as well as the stimulus? Or possibly to the LFP signal? Spiking is often better aligned to recent spikes or ongoing oscillations than to stimuli, so this might buy you further gains over more traditional approaches."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Multilayer Recurrent Network Models of Primate Retinal Ganglion Cell Responses", "abstract": "Developing accurate predictive models of sensory neurons is vital to understanding sensory processing and brain computations.
