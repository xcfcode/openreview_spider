Learning the intrinsic structure property of data is a crucial step for dimensionality reduction and effective feature extraction. This paper develops Grassmann graph embedding, which combines graph convolutions to capture the main components within graphs' hidden representations. Each set of featured graph nodes is mapped to a point on a Grassmann matrix manifold through Singular Value Decomposition, which is then embedded into a symmetric matrix space that approximates denoised second-order feature information. The view of treating nodes as a set could inspire many potential applications. In particular, we propose Grassmann (global graph) pooling that can connect with any graph convolution for graph neural networks. The Grassmann pooling achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of graph prediction benchmarks.", "pdf": "/pdf/11df76952cb8774915532b326ef1a62da44c017c.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|grassmann_graph_embedding", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021grassmann,\ntitle={Grassmann Graph Embedding},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to ICLR 2021 Workshop on Geometrical and Topological Representation Learning},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ELsrI4NgvS-},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615225929161, "tmdate": 1615967298665, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
