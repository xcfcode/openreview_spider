RENAS is the only Evolutionary-RL architecture search hybrid that we are aware of, and the approach it took does lead to good performance. However, we believe that the differences between RENAS and Evo-NAS are fundamental.\n\nAs we wrote in point 3 of our \"Comparison with RENAS\" comment, RENAS uses an additional mutation grammar (so, a mutation search space), and the task for RL is to navigate that space. Because of that, we don't see a straightforward way to create an ablation of RENAS containing just the RL part alone (and such an ablation is not covered in the RENAS paper).\n\nOn the other hand, Evo-NAS lies on a continuous spectrum. Two extreme points of that spectrum are Evo-NAS's ablations: either having just the evolutionary part, or just the RL part. We believe that, as far as advocating for further exploring this spectrum goes, our paper makes a much stronger point for it than the RENAS paper."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1813/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1813/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Evo-NAS: Evolutionary-Neural Hybrid Agent for Architecture Search", "authors": ["Krzysztof Maziarz", "Mingxing Tan", "Andrey Khorlin", "Kuang-Yu Samuel Chang", "Andrea Gesmundo"], "authorids": ["krzysztof.s.maziarz@gmail.com", "tanmingxing@google.com", "akhorlin@google.com", "kysc@google.com", "agesmundo@google.com"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search has shown potential to automate the design of neural networks.

Below we review some key differences and reasons why we think the main contributions of our work still stand. While both works hybridize RL with evolution, we believe the goals are very different, and the insights complementary. Please let us know your thoughts on this comparison.\n\n1) We believe that the purpose of RENAS was achieving SotA accuracy on CIFAR10 and ImageNet with low computational cost. To that end, they proposed a framework which does use both RL and Evolution to produce child models. However, RENAS is also augmented with several domain-specific optimizations and improvements that could be complementary to many possible search algorithms, including:\n- a complex way of proposing new mutations by using attention and a bidirectional LSMT encoder ran on the architecture description\n- reloading weights from the parent model into the child model (related to the approach in ENAS)\n- a refined reward function: instead of using validation accuracy directly, it is rescaled and passed through the tan() function\n- improved search space (not reused from any prior work)\n\nWe think that likely all of these different ideas, together with combining RL with Evolution, contribute to RENAS achieving good results. In contrast, our aim was not to necessarily push Evo-NAS to its limits in terms of accuracy or computational savings - in fact, the improvements listed above could also be applied to Evo-NAS. We explicitly chose not to do that (for example, not to reload child weights or tune the search space), because our goal was to study how RL and evolution work together. The RL and Evolutionary baselines that we compare with are simply ablations of Evo-NAS, so the fact that Evo-NAS outperforms them both really shows that there is something to be gained from both worlds.\n\n2) Since our aim was to show that combining learning and evolution leads to gains across domains, we experiment with many: image (ImageNet, NAS-Bench), NLP, and synthetic. While we focus on architecture search, we also believe that our results hint that Evo-NAS would show strong performance in different (although similar) discrete optimization problems - and we would be happy to see follow-up works of this kind. In contrast, RENAS approach strongly focuses on the image domain, and applying it to other domains is a future research opportunity.\n\n3) Evo-NAS learns a policy directly on the architecture search-space, while RENAS learns it over the space of possible mutations applicable to a given parent model. Thus, the application of RENAS requires to define an additional mutation grammar and a more complex agent (e.g. composed of 4 distinct mutation generation sub-steps)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1813/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1813/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Evo-NAS: Evolutionary-Neural Hybrid Agent for Architecture Search", "authors": ["Krzysztof Maziarz", "Mingxing Tan", "Andrey Khorlin", "Kuang-Yu Samuel Chang", "Andrea Gesmundo"], "authorids": ["krzysztof.s.maziarz@gmail.com", "tanmingxing@google.com", "akhorlin@google.com", "kysc@google.com", "agesmundo@google.com"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search has shown potential to automate the design of neural networks.

The combined EVO-NAS has showed consistent good performance over a range of tasks.\n\nOverall, while the novelty of the paper is not exceptional, since it is a rather straightforward combination of two existing approaches, the end-results is promising. I would like to see more in-depth analysis on the combined algorithm to validate authors' hypothesis on why EVO-NAS works better. More detailed comments can be found below.\n\n1. The experiment on the synthetic task is not very helpful, since the domain can be far apart from the real NAS applications. One evidence is that the NN significantly outperform EVO in this task but not in the other tasks.\n\n2. In difficult tasks, the proposed EVO-NAS and the original Aging EVO are very close in the first few hundreds of trials, however, later the gap remains the same. It would be interesting to see if we can eliminate the gap by adding the NN component in the middle of the Aging EVO experiment (e.g., at the point of 2000 trials).\n\n3. I am also curious about the difference between the NN learned from Neural agent vs. those learned from EVO-NAS agent. Moreover, do we need a NN for the EVO-NAS?

We address each of your concerns below. Please let us know if you have some further comments - we are happy to make changes to the paper to improve it.\n\n1. While the gains are not enormous, we agree with Reviewer #2 in saying that they are consistent across a range of different tasks: both in real-life AS scenarios (NAS-Bench, NLP, ImageNet), and in the synthetic task. However, making sure that differences between results are statistically significant is certainly an important point.\n\nFor example, note that for NLP (Table 1), we ran 10 runs for each (approach, dataset) pair. We claim that Evo-NAS matches the better of the baselines in all cases, and in 3 out of 7 it outperforms the best baseline with statistical significance. We made this claim for the three datasets where the difference exceeded twice the standard-error-of-the-mean. This can also be easily translated into p-values: for example, for the ConsumerComplaints dataset, the p-value for Evo-NAS\u2019s gains over either baseline being statistically significant is < 0.02 (so we reject the null hypothesis that there is no gain).\n\nWe used simple statistical measures such as the ones described above to assess significance. However, we are open to performing additional nonparametric tests, such as the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test you proposed. Please let us know what would be the exact test that you had in mind (i.e. what would be the null hypothesis). For example, we could consider pairs of (average result of Evolution, average result of Evo-NAS) over all benchmarks considered in the paper (there are 10 in total since we should count each NLP dataset separately), and perform the test on these pairs. In that case, the Signed-Rank test does show significance, as in all cases the mean result of Evo-NAS is strictly better than the mean result of Evolution.\n\n2. You are right in saying that there are many smart evolutionary algorithms out there. However, to our knowledge, the NAS domain is dominated by \u201cnon-adaptive\u201d evolution (i.e. with uniform prior over mutations), which also seems to perform very well across different AS domains. Since here we focus on architecture search, we compare our method to two strong, common and most recent baselines (the combination of which gives Evo-NAS).\n\nNote that our hybrid may not necessarily be the best algorithm of this kind; our intention was to show that combining these two worlds (learning-based and evolution-based) in a relatively simple way we can get consistent gains across multiple domains.\n\nOne kind of follow-up works that we wish to inspire is exactly what you are proposing: bringing different \u201csmart\u201d genetic algorithms from the evolution community to the NAS community, and investigating their behavior on architecture search. It is surely an exciting direction, although one that is not the focus of our current work."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1813/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1813/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Evo-NAS: Evolutionary-Neural Hybrid Agent for Architecture Search", "authors": ["Krzysztof Maziarz", "Mingxing Tan", "Andrey Khorlin", "Kuang-Yu Samuel Chang", "Andrea Gesmundo"], "authorids": ["krzysztof.s.maziarz@gmail.com", "tanmingxing@google.com", "akhorlin@google.com", "kysc@google.com", "agesmundo@google.com"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search has shown potential to automate the design of neural networks.

Please let us know if you have any more feedback about our work, since we would be happy to use it to make the paper better. Below we specifically address each of the points that you made.\n\n1. We agree that the synthetic task is far from real NAS applications. In our paper we do focus on NAS, and the other lines of experiments (NAS-Bench, NLP datasets, ImageNet) are all real-life architecture search scenarios. However, as we hint in the \u201cConclusion\u201d section, it is possible to apply Evo-NAS to tasks outside of architecture search. Discrete optimization problems such as our toy task could be one example, and we see that Evo-NAS also performs very well in this domain. We think that makes the approach even more promising in terms of inspiring future work.\n\n2. As we understand the proposal, you would consider running the NN learning component not from the beginning of the experiment, but start learning later on. This would save some computational cost; are we missing any other advantages of this approach? Our initial intuition is that the savings might be limited due to low overhead of running the NN compared to the training of candidate architectures. However, it would be interesting to experiment further in this direction in the future.\n\n3. You made a good point that we could use something simpler than a Neural Network for the learning part of Evo-NAS. Since we wanted our approach to be comparable to existing methods, we used a NN, since it\u2019s somewhat standard in the NAS community. Also, from a theoretical standpoint, a NN has a useful property of being a universal approximator. On the other hand, it does seem likely that guiding the evolutionary search (i.e. producing a good prior over mutations) might be an easier problem than learning the structure of all solutions (i.e. producing a good prior over the entire search space). \n\nTherefore, it\u2019s certainly possible that using something simpler as the learning part of Evo-NAS would be sufficient to get good results. However, again note that in terms of computational cost the NN part is negligible - so any gains would not be in terms of compute, but perhaps in enhanced explainability of the learning component."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1813/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1813/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Evo-NAS: Evolutionary-Neural Hybrid Agent for Architecture Search", "authors": ["Krzysztof Maziarz", "Mingxing Tan", "Andrey Khorlin", "Kuang-Yu Samuel Chang", "Andrea Gesmundo"], "authorids": ["krzysztof.s.maziarz@gmail.com", "tanmingxing@google.com", "akhorlin@google.com", "kysc@google.com", "agesmundo@google.com"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search has shown potential to automate the design of neural networks.

Below we specifically address both of the points that you raised. Let us know if you have any more concerns - we are happy to make improvements to the paper.\n\n1. To make the assessment that the methods have converged, we looked at the best reward attained (right plots), not reward running average (left plots). By \u201creward running average\u201d, we mean sliding a constant size window over the reward, and computing the average reward in each such window. This measure is not a good metric to compare the algorithms, and we use it just to show how much the reward varies from sample to sample for different methods.\n\nNote that learning-based methods (like Neural PQT which you mentioned) do see small improvements in running average reward even long after they stop exploring new parts of the search space - this is simply because they keep making their distributions over actions \u201csharper\u201d. Therefore, it is more informative to look at best reward attained over time.\n\nWith that in mind, we review below the experiments that you pointed to - that is, Figures 2 and 3. You also mentioned Figure 1, which does not correspond to any experiment, so we assumed this to be a typo - but let us know if you meant something else there, and we can discuss further.\n\n- For NAS-Bench (Figure 3), the methods see only marginal improvements at the end of the experiment.\n\n- For the synthetic task (Figure 2), all methods see small improvements of the reward if ran longer, but the overall pattern remains the same (Evo-NAS (PQT) attaining the best results, matched by Neural (PQT) from around 4500 trials onward).\n\n2. Our understanding is that PQT provides a stronger training signal than Reinforce. This comes at a cost, since Reinforce is known to be unbiased, and therefore it produces gradients that (in expectation) match the gradient of the expected reward. On the other hand, PQT is a heuristic, and it gives no theoretical guarantees.\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t say that PQT is always better than Reinforce - this is likely very domain dependent. Our focus is architecture search, where the number of trials is typically low given the complexity of the search spaces. In this domain, as seen in our experiments, trading off theoretical guarantees and lack of bias for a stronger and more greedy training signal leads to better results.\n\nNevertheless, comparing PQT to classical RL algorithms (like Reinforce, but also many others) is a very interesting research direction. Since our main goal was hybridizing RL-based and Evolution-based approaches to architecture search, we did not explore this direction in our work."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1813/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1813/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Evo-NAS: Evolutionary-Neural Hybrid Agent for Architecture Search", "authors": ["Krzysztof Maziarz", "Mingxing Tan", "Andrey Khorlin", "Kuang-Yu Samuel Chang", "Andrea Gesmundo"], "authorids": ["krzysztof.s.maziarz@gmail.com", "tanmingxing@google.com", "akhorlin@google.com", "kysc@google.com", "agesmundo@google.com"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search has shown potential to automate the design of neural networks.

I suspect this figure is not from sufficient runs. In theory, random search should keep consistently increasing until converging with Evo-NAS; and it will find the best in expected N/2 trails (N is the size of NASBench). It is questionable for random search to reach plateau in only 5000 trails on a dataset that has 420K samples.
