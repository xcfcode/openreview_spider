In the following we address specific concerns of the reviewer. \n\n**\u201cThat said, originality in terms of research contribution is limited. Siamese NNs have long been in use and recently revisited for variety of vision tasks such as face recognition [1, 2], object tracking [3], etc\u201d**\n\nWe agree that Siamese NNs is an architecture that has been previously studied, and other applications in different domains have been presented. However, we are the first to apply this type of architecture on the behavioral biometrics field. Our novelty relies on proposing a methodology that couples previous knowledge related to architecture, losses, sample generation and data structures, producing a well-performing model in a new domain. This behavioral domain presents its own difficulties inherent to the nature of biometric data, different from the challenges present in other tasks such as object tracking and face recognition tasks. Furthermore, we have shown that this approach is applicable and scalable to a real production case with thousands or millions of users, which has never been reported before. \n\n**\u201cComparisons with existing methods in the domain have not been included to the main paper (they are supposed to be in the appendix).\"**\n\nWe proved that a better performance is obtained when using a Siamese NNs with a few-shot interaction in comparison to previously studied approaches (SVM, RF, DT). Those comparisons were on the Appendix A, now, the most relevant have been moved to the main text.  \n\n**\"The aim perhaps of this paper is to present a baseline NN-based approach for user verification/ biometrics\u201d** \n\nWe showed that a single Siamese NN architecture abstracts the information from the input features so well, that two completely different sources (Desktop and Mobile) can be processed with the same Siamese NNs architecture. Moreover, we showed that our feature engineering process leads to an accurate latent space representation, which is useful for the biometric authentication use case. \n\nGiven these points, the focus of our contribution is to combine one-shot learning and behavioral biometric authentication, a research intersection that remained unexplored in both ML and biometrics communities. Moreover, we propose a solution that overcomes implementation and scalability issues from previous approaches, while maintaining or improving performance in the real case. For instance, using only one model for all the users reduces the memory, training and monitoring requirements. Besides, compared with other approaches, we demand less interaction time per user to train and test. Those advantages arise from the few-shot nature of a Siamese NNs. We also contributed by confirming that, with the features proposed, there is an improvement of performance by using a triplet loss instead of a regular pair loss scheme. We would like to highlight that our main contribution is to show real world insights on the intersection between Siamese NNs and few-shot behavioral biometric authentication.

In the following we address specific concerns of the reviewer. \n\n**\u201cI like the idea of applying the siamese paradigm to authentication however the paper offers limited novelty for a representation learning conference [...] My major concern is the novelty of the siamese network. [...]Please acknowledge the contribution of the paper for an ML venue.\u201d**\nRegarding comments on novelty, even though Siamese architectures have been widely studied, their effectiveness on behavioral data has not been explored yet. Our contributions are focused on a practical study in the intersection of biometric data and Siamese architectures. We built suitable feature representations for human-device interactions from different behavioral sources (mouse, keyboard, mobile sensors), that enable the generation of a latent space effective for biometric authentication. Moreover, our proposed methodology for both web and mobile environments shows interesting insights about how biometric data and ML could be integrated in realistic scenarios, setting a precedent for future ML studies in the field. Furthermore, ICLR also encourages (1) studies showing applications on different fields and (2) research on implementation and scalability issues of current state-of-the art systems. Having said that, our work contributes to ML by proposing a one-shot ML framework for biometric data that has been proved in large scale in-the-wild scenarios and over different behavioral sources.  \nAn additional advantage of testing our approach on a large production dataset is that we were able to evaluate the impact of training with different user sample sizes (25K, 50K, 100K). This resulted in similar model performances even when the sample size was 4 times larger. This finding suggests that, for behavioral biometric data, there could be a limit to the representational power of the data in the latent space, this is an interesting insight for future research on Siamese neural networks applied to structured data. \n\n**\u201cThere are zero baselines (no Siamese) compared.\u201d**\nRegarding a baseline, we showed that our chosen representation of human behavioral traits outperforms previous studies, even those using NN, on both web and mobile environments under practical scenarios with short interaction-time periods. On Appendix A, we compared the advantages of our approach against previously studied techniques found in literature. Notably, we are the only approach scalable to large deployments due to the application of one-shot techniques in behavioral biometrics. For the rebuttal phase, we have included numerical benchmarks with previous studies in the main document.

Notably, the behavioral characteristics of users when engaging with these devices, measured in the form of mouse movements or keyboard typing patterns on browsers or touch patterns on mobile phones, serve as a proxy for more direct biomarkers such as face recognition, eye scans, etc. The authors argue that the latter requires more specialised hardware and is thus not easily scalable. Instead, they architect the first NN based solution that serves both modalities, web and mobile phones, while trying to be more accurate and responsive.\n\nReview:\n(a) The study is of good quality. The language is clear and concise. Related work is well covered to the best of my knowledge, making reference to one of the oldest instantiations of such model for signature verification.\n\n(b) The originality of the method viz-a-viz the domain 'of biometric verification' seems to be high. In particular, existing solutions to the problem of behavioral biometric verification have either used different models (SVMs or RDTs) or different features or different formulations (classic supervised recognition setting using one model per user). This disposes them to problems such as limited scalability, lower performance and high latency. Herein, their solution of using a single siamese network, for both modalities, and across different users, adds generality, performance and speed. They have curated experiments with different number of users at training time, and using different metric losses (pairwise and triplet) for representation learning via similarity matching, shedding light on the effectiveness of their approach.\n\n(c) That said, originality in terms of research contribution is limited. Siamese NNs have long been in use and recently revisited for variety of vision tasks such as face recognition[1, 2], object tracking [3], etc. The loss formulation used here is also standard, not going beyond the staple pairwise and triplet. Papers where newer losses or network architectures or training paradigms have led to better analysis and results have made sound research contributions and exhibited suitability for the main track e.g. [1, 2]. In other cases, where tasks are key, and results are good but the approach is largely borrowed, it serves good to go for a workshop track e.g. [3].\n\n(d) Comparisons with existing methods in the domain have not been included to the main paper (they are supposed to be in the appendix). The aim perhaps of this paper is to present a baseline NN-based approach for user verification/ biometrics. I believe this would be a good fit for presentation at a more focused workshop on biometric verification. As a main track ICLR submission I find it lacking in novelty, reach and research contribution.\n\n[1] Triplet Loss in Siamese Network for Object Tracking, Dong and Shen (ECCV 2018)\n[2] Occlusion Robust Face Recognition Based on Mask Learning With Pairwise Differential Siamese Network, Song et.al.

The proposal is evaluated on three different dataset, collected ad-hoc for this work, showing a performance up to >0.9 acc. In the experimentation setup authors include different data splits, sequences lengths and training methods (pairs and triplets). The work shows the feasibility of using this type of approach for few-shot classification under real industry constraints.\n\n------------------\nContributions\n\nMy recommendation for this manuscript is a strong accept. I believe this paper makes a relevant contribution to the field since it addresses a topic which is quite interesting for the audience, it is technically sound, covers different hypotheses and provides very useful insight to practitioners about the use of these approaches in real industry applications. The last point is the most interesting in my opinion, honestly. \nThe paper is well structured, with a clean format, very well written and easy to read.\nProbably its weakest point is the novelty, since it addresses a well-known problem using a long-established NN architecture. However the combination of one-shot learning, siamese architecture and behavioral biometrics is something I personally have not seen before, so I consider it robust enough.\n\n------------------\nRecommendations\n\nAlthough it is covered in the section 3.1, given the scope of the conference and its relevance for the reproducibility of the results, I\u2019d ask authors to include a clear and detailed explanation of the feature vector employed. Some chart or graph where the reader can see easily how many features come from which source (sensor, keypad, gesture), how the derived features are computed and how movements are translated to features. Even better if the authors can include some examples.  Maybe as an appendix, but I really believe it\u2019s important and a clear improvement for the manuscript.\n\nI think it\u2019d be interesting to add further details about the data splitting mechanism. I believe the paper needs at least to state clearly whether the train/test split is done by users (where a group of users are employed to perform inference and the rest as control test) or by sequences (where the data from each user is split into train and test). This is a relevant topic since the later has been demonstrated in previous HAR works to offer less robust and generalizable models. Please expand this point.\n\nFigure 4 - Please specify clearly which sequence length is the one used for this experiment. It seems taken for granted it is 10 sec , since it\u2019s the configuration offering best results, but please make it more clear to the reader.\n\nFrom a personal perspective I think it\u2019d be interesting to expand the work adding feature extraction mechanism using the state-of-art in time series modelling, this is, recurrent neural units or attention based mechanism. I\u2019m really curious to see how that compares with the current engineered features.\n\n------------------\nMinor\n\nFigure 2b - I\u2019d recommend to scale the Accuracy axis since the series are hard to analyse (they are too close together)\n\nTypo: \u201c Figure 2 shows the ROC curve and the FAR and FRR for the best setup in web environment\u201d -> \u201cFigure 3 shows the ROC curve and the FAR and FRR for the best setup in web environment\u201d\n\nTypo: \u201cFigure 2 shows the ROC curve and the FAR and FRR for the best setup in mobile environment.\u201d -> \u201c \u201cFigure 3 shows the ROC curve and the FAR and FRR for the best setup in mobile environment.\u201d\n", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1323/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1323/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Siamese Neural Network for Behavioral Biometrics Authentication", "authorids": ["~Jes\u00fas_Solano1", "esteban.rivera@appgate.com", "alejandra.castelblanco@appgate.com", "lizzy.tengana@appgate.com", "christian.lopez@appgate.com", "martin.ochoa@appgate.com"], "authors": ["Jes\u00fas Solano", "Esteban Rivera", "Alejandra Castelblanco", "Lizzy Tengana", "Christian Lopez", "Martin Ochoa"], "keywords": ["Deep Learning", "Few-shot Learning", "Behavioral Biometrics", "Biometric Authentication"], "abstract": "The raise in popularity of personalized web and mobile applications brings about a need of robust authentication systems.

We develop our approach to identify behavior from either human-computer or human-smartphone interaction. For computer interaction our approach learns from mouse and keyboard dynamics, while for smartphone interaction it learns from holding patterns and touch patterns. We show that our approach has a few-shot classification accuracy of up to 99.8% and 90.8% for mobile and web interactions, respectively. We also test our approach on a database that contains over 100K different web interactions collected in the wild.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "solano|a_siamese_neural_network_for_behavioral_biometrics_authentication", "pdf": "/pdf/d1a1d5c3442ef67db75b417985aee9e8f2f3bf91.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=eBXtf16EHc", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nsolano2021a,\ntitle={A Siamese Neural Network for Behavioral Biometrics Authentication},\nauthor={Jes{\\'u}s Solano and Esteban Rivera and Alejandra Castelblanco and Lizzy Tengana and Christian Lopez and Martin Ochoa},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=MG8Zde0ip6u}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
