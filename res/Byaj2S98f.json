The authors describe a way of building neural nets that print their own weights. \n\nThis is a very special case of what was done around 1992-1993: self-referential recurrent networks [1,2,3,4] not only read and write their own weights, but also can run entire computable learning algorithms or weight modification algorithms, to \u201clearn how to learn\u201d  (see also [7] for a more recent meta-learning application). \n\nThe authors write: \"This overcomes the problem of \u0398 being larger than the output, since we are only outputting a scalar \u0398c for each coordinate c.\" \n\nLikewise, the earlier work [1,2,3,4] used output units to encode weight addresses, to read and write them. There also is an outer-product-based way [5,6] of dramatically improving the ratio between addressable fast weights [0] and adaptive parameters. \n\nObviously the authors of this submission should point out what's new in their approach.\n\nI'd like to see the revised version again.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n[7] S.

Unfortunately it's not that clear to me why that would be a useful thing to do, neither does the paper present any results that support this. \n\nThe first experiment, in which the network is only trained for replication, seems somewhat ill-posed because a trivial solution to this task would be to learn a network in which all the weights are equal to zero. This leads me to think that the notion of self-replication should be connected to the information content of the weights in some way. The obtained error score on this task is hard to interpret without any baselines or variations of the task.\n\nThe second experiment shows that the performance on MNIST classification degrades when the replication criterion is added as an auxiliary task. This is quite obvious and it would have been an interesting finding if the opposite result was observed. \n\nPros: original idea\nCons: limited analysis, no insightful results\n\n", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Network Quine", "abstract": "We describe a method for building a self-replicating neural network.
