Inspired by computer vision, the authors propose to specialize LMs to a particular domain and task with an intermediate clustering task. A large unlabeled dataset is clustered to generate pseudo-labels then a BERT model is specialized to predict the cluster id of each example. More precisely, the authors use GloVe embeddings (bag-of-word representations) and the sIB clustering algorithm with a constant number of clusters (50). \n\nThe additional clustering task is shown to help for low-resource topic classification. In the paper setup, the whole dataset (up to 15000 examples) is used for clustering (without the labels), while the fine-tuning phase relies on a small subset of the training data. The authors show nice gains when using 64 examples for fine-tuning. Graphs show that the gains are lower as more fine-tuning data is used, and usually disappear with more that 192 to 384 examples. The authors go on showing that their approach works best when the cluster ids correlate well with the original labels.\n\nOverall the paper is clear and well-written. It proposes an interesting and, to the best of my knowledge, novel idea.\n\nConcerns:\n- Some claims feel overly broad. I believe the claims should be limited to improving low-resource/few-shot *topic* classification tasks, not text classification in general, which is especially unclear in the title and abstract.\n- While the domain transfer literature is well introduced, no low-resource/few-shot literature is mentioned, making it hard to relate the results to similar research (although to be fair, it is true that CV has much more literature on this topic than NLP).\n- There is little discussion on the motivation and practicality of this approach, which makes the results seem almost anecdotic. If the motivation is to improve few-shot learning, the relevant literature should be introduced and compared against. If the motivation is topic classification, the practicality of this work seems limited: since a larger dataset is available for clustering, manually labeling a few hundred examples (human expert, MTurk) feels more promising. For example, BERT with 256 examples yields better results on most datasets than BERT:CLUST with 64 examples.\n- Several ideas mentioned as future work seem relatively straightforward to try and could have been interesting for inclusion in this paper.\n\nQuestions:\n- The correlation between cluster ids and task labels seems critical for the approach to work. Did the authors try using a number of clusters equal to the number of labels? If so, how did that change the results?\n- The vocabulary size used for clustering (10000 word stems) seems low. What are the reasons for choosing that number? Also, is the vocabulary task-dependent?\n- Why did the authors use a BoW approach for clustering? For example, why not embed each example with BERT (which should capture topics better than GloVe-BoW) using the output [CLS] vector?\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1678/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1678/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Cluster & Tune: Enhance BERT Performance in Low Resource Text Classification", "authorids": ["~Eyal_Shnarch1", "arielge@il.ibm.com", "alonhal@il.ibm.com", "lenad@il.ibm.com", "~Leshem_Choshen1", "~Ranit_Aharonov2", "noams@il.ibm.com"], "authors": ["Eyal Shnarch", "Ariel Gera", "Alon Halfon", "Lena Dankin", "Leshem Choshen", "Ranit Aharonov", "Noam Slonim"], "keywords": ["low resource", "BERT", "clustering"], "abstract": "In data-constrained cases, the common practice of fine-tuning BERT for a target text classification task is prone to producing poor performance.

We accept your comment about the usage of the term \"low resource\" and have changed the title, abstract and text to avoid this term, replacing it with the more accurate term of \"limited amount of labeled data\". \n\nYou mentioned that the fact that \"performance gain diminishes quickly as number of labels get over a few hundreds\" is a reason for not giving a higher rating. We'd like to better present our motivation, which lies exactly in the realm of less than a few hundreds labeled examples. \nIn many real-world scenarios of topic classification there is a strict limit on the amount of annotation that can be collected. There are many cases in which the data cannot be sent for massive labeling by the crowd (e.g., due to confidentiality of the data, or the need for a very specific expertise). Often, the availability of experts for annotation is very limited and even as many as a few hundreds labeled examples are too much to expect. In the paper, in the results figures, the x axis goes to 1024 in order to show where the different methods reach a similar accuracy. However, our focus in this paper is the left-hand side of the x axis, where the amount of labeled examples is very small. This area reflects a real need that we, and many others, are facing. We have updated the paper to better present our motivation.\n\nYou asked, \"Did you use training set for clustering, without considering their labels?\" The answer is yes, and we added a note in the Inter-training paragraph of section 3.2.\n\nYou also asked, \"Why use accuracy, not P/R as the metric? are all test sets balanced?\" \nWe opted for using accuracy in order to be aligned with the standard measures used in the leader boards of most of the datasets used. See for example the leader boards in https://paperswithcode.com/area/natural-language-processing which report accuracy (or error, which is 1-accuracy). The datasets are indeed balanced, apart of two, SMS-Spam and Cola, for which F1 is indeed a more natural measure (both are binary classification tasks with a positive class which is significantly less than half of the data), but we wanted to keep a consistent measure. We did verify that the qualitative results with respect to the different algorithms in the imbalanced datasets do not change when using a weighted F1. If you think this is an important point, we can add it in the paper.\n\nFinally, Figure 3 was improved per your suggestion."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1678/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1678/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Cluster & Tune: Enhance BERT Performance in Low Resource Text Classification", "authorids": ["~Eyal_Shnarch1", "arielge@il.ibm.com", "alonhal@il.ibm.com", "lenad@il.ibm.com", "~Leshem_Choshen1", "~Ranit_Aharonov2", "noams@il.ibm.com"], "authors": ["Eyal Shnarch", "Ariel Gera", "Alon Halfon", "Lena Dankin", "Leshem Choshen", "Ranit Aharonov", "Noam Slonim"], "keywords": ["low resource", "BERT", "clustering"], "abstract": "In data-constrained cases, the common practice of fine-tuning BERT for a target text classification task is prone to producing poor performance.

We accept your comment that we should better reflect the fact that our method was eventually found most useful for *topical* text classification. Per your suggestion, we have updated the title, the abstract, and text. \n\nIn addition, we have added a paragraph on few-shot learning literature in the related work section.\n\nRegarding your comment on the motivation of this work. Our motivation is not improving few-shot learning, rather it is improving real-world scenarios of topic classification where there is a strict limit on the amount of annotation that can be collected. There are many cases in which the data cannot be sent for labeling by the crowd (e.g., due to confidentiality of the data, or\nthe need for a very specific expertise). Often, the availability of experts for annotation is very limited and even as much as 250 labeled examples are too much to expect. In the paper, in the results figures, the x axis goes to 1024 in order to show where the different methods reach the same accuracy. However, our focus in this paper is the left-hand side of the x axis, where the amount of labeled examples is very limited. This area reflects a real need that we, and many others, are facing. We have updated the paper to better present our motivation.\n\nPer your suggestion to try to include something from the future work in this paper - we have implemented one direction of our future work. In the original discussion section, we raise the following question: \"could more suitable partitions be acquired by changing embedding space?\". We have tested k-means over the CLS token of BERT as well as classifying with SVM over a representation based on Glove. Both methods do not yield better performance (see Figures 5 and 7).\n\nQuestions:\n\n* \"Did the authors try using a number of clusters equal to the number of labels?\" Yes, we have, and the results were consistently inferior. \nFollowing your question, we now specifically mention this point in the footnote in section 3.2, experimental setup. In addition, we note that in practice one may not know how many classes truly exist in the data, so this parameter is not necessarily known in real-world applications. Furthermore, we wanted to show that the gain is robust, hence used a single configuration with 50 clusters across all datasets.\n\n\n* \"The vocabulary size used for clustering seems low. What are the reasons for choosing it? Is the vocabulary task-dependent?\"\nWe used the default size of the open source code we used, which is defined as the 10k most frequent words in the dataset (we added this to the experimental setup section). Thus, the vocabulary size is *dataset* dependent. We have not tried to optimize the vocabulary size parameter, though potentially this could result in better performance. \n\n* \"Why did the authors use a BoW approach for clustering?  For example, why not embed each example with BERT ... using the output [CLS] vector?\" \nYour suggestion to use the CLS is indeed a good direction to explore. We have therefore implemented it and have added clustering over BERT's [CLS] to our results - see Figure 5. As can be seen in the figure, the BOW approach performs better."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1678/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1678/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Cluster & Tune: Enhance BERT Performance in Low Resource Text Classification", "authorids": ["~Eyal_Shnarch1", "arielge@il.ibm.com", "alonhal@il.ibm.com", "lenad@il.ibm.com", "~Leshem_Choshen1", "~Ranit_Aharonov2", "noams@il.ibm.com"], "authors": ["Eyal Shnarch", "Ariel Gera", "Alon Halfon", "Lena Dankin", "Leshem Choshen", "Ranit Aharonov", "Noam Slonim"], "keywords": ["low resource", "BERT", "clustering"], "abstract": "In data-constrained cases, the common practice of fine-tuning BERT for a target text classification task is prone to producing poor performance.

We agree that such an evaluation is imperative to better understand the potential of our proposed method. Correspondingly, we tested 4 such baselines, only one of which resulted in relatively decent performance. The results of this method are now added to Figure 2, along with a corresponding discussion. As can be seen in the figure, even for this most successful baseline, the results were overall inferior to our approach. Thus, while we agree with the reviewer that our approach perhaps benefits from infusing BOW knowledge into the BERT representations, our updated results suggest that in practice BERT-IT-CLUST should still be preferred over simpler alternatives, even for topical datasets, and certainly for non-topical ones. A better understanding of the potential synergistic effect of using BOW-based clustering for inter-training BERT representations merits further investigation, as we now point out in the Discussion. \n\n*Further details*:\n\nAs baselines, we examined SVM and Naive Bayes, over the explicit BOW representation and over Glove representation (where each text is represented based on the average Glove embeddings of its words). A comparison of all BOW baselines to BERT is presented in the new Figure 7 in the Appendix. For three of these baselines, the results were consistently lower than the results reported in our original submission, typically by a very significant margin. The only baseline with relatively decent performance was SVM-Glove, hence the results of this method are now added to Figure 2, along with a corresponding discussion. As can be seen in the figure, even for this most successful baseline, the results were overall inferior to our approach.  Specifically, SVM-Glove depicted comparable or slightly superior results only for the very small labeled data regime (e.g., when considering 64 labeled instances), and even then, only for 3 out of the 6 topical datasets. Adding more labeled instances, resulted with lower gain for this baseline in all topical datasets. Hence when considering the entire range of fine-tuning sample sizes, its results are inferior to our approach in all 6 topical datasets. Specifically, SVM-Glove results were inferior to BERT-IT-CLUST in 39 out of the 47 data points reported for the 6 topical datasets in Figure 2. In the remaining 4 non-topical datasets, not surprisingly SVM-Glove results were consistently inferior to the BERT-based results, usually by a very large margin.

The idea is simple. We can perform clustering using BoW representations to generate pseudo labels, which will be used to fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model. The results show that the proposed method is effective in topical classification problems.\n\nPros:\n - the idea is very simple and we can easily adapt the idea to different classification tasks.\n- the results are promising, especially on topical classification problems.\n\ncons:\n- My main doubt about this paper is that I think the improvements in the topical classification problems were rooted in the fact that the authors used the \"BoW representations\" to conduct the clustering. The BoW representations are known to be more effective for topical classification problems compared to BERT-based sentence representations. So what the authors did maybe actually infuse/distill the BoW knowledge into the BERT representations.\n- I suggest the authors include a set of BoW representation based baselines. E.g., simple BoW based SVM model, average of GloVe embeddings of BoW representations based classification.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1678/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1678/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Cluster & Tune: Enhance BERT Performance in Low Resource Text Classification", "authorids": ["~Eyal_Shnarch1", "arielge@il.ibm.com", "alonhal@il.ibm.com", "lenad@il.ibm.com", "~Leshem_Choshen1", "~Ranit_Aharonov2", "noams@il.ibm.com"], "authors": ["Eyal Shnarch", "Ariel Gera", "Alon Halfon", "Lena Dankin", "Leshem Choshen", "Ranit Aharonov", "Noam Slonim"], "keywords": ["low resource", "BERT", "clustering"], "abstract": "In data-constrained cases, the common practice of fine-tuning BERT for a target text classification task is prone to producing poor performance.
