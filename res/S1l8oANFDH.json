The most popular idea is to use program synthesis & imitation learning to distill from a programmatic policy from some oracle policy.  \n\n(B) The second is training compact policies using a complex model-based controller (e.g., Guided Policy Search).   The idea is to use a step-wise model-based controller to design a good trajectory that maximizes reward, while not deviating too far from the current policy.  Then the new policy is learned from this trajectory.\n\nThe authors contrast with (A) via \"our student does not learn based on examples provided by the teacher, but is trained to mimic the internal structure of the teacher\". The authors contrast with (B) in part by claiming that \"the teacher must mirror the structure of the student\", which is supposedly harder.\n\nThus, it seems much of the intellectual merit & novelty lies how the proposed method tackles this \"structure\" problem, from both the teacher and the student side.  However, I'm having a hard time appreciating this aspect of the proposed approach.  I'm also confused by how the \"student does not learn based on examples provided by the teacher\" if it's doing imitation learning on trajectory-level demonstrations. Can the authors elaborate on this point further?\n\nThe experiments seem ok.  The idea of training programmatic polices that \"inductively generalize\" has been done before on arguably more difficult tasks (see Table 2 in https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05431).   To contrast with this prior result, it seems the main point is that prior work relied on domain-specific program synthesizers.  Can the authors elaborate on this point further?\n\nMinor comments:\n\n-- Adaptive teaching is a pretty ambiguous term, and I think misleading within ML community (cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05190). I recommend a different algorithm name.\n\n-- Deriving the variational objective is a lot of work to reduce it to just trajectory design.  Seems overkill.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nUpdates after Author Response\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI increased my score to accept.

We like your further recommendations and incorporated them into the paper. \n\nWe updated the introduction to scope out the problem more concretely (and match our response above). \n\nWe agree that the examples of loop-free trajectories should be in Section 4.2. \n\nWe also agree that the high-level insights for the design decisions should be explicitly mentioned. Here, we point out some of our design decisions and reasons.  In general, most of the approximations are made for scalability reasons and we tried to use the best alternative available in the literature to handle similar issues. \n\n1. Approximating $p(\\tau | \\pi, x_0)$ \n\nNote that this probability will be computed as part of an objective for numerical optimization. Hence, it is very important to have a smooth closed-form representation of the probability that can be computed very efficiently (along with gradients). \n\nSymbolically computing the \u201ctrue\u201d probability is hard because of the discrete-continuous structure of $\\pi$. Another alternative is to precompute the probabilities of all the trajectories ($\\tau$) that can be derived from $\\pi$. However, this is also infeasible because the number of trajectories is unbounded. \n\nHence, we use an approach similar to the cross-entropy method [1], which is a standard tool in Monte Carlo estimation, and combinatorial and continuous optimization.\n\nFor our benchmarks, we didn\u2019t notice any improvement in the number of student-teacher iterations by increasing the number of samples ($\\rho$) from the current value of 10. So, we believe we are not losing much information from this approximation.  \n\n[1] Shie Mannor, Reuven Y Rubinstein, and Yohai Gat. The cross entropy method for fast policy search. In Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-03), pp. 512\u2013519, 2003.\n\n\n2. EM algorithm \n\nAs shown in appendix A.1, computing the maximum likelihood estimate of the state machine ($\\pi$) involves finding the latent mode-assignment variables ($\\mu$) in addition to the parameters of the action functions and the switching conditions. Numerically optimizing this maximum likelihood objective is hard because it requires integrating over all possible choices for the latent variables. For example, if the teacher generates 10 loop-free policies every iteration and there are 10 modes in each loop-free policy, and 4 modes in the state-machine, the number of choices for the latent variables is 4^100, which makes the enumeration infeasible.\n\nThe expectation-maximization method provides an efficient way for computing the maximum likelihood, by alternatingly optimizing for the latent variables and the state-machine parameters. This method does not guarantee global optima but usually works well in practice. In addition, since computing the switching conditions is expensive, we had to restrict the number of EM iterations.  However, note that even if the EM algorithm didn't converge, our overall algorithm can still recover by using additional teacher-student interactions. \n\nThe alternate method would be to run the EM algorithm multiple times/longer to get better results per student iteration, and \u201cmaybe\u201d reduce the total number of teacher-student iterations.  We say  \u201cmaybe\u201d because the EM algorithm might have already converged to the global optima, making the extra EM iterations useless. The tradeoff between our approach and this alternative depends on whether the teacher\u2019s algorithm or the student\u2019s algorithm is expensive for a particular benchmark. \n\nHowever, from Figure 11, we can see that some of our benchmarks already use very few (< 5) teacher-student iterations  (Car, QuadPO, Pendulum, Mountain car, and Swimmer). Of the other three benchmarks that needed many iterations, for two of them  (Cartpole and Acrobot), the student\u2019s algorithm is as expensive as the teacher\u2019s algorithm. This justifies our decision to not run the EM algorithm multiple times/longer.  \n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1321/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1321/Reviewers/Submitted", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1321/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1321/Area_Chairs"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1321/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["jinala@csail.mit.edu", "obastani@seas.upenn.edu", "zenna@mit.edu", "asolar@csail.mit.edu"], "title": "Synthesizing Programmatic Policies that Inductively Generalize", "authors": ["Jeevana Priya Inala", "Osbert Bastani", "Zenna Tavares", "Armando Solar-Lezama"], "pdf": "/pdf/098084d58f170afbfefc335ad4361a364376ed4b.pdf", "TL;DR": "An approach to learn program policies for control tasks that inductively generalize.

The method is tested on a suite of standard control problems against PPO with / without memory and against simple numerical optimisation, analysing both performance and some degree of generalisation.\n\n\nOverall, I like both the problem setting (constraining / structuring policies using SMs), and the proposed modeling and optimisation. In particular, the teacher-student setup makes sense to me in the way it has been casted under VI, and I would like to see it explored further.\n\nI have however a few major issues that prevent me from recommending acceptance of the work:\n\n1. The experiment section is generally lacking in terms of implementation details. The authors don't specify anything about models structure or details about the employed state machines, and do not seem to have included details about their direct optimisation baseline, environment featurisation, hyperparameters used across their experiments, and so on. I very much doubt I would be able to reproduce the results based only on the manuscript.\n\n2. The quality of the policies depend heavily on how close the proposed state machine matches the underlying dynamics of each task. Since - very often - complex tasks are hard to optimally describe without producing very large state machines, I would have liked to see the method tested against poor and/or adversarial specifications, to see whether empirically how well the student-teacher optimisation system can recover under such constraints.\n\n3. Casting the problem as a POMDP, while technically fine (and in most cases reasonable), doesn't seem to provide any significant advantage to the method, and seems to only be adding noise in the formalisms described across the paper. Since the method introduces notation that a lot of RL researchers are not necessarily familiar with, I would suggest the author to try to simplify it where possible. [Also please note that I haven't re-derived section 4.1 under this assumption, so correct me if I'm wrong on this.]\n\n\nAt this point, I am recommending a weak rejection, however I will be happy to significantly reconsider my overall assessment provided that at least point (1) is decently addressed (and ideally I get some response wrt. points 2 and 3).\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1321/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1321/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["jinala@csail.mit.edu", "obastani@seas.upenn.edu", "zenna@mit.edu", "asolar@csail.mit.edu"], "title": "Synthesizing Programmatic Policies that Inductively Generalize", "authors": ["Jeevana Priya Inala", "Osbert Bastani", "Zenna Tavares", "Armando Solar-Lezama"], "pdf": "/pdf/098084d58f170afbfefc335ad4361a364376ed4b.pdf", "TL;DR": "An approach to learn program policies for control tasks that inductively generalize.

We address your concerns below: \n\n**** Implementation details and direct opt baseline ****\n\nWe added details about the environments, state machines, hyper-parameters and the direct-opt baseline in Appendix B.3 in our paper. We also show all synthesized state-machines in Figures 14 to 20. \n\n**** Scaling to synthesizing large state machines ****\n\nWe have added a new, more complex benchmark -- namely, the MuJoCo swimmer (extended to 4 segments instead of 3 to make the task more challenging) -- to our paper. This benchmark has control inputs R^3 and observation space R^10. The state-machine policy synthesized using our algorithm has 4 different modes. (Section 5, Figure 10, Figure 20)\n\nOverall, the focus of our paper is on addressing problems where a relatively simple behavior must be repeated a certain number of times to solve the given task. We believe these problems are pervasive -- for example, many motor tasks such as walking, running, jumping, swimming, etc. all rely on this kind of a policy. Yet, neural network policies have difficulty solving these tasks in a generalizable way. The key premise behind our approach is that compact state-machine policies can represent policies that both have good performance and are generalizable for this class of problems. Indeed, our algorithm solves all of our benchmarks using state-machine policies with at most 4 modes and switching conditions of depth at most 2.\n\nFor example, consider the autonomous car example in Figure 1. The task in Figure 1d (i.e. when the gap between cars is very small) is significantly complex that the neural network baseline was not able to solve (even when trained directly on those initial states; see Figure 3 rightmost). However, a small state-machine policy with only 3 modes was able to solve this task.\n\nWe certainly agree with the reviewer that it will be interesting to see how the algorithm scales for larger state machines. However, this problem is qualitatively different from the one we are solving, and different algorithms would be needed to solve it. Overall, we believe that state-machines are most useful when only a few states are required. When a large number of states are needed, then the number of possible transition structures grows exponentially, making it unlikely that we can learn the \u201ctrue\u201d structure without having an exponential amount of both training data and computation time. For these cases, we believe recurrent neural network policies such as LSTMs may remain the better choice.\n\n**** Casting the problem as a POMDP **** \n\nWe use a POMDP formulation because our policies have internal state and some of our benchmarks (e.g., QuadPO) have different observation vectors and the state vectors. We thought about focusing on MDPs to simplify notation, but concluded that it would not significantly help. The aspect of our approach that complicates our formalization is that our policies keep internal state. However, this aspect is central to our approach, since we are both positing that internal state is necessary, and that it is hard to learn programmatic policies with internal state.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1321/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1321/Reviewers/Submitted", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1321/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1321/Area_Chairs"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1321/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["jinala@csail.mit.edu", "obastani@seas.upenn.edu", "zenna@mit.edu", "asolar@csail.mit.edu"], "title": "Synthesizing Programmatic Policies that Inductively Generalize", "authors": ["Jeevana Priya Inala", "Osbert Bastani", "Zenna Tavares", "Armando Solar-Lezama"], "pdf": "/pdf/098084d58f170afbfefc335ad4361a364376ed4b.pdf", "TL;DR": "An approach to learn program policies for control tasks that inductively generalize.

We address your concerns below: \n\n**** Importance of the state-machine structure and difference with prior work **** \n\nPrior work in [1] and [2] has shown that programmatic policies achieve better interpretability and generalization over neural network policies. For generalizability, they have shown that a policy learned for one particular track of the Torcs game can be easily transferred to a couple of other tracks. In contrast, we focus on a different kind of generalization, namely, to performing a repetitive behavior arbitrarily many times. We train on problem instances that only require a small number of repetitions of a behavior (e.g., 1 to 3), but the policies we learn generalize to problem instances where the behavior must be repeated an arbitrarily large number of times.\n\nPrior work uses stateless programs, which makes learning generalizable repetitive behaviors hard, e.g., a stateless program cannot internally keep track of the progress made within each repetition and decide the next action based on that progress. In contrast, we use state-machine based policies that have internal state. With state-machine policies, the repetitive behavior in the tasks can be explicitly exposed (for ex, a set of modes that are connected in a cyclic order represents a loop), and the internal state (i.e. which mode the SM is in) can be used to keep track of the progress within a loop iteration.\n\nSynthesizing state-machine policies is substantially more challenging than previous work, since it involves latent states that are unobserved. A typical approach is to use a teacher such as a DNN to guide the search [1,2]; however, we found that DNNs are unable to learn the \u201ccorrect\u201d latent states (i.e., the ones they learn do not generalize).\n\nOur teacher is designed to avoid these problems. First, our teacher also has an explicit notion of modes, and hence, it can discover the \u201ccorrect\u201d modes that solve the task in a generalizable way, which the student will imitate. Second, our representations also make it easy for the student to enforce the repetitive structure in the modes of the loop-free policies learned by the teacher. \n\nIn principle, the internal state can be replaced with the history of agent\u2019s states. However, for some environments, a long history might be needed to replicate the internal state. Using such a long history would dramatically increase the dimension of the state space, making it very hard to generalize robustly.\n\n\n**** Examples vs trajectory traces **** \n\nWe apologize for the confusion. When we said that \u201cthe prior works assume a domain-specific program synthesizer that can learn programmatic policies given a supervised dataset\u201d, we mean that they can learn a programmatic policy based on \u201cstate-action pairs\u201d sampled from the neural network.\n\nOn the other hand, the student in our algorithm needs to learn the state-machine policy from entire \u201ctrajectory traces\u201d to learn the internal state.  In particular, each trajectory trace consists of the sequence of states and actions from the initial state to the goal state visited by the teacher, but also encodes which states correspond to mode changes for the (loop-free) teacher. In the teacher\u2019s iteration, the teacher mode changes are regularized to align more closely with the possible student mode changes. As a consequence, in the student\u2019s iteration, it is easier for the student to mimic the teacher\u2019s mode changes.\n\nLeveraging this connection between the teacher structure and student structure is critical for us to be able to learn state-machine policies. In contrast, existing approaches treat the teacher as a blackbox, and learn purely from the state-action examples obtained from the teacher. They can do so since there is no latent information that the student needs to learn. In contrast, in our setting, it is very hard to learn the latent mode transitions without supervision. Using a teacher with mode changes alleviates this challenge.\n\n\n[1] Abhinav Verma, Vijayaraghavan Murali, Rishabh Singh, Pushmeet Kohli, and Swarat Chaudhuri.

We address your concerns below: \n\n**** Complexity of the algorithm limits the set of applicable environments ****\n\nWe have added a new, more complex benchmark -- namely, the MuJoCo swimmer (extended to 4 segments instead of 3 to make the task more challenging) -- to our paper. This benchmark has control inputs R^3 and observation space R^10. The state-machine policy synthesized using our algorithm has 4 different modes. (Section 5, Figure 10, Figure 20)\n\nOverall, the focus of our paper is on addressing problems where a relatively simple behavior must be repeated a certain number of times to solve the given task. We believe these problems are pervasive -- for example, many motor tasks such as walking, running, jumping, swimming, etc. all rely on this kind of a policy. Yet, neural network policies have difficulty solving these tasks in a generalizable way. The key premise behind our approach is that compact state-machine policies can represent policies that both have good performance and are generalizable for this class of problems. Indeed, our algorithm solves all of our benchmarks using state-machine policies with at most 4 modes and switching conditions of depth at most 2.\n\nFor example, consider the autonomous car example in Figure 1. The task in Figure 1d (i.e. when the gap between cars is very small) is significantly complex that the neural network baseline was not able to solve (even when trained directly on those initial states; see Figure 3 rightmost). However, a small state-machine policy with only 3 modes was able to solve this task.\n\nWe certainly agree with the reviewer that it will be interesting to see how the algorithm scales for larger state machines. However, this problem is qualitatively different from the one we are solving, and different algorithms would be needed to solve it. Overall, we believe that state-machines are most useful when only a few states are required. When a large number of states are needed, then the number of possible transition structures grows exponentially, making it unlikely that we can learn the \u201ctrue\u201d structure without having an exponential amount of both training data and computation time. For these cases, we believe recurrent neural network policies such as LSTMs may remain the better choice.\n\n**** Empirical runtime analysis ****\n\nWe add runtime analysis in Appendix C.2 and Figure 11 in our paper. We show the synthesis times for various benchmarks, the number of student-teacher iterations, and the time spent by the teacher and the student separately. We hope this will give the reviewer a better perspective on the different parts of the algorithm\n\n**** Scaling the algorithm with the complexity of the grammar ****\n\nFor the action functions, the user decides whether the action functions will be from a constant grammar or a proportional grammar. Furthermore, for proportional grammar, the user specifies which observation the action should be proportional to. There are no discrete choices in either of these two grammars. We believe that this is usually not difficult for the user to choose the best grammar to use; for instance, a user can easily say that the control for y-acceleration will be proportional be y-velocity and not x-velocity. An alternative would be to run the teacher\u2019s algorithm with many different action function grammars and choose the grammar that resulted in high-reward loop-free policies.\n\nFor the switching conditions, the discrete choices in the grammar will be learned by the synthesis algorithm along with the continuous parameters. We agree with the reviewer that the discrete enumeration involved here will quickly blow up with the size of the boolean expression. For this reason, we have a greedy algorithm that scales quadratically with the size of the expression rather than exponentially. We failed to mention this in the original paper, but updated it now (see Appendix A.3 in our paper for more details). All the experiments use this greedy algorithm for learning the switching conditions.\n\n**** Examples of loop-free policy ****\n\nWe added two examples of loop-free policies in Figure 13 in the context of the example in Figure 1. We also show visualizations of trajectories learned by the teacher and the student for two different iterations of the algorithm in Figure 12. \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1321/Authors"], "readers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1321/Reviewers/Submitted", "everyone", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1321/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1321/Reviewers"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1321/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["jinala@csail.mit.edu", "obastani@seas.upenn.edu", "zenna@mit.edu", "asolar@csail.mit.edu"], "title": "Synthesizing Programmatic Policies that Inductively Generalize", "authors": ["Jeevana Priya Inala", "Osbert Bastani", "Zenna Tavares", "Armando Solar-Lezama"], "pdf": "/pdf/098084d58f170afbfefc335ad4361a364376ed4b.pdf", "TL;DR": "An approach to learn program policies for control tasks that inductively generalize.

The technique is evaluated on 7 classic control environments, and found\nto outperform pure-RL baselines under \"test\" conditions in most of them.\n\n# Review\n\nI am not an expert in RL-based control, although I'm familiar with the recent literature that applies formal methods to\nthese domains. I find the studied settings valuable albeit fairly limited, but the paper's method undeniably shows\nnoticeable improvement on these settings. Inductive generalization is an important problem, and the authors' approach of\nlimiting the agent structure to a particular class of state-machine policies is a reasonable solution strategy.\n\nThat said, the complexity of synthesizing a state machine policy clearly caused the authors to limit their supported\naction and condition spaces considerably (Figure 6). That, I'm assuming, limits the set of applicable control\nenvironments where optimization is still feasible. The authors don't provide any analysis of complexity or empirical\nruntime of the optimization process. Breaking it down for each benchmark would allow me to appreciate the optimization\nframework in Section 4 much more. As it stands, Section 4 describes a complex optimization process with many moving\nparts, some of which are approximated (q* and p(\u03c4|\u03c0,x\u2080)) or computed via EM iteration until convergence (\u03c0*). It is hard\nto appreciate all this complexity without knowing where the challenges manifest on specific examples.\n\nSection 4.2 needs an example, to link it to the introductory example in Figure 1. The \"loop-free\" policies of the\nteacher are, in programmatic terms, _traces_ of the desired state machine execution (if I understand correctly), but\nthis is not obvious from just the formal definition.\n\nThe EM optimization for the student policy makes significant assumptions on the action/condition grammars. Namely, the\nalgorithm iterates over every possible discrete \"sketch\" of every program, and then numerically optimizes its continuous\nparameters (Appendix A). When the action/condition grammars grow, the number of possible programs there increases\ncombinatorially. Is there a way to adapt the optimization process to handle more complex grammars, possibly with\ndecomposition of the problem following the program structure?\n\nSection 5 needs a bit more details on the Direct-Opt baseline. It's unclear how the whole state machine policy (which\nincludes both discrete and continuous parts) is learned end-to-end via numerical optimization. Granted, the baseline\nperforms terribly, but would be great to understand how it models the learning problem in order to appreciate why it's\nterrible.\n\nWhy were the \"Acrobot\" and \"Mountain car\" benchmarks removed from the main presentation of results?"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1321/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1321/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["jinala@csail.mit.edu", "obastani@seas.upenn.edu", "zenna@mit.edu", "asolar@csail.mit.edu"], "title": "Synthesizing Programmatic Policies that Inductively Generalize", "authors": ["Jeevana Priya Inala", "Osbert Bastani", "Zenna Tavares", "Armando Solar-Lezama"], "pdf": "/pdf/098084d58f170afbfefc335ad4361a364376ed4b.pdf", "TL;DR": "An approach to learn program policies for control tasks that inductively generalize. ", "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has successfully solved a number of challenging control tasks. However, learned policies typically have difficulty generalizing to novel environments. We propose an algorithm for learning programmatic state machine policies that can capture repeating behaviors. By doing so, they have the ability to generalize to instances requiring an arbitrary number of repetitions, a property we call inductive generalization. However, state machine policies are hard to learn since they consist of a combination of continuous and discrete structures. We propose a learning framework called adaptive teaching, which learns a state machine policy by imitating a teacher; in contrast to traditional imitation learning, our teacher adaptively updates itself based on the structure of the student. We show that our algorithm can be used to learn policies that inductively generalize to novel environments, whereas traditional neural network policies fail to do so.
