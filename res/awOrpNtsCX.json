ST-DNNs, in contrast to conv. layers, can natively support non-rectangular neighborhoods (regions). Similarly to conv. layers, ST-DNNs can be stacked to increase expressivity. ST-DNNs themselves correspond to solutions to the Poisson PDE. The paper describes how these layers can be trained and used for prediction. Results are reported on a texture dataset.\n\nNovelty\nThe authors suggest ST-DNNs that natively support non-rectangular regions. ST-DNNs are natively co-variant to translations and rotations (as opposed to CNNs)\n\nImpact\nST-DNNs can outperform CNN-based networks in a texture segmentation setting when the data is scarce.\nClarity\nThe paper is exceptionally clear. The mathematical reasoning is sound and the notation helps to understand the relationship between the components. The appendix contains a plethora of additional information and is clearly structured.\n\nEvaluation\nThe authors performed experiments with regard to two texture datasets, (i) Real-World Texture Segmentation, and (ii) Synthetic Texture Dataset. Both datasets are comparatively small (<300 images)\n\nStrengths (Reasons to accept)\nMathematically speaking, the paper presents solid derivations that are easy to follow. The notations help to understand the meaning.\nIn general, the clarity of the plots, the diagrams and the algorithms are good \nThe description of the training and the prediction phase is extraordinarily clear and sensical.\n\n\nWeaknesses (Reasons to reject)\nThe choice of the Poisson PDE seems somewhat arbitrary. The argumentation why this choice was made seems to also apply in a much more general context to simpler approaches\nThe authors argue (Related work) that pre-existing segmentation approaches have difficulty in handling the larger number of classes typically found in texture segmentation tasks. This claim doesn\u2019t seem warranted and a proper justification is missing.\nSection 3.2 mentions that images need inevitably to be downscaled to make the model fit into memory. This seems to be an achilles heel of the model that could have probably been addressed differently.\nThe evaluation of the paper is unnecessarily restricted to texture segmentation. It would have been interesting to test the system on classical segmentation problems that necessitate a more hierarchical segmentation approach (e.g. autonomous driving) as opposed to the very local nature of texture segmentation. If ST-DNNs underperform on mainstream segmentation tasks, this is valuable information to the community. \nMost of the proofs are straightforward (owed to the fact that some property is inherited from the Poisson PDE) and could have either been left out or abridged\nThe argument that neighborhoods ideally have to be non-rectangular is not entirely convincing. A practical toy example (simpler than texture segmentation) that showcases the (supposed) shortcomings of CNNs would be useful here.\nThe reliance on an initial mask is a limitation of ST-DNNs compared to conventional CNNs.\nAdmittedly, ST-DNNs seem to cope better with small dataset sizes than CNNs in the texture setting. The readers should be convinced that this property is important, perhaps through a high-impact example where data is scarce.\n\nFormatting\nThe authors did not follow the ICLR style for citations as described in Section 4 of the template, replacing named citations (e.g. Gou et al, 2017) with a numeric citation (12). This effectively gives the authors more space for content than competing submissions.\n\nQuestions and other comments to the authors\nWhich are the most compelling reasons to prefer Poisson PDEs over other PDEs or even simpler approaches?\n\n\n=============UPDATE==============\nI am generally satisfied with the answers provided by the reviewers and I have increased my score accordingly. \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1300/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1300/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Shape-Tailored Deep Neural Networks Using PDEs for Segmentation", "authorids": ["~Naeemullah_Khan1", "~Angira_Sharma1", "~Philip_Torr1", "~Ganesh_Sundaramoorthi1"], "authors": ["Naeemullah Khan", "Angira Sharma", "Philip Torr", "Ganesh Sundaramoorthi"], "keywords": ["robustness", "covariance", "invariance", "convolutional neural nets", "PDEs", "segmentation"], "abstract": "We present Shape-Tailored Deep Neural Networks (ST-DNN).

The choice of the Poisson PDE seems somewhat arbitrary. \n\nThe motivation for using Poisson PDE is as follows (see also page 3 paragraph tilted shape-tailored deep network):\nit is known that the derivative of Gaussians can approximate  convolutional kernels. The generalization of Gaussian smoothing to region of arbitrary shape is the Heat Equation, which is computationally expensive to solve. There we have chosen the Poisson equation as it is the steady state of a heat equation and it can be solved efficiently (see Appendix D for more details). We have added some explanation to the \"Additional Comments \" section in Supplementary material. The PDE formulation also allows us to acheive the theoretical guarantees for desirable covariance and robustness properties.\n\n\n2. pre-existing segmentation approaches have difficulty in handling the larger number of classes \n\nThis comment is sepcifically about semantic segmentation methods where the output classes are restricted to a few classes (usually around $10^2$) which is not comparable to the number of texture classes in real life.\n\n3. Section 3.2 mentions that images need inevitably to be downscaled to make the model fit into memory.\n\nImages are downsampled to use packages like PyTorch we have also trained on full size images and the downsampling does not result in any significant performance decrease (see Appendix D).\n\n4)\tThe evaluation of the paper is unnecessarily restricted to texture segmentation. \n\nWe would like to highlight that the main motivation of the paper is to present the first deep learning based segmentation method that is shape tailored and has desirable invariance/ robustness properties by design. DNN based methods, although they have been shown to work on semantic segmentation datasets, do not display these properties and hence their perfromance drop in many real settings where simple transformations of objects are widely present. Our work is primarily focused on the theoretical properties with proof of concept on textured datasets which displays a lot of these transformation like domain deformation, translation, rotation and scale change.\n\nAdditionaly we have  extended the experimetn section as well, kindly see the \u201cAdditional Experiments\u201d comments. \n\n\n5) Most of the proofs are straightforward (owed to the fact that some property is inherited from the Poisson PDE) and could have either been left out or abridged.\n\nThe proofs are in the Appdendix. Our intention in highlighting these properties in the main paper is to empahsize the fact that our's is the first Deep Learning based segmentation approach that exhibits these properties.  \n\n\n6) The argument that neighborhoods ideally have to be non-rectangular is not entirely convincing.\n\nRectangular feature aggreagate statistics from across the boundaries of objects/ regions making it difficult to localize object boundaries. This has been demonstrated in previous work e.g. Khan2015.

It is encouraging to see that the reviewers have taken an in-depth look at the paper and have provided valuable feedback.\n\n\nThe primary concern of the reviewers was about the experiment section. We had tested on two segmentation datasets proposed in Khan 2015. To address this concern we have tested on two additional datasets BSDS500 and Multi-region synthetic texture dataset [https://github.com/MMFa666/Segmentation_dataset ]. BSDS500 is one of the most widely used datasets in edge-based approach to segmentation and Multi-region synthetic texture dataset is a large scale multi-region texture segmentation dataset with 50,000 images. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all datasets. \n\nWe would also like to highlight that the main motivation of the paper is to present the first deep learning based segmentation method that is shape tailored and has desirable invariance/ robustness properties by design. DNN based methods, although they have been shown to work on semantic segmentation datasets, do not display these properties and hence their perfromance drop in many real settings where simple transformations of objects are widely present.

I see that the authors conducted two experiments on texture segmentation datasets where both are very small datasets. Why does this happen? Small datasets usually can not tell us statistic conclusions as random things always influence the results pretty much. Or is it because that ST-DNN can only be applied or be useful on small datasets? If yes, this needs to be stated and clarified in the paper.\n\nThe success of our methods on small trainingset is actually one of the strenghts of our methods. DNNs even if we train them on large scale datasets and finetune on small datasets, they fail to perform on par with our method. Also, we have added additional experiments to the paper, one on large scale multi-region texture segmentation dataset with 50,000 images.\n\n\n2. The experiments are conducted on two texture segmentation datasets which are both very small with a few hundred images. In table I, the authors compare with more general baselines, i.e., Deeplab. However, Deeplab is proposed for large dataset which will experience over-fiting on the small datasets used by the authors. So I feel that Table 1 is not a very fair comparison and indicates less meaning to us in terms of the performance of ST-DNN compared to general segmentation methods.\n\nIn order to have a fair comparison and avoid overfitting the deep learning based methods are trained on standard datasets with as many as 50,000 images. After which they are fine-tuned on our training set which is further augmented (see subsection Methods in Experiment Section). \n\nTo further elaborate the strenght of our method we have also added an additional experiment with large trainingset of 42,000 images.\n\n3.If we fix the consideration inside texture segmentation, where the authors kindly compare with a few state-of-the-art in Table 2. However, only two datasets are tested while I think >4 are sufficient for a good quality publication. Overall, I think the motivation and novelty are good.

Input preprocessing for the segmentation task: The relevance of adding the grayscale, together with oriented gradients over numerous scales seems unclear. The compositional operation (simulated by stacking of multiple layers) should implicitly compute. An analysis of different feature space and how it impacts the performance seems to be missing. This would be important for the readers attempting to generalize the proposed method to other tasks.\n\nThe efficacy of grayscale and oriented gradients at multiple scales have been shown in Mallat2013 and Khan2018.  More details added in the paper in Supplmentary (Additional Comments) to make it clear to the reader.\n\n2. Evaluation datasets: Similar to prior shape-tailored methods which were applied to benchmarks datasets of tracking and segmentation such as BSDS500, it would be helpful in the proposed method can be applied and evaluated on such benchmarks to make it easier for readers to assess the benefits of the proposed method.\n\nWe have added additional experiments, kindly refer to the \u201cAdditional Experiments\u201d comment\n\n3. Comparison with deep segmentation methods: From the texture segmentation, it seems a natural formulation would be use Siamese or triplet networks to facilitate homogeneity of within each region and discriminativeness across regions (as is done in [23], as well as other papers such as https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8545348). How is the cross-entropy loss used to train the baselines? Is each texture region in the dataset a unique label? It would help better appreciate the poor segmentation performance of these baselines.\n\nNotice that we have tested deep learning methods with our loss. Our loss is an efficient formulation for metric learning. Rather than optimizing the distance of the descriptor for a pair of pixels or a triplets, our energy optimizes the distance for all pixels in the regions. Furthermore, notice that our formulation is much more time and compute efficient. We have used cross entropy loss for deep learning methods just for completeness so that it is evident that cross entropy type losses don't work in appearance learning problems. Keeping loss function the same we have shown the difference in performance is only because of the architecture differences of ST-DNN to standard deep learning methods.\n\n\n\n4. Model selection strategy: How are the best performing hyperparameters obtained? Table 3 shows that the performance changes significantly as the number of layers increase until 4 layers and over-fits as soon as 5th layer. Are the reported quantitative results on the testing dataset the most optimistic estimate, or were the parameters determined using a model-selection/validation dataset?\n \nWe selected a 4 layer network based on results on a validation set where performance starts to plateau after 4 layers. Similar trends can be observed on test set [see Section ablation study]\n\n5.How well does the proposed method handle scales? With standard segmentation methods, the scales are handled by explicit down/up sampling layers. How does the consideration of oriented gradients at fewer scales impact the performance?\n\nSince our ST-DNN aggregates statistics at multiple scales the methods are invariant to scale change. Notice the texture datasets have sufficient scale variations and we perform very well on these datasets.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1300/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1300/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Shape-Tailored Deep Neural Networks Using PDEs for Segmentation", "authorids": ["~Naeemullah_Khan1", "~Angira_Sharma1", "~Philip_Torr1", "~Ganesh_Sundaramoorthi1"], "authors": ["Naeemullah Khan", "Angira Sharma", "Philip Torr", "Ganesh Sundaramoorthi"], "keywords": ["robustness", "covariance", "invariance", "convolutional neural nets", "PDEs", "segmentation"], "abstract": "We present Shape-Tailored Deep Neural Networks (ST-DNN).

ST-DNN are motivated by the prior work on shape-tailored descriptors (or smoothing) that aggregate image statistics within regions of the interest, and defined as a solutions to the Poisson PDE which balances image fidelity and smoothness. This paper applies this formulation to generalize convolutions from square-shared operations to arbitrary regions, and constructs a deep neural networks by stacking this smoothness operator with 1x1 convolutions and ReLU (ST-DNN layer), repeatedly. For texture segmentation task, ST-DNN takes the input data (input images channels, together with grayscale and oriented gradients computed at 5 scales) and initial segmentation mask, and applies several layers of ST-DNN layers to produce an updated segmentation mask. The network parameters are trained using a loss that is minimized when the descriptors within a segment are homogenous, and different from descriptors in other regions.\n\nStrengths\n+ Paper presents a novel deep network architecture using shape-tailored smoothing operations to aggregate data over arbitrary regions, thus, generalizing the convolution operation.\n+ Proposed formulation also enables the ST-DNN to be covariant to the in-plane rotation and translations as well as small deformations. Theoretical justifications as well as empirical validation are included (in the appendix).\n+ Proposed outperform other shape-tailored variants for texture segmentation as well as earlier works on texture segmentation.\n+ Proposed operation could potentially benefit other applications such as tracking or image segmentation and hence may be of relevance to broader vision community.\n\nConcerns\n- Input preprocessing for the segmentation task: The relevance of adding the grayscale, together with oriented gradients over numerous scales seems unclear. The compositional operation (simulated by stacking of multiple layers) should implicitly compute. An analysis of different feature space and how it impacts the performance seems to be missing. This would be important for the readers attempting to generalize the proposed method to other tasks.\n- Evaluation datasets: Similar to prior shape-tailored methods which were applied to benchmarks datasets of tracking and segmentation such as BSDS500, it would be helpful in the proposed method can be applied and evaluated on such benchmarks to make it easier for readers to assess the benefits of the proposed method.\n- Comparison with deep segmentation methods: From the texture segmentation, it seems a natural formulation would be use Siamese or triplet networks to facilitate homogeneity of within each region and discriminativeness across regions (as is done in [23], as well as other papers such as https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8545348). How is the cross-entropy loss used to train the baselines? Is each texture region in the dataset a unique label? It would help better appreciate the poor segmentation performance of these baselines.\n- Model selection strategy: How are the best performing hyperparameters obtained? Table 3 shows that the performance changes significantly as the number of layers increase until 4 layers and over-fits as soon as 5th layer. Are the reported quantitative results on the testing dataset the most optimistic estimate, or were the parameters determined using a model-selection/validation dataset?\n- How well does the proposed method handle scales? With standard segmentation methods, the scales are handled by explicit down/up sampling layers. How does the consideration of oriented gradients at fewer scales impact the performance?\n\nOverall the paper presents an interesting formulation which could be useful to segmentation tasks, as well as tracking (as presented in [22]) but there are several concerns which need to be addressed.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1300/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1300/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Shape-Tailored Deep Neural Networks Using PDEs for Segmentation", "authorids": ["~Naeemullah_Khan1", "~Angira_Sharma1", "~Philip_Torr1", "~Ganesh_Sundaramoorthi1"], "authors": ["Naeemullah Khan", "Angira Sharma", "Philip Torr", "Ganesh Sundaramoorthi"], "keywords": ["robustness", "covariance", "invariance", "convolutional neural nets", "PDEs", "segmentation"], "abstract": "We present Shape-Tailored Deep Neural Networks (ST-DNN).

We empirically show that they exceed segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art CNN-based descriptors using 2-3 orders smaller training sets on the texture segmentation problem.", "one-sentence_summary": "Partial differential equations in deep neural networks for better convarince/invariance propertires.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "khan|shapetailored_deep_neural_networks_using_pdes_for_segmentation", "pdf": "/pdf/2eb2d25ecae3d0c19a814ee737568649e59c9111.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=5j5CtrLvs", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkhan2021shapetailored,\ntitle={Shape-Tailored Deep Neural Networks Using {\\{}PDE{\\}}s for Segmentation},\nauthor={Naeemullah Khan and Angira Sharma and Philip Torr and Ganesh Sundaramoorthi},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=awOrpNtsCX}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
