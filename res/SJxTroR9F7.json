This approach generally applies to both continuous and discrete action spaces and can handle a variety of constraints. Their primary claims is that this approach improves sample-efficiency over TRPO on Mujoco tasks and over PPO on Atari games.\n\nThe method proposed in the paper has strong similarities with existing methods, but lacks comparisons with these approaches. The authors have not clearly demonstrated that SPU provides novel insights beyond the existing literature. I'm happy to change my score if the authors can convince me otherwise.\n\nMain comments:\n\nThe focus of the paper is sample-efficiency, but the intro restricts to the on-policy setting. The authors should justify this choice. It is well known that off-policy algorithms (e.g., SAC for continuous control and Implicit Quantile Networks for Atari) are much more sample-efficient.\n\nIn Sec 4, what is the advantage of breaking the problem up into these 3 steps versus directly trying to solve (9),(10)? In fact, if we convert (10) into a penalty and take the derivative, we arrive at nearly the same gradient as (17). As this is central to the SPU framework, this needs to be justified.\n\nMPO (Abdolmaleki et al. 2018) is very closely related to SPU. It is unclear if SPU provides any additional insights or benefits over MPO. This needs to be discussed and compared.\n\nThe experimental section could be strengthened by:\n* Given the similarity to SPU, comparisons to MPO and GAC should be made, or clear justification for why they are not comparable must be given.\n* Why is the comparison on Mujoco to TRPO in the main text and the comparison to PPO relegated to the appendix? It would make more sense to compare to PPO, so the authors need to justify this decision.\n* The results on Mujoco are quite poor compared to state-of-the-art methods (e.g., SAC). The authors should justify why we should care about their results.\n\nComments:\n\nIn Sec 2, the authors should be careful about the discounting. For example, they are almost surely not having A_{it} approximate \\gamma^t A^{\\pi_{\\theta_k}}, rather A^{\\pi_{\\theta_k}}.\n\nIn Sec 2, the KL is denoted as KL(\\pi || pi_k), but in the text is described as the KL from \\pi_k to \\pi (reversed). From the equations, it appears that is an error, and it should read KL from \\pi to \\pi_k.\n\nIn Sec 3, the description of NPG/TRPO is not accurate. The main goal of NPG/TRPO work was to establish monotonic improvement.\n\nIn Sec 3, computational speed is cited as a major deficit of GAC, especially the solving linear systems with the Hessian (wrt to the actions). This seems rather surprising. Inverting a 1000x1000 matrix on a modern computer takes <1 second, so it doesn't seem like this should be the limiting step for any of the problems encountered.\n\nThe KL penalty version of PPO seems closely related to SPU. Can the authors mention differences with that version of PPO in the related work?\n\nIn Sec 4, step iii is described as supervised learning. Can the authors elaborate on why? I would typically think of the other direction as supervised learning as that leads to MLE.\n\nIn Sec 5.1, what is the justification/reasoning for setting \\tilde{\\lambda_{s_i}} = \\lambda and introducing the indicator functions?\n\nSec 5.2 is not evaluated and Sec 5.3 produces inferior results, so it may make sense to move these to the appendix. Otherwise, the authors should explain situations where we would expect these to be useful or provide some additional insight. It also should be noted that the proximity constraints in TRPO/PPO follow from a theoretical argument and are not arbitrary choices.\n\nSec 5.3 seems to deviate quite a bit from the SPU framework. In addition to the differences pointed out in the text, the \"supervised\" loss changes too. Can the authors justify/explain the reasoning for these changes?\n\n=====\n\nI appreciate the authors' efforts to improve the paper. However, there is still substantial room for improvement in writing clarity. For example, the authors optimize the reverse KL from typical supervised learning, which makes even the title of the method confusing. The method that was experimentally evaluated can be derived more simply without the two-step procedure by directly taking the gradient and add the heuristically motivated per state indicator. This in itself is interesting and the authors demonstrate that it works well experimentally. I think the paper would be substantially more useful to the community if the authors focused on that contribution alone. As it stands now, I find the paper difficult to read because most of the theoretical results have no bearing on the method.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper130/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Supervised Policy Update for Deep Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "We propose a new sample-efficient methodology, called Supervised Policy Update (SPU), for deep reinforcement learning.

As such, Equation 14 is *more* theoretically justified than Equation 13.\n\nDisadvantaged because they work in the parameter space, TRPO also needs to make 2 other approximations (linear approximation to objective and quadratic approximation to aggregated constraints). The two-step procedure allows us to bring in convex theory and duality to solve exactly the original problem TRPO wants to but is unable to solve. To our knowledge, this would not have been possible without the two-step procedure.\n\nThus, compared to PPO, we are on significantly stronger theoretical footing.

We argue that this does not represent a lack of novelty because:\n\n-  PPO considers a similar form of gradient, with adaptive KL penalty. However, in PPO, this form of gradient is inferior to PPO clipping. To the best of our knowledge, it is only until our work that such form of gradient is demonstrated to outperform PPO clipping.\n\n-  The two-step procedure allows us to theoretically motivate adding the indicator variable. Considering what would happen if we were to add the indicator variable to either TRPO or PPO without the two-step process and the optimization problem (12-14). In TRPO, theta_k is only updated once to obtain theta_{k+1}. Thus, it does not make sense to add the indicator. In PPO, the disaggregated constraint is not considered. In our paper, the indicator variable is intimately linked to the two-step procedure and the optimization problem (12-14). The two-step procedure allows us to solve this problem exactly. To have the gradient to update the policy, we make approximations. The indicator variable helps to enforce hard constraints despite the approximations.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper130/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper130/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper130/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Supervised Policy Update for Deep Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "We propose a new sample-efficient methodology, called Supervised Policy Update (SPU), for deep reinforcement learning.

We felt it more appropriate to refer readers to these works rather than repeating the results in the appendix.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u201cJust above theorem 1 the sentence does not parse \"Further, for each s, let \u03bbs be the solution to \", firstly there is no 'solution' to an equation, secondly should it be \u03bbs or pi?\u201d\n\nJust above Theorem 1, note that \ud835\udf0b^\ud835\udf40 is defined as a function of \ud835\udf40. We then define \ud835\udf40_s as the  \ud835\udf40 that makes the value of the KL divergence equal to epsilon.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u201cThe discussion following theorem 1 is very messy and hard to follow and the notation is horrendous. I'm confused as to why the indicator function in the 'disaggregated' update only includes states for which the constraint is already satisfied, what about the states where it is not? I presume this is because you initialize from the previous policy, but this seems very approximate and even worse updating the parameters for one state might significantly move the policy in some other state meaning large violations are possible and not dealt with.\u201d\n\nPlease note that the indicator function in Equation (18) is applied to each state in the trajectories sampled by the current policy. The indicator function helps us to take into account the disaggregated constraints (14) in the optimization problem (12)-(14). \n\nPlease also note that the original policy improvement bound from TRPO [1] [2] were proved using the disaggregated constraints. We would like to quote the TRPO paper: \u201cThis problem imposes a constraint that the KL divergence is bounded at every point in the state space.\u201d In the TRPO, the disaggregated constraint is too unwieldy to work with and they thus choose to work with the average KL divergence (the aggregated KL constraints in our case). In our paper, we work directly with the disaggregated constraint, but make the approximation that we only enforce the disaggregated constraints for the states in the trajectories sampled by the current policy. \n\nThank you for your comment here! We will rewrite the discussion to better explain our reasoning regarding the indicator function.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u201cThe connections to the papers 'MAXIMUM A POSTERIORI POLICY OPTIMISATION' and 'Relative Entropy Policy Search' should be mentioned, as another commenter said previously.\u201d\n\nIn the revision, we will include a discussion of MPO and Relative Entropy Policy Search and their relationship to our work. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u201cI don't think TRPO/PPO is SOTA anymore, so maybe these baselines aren't particularly interesting.\u201d\n\nWe acknowledge that recent work such as SAC has show to improve performance on TRPO and PPO, however we would like to point out that the main focus of our paper is to explore the idea of separating finding the optimal policy into a two-step process: finding the optimal non-parameterized policy, and then parameterizing this optimal policy. As such, we wanted to compare with algorithms operating under the same algorithmic constraints, one of which is being on-policy. It is a general trend in RL that the performance of an on-policy algorithm can be improved by incorporating off-policy training (such as in SAC), We thus leave the extension of our approach to off-policy training to future work. We also invite the community to join us in making this extension. To help with this effort, we will release code for push-button replication of the main results in the paper.\n\nThank you again for your input, we look forward to further discussions.\n\n\nReference\n\n[1] Joshua Achiam, David Held, Aviv Tamar, and Pieter Abbeel.

It is much simpler and more understandable than MPO and GAC. The technique is comprehensible by undergraduates. Simplicity in RL algorithms has its own merits. This is especially useful when non-expert wants to apply RL algorithms to solve their problems, which is becoming a trend. The step-by-step description and implementation of SPU in only slightly more involved than PPO.\n\n-  It is versatile since a wide variety of constraint types can be used. SPU provides a general framework, allowing practitioners to try out different constraint types. For example, the TRPO paper mentions that enforcing the disaggregated constraint is preferable to enforcing the aggregated constraints. However, for mathematical conveniences, they choose to work with the aggregated constraints: \u201cWhile it is motivated by the theory, this problem is impractical to solve due to the large number of constraints. Instead, we can use a heuristic approximation which considers the average KL divergence\u201d [6]. In our paper, we show that the SPU framework allows us to solve the optimization problem with the dis-aggregated constraint exactly and also experimentally demonstrates that doing so helps to bring performance of SPU to be higher than TRPO.\n\n-  It is desirable to have a unified algorithm that applies to both continuous and discrete problems. In our understanding, GAC and SAC do not apply to the discrete case. MPO has only made preliminary progress with the discrete case. \n\n-  To our knowledge, among all the on-policy algorithms, it gives the best performance for the continuous cases. Deeply understanding the on-policy case is beneficial to the community. In future work we will consider combining SPU with replay buffers. \n\n-  It is a general approach to solving DRL problems. The algorithms tested in our paper are specific instances of this approach. In both the GAC and MPO paper, working in the non-parameterized policy space is a by-product of applying the main ideas in those papers to DRL.\n\nWe will cite and discuss SAC and MPO paper in related work. We also argue that SAC is not directly comparable to SPU since SAC tunes environment-specific parameter (reward scaling). In SPU, the hyper-parameters are shared and fixed across all environments. The neural networks used in the SAC paper are also 4 times larger than the neural networks used in our work and the versions of PPO and TRPO that we compared against. Also, the performance of SPU and SAC can not be compared by looking at the graphs in the respective papers since the Mujoco environments used in the SAC paper is version 1 while we used version 2.  \n\nThat being said, in our paper, we want to compare SPU against algorithms that operate under the same constraints, one of which is being on-policy. Thus, the focus of the paper will remain comparing SPU with other on-policy schemes. We justify why in more detailed below.

It would make more sense to compare to PPO, so the authors need to justify this decision.\n* The results on Mujoco are quite poor compared to state-of-the-art methods (e.g., SAC). The authors should justify why we should care about their results.\u201d\n\nResponse: We do not claim state of the art results. Rather, we hope our paper ignites interests in separating finding the optimal policy into a two-step process: finding the optimal non-parameterized policy, and then parameterizing this optimal policy. As such, we wanted to compare with algorithms operating under the same algorithmic constraints, one of which is being on-policy. Also, both SAC and Implicit Quantile Networks for Distributional Reinforcement Learning have a long of history of development and we argue this is why they are state-of-the-arts method. In contrast, SPU is among the first few papers to consider working in the non-parameterized space. \n\nIt is a general trend in RL that the performance of an on-policy algorithm can be substantially improved by incorporating off-policy training. For example, experience replay was used to make Q-learning the state-of-the-art approach in DRL [1]. Subsequently, experience replay was also incorporate into actor-critic methods, which brought its performance to being equal to Q-learning method [2]. We thus leave the extension of our approach to off-policy training to future work. We also invite the community to join us in making this extension. To help with this effort, we will release code for push-button replication of the main results in the paper.\n\nWe included the graphs for Atari in the appendix because there are too many of them. We have included figure 2 to provide for a high-level overview of the performance of SPU vs PPO. We will rewrite the explanation of figure 2 to make this clearer.\n\nWe acknowledge that solving the model-free DRL problem as a two-step procedure of first solving a non-parameterized problem and then a projection onto the parameter space has independently been proposed in the GAC paper and the MPO paper. We will be sure to give the MPO paper proper credit in the revision. \n\nWe acknowledge SAC and other off-policy techniques can do better than SPU, which is on policy. We thank the reviewer for pointing out to us the SAC paper. We will make sure to cite SAC and discuss its benefit in our related work section.

It is unclear if SPU provides any additional insights or benefits over MPO.

Our approach is more straightforward, and has been designed to handle different types of trust region constraints in a natural manner. Also, the approach naturally applies to discrete (Atari) as well as continuous (Mujoco). Also, we argue that working in the non-parameterized space is a general framework to solving DRL problem and demonstrates its theoretical and experimental benefits. In MPO, working in the non-parameterized space is a by-product of applying EM to DRL problems.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper130/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper130/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper130/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Supervised Policy Update for Deep Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "We propose a new sample-efficient methodology, called Supervised Policy Update (SPU), for deep reinforcement learning.

Starting with data generated by the current policy, SPU formulates and solves a constrained optimization problem in the non-parameterized proximal policy space. Using supervised regression, it then converts the optimal non-parameterized policy to a parameterized policy, from which it draws new samples. The methodology is general in that it applies to both discrete and continuous action spaces, and can handle a wide variety of proximity constraints for the non-parameterized optimization problem. We show how the Natural Policy Gradient and Trust Region Policy Optimization (NPG/TRPO) problems, and the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) problem can be addressed by this methodology. The SPU implementation is much simpler than TRPO. In terms of sample efficiency, our extensive experiments show SPU outperforms TRPO in Mujoco simulated robotic tasks and outperforms PPO in Atari video game tasks.", "keywords": ["Deep Reinforcement Learning"], "authorids": ["quan.hovuong@gmail.com", "yiming.zhang@nyu.edu", "keithwross@nyu.edu"], "authors": ["Quan Vuong", "Yiming Zhang", "Keith W.
