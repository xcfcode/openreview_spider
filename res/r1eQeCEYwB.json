In addition, graph classification requires the GNN to understand both local and global structures of the given graph. The requirements of graph classification are completely different from those of node classification. As we showed through several numerical experiments, mapping the local structures to similar feature vectors and not understanding the global structure of the graph, can make the GNN completely unable to perform even simple classification tasks. \n\n- \"high computational complexity of the proposed approach\": Our approach does not have high computation complexity.

Specifically, if two nodes, that may be far apart in the graph, may be represented as (almost) the same vector. This is simply because when no features/labels are associated with nodes, and the local structure around those two nodes is very similar then the local aggregation of information will result in a similar representation.  Therefore the authors introduce an embedding first of the graph in the Euclidean space using DeepWalk and then use this embedding in combination with the design of a CNN. The authors propose a pooling method that outperforms several state-of-the-art pooling techniques on real data. Overall, the empirical results are supportive of the fact that the proposed method can help improve the performance of GNNs. \n\nOverall I found the results of this paper to be weak, but nonetheless the paper is well-written and contains some interesting ideas. Hence my rating. Some questions follow. \n\n- While the authors call this as an \"issue\" it is more like a feature of these methods.  For instance, in \"RolX: Structural Role Extraction & Mining in Large Graphs\" by Henderson et al. this \"issue\" could turn out to be an interesting feature of the GNNs in the sense that these nodes may have a similar (structural) role.  It would be nice to have a short discussion related to this line of research in social networks' analysis. \n-  Some components of the CNN (e.g., node sampling) could be done using  well-developed tools for sampling matrices from numerical linear algebra, or by introducing some randomness when sampling a node as in kmeans++. \n- Graph downsampling appears to be an expensive operation. Can you please comment on the running times? The issue of scalability is not discussed, and the reader cannot easily infer to what sizes this method can scale up to. \n- Using other graph tasks, that are classical but also more challenging (e.g., learning 2-connected components of a graph just to mention something that comes up) would be interesting to see in Section 5.2.\n-  It would have been interesting to see the effect of the embedding step on the accuracy on the real data. E.g., using node2vec or standard spectral embeddings. \n\n\n[Edit: The authors have replied to my comments, and the other reviewers' comments in great detail.

Second, please let us clarify what we wanted to show in Table 1 and Table 2. GNN-ESR yields notable performance gain when:\n \n1-    The graphs are composed of similar local structures and the difference between graphs is in their global structure. For instance, Table 1 shows that for the HLLD, CNLC, and CNC tasks, GNN-ESR yields notably higher performance (around 100 % performance improvement).  \n\n2-    When the nodes/edges of the graph are not labeled or attributed. In Table 1, we did not include the node labels and results for PROTEINS, NCI1, DD, ENZYM, SYNTHIE shows that the proposed approach clearly helps the GNN to extract more informative features. \n \nPLEASE NOTE that we could include PTC in this Table 1 too and the performance gain for the PTC dataset when the nodes are not labeled is notable (6 %). Table 1 was too long and we did not include further datasets. \n \n3-    Table 2 shows that even if the nodes/edges of the graphs are labeled/attributed, the proposed approach can provide notable performance gain and the reason is twofold. First of all, the proposed approach helps the GNN to distinguish similar local structures in different locations of the graph. Second, it provides a geometrical representation of the graph to the GNN. For instance, for the ENZYM, NLC, and MDC, the performance gain is more than 10 %. We intentionally included PTC, PROTEINS, DD in Table 2 to show that the proposed approach either improves the performance or yields comparable performance. \n\nIn the paper, we claim that the proposed approach CAN improve the results. The amount of improvement depends on the structure of the graphs and the way the graphs are attributed/labeled. \n\nWe would also like to note that the proposed approach also addresses the problem raised by (Xu et al. ICLR 2019) in a more effective way. The authors of (Xu et al. (ICLR 2019)) wanted to make sure that if two local structures are different, the GNN maps them to different vectors in the feature space. The solution that we proposed prevents the GNN from mapping even similar local structures to the same feature vectors because we make the GNN aware of the location of the nodes. Please take a look at our answer to Reviewer 4 about this point. \n\nWe also like to mention that the contribution of our paper is not limited to GNN-ESR. We utilized the spatial representation of the graph to propose a novel pooling method too. The proposed approach is more intuitive and interpretable than most of the existing methods and the results show that it either outperforms or yields comparable performance. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper922/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper922/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "GRAPH ANALYSIS AND GRAPH POOLING IN THE SPATIAL DOMAIN", "authors": ["Mostafa Rahmani", "Ping Li"], "authorids": ["mostafarahmani@baidu.com", "liping11@baidu.com"], "keywords": ["Graph Neural Network", "Graph Classification", "Graph Pooling", "Graph Embedding"], "TL;DR": "Addressing a serious shortcoming of the GNNs by making them aware of the role of the nodes in the structure of the graph and proposing a novel graph pooling method.

I have upgraded the score to marginal acceptance (6).\n\n============ Original review ============\n\nIn this paper, the authors identify a shortcoming of existing GNN architectures for graph classification tasks -- specifically, the fact that, in the featureless regime, the graph convolutional layers rely on propagating very rudimentary structural information, making it hard (or impossible) to distinguish graphs with similar local structure. To fix the problem, the authors propose to augment the input feature space with graph-structural embeddings (computed by an algorithm like DeepWalk), and processing those in parallel with any other input features available.\n\nOn existing real-world datasets, as well as synthetic datasets carefully constructed to illustrate this phenomenon, the proposed pipeline matches or exceeds the version without the structural embedding inputs. Further, the authors note that the structural embeddings could be used to propose a novel graph pooling method -- one which attempts to preserve as diverse structural feature sets as possible. It is shown that this method is competitive to other differentiable pooling methods, like DiffPool and Graph U-Nets. Lastly, the authors demonstrate that the addition of pooling layers does not help baseline GNNs on the synthetically constructed tasks, as the fundamental issue of handling similar local structures is still not addressed.\n\nI believe that the paper clearly exposes and proposes a nice idea which could hold great potential, and which can be useful to graph representation learning practitioners. I am particularly happy with the design of the synthetic experiments. However, I find that, in its current form, the manuscript is narrowly below the bar for a venue like ICLR.\n\nComments:\n* The observation that existing GNN layers may struggle with distinguishing featureless graphs is not particularly novel. It's largely the centerpiece of the (already cited) work of Xu et al. (ICLR 2019), and I believe that its relevance and relation to the authors' work should be better stressed in the related work section.\n\n* The usage of DeepWalk to encode structural information (and even to be used as initial features for a GNN) is, ultimately, also not necessarily a novel idea. At least, it's something that should be clear to any expert GNN practitioner already: if useful features are missing from the graph, a method like DeepWalk (if applicable; see below!) could be a go-to method for obtaining such features. In its current form, I don't see that the authors are proposing anything substantially architecturally novel, and their contribution is primarily on the data/feature engineering side.\n\n* The above point is not necessarily problematic, but if the aim is to stress the importance of the architectural novelties of the proposed GNN-ESR model more, and not just the added features, I would recommend the authors to perform a few ablations: e.g. seeing how well would processing a concatenation of E and F in the same GNN layer perform.\n\n* Many of the standard graph classification datasets are known to be noisy and unreliable (see e.g. Luzhnica, Day and Li\u00f2 (ICML GraphReasoning Workshop 2019). This means that it is a must to report error bars of the cross-validation experiments. It's hard to say that many of the improvements depicted here are statistically significant otherwise.\n\n* I have concerns about the computational complexity, or even feasibility, of using DeepWalk-like methods in the general case, e.g. for node classification. Namely, if such layers are to be applied in inductive settings (with nodes gradually added to graphs), one would require re-running DeepWalk every time a new node is added. The authors should comment on this adequately, and perhaps discuss the feasibility of other unsupervised embedding techniques for obtaining the e-vectors -- such as VGAE (Kipf and Welling, NIPS BDL 2016), GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., NIPS 2017), Graph2Gauss (Bojchevski and G\u00fcnnemann, ICLR 2018) or DGI (Veli\u010dkovi\u0107 et al., ICLR 2019).\n\n* While I find the proposed pooling method interesting (and more grounded in the graph's structural features than other proposed works), I find that there are many potential limitations to be discussed. For example, the fact that we start from a random first index means that we cannot rely on the obtained pooling to always be the same -- could this cause undesirable variance at test time? Furthermore, the downsampling from A^3 is a sure-fire way to obtain dense graphs after the first pooling -- potentially severely limiting the applicability of the method for large graphs. In my opinion, the authors should appropriately comment on these and perform ablations against pooling with A and A^2 (as was done in Graph U-Nets). It should also be interesting to note that there exist other structurally-informed pooling methods; see e.g. the Clique pooling method from Luzhnica, Day and Li\u00f2 (ICLR RLGM 2019).\n\nGiven all of the above, I recommend (marginal) rejection, but am open to improving my score if the authors appropriately address the aforementioned comments.\n\nSome minor comments and thoughts:\n* The paper has several typos and grammar issues, and a typo pass is highly encouraged to aid clarity;\n* The \"attention mechanism\" of Equation (5--6) seems to be nonparametric? If so, it might be interesting to compare with a version that features learnable queries, e.g. using the Transformer-style attention.\n* In Equation (3), should the first min actually be a max? As we're maximising the overall minimum distances between topological features.\n* I'm not sure that the paper is anywhere clear on what's the exact GNN layer being used. Could this be clarified and made more explicit? It's critical to reproducibility.\n* I find it curious that the authors needed to resort to using batch normalisation---I usually found it to either have no meaningful effect on the results on the graph classification benchmarks, or it made results worse. Can the authors comment on this decision?\n* The idea to concatenate output of all convolutional layers is heavily resembling Jumping Knowledge networks (Xu et al., ICML 2018), and I believe they should be appropriately cited.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper922/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper922/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "GRAPH ANALYSIS AND GRAPH POOLING IN THE SPATIAL DOMAIN", "authors": ["Mostafa Rahmani", "Ping Li"], "authorids": ["mostafarahmani@baidu.com", "liping11@baidu.com"], "keywords": ["Graph Neural Network", "Graph Classification", "Graph Pooling", "Graph Embedding"], "TL;DR": "Addressing a serious shortcoming of the GNNs by making them aware of the role of the nodes in the structure of the graph and proposing a novel graph pooling method.

You should make it clear in the paper on which datasets your methods no longer have a clear edge.\u201d\n\nThanks for your suggestion. In the paper, we did not say that the proposed method outperforms on all the data-sets. We stated that the algorithm outperforms or yields comparable performance. In the revision, it is stated in a more clear way. \n\n5. \u201cThank you for the response. It has been raised in some \u2026  is scalable and should capture very similar invariances as DeepWalk.\u201d\nIt is an interesting thought and we can consider it in our final version. I think since the GNN averages the nearby nodes, it makes the vectors of two connected nodes close to each other. However, if the final purpose is to create something which is already given by DeepWalk in better quality, why not just using DeepWalk. It is also scalable and its complexity is linear with the number of nodes. In addition, since the GNN starts with random noise, it is hard for the GNN to create an informative distribution of the embedding vectors using just a few convolutions. \n\n\n6. \u201cThank you for your thoughts -- could you please include this discussion in the paper somewhere? \u201c\n\nThanks for the suggestion. We did (page 6 - right above graph down sampling). \n\n7. I'm not claiming that obtaining A^2 or A^3 is computationally expensive -- I'm merely stating that the matrices will become dense (and maybe even complete, very quickly). This poses issues on the memory side (while I appreciate that the classification tasks you used aren't large-scale, you should at least comment on the fact the method as-is won't be applicable memory-wise for large graphs). It also poses issues on the message aggregation side -- when you need to deal with O(N) GNN messages in every node, you can easily run into problems of oversmoothing or exploding messages. This should all be at least briefly discussed in the paper.\n\nThanks for the comment. We extended Remark 1 to include more details and some solutions. \n\n11. I'm not sure I follow the argument here. If both of your operators in eqn (3) are 'min', then why in Algorithm (1) is an argmax performed? If one wanted to minimise the sum of minimal distances (min-of-min, as eqn (3) shows), why not take argmin?\n\nLet's consider (2) and (3) separately. \n\n(2) is simply finding the farthest point (with respect to the sampled nodes). Thus, we need the argmax function to find the point with the maximum distance. \n\nThe cost function of (2) measures how accurate a set of sampled points cover a set of data points. The cost value for each data point is equal to its distance to the closets (min) sampled data points. Now, we minimized (min) this cost function to find the best set of sampled points. \n\n12. \u201cOkay, this clarifies my doubt. Could you please make it more clear somewhere in the paper that you're using exactly Equation (1) in your implementation?\u201d\n\nWe did.

Thank you for the response. It has been raised in some works (e.g. DGI) that a GNN by itself---irrespective of the parameters chosen---imposes an inductive bias that close nodes should be grouped together.

We are well aware of column/row sampling techniques and we considered several sampling methods as our candidates including the one used in K-means++ and SRS [arXiv:1705.03566]. The farthest data point sampling method used in our pooling method (which is very similar to the sampling techniques used in K-means ++) ensures that the sampled embedding vectors cover the spatial distribution of all the embedding vectors and this is all we expect the sampling method to do. \n\n3- \u201cGraph downsampling appears to be an expensive operation.\u201d\nThe complexity of the sampling method is linear with the number of sampled embedding vectors (O(m*n*de) where m is the number of sampled vectors and de is the dimension of the embedding vectors). In addition, different from node classification, in the graph classification task, we mostly do not have large graphs (mostly less than 100 nodes). In the revised paper, we described the computation complexity of the node sampling method. \n\n4- \u201cIt would have been interesting to see the effect of the embedding step on the accuracy on the real data. E.g., using node2vec or standard spectral embeddings.\u201d\n\n\u0651In our initial experiments, we used other embedding methods such as [arXiv:1710.02971] but the results were not much different. In the final version, we will report the results with several different embedding methods. \n\n5- \u201cWhile the authors call this as an \"issue\" it is more like a feature of these methods.  For instance, in \"RolX: Structural Role Extraction & Mining in Large Graphs\" by Henderson et al. this \"issue\" could turn out to be an interesting feature of the GNNs in the sense that these nodes may have a similar (structural) role.\u201d\n\nIt depends on the application that we deal with. In the graph classification problem , we clearly showed that it is not a desirable feature and this feature can make the GNN unable to extract discriminative features. \nMoreover, our approach addresses another problem of GNNs raised by (Xu et al.

(ICLR 2019)\u201d: \nPlease note that the approach presented in (Xu et al. (ICLR 2019)) does not solve the problem that we address in our paper. The authors of (Xu et al. (ICLR 2019)) want to make sure that if two local structures are DIFFERENT, the GNN maps them to different vectors in the feature space and they showed that the sum aggregator satisfies this requirement. The solution that we proposed prevents the GNN from mapping even SIMILAR local structures to the same feature vectors because we make the GNN aware of the location of the nodes. In addition, in all our experiments we used the sum aggregator. The presented experiments clearly show that  (Xu et al. (ICLR 2019))  can not solve the problem that we addressed in our paper. \n\nWe clarified this difference in the new paper.   \n\n2- \u201ctheir contribution is primarily on the data/feature engineering side\u201d: \nWe believe that it is an important contribution that our paper shows that the fact that GNN maps similar local structures to same feature vectors is problematic. In addition, we propose a solution to this important problem and our solution is simple and effective ( it also addresses the problem raised in Xu et al. (ICLR 2019) in a more effective way).\nMoreover, the contributions of our paper is not limited to GNN-ESR. We present a new graph pooling method too. \n\n\n3- \u201cThe above point is not necessarily problematic but \u2026 seeing how well would processing a concatenation of E and F in the same GNN layer perform\u201d:\n\nWe do not claim that we propose a novel architecture for GNNs (except the new pooling layer).  In Figure 1, if we set k1=0, it is equivalent to the scenario in which we  E and F are concatenated. Our initial experiments with few data-sets showed that k=1 is slightly better than k=0. We will regenerate the results with k=0 and will report them in the final version. \n\n\n4- \u201cThis means that it is a must to report error bars of the cross-validation experiments..\u201d: \nThanks for your suggestion.  We added the error bars to the results in the new paper. \n\n\n5- \u201ccomputational complexity, or even feasibility, of using DeepWalk-like methods in the general case \u2026 or DGI (Veli\u010dkovi\u0107 et al., ICLR 2019).\u201d\n\nIn this paper, we focus on graph classification. For online cases, there are some online embedding methods. In addition, Deepwalk is scalable to large graphs. In the paper, we mention that the motivation for using the embedding vectors is to provide a point-cloud representation of the graph to the neural networks. Thus, any embedding method which yields embedding vectors such that the distance between the embedding vectors is proportional to the distance of their corresponding nodes is applicable. In our initial experiments, we used other embedding methods such as [arXiv:1710.02971] but the results were not much different. \nPlease note that methods such as VGAE (Kipf and Welling, NIPS BDL 2016) are not applicable to our method. They basically assume that the node attributes contain sufficient amount of information such that one can recover the adjacency matrix via processing the node attributes. \n\n\n6- \u201cthe fact that we start from a random first index means ... could this cause undesirable variance at test time? \u201d:\n\nSince we use farthest data point sampling, finally the sampled embedding vectors cover the spatial distribution of all the embedding vectors. In addition, one can start from a deterministic embedding vector. For instance, we can start from the embedding vector which is the closest vector to the mean of all the embedding vectors. \n\n7- \u201cFurthermore, the downsampling from A^3 is a sure-fire way to obtain dense graphs after the first pooling -- potentially severely limiting the applicability of the method for large graphs\u201d:\n\nAdjacency matrices are mostly sparse and obtaining A^2 or A^3 is not computationally expensive. In addition, in most of the graph classification applications, the size of the graphs are small. \n\n\n8- \u201cCLIQUE POOLING\u201d: \nThanks for bringing this paper into our attention. We cited it. \n\n9- \u201cI recommend (marginal) rejection, but am open to improving my score if ....\u201d\n\nWe are delighted that you found our paper innovative and we would like to note that openreview shows \u201cclear reject\u201d not marginal reject. We hope that our answers provide a more clear picture of the contributions of the paper. \n\n10- \u201cit might be interesting to compare with a version that features learnable queries\u201d:\n\nBoth Diffpool and Rank-Pool use learnable queries.\n\n\n11- \u201cIn Equation (3), should the first min actually be a max?\u201d\n\nIt should be min. The distance between each data point and its closest sampled vector matter. \n\n12- \u201cwhat's the exact GNN layer being used\u201d\n\nWe used spatial convolution layer as in eq (1). We will release the data and the code after acceptance.\n\n13- \u201cBatch normalization\u201d:\n\nWe used it to help to prevent overfitting along with dropout. \n\n14- (Xu et al., ICML 2018): \n\nWe cited it.

A new graph pooling method is proposed and it is shown that the proposed pooling method achieves competitive or better results in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods. \n", "pdf": "/pdf/7ce731d0848d434b54a0d0ae89eb102fbb263703.pdf", "paperhash": "rahmani|graph_analysis_and_graph_pooling_in_the_spatial_domain", "original_pdf": "/attachment/209f45117e756495512c861648585bd43b80ee0a.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nrahmani2020graph,\ntitle={{\\{}GRAPH{\\}} {\\{}ANALYSIS{\\}} {\\{}AND{\\}} {\\{}GRAPH{\\}} {\\{}POOLING{\\}} {\\{}IN{\\}} {\\{}THE{\\}} {\\{}SPATIAL{\\}} {\\{}DOMAIN{\\}}},\nauthor={Mostafa Rahmani and Ping Li},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1eQeCEYwB}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
