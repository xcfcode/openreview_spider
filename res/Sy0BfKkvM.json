It proposes to generate fake (unknown class) examples using a two steps procedure: first a GAN is trained together with a classifier (C_K) using the data with the known classes, then this GAN is used to learn \u201cnear the frontiers\u201d examples. A new classifier (C_K+1) is then trained using both the labeled and the fake examples. Evaluation is performed on two image datasets.\n\nThis seems to me as an over complex procedure for dealing with the problem of unknown classes. The experimental section lacks precision. There is no indication on how the decision threshold theta is set for computing the accuracy on the softmax baseline. You do not indicate how many classes are supposed to be known in MNIST. There is no comparison with an alternative baseline making use of noisy data. Instead of training an alternative baseline with random samples, you could have sampled using the uncertainty provided by the classifier (e.g. sampling data for which no clear decision appears).  \nThere is no indication about the nature of the GAN and of the classifiers components. Entropy is mentioned in Eq. (3) but the term used here is not an entropy. There is no indication on how the GAN and the classifier are trained (section 2.1), are you using an alternate optimization?\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Open Set Recognition with Generated Data", "abstract": "In open set recognition tasks, a classifier must label instances of known classes while detecting unknown classes not encountered during training.
