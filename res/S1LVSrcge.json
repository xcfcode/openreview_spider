The new architecture seems to outperform vanilla RNNs on various sequence modelling tasks. Visualizations of the assignment of computational resources over time support the hypothesis that the model is able to learn to assign more computations whenever longer longer term dependencies need to be taken into account.\n\nThe proposed model is evaluated on a multitude of tasks and its ability to outperform similar architectures seems consistent. Some of the tasks allow for an interesting analysis of the amount of computation the model requests at each time step. It\u2019s very interesting to see how the model seems to use more resources at the start of each word or ASCII character. I also like the investigation of the effect of imposing a pattern of computational budget assignment which uses prior knowledge about the task. The superior performance of the architecture is impressive but I\u2019m not yet convinced that the baseline models had an equal number of hyperparameters to tune. I\u2019ll come back to this point in the next paragraph because it\u2019s mainly a clarity issue.\n\nThe abstract claims that the model is computationally more efficient than regular RNNs. There are no wall time measurements supporting this claim. While the model is theoretically able to save computations, the points made by the paper are clearly more conceptual and about the ability of the model to choose how to allocate its resources. This makes the paper interesting enough by itself but the claims of computational gains are misleading without actual results to back them up. I also find it unfortunate that it\u2019s not clear from the text how the hyperparameter \\bar{m} was chosen. Whether it was chosen randomly or set using a hyperparameter search on held-out data influences the fairness of a comparison with RNNs which did not have a similar type of hyperparameter for controlling regularization like for example dropout or weight noise (even if regularization of RNNs is a bit tricky). I don\u2019t consider this a very serious flaw because I\u2019m impressed enough by the fact that the new architecture achieves roughly similar performance while learning to allocate resources but I do think that details of this type are too important to be absent from the text. Even if the superior performance is due to this extra regularization controlling parameter it can actually be seen as a useful part of the architecture but it would be nice to know how sensitive the model is to its precise value.\n\nTo my knowledge, the proposed architecture is novel. The way the amount of computation is determined is unlike other methods for variable computation I have seen and quite inventive. Originality is one of this paper\u2019s strongest points. \n\nIt\u2019s currently hard to predict whether this method for variable computation will be used a lot in practice given that this also depends on how feasible it is to obtain actual computational gains at the hardware level. That said, the architecture may turn out to be useful for learning long-term dependencies. I also think that the interpretability of the value m_t is a nice property of the method and that it\u2019s visualizations are very interesting. It might shed some more light into what makes certain tasks difficult for RNNs. \n\nPros:\nOriginal clever idea.\nNice interesting visualizations.\nInteresting experiments.\n\nCons:\nSome experimental details are not clear.\nI\u2019m not convinced of the strength of the baseline.\nThe paper shouldn\u2019t claim actual computational savings without reporting wall-clock times.\n\nEdit:\nI'm very positively impressed by the way the authors ended up addressing the biggest concerns I had about the paper and raised my score. Adding an LSTM baseline and results with a GRU version of the model significantly improves the empirical quality of the paper. On top of that, the authors addressed my question about some experimental detail I found important and promised to change the wording of the paper to remove confusion about whether the computational savings are conceptual or in actual wall time. I think it's fine that they are conceptual only as long as this is clear from the paper and abstract. I want to make clear to the AC that since the changes to the paper are currently still promises, my new score should be assumed to apply to an updated version of the paper in which the aforementioned concerns have indeed been addressed. \n\nEdit: \nSince I didn't know that the difference with the SOTA for some of these tasks was so large, I had to lower my score again after learning about this. I still think it's a good paper but with these results I cannot say that it stands out.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variable Computation in Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been used extensively and with increasing success to model various types of sequential data.

To motivate our approach further, we will add that being able to run models with limited and/or fixed computational resources is extremely important for the application of machine learning methods, and we provide a first step towards such gains.

In practice however, it was given a fixed value to match the GPU floating point sensitivity.\n\nThe reason for the choice of this specific \u201cfirst-D\u201d shape is that we wanted to be able to control the computational complexity efficiently. Thus, we only have one parameter; a more general solution using any subset of the dimensions would be as expensive to compute as the full new hidden state, which would limit the usefulness of the mechanism.\n\n=== Evaluation ===\nIndeed, the magnitude of the change for the GRU hidden state at each time step does follow a similar pattern, in that it changes slightly more at the beginning of each word (the average gate value goes down monotonically from 0.8 at the beginning of a word to 0.6 at the end).\n\nThere are two main differences however. First, the GRU gate controller seems to only rely on the information provided by encountering a space character, and does not exhibit any of the morphological phenomena that can be observed with the VCRNN (as illustrated in Figure 4). \n\nSecondly, and more importantly, that measure is given a posteriori: computing the gate is as expensive as computing the full new state. One of the purposes of our work was to show that it is possible to obtain that information for much cheaper.\n\nWe will add this discussion to the paper, as these are indeed important distinctions.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variable Computation in Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been used extensively and with increasing success to model various types of sequential data.

We first address the issues raised by two or more reviewers here. As a general comment, we would like to emphasize again the exploratory nature of our work. We aimed to explore the following question: is it possible for a recurrent model to (cheaply) determine a priori  how much computation it is going to need at each time step? We designed our model and experimental section with this interrogation in mind, and believe that we were able to provide a positive answer.\n\nAs regards the wall-clock time, the computational gains are currently, to quote Reviewer 2 conceptual only, as we are using the Torch GPU kernels, and optimizing the hardware implementation was beyond the scope of this project. Our goal was to make the possible implications of the result clear, but we will clarify the language of the paper to reflect this more accurately.\n\nFor each experiment, we tried a range of \\bar{m} values for the Variable Computation recurrent network and a range of hidden state dimensions for its vanilla counterpart. While we only provided one result on PTB, Figure 5 illustrates how both of these choices affect the model\u2019s computation and perplexity on a Czech and a German dataset; note that the Variable Computation curve for perplexity/number of operations is always under the Vanilla one, meaning fewer operations for a better perplexity. We will provide the same figure for PTB.\n\nOur original reasoning for only providing vanilla RNN results on PTB was that we were trying to compare apples to apples, so to speak, and to reinforce the message that we are considering a paradigm which can be extended to other architectures.\n\nHowever, we have since successfully applied our method to the GRU architecture, which gives us the Variable Computation Gated Recurrent Unit (VCGRU). Between this and all of the reviewers\u2019 well-received advice to provide more context, we re-ran experiments with the RNN and VCRNN, GRU and VCGRU, and the LSTM architecture. The results are as follow. As in the paper, the second column provides the dimension of a vanilla RNN which would perform the same number of operations.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nModel\t\t\t| RNN-equiv\t| train / valid / test\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLSTM_1024\t\t| 2048\t\t| 1.21 / 1.46 / 1.42\nGRU_1024\t\t| 1450\t\t| 1.17 / 1.47 / 1.42\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRNN_1024\t\t| 1024\t\t| 1.31 / 1.51 / 1.47\nLSTM_512\t\t| 1024\t\t| 1.31 / 1.49 / 1.44\nGRU_725\t\t| 1024\t\t| 1.26 / 1.47 / 1.43\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVCRNN_1024\t\t| 760 \t\t| 1.39 / 1.51 / 1.46\nRNN 760\t\t        | 760 \t\t| 1.37 / 1.52 / 1.47\nLSTM 380 \t\t| 760 \t\t| 1.34 / 1.48 / 1.43\nGRU 538\t\t        | 760 \t\t| 1.28 / 1.49 / 1.44\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVCGRU_1024\t\t| 648 \t\t| 1.30 / 1.47 / 1.42\nLSTM 324 \t\t| 648 \t\t| 1.41 / 1.51 / 1.46\nGRU 458\t\t        | 648 \t\t| 1.37 / 1.52 / 1.47\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVCGRU_1024\t\t| 538 \t\t| 1.32 / 1.49 / 1.44\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe VCGRU behaves similarly to the VCRNN: the number of operations per character follows the same patterns, and it achieves the same perplexity as its constant computation counterpart with fewer operations. It also outperforms both GRUs and LSTMs for a given number of operations. We will add these results and discussion in the paper.\n\nFinally, we will add further discussion of our gating mechanism and comparison to other existing ones in the next version of the paper. Compared to the rest of the literature, the VCRNN gating paradigm is closest to that of the GRU: the main difference between the two is that where the GRU gate can take any shape, ours is more constrained and parametrized by a single value m_t, which allows to cheaply control the number of operations for the current time step.\n\nWe address the other comments in individual replies.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variable Computation in Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been used extensively and with increasing success to model various types of sequential data.

VCRNN is similar in nature to Adaptive Computation Time (Graves et al., 2016). Imagine a vanilla RNN, at each timestep only a subset (i.e., \"variable computation\") of the state is updated. Experimental results are not convincing, there is limited comparison to other cited work and basic LSTM baseline.\n\n=== Gating Mechanism ===\nAt each timestep, VCRNN generates a m_t vector which can be seen as a gating mechanism.  Based off this m_t vector, a D-first (D-first as in literally the first D RNN states) subset of the vanilla RNN state is gated to be updated or not. Extra hyperparams epsilon and \\bar{m} are needed -- authors did not give us a value or explain how this was selected or how sensitive and critical these hyperparms are.\n\nThis mechanism while novel, feels a bit clunky and awkward. It does not feel well principled that only the D-first states get updated, rather than a generalized solution where any subset of the state can be updated.\n\nA short section in the text comparing to the soft-gating mechanisms of GRUs/LSTMs/Multiplicative RNNs (Wu et al., 2016) would be nice as well.\n\n=== Variable Computation ===\nOne of the arguments made is that their VCRNN model can save computation versus vanilla RNNs. While this may be technically true, in practice this is probably not the case. The size of the RNNs they compare to do not saturate any modern GPU cores. In theory computation might be saved, but in practice there will probably be no difference in wallclock time. The authors also did not report any wallclock numbers, which makes this argument hard to sell.\n\n=== Evaluation ===\nThis reviewer wished there was more citations to other work for comparison and a stronger baseline (than just a vanilla RNN). First, LSTMs are very simple and quite standard nowadays -- there is a lack of comparison to any basic stacked LSTM architecture in all the experiments.\n\nThe PTB BPC numbers are quite discouraging as well (compared to state-of-the-art). The VCRNN does not beat the basic vanilla RNN baseline. The authors also only cite/compare to a basic RNN architecture, however there has been many contributions since a basic RNN architecture that performs vastly better. Please see Chung et al., 2016 Table 1. Chung et al., 2016 also experimented w/ PTB BPC and they cite and compare to a large number of other (important) contributions.\n\nOne cool experiment the authors did is graph the per-character computation of VCRNN (i.e., see Figure 2). It shows after a space/word boundary, we use more computation! Cool! However, this makes me wonder what a GRU/LSTM does as well? What is the magnitude of the of the change in the state vector after a space in GRU/LSTM -- I suspect them to do something similar.\n\n=== Minor ===\n* Please add Equations numbers to the paper, hard to refer to in a review and discussion!\n\nReferences\nChung et al., \"Hierarchical Multiscale Recurrent Neural Networks,\" in 2016.\nGraves et al., \"Adaptive Computation Time for Recurrent Neural Networks,\" in 2016.\nWu et al., \"On Multiplicative Integration with Recurrent Neural Networks,\" in 2016.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variable Computation in Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been used extensively and with increasing success to model various types of sequential data.

As to the effect of imposing a particular ordering of the dimensions on the model, it is difficult to assess without more empirical evidence. On the one hand, it reduces the number of local minima. On the other, it constrains the optimization somewhat, especially in the early stages. Our intuition is that neither of these effects is significant enough to justify a more complex model.\n\n\nWe certainly do not believe that ease of introspection should be a requirement for all models proposed. However, the nature of the present work is exploratory: we wish to examine the feasibility and usefulness of a general paradigm which we feel is under-researched in the literature; specifically, the ability of recurrent networks to perform variable amounts of computation to fit the needs of sequential data. Thus, our focus in this paper is on interpretability rather than pure performance. We strongly believe that a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms which contribute to the success of popular methods is essential to guiding the medium- and long-term evolution of the field, and aim to contribute to such progress here.\n\n\nAs regards our choice not to include sota char-level Penn TreeBank perplexity numbers in Table 3: we designed our experimental section to provide the clearest possible answer to the above-mentioned question, by trying to avoid possible confounding factors. Hence, we compare the results of the Variable Computation RNN to that of its closest constant computation counterpart (the Elman unit) in a regime where there is a clear trade-off between the amount of computation the model performs and the resulting test set perplexity (i.e. hidden dimensions between 100 and 1000).\n\n\nLSTMs also perform more computation than vanilla RNNs. The equivalent LSTM dimension for VCRNN-1000-a, for example, would only be 85. Even then, because the LSTM unit focuses on different mechanisms, it  would be unclear what conclusions one should draw from the difference in performances (if any). Additionally, while our gating mechanism works poorly with LSTMs (compounding gating mechanisms seems to make optimization difficult), the general paradigm can certainly be applied to produce Variable Computation LSTMs (we hope to spend some more time working on that project in the future).\n\n\nFinally, we did not find any other reported bit-level perplexity numbers in the literature than those provideded here. For character level, the best reported result to our knowledge is that of (HyperNetworks, Ha et al. 2016), with Valid/test bpc of 1.25/1.24. The reported results in recent literature for Elman-RNN-based methods (usually with more layers and hidden units) vary between 1.42 and 1.48.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variable Computation in Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been used extensively and with increasing success to model various types of sequential data.
