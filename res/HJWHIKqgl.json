Responses to a few points follow:\n\n\u201c1) the use of MMD to train generative models, as well as the importance of variance-reduction in MMD were already known.\u201d\n\nThe test power maximization strategy for the quadratic-time MMD is a new result, although a related result for a linear-time MMD statistic was published in Gretton et al. (NIPS 2012). The argument for the quadratic-time MMD presented in the present paper is a little more delicate, due to the different forms of the null and alternative distributions of the quadratic MMD estimate, and the far more complex expression for the variance.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that the MMD is established in training generative models (e.g., we reference the generative moment matching networks of Li et al. 2015 and the related model of Dziugaite et al. 2015). Our main purpose in this paper was rather to reveal statistically significant and interpretable differences in distributions of the trained models from  that of the reference data set.\n\nThat said, we have also proposed some additional strategies when using MMD to train GANs: for instance, using a sum of kernels with different bandwidths in our MMD, which helps ensure at least one of the kernel bandwidths in our \u201cdictionary\u201d gives a good gradient signal to the generator, and using an MMD defined on discriminator features as the signal to our generator.\n\n\n2)  \"I wonder if its use would be possible to train generators properly on realistic (non-binarized) data. This of course could be addressed by regularizing (smoothing) the kernel bandwidths ...\"\n\nWe agree that training a GAN (which gives continuous outputs) against the MNIST reference data (which is quantized into 256 bins) would benefit from using a broader kernel bandwidth which might \"blur over\" this quantization effect. It then becomes an interesting question as to how to choose the best kernel to control for perceptually relevant differences, and to ignore differences in distribution due to quantization/pixel level artifacts.\n\nIt is also perhaps worth clarifying that we binarized the MNIST digits only for the model criticism experiments; when using MMD as a GAN objective, we used the original digits."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Models and Model Criticism via Optimized Maximum Mean Discrepancy", "abstract": "We propose a method to optimize the representation and distinguishability of samples from two probability distributions, by maximizing the estimated power of a statistical test based on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD).

We'll briefly respond to a couple of points:\n\n\u201cThe two sample test are still quadratic in the number of samples. \u201c\n\nIn respect of computational cost: this is less of an issue when using MMD to reveal statistically significant differences in the distribution of GAN and reference digits, since such an evaluation occurs as a one-off step after the GAN is trained.  In training, the situation is less severe than one might expect, since we use minibatches, which results in speeds comparable to regular GANs (bearing in mind that the discriminator requires no training in the GMMN cases).\n\n\n\u201cIt would be interesting to know in what way this approach fails on e.g. image data (or other complex, high dimensional data where neural network generalize well). I could imagine that the neural network based discriminators in GANs generalize better than kernel based MMD methods. I would like to see follow up work that investigates this in more detail (and potentially profes my intuition wrong).\u201d\n\nYes, we agree this is the next step.

A few notes:\n\n\n\"How to train the provided t objective is not clear.\"\n\nThe estimator, which is given by dividing (2) by the square root of (5), is differentiable with respect to the kernel, and indeed can be easily handled by automatic differentiation systems such as Theano and TensorFlow. We then merely need to use it as a loss either at the end of an ARD-computing network (for the model criticism experiments) or within a GAN framework, and optimize with standard gradient methods. Implementations of the estimator in both Theano and TensorFlow are provided at https://github.com/dougalsutherland/opt-mmd, which also demonstrates its use in both setups.\n\n\n\"The algorithm is only tested on MNIST dataset as model criticism and learning objective. Comprehensive empirical comparison to the state-of-the-art criteria, e.g., log-likelihood, and other learning objectives is missing.\"\n\nOur paper proposes a method for model criticism and a new training objective in the GAN setting, where true likelihoods are intractable; to compare to log-likelihoods, we would need to instead use models where those are evaluable.\n\nAdditionally, as pointed out by Theis et al. (ICLR 2016), log-likelihood in fact is nearly independent of sample quality. As they demonstrate, models can have excellent-looking samples with terrible log-likelihoods, or very good log-likelihoods with terrible samples; log-likelihood is a useful measure for understanding the quality of models for some applications, but is not very useful for measuring sample quality. MMD and the related measures we consider, by contrast, are entirely sample-based and model-independent; they are good for understanding the quality of samples from a model, but not for directly understanding the quality of a model for e.g. regression purposes. Our MMD-based measures thus help in providing a quantitative measure of something akin to visual sample quality, rather than the very different log-likelihood criterion generally considered in previous evaluations of generative models."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Models and Model Criticism via Optimized Maximum Mean Discrepancy", "abstract": "We propose a method to optimize the representation and distinguishability of samples from two probability distributions, by maximizing the estimated power of a statistical test based on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD).

In general, this tradeoff is hard to quantify; (4) provides a partial picture in terms of its dependence on m. In the generative model criticism case, we can take as many samples from the generated model as needed, and so available sample sizes will often be relatively large, making careful consideration less necessary.\n\nThese methods are certainly applicable to more complex datasets, using e.g. convolutional networks, with the t statistic as a loss. We ran some initial experiments on the Salimans et al. models for CIFAR-10 and found that the model samples were in fact easy to distinguish even with median-heuristic RBF kernels, so that our machinery was not needed for powerful tests. Presumably this would be true for current GAN-type models on more complex datasets as well, but our methods should apply to tests on better models in those settings (or to other testing problems on images).\n\nIn terms of the GAN sample qualities: to our eyes, it seems that the feature matching-based samples of 4(c) are somewhat better than those of (a) and (b). The GMMN and t-GMMN results are more similar. It seems that, at least on MNIST with this particular fixed kernel, direct classification loss gives a better distribution to match against than the raw image structure. This demonstrates that adaptivity in the matching is helpful.\n\nOur initial attempts to directly optimize the kernel resulted in instability in training. We conjecture, inspired by the simultaneous work of Arjovksy and Bottou (https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4_qw5xe), that this is because the two-sample test discriminator becomes too powerful in distinguishing the generator and true data manifolds.

We discretized the images for the test because otherwise the task is too trivially easy: looking at just marginal pixel values, a very small-bandwidth Gaussian kernel would immediately be able to distinguish the GAN pixel values (which are continuous but unlikely to hit exact 0s or 1s) from the MNIST pixel values (which are discretized into 256 discrete values).

How should split my data? Half and half? It seems that using a larger sample set will let me choose my kernel better, but I will loose power in the test sample. On the other hand, using a smaller training sample may result in a sub-optimal kernel choice, but will lead to higher power in the test sample.\n\nSecond, the paper mostly discusses MMD on raw pixels with the RBF kernel. How would these results translate into more complicated datasets, such as CIFAR, LSUN, CelebA, ImageNET...?\n\nThird, I do not see any difference between Figures 4a, 4b, 4c, or any qualitative discussion in the text."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Models and Model Criticism via Optimized Maximum Mean Discrepancy", "abstract": "We propose a method to optimize the representation and distinguishability of samples from two probability distributions, by maximizing the estimated power of a statistical test based on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD).
