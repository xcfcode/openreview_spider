In short, the authors propose a two-step process: 1) fine-tuning the poisoned model on a small portion of clean data, which is a commonly used defense, and 2) treating the poisoned model as the student and the fine-tuned model as the teacher and performing attention distillation. The authors show the proposed approach's effectiveness by comparing to three commonly used techniques leveraging six state-of-the-art backdoor attacks on two datasets, namely GTSRB and CIFAR10.  \n\n## Contributions & Strengths\n\nThe paper is well-written, the approach is simple yet effective, the ideas are clearly communicated, and the article has a tremendous experimental section.\n\nThe contributions of the paper are as follows:\n\n1. Introducing attention-distillation as a simple yet practical approach for erasing backdoors in a poisoned neural network. \n2. Performing extensive studies to compare and validate the existing approach against state-of-the-art backdoor erasing methods\n3. Providing substantive ablation studies that further clarify the contribution of each step of the proposed approach and its variations (for instance, in the iterative NAD).\n4. The attacks used in the paper cover both patch-like ($3\\times 3$ pixels) attacks as well as full image perturbation attacks. \n\nGiven the simplicity of the approach and its practical performance, I would expect the paper to be impactful and of interest to the community.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\nThe main weakness of the paper, in my opinion, is the sensitivity of the approach to the regularization parameter $\\beta$. Specifically, the optimal parameter choice relies on 1) knowing the type of attack and 2) having access to attacked images. It would be great if the authors can provide insights about choosing a good $\\beta$ while being oblivious to the type of attack. \n\n## Questions and comments for the authors\n\n1. At first glance, the method is counter-intuitive. If I understand correctly, the teacher model is fine-tuned with the first term of the total loss in Eq (3), i.e., starting from the poisoned model, you fine-tune with cross-entropy loss on the clean data. Hence, the optimal solution for the first term of the loss in (3) is the teacher model.  The teacher model is also the minimizer for the second term in the loss. Therefore, I would expect the teacher model to be the optimal solution for minimizing (3). However, the paper shows that this is not the case, and optimizing (3) leads to a better model than the teacher model (i.e., the fine-tuned model). What am I missing?\n2. Have the authors considered top-down attention mechanisms, like CAM, GradCAM, and GradCAM++, to calculate the attention maps in place of the norm-based attentions used in the paper? Could you provide any insights on this?\n3. In \"[Fooling Network Interpretation in Image Classification](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Subramanya_Fooling_Network_Interpretation_in_Image_Classification_ICCV_2019_paper.html)\" Subramanya et al. ICCV2019 propose adversarial patches that have a negligible effect on networks' attention (not in a backdoor setting). Given that the proposed method relies on attention, it would be interesting to see how it fairs against such attacks. \n4. In all your ``clean accuracy' plots (e.g., Fig 2 right panel), could you please provide a zoomed-in version of the curves as well?\n\n## Evaluation logic\n\nOverall, I have a high opinion of this paper and appreciate the work the authors have put into writing a comprehensive article. I am scoring the paper as a 7. I would be happy to increase my score conditioned upon clarification of my questions and addressing the concerns. \n\n## Post Rebuttal \n\nI thank the authors for their response. I have two responses: 1) I still don't find the answer to my Q1 convincing; in particular, the 'filtering effect of distillation' mechanism requires more rigorous discussion, and 2) with regards to the ICCV2019 paper, I think the authors may have misinterpreted my point; my point here is that one could design backdoor attacks that do not affect the attention maps substantially and was wondering if the logic would hold for such attacks. However, I agree with the authors that the points go beyond the scope of the current paper and would be interesting for potential future work. In any case, I think the paper is a good contribution to the field and would still vote for accepting the paper.

Maybe you can draw a learning curve for these 4 methods as well.\n\nPlease explain the possible source of information gain. For example: do the teacher and the student models use the same set of augmentation data? How does your approach compare with a baseline where only the teacher model is used and trained with both the data seen by the student and teacher models in your approach?\n\nPlease visualize the attention maps when the model is overfitting and when it is not.

The defense method, called neural attention distillation (NAD), first finetunes the backdoored model on a set of clean data to get a teacher model. The second part of NAD then finetunes another copy of the original backdoored model (student) on the same clean data while minimizing the difference between the activation maps of the student model and teacher model. The teacher model\u2019s weights are frozen in this distillation phase. The authors show that NAD outperforms or matches previous backdoor defenses over a range of attacks on the CIFAR-10 and GTSRB datasets. Further experiments are also conducted to show NAD\u2019s performance under different conditions such as the percentage of clean data and configuration of teacher-student models.\n\nPros:\n+Stronger empirical performance in defending against backdoor attacks versus previous methods.\n+Solid experiments studying performance under different conditions such as clean data percentage and types of attacks.\n\nCons:\n-The reason behind why NAD\u2019s student model outperforms its teacher (Finetuning) model is unclear, leaving the intuition and basis behind NAD\u2019s performance still not completely understood. \n-NAD\u2019s premise assumes the presence of clean and validated data, having limitations especially for training datasets with a large size.\n\nRecommendation:\nNAD\u2019s better empirical performance over prior art and the comprehensiveness of experiments in this paper would be valuable in the effort to tackle the threat of backdoor poisoning. My key concern about this paper is the lack of discussion about why NAD\u2019s student model could outperform its teacher (Finetuning) model even though both are finetuned on clean data and the student model is essentially mimicking the teacher\u2019s activation maps and has the same model architecture. More discussion or theoretical analysis would make the intuition behind NAD more convincing. Moreover, the proposed method did not include a component to detect the presence of a backdoor poison or consider an adaptive attack scenario. Overall, I am still inclined towards accepting due to its good empirical results. \n\n\nComments & Questions:\nEvaluating NAD on other model architectures might further show that NAD can generalize well.\n\nHave you consider backdoor attacks targeting multiple classes? How would NAD perform?\n\nWhat would happen to the required clean data size for the NAD defense to work if the dataset is of larger scale, such as imagenet? Would NAD still need 5% clean data, same, less or more?\n\n--Update after rebuttal--\nThe reviewer thank the authors for the response.

More clarification is appreciated.", "review": "This paper proposed neural attention distillation (NAD), a defense aiming to erase trigger effects from backdoored models with limited clean data. The idea is to leverage knowledge distillation by using a fine-tuned model as a teacher model and use NAD loss as a regularizer to train a student model by matching their attention maps. \n\nComparing to three existing defenses (finetuning, fine-pruning, and mode connectivity repairing (MCR)) over 6 different backdoor attacks, NAD shows significantly improved (lower) overall attack success rate while retaining similar accuracy on clean data. The authors also demonstrated that NAD training is more efficient than MCR. Some discussion on the teacher-student combination and the role of attention map is provided.\n\nOverall, I find the defense results descent and the performance improvement significant. The authors also have done a thorough comparison across datasets, attacks, and defenses.\n\nThere are a few things I hope the authors can further clarify, and I believe the new results will add more value to this work. I am happy to increase my score if they are addressed.\n\n1. Why is attention map regularization working, especially the fact that both the teacher and student models still carry backdoor effects (backdoored models w/ or w/o finetuning)? In the appendix the authors had some discussion on why using attention map over feature map for distillation loss. I am wondering does this imply feature maps are more vulnerable to trigger compared to attention maps? If so, since the tested attacks do not have the objective of deceiving the attention map (but will affect the feature maps), will the defense still be effective against an advanced backdoor attack that also aiming to deceive/bypass attention maps?

Please find our responses below for the concerns.\n\n---\n**Q1**: Why is attention map regularization working? Are feature maps more vulnerable compared to attention maps? Evaluation on adaptive attacks.\n\n**A1**: There are two advantages of attention distillation over feature distillation: 1) **Integration**. The attention operators calculate the sum (or the mean) of the activation map over different channels (see Equation (1)). It can thus provide an integrated measure of the overall trigger effect. On the contrary, the trigger effect may be scattered into different channels if we use the raw activation values directly. Such a difference between the attention and the feature maps is visualized in Figure 11 and 12 in Appendix I. Therefore, aligning the attention maps between the teacher and the student networks is more effective in weakening the overall trigger effect than directly aligning the raw feature maps. 2) **Regularization**. Due to its integration effect, an attention map contains the activation information of both backdoor-fired neurons and the benign neurons. This is important as the backdoor neurons can receive extra gradient information from the attention map even when they are not activated by the clean data. Moreover, attention maps have lower dimensions than feature maps. This makes the attention map based regularization (alignment) more easily to be optimized than feature map based regularization. We have added a small subsection \u201cAttention Distillation VS. Feature Distillation\u201d in Section 4.3 to address this.\n\nWhile we agree that robustness analysis against an adaptive attack will make our results more complete, it is very challenging to develop such an adaptive attack. This is because backdoor attacks can only poison the training data and cannot intervent the training process. Therefore, the adversary has to trick the model to pay more attention to the trigger pattern, otherwise, the model may ignore the trigger pattern during training. It is still an open question whether a backdoor attack can succeed without causing an attention shift. Note that the attention shift is not necessarily towards a small patch, the Refool backdoor attack tested in our experiment has a very subtle attention shift (see Fig. 5 in the Refool paper). The evaluation on a simple adaptive attack with BadNets has been added to Appendix K. \n\n---\n**Q2**: In the MCR experiment, it is not clear what two end models the authors chose to perform path connection.\n\n**A2**: As we stated in Appendix A \u201cMore Details on Defense Baselines\u201d, we use the backdoored model as endpoint model t = 0 and t = 1.

We empirically show, against 6 state-of-the-art backdoor attacks,  NAD can effectively erase the backdoor triggers using only 5\\% clean training data without causing obvious performance degradation on clean examples.

Please find our responses below for your questions.\n\n----\n**Q1**: The optimal parameter choice relies on 1) knowing the type of attack and 2) having access to attacked images. It would be great if the authors can provide insights about choosing a good $\\beta$.\n\n**A1**: We agree that the optimal values of the $\\beta$ parameter can be different across different attacks. A practical strategy is to increase $\\beta$ until the clean accuracy (right subfigure in Figure 8) drops below an acceptable threshold. This can reliably find an optimal $\\beta$, as increasing $\\beta$ can consistently improve the robustness (left figure in Figure 8). We have added this discussion to Section 4.3 \u201cEffect of Parameter $\\beta$\u201d.\n\n---\n**Q2**: Eq. (3): Why the student network can be better than the teacher network?\n\n**A2**:  Thanks for your insightful interpretation. Indeed, the first term in Eq. (3) is to finetune the student network to keep the good classification performance, which will produce a model that has similar performance to the teacher network. The second term can further improve the attention of the student. Here, the key insight is that distillation has a filtering effect that can effectively remove the backdoor noise from the attention map, even if the target attention is not perfectly clean. In other words, the partially purified attention of the teacher network can lead to even better student attention. The filtering effect of distillation is enhanced by using the squared sum instead of the raw attention. We have an analysis in Appendix F and Table 6, where it shows $A_{sum}$ is better than $A_{mean} $ and $A_{sum}^{2}$ is better than $A_{sum}$. We have also added a small subsection \u201cWhy a finetuned teacher can purify a backdoored student?\u201d in Section 4.4 to explain this insight.\n\n----\n**Q3**:  Have the authors considered top-down attention mechanisms?\n\n**A3**: Thanks for the suggestion. The GradCAM and related attention is the attention of the network on the **input**, not intermediate layer attention. However, backdoor attacks implant triggers into the intermediate layers of the network. Since a backdoored network behaves normally on clean data, it is likely that the model will have normal attention on the clean images used for finetuning. This may limit the effectiveness of GradCAM attention based on distillation or regularization. We are happy to explore these mechanisms in our future work.\n\n---\n**Q4**: Effect against \"Fooling Network Interpretation in Image Classification\" Subramanya et al. ICCV2019.\n\n**A4**: Thanks for the interesting suggestion. The patch attack proposed in the paper is a test-time adversarial attack, while our method is a training-time defense.  Although our method can effectively remove backdoor triggers from backdoored models, the purified models are still vulnerable to test-time adversarial attacks. We agree that it is interesting to explore strategies that can have both backdoor and adversarial robustness, for example, using adversarial finetuning. We will consider this as our future work.\n \n---\n**Q5**: A zoomed-in version of the curves in Fig 2 right panel.\n\n**A5**: Thanks for the suggestion.

Please find our responses below.\n\n---\n**Q1**: The training progress and the degree of overfitting of the teacher model are important but not clarified in the paper. In Figure 4, why \"4) C teacher and B student)\" can work well?\n\n**A1**: We assume by \u201ctraining progress\u201d, the reviewer means the NAD finetuning process and the \u201coverfitting\u201d means the student network overfits the finetuned teacher network during NAD finetuning. We have added a paragraph at the end of Section 4.4 \u201cOverfitting in NAD\u201d to discuss this. We find that the student can indeed overfit to the partially purified teacher network. However, this can be effectively addressed by a simple early stopping strategy: stop the finetuning when there are no significant improvements on the validation accuracy within a few epochs (e.g. at epoch 5). Note that this also highlights the efficiency of our NAD defense as only a few epochs of finetuning is sufficient to erase the backdoor trigger.\n\nIn Figure 4, the C teacher network is the model trained from scratch using 5% of clean training data (see Section 4.4). This means the attention of the network is clean. In other words, the network has learned to pay proper attention to the input image, although the model\u2019s clean accuracy is low (right subfigure in Figure 4). In this case, the student can still overfit to the teacher network if it is overly finetuned.\n\n---\n**Q2**: Do the teacher and the student models use the same set of augmentation data?\n\n**A2**: Yes. This information is provided in the last paragraph of Section 3 and in the \u201cDefense Configuration\u201d in Section 4. We have added more detailed descriptions of this setting at these two places.\n\n---\n**Q3**: How does your approach compare with a baseline where only the teacher model is used and trained with both the data seen by the student and teacher models in your approach?\n\n**A3**: In our setting, the teacher and the student models use the **same** clean subset of data. So the suggested baseline is actually to finetune the backdoored model **two** or more times, which is also equivalent to finetuning for two times or more epochs. We find that iterative finetuning does not lead to further improvement over one-time finetuning. This result has been added to Figure 9 in Appendix G. \n\n---\n**Q4**: Please visualize the attention maps when the model is overfitting and when it is not.\n\n**A4**: We assume by \u201cthe model is overfitting\u201d, the reviewer means the student network overfits the teacher network. We have added the attention maps learned by the student network at each of the 10 finetuning epochs to Appendix I, along with a discussion on the overfitting effect in NAD at the end of Section 4.4. We also show the activation maps learned by the network when an activation (rather than attention) distillation is applied. As can be verified, using distilling activation can lead to severe overfitting to the teacher network, however, distilling attention does not.\n\n---\n**Q5**: Please describe your data augmentation strategies in detail. What are their settings? Is the data augmentation methods used in each epoch or just at the beginning of the training process?\n\n**A5**: As we described in Section 4.1 \u201cDefense Setting\u201d, we use typical data augmentation techniques including random crop (padding = 4), horizontal flipping, and Cutout. For Cutout, we set the number of patches to be cut out of each image to 1 and each patch is a 3 \u00d7 3 square, which corresponds to the cutout parameters: n_holes=1 and length=9. This information is also provided in Appendix B. We have now added more descriptions of our settings in Section 4.1. The data augmentations are applied to each batch of training images at each training iteration, following a typical DNN training process. The same data augmentations are also applied to other finetuning-based baseline methods. Additionally, we have a comparison of our NAD method to just using data augmentations Cutout and Mixup in Appendix B.\n\n---\nWe are happy to provide more clarifications and run more experiments if there is anything still not clear or should you have other suggestions.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1631/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1631/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Attention Distillation: Erasing Backdoor Triggers from Deep Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~Yige_Li1", "xxlv@mail.xidian.edu.cn", "~Nodens_Koren1", "~Lingjuan_Lyu1", "~Bo_Li19", "~Xingjun_Ma1"], "authors": ["Yige Li", "Xixiang Lyu", "Nodens Koren", "Lingjuan Lyu", "Bo Li", "Xingjun Ma"], "keywords": ["Backdoor Defense", "Deep Neural Networks", "Neural Attention Distillation"], "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known vulnerable to backdoor attacks, a training time attack that injects a trigger pattern into a small proportion of training data so as to control the model's prediction at the test time.
