A key problem here is that processing such sequences with ordinary RNNs requires a reduce operation, where the output of the net at time step t depends on the outputs of *all* its predecessor. \nThe authors now make a crucial observation, namely that a certain class of RNNs allows evaluation in a non-linear fashion through a so-called SCAN operator. Here, if certain conditions are satisfied, the calculation of the output   can be parallelised massively.\nIn the following, the authors explore the landscape of RNNs satisfying the necessary conditions. The performance is investigated in terms of wall clock time. Further, experimental results of problems with previously untacked sequence lengths are reported.\n\nThe paper is certainly relevant, as it can pave the way towards the application of recurrent architectures to problems that have extremely long term dependencies.\nTo me, the execution seems sound. The experiments back up the claim.\n\n## Minor\n- I challenge the claim that thousands and millions of time steps are a common issue in \u201crobotics, remote sensing, control systems, speech recognition, medicine and finance\u201d, as claimed in the first paragraph of the introduction. IMHO, most problems in these domains get away with a few hundred time steps; nevertheless, I\u2019d appreciate a few examples where this is a case to better justify the method.", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Parallelizing Linear Recurrent Neural Nets Over Sequence Length", "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used to model sequential data but\ntheir non-linear dependencies between sequence elements prevent parallelizing\ntraining over sequence length.

It is true that parallel scan is \"a key primitive in many parallel algorithms\"[1] and has been heavily studied and optimized. Parallel linear recurrence is a lesser known application of the widely popular parallel scan algorithm. Neural nets are hugely dependent on high performance parallel computational primitives such as matrix multiplication and convolution. We believe the first application of this classic parallel algorithm to a field dependent on fast parallel algorithms is a novel idea; otherwise someone else would have published this paper in the previous 30+ years that both parallel linear recurrence and RNNs have existed.\n\nBeyond the new architectures introduced in the paper, we applied parallel linear recurrence (PLR) to SRU and QRNN and note that it could also be applied to strongly-typed RNNs. Further, we show that PLR can also accelerate (the currently uninvestigated) architectures involving on h_t = A_t h_{t-1} + x_t for square matrices A_t.\n\nThe broader question is \"how limiting is it that PLR cannot accelerate LSTMs, GRUs, vanilla RNNs, or other non-linear RNN models?\". We do not think this will limit the applicability of PLR within RNNs. A significant amount of recent research (listed below in [2]) has matched or surpassed the performance of non-linear RNNs with models with only linear sequential dependency. Given this body of research, our belief has shifted from \"RNNs depend on sequential non-linearity\" to \"there is no evidence that sequential non-linearity is necessary, and there is a fair amount of evidence it is not necessary\". With this in mind, we believe PLR's incompatibility with non-linear RNNs is not a major practical limitation as we expect linear surrogate RNNs to continue growing in popularity due to their fast training times and good performance. We also think this work will accelerate the growing popularity of linear surrogate RNNs.\n\n[1]\nhttp://people.cs.vt.edu/yongcao/teaching/cs5234/spring2013/slides/Lecture10.pdf\n\n[2]\nSequential models with linear dependendencies with experimental\nperformance on par with non-linear RNNs.

This means\n  relatively short recordings create very long sequences. These\n  sequences may be used for a sequence classification task which makes\n  it difficult to use truncated BPTT.
