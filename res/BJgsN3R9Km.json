How is the training time?\n\nCPU or GPU: While we trained the AntMan models on GPU, our tensorflow implementation is architecture agnostic. It can be trained on either.\n\nTraining time and efficient implementation: AntMan implementation is in fact extremely simple. Each AntMan based RNN module can be implemented with less than a 100 lines of tensorflow code, and efficiently trained on either CPU or GPU. \n\nWe simply replace the matrix multiplications in the RNN with AntMan modules which are themselves composed of smaller matrix-multiplications. As the basic building block is still a matrix-vector multiplication, they can be computed efficiently on both CPU and GPU.\n\nPTB takes less than 6 hours to train on a single Titan XP GPU, while the BIDAF model takes about 20-40 hours to train. The training time of the compressed model is comparable as of the original model.\n\n2: Why is AntMan applied just to RNNs?\n\nIt is definitely true that AntMan can be applied to any Matrix-vector product in a neural network. We do not claim that AntMan only works for RNN. We focus on RNNs because matrix-vector multiplies are the primary source of performance bottleneck in RNNs. We plan to try out AntMan on other networks as part of our future work.\n\t\n3: Another baseline is needed for comparison. The reviewer suggests a directly designed small \nRNN trained using Knowledge distillation.\n\n\tWe understand the reviewer's concern regarding the choice of baseline. In fact, we considered several compression techniques to identify the strongest baselines to compare with AntMan. Eventually, we chose ISS as the baseline, because for RNNs ISS satisfies two important criteria that we believe are most critical for model compression techniques, i) Good theoretical reduction in compute and memory, ii) Good computation efficiency of the compressed model that results in an actual reduction in the wall-clock time.  Most compression techniques do not satisfy both of these criteria. \n\nHowever, we do think that alternate baseline suggested by the reviewer makes good sense. We have run the suggested experiments and added the results comparing AntMan with directly designed small RNN models in the appendix. To summarize, we find that for a given level of compression, directly designed small RNN model trained with the original teacher model has much higher perplexity than AntMan compressed model trained with the same teacher, demonstrating that AntMan indeed provides new value. The results are presented in the table below.

Comparing against quantization and pruning\n\nWe understand the reviewer's concern on the choice of baseline, specifically the lack of comparison with quantization and pruning. In fact, we considered several compression techniques including quantization and pruning to identify the strongest baselines to compare with AntMan. Eventually, we chose ISS as the baseline, because for RNNs ISS satisfies two important criteria that we believe are most critical for model compression techniques, i) Good theoretical reduction in compute and memory, ii) Good computation efficiency of the compressed model that results in an actual reduction in the wall-clock time. Most model compression techniques lack one of these criteria.\n\nWhile Quantization and pruning are effective techniques for model compression, the former provides limited compression, while the latter is not computationally efficient.  More specifically, we did not consider quantization and pruning as strong baselines for the following reasons.\n\n1a. Quantization:  Even without running any experiments, we already know the maximum model compression that is achievable using quantization. Commodity hardware can support computation on up to 8-bit integers.   Even more aggressive quantization (e.g., 2-7 bit) hardly provides additional computational benefit because commodity hardware does not support those in their instruction set, while 1-bit quantization does not offer comparable accuracy. So theoretically, the maximum level of compression achievable through quantization alone on commodity hardware is from 32-bit to 8-bit resulting in a maximum compression of  4x, while AntMan can achieve up to 100x with no accuracy loss.  \n\nFurthermore, quantization and AntMan are complimentary techniques, which can be used together on a model.\n\n1b. Pruning: It is difficult to translate the computation reduction from pruning based techniques into actual performance gains.\n\nWhile we did not present pruning results in the paper, we did try out techniques on both PTB and BiDAF models to generate random sparsity as well as blocked sparsity. In both cases, we were able to get more than 10x reduction in computation even in the absence of Knowledge distillation. Therefore pruning provides excellent computation reduction. \n\nHowever, as discussed in the paper, those theoretical computational reductions cannot be efficiently converted into practical performance gains: Unstructured sparsity resulting from pruning suffers from poor computation efficiency; a 10x theoretical reduction leads to less than 4x improvement in performance while AntMan achieves 30x performance gain with 10x computation reduction for PTB like models.\n\nIt is possible to achieve structured sparsity such as block sparsity through pruning. However, structured sparsity requires implementing specialized kernels to take advantage of the computation reduction. \n\nDue to these reasons, we felt that Pruning techniques are weaker baselines to compare against. On the contrary, both ISS and AntMan achieve good computation reduction and can be efficiently executed using readily available BLAS libraries such as Intel MKL resulting in superlinear speedups. This is why we chose ISS as a primary baseline. We have added a section in the appendix discussing the limitation of various compression techniques including quantization and pruning in comparison to AntMan.\n\n\n2. Why just RNNs?\n\nIt is definitely true that AntMan can be applied to any Matrix-vector product in a neural network. We do not claim that AntMan only works for RNNs. We focus on RNNs because matrix-vector multiplies are the primary source of performance bottleneck in RNNs. We plan to try out AntMan on other networks as part of our future work.\n\n\n3. Cost of Finding P and Q?\n\nThe cost of finding P and Q can be neglected because we do not explicitly calculate them. Lets use SVD (PQ = A) for clarification. Instead of first training to find the weights of matrix A, and then decomposing into P and Q, we replace A as PQ directly in the neural network, allowing the back-propagation to find the appropriate values of P and Q that minimizes the loss function.\n\n4. What about combining SVD and LGP in Table 2? What about LGP Dense?\n\tIn Table 2 we presented only those results that yielded maximum computation reduction with minimum loss in accuracy. For PTB, LowRank LGP incurs more accuracy loss than just LGP. For example, for 10x compression, LGP achieves a perplexity of 74.69 while the best LowRank LGP achieves 75.99.\n\t\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1482/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1482/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1482/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AntMan: Sparse Low-Rank Compression To Accelerate RNN Inference", "abstract": "Wide adoption of complex RNN based models is hindered by their inference performance, cost and memory requirements.

Unfair comparison with ISS\n\nWhile we agree that ISS with KD would be interesting to try out, we do consider our current comparison fair as we are comparing with the full set of techniques described in the ISS paper. The authors of the ISS paper do not claim that their techniques should be used together with Knowledge Distillation. On the contrary, KD is part of our training process. Therefore, we are comparing the entirety of our techniques to the entirety of the ISS techniques.\n\nTraining with ISS would also require finding solutions to additional problems that are not described in the ISS paper. For example, ISS induces sparsity using a group lasso term in the loss function. As KD also introduces additional teacher loss to the loss function, it becomes necessary to balance the different loss terms that are targeted at achieving different goals (sparsity vs accuracy). It is not clear how these terms can be balanced systematically. Further, ISS requires tuning various hyper-parameters such as dropout, weight decay, and learning rate. In the presence of additional terms the loss function, it becomes necessary to do a full hyper-parameter sweep to identify the best set of parameters. \n\nWe like the reviewer's suggestion on using ISS with KD and are working actively on getting these results, as our end goal is to find the best compression techniques for our production models. However, we consider it to be non-trivial, and well beyond what is described in the ISS paper.\n\nWe also appreciate that the reviewer took an in-depth look at the results to point out that in the absence of KD, AntMan does worse than ISS for PTB. While this is true for PTB, we also want to point out that this is not always the case. For BiDAF, AntMan has better F1 score than ISS for the same level of compression in the absence of KD. For example, using LowRank LGP, in the absence of KD, AntMan can achieve average compute reduction of 8x for BiDAF while achieving F1 score over 76. On the other hand for F1 scores less than 76, ISS provides a compression of less than 5x on average. We have added these results in Appendix B.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1482/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1482/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1482/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AntMan: Sparse Low-Rank Compression To Accelerate RNN Inference", "abstract": "Wide adoption of complex RNN based models is hindered by their inference performance, cost and memory requirements.

Choice of baseline\n\nWe understand the reviewer's concern regarding the choice of baseline. In fact, we considered several compression techniques to identify the strongest baselines to compare with AntMan. Eventually, we chose ISS as the baseline, because for RNNs ISS satisfies two important criteria that we believe are most critical for model compression techniques, i) Good theoretical reduction in compute and memory achievable without sacrificing accuracy, ii) Good computation efficiency of the compressed model to fully exploit the theoretical reduction in computation.  Most compression techniques do not satisfy both of these criteria. \n\nBased on the reviewer's feedback, we discuss various compression techniques in regards to the aforementioned criteria and how they compare to AntMan. We also provide experimental results when applicable. We have added this discussion and results to the appendix A of the paper.\n\na. Quantization: 16 and 8-bit quantization (original 32-bit) can be supported fairly easily on commodity hardware, resulting in a maximum compression of 4x. Even more aggressive quantization (e.g., 2-7 bit) hardly provides additional computational benefit because commodity hardware does not support those in their instruction set, while 1-bit quantization does not offer comparable accuracy. \n\nIn comparison, we demonstrate that AntMan achieves up to 100x reduction in computation without loss in accuracy.  Moreover, quantization can be applied to AntMan to further reduce the computation, and vice versa, as quantization and AntMan are complementary techniques.\n\nb. Pruning: Unstructured sparsity resulting from most pruning techniques is not computationally efficient. For both PTB and BiDAF, our experiments show that pruning can achieve over 10x in computation reduction without even using knowledge distillation. However, due to poor computational efficiency, 10x theoretical reduction translates to less than 4x reduction in wall-clock time, while 10x reduction in Ant-Man translates up to 30x reduction in wall-clock time as demonstrated in the paper. Due to this inefficiency in computation, we do not consider pruning as a competitive baseline to compare against. (Table 2)\n\nPruning can also be used to produce structured sparsity such as blocked sparsity. However, structured sparsity requires implementing specialized kernels to take advantage of the computation reduction. Its efficiency greatly depends on the implementation, and in general is far from the theoretical computation reduction.\n\nc. Direct Design: Reviewer 2 suggested comparing with AntMan with smaller RNN models trained using the larger teacher model. Our results show that for the same level of compression AntMan achieves much higher accuracy.  (Table 3)\n\nd. SVD : We constructed compressed models by replacing matrix-multiplication with SVD, and trained the SVD based models using knowledge distillation. Once again, we find that for the same level of compression, AntMan achieves much higher accuracy than SVD. (Table 3)\n\ne. Block Tensor Decomposition (BTD): BTD is designed to compress RNNs whose inputs are produced by convolution based models, and contain certain redundancies. AntMan, on the other hand, is generic to all RNN based models. Also, BTD is designed to compress only the input vector and not the hidden vectors. This hinders the performance of BTD over a range of RNNs, where the hidden vectors are also large and hence we didn\u2019t consider BTD as a strong baseline to compare against.\n\nIn summary, we considered several compression techniques when choosing our baseline. We found that most techniques either did not achieve good computation reduction with comparable accuracy or were computationally inefficient to execute.  ISS is a strong baseline, providing both good theoretical reduction and good computational efficiency, which we chose to compare with thoroughly.\n\n\nTable 2: Theoretical vs Actual Performance gain on PTB using unstructured Pruning vs AntMan\n\nTheoretical Compression         Actual Performance Gain\n                                                      Pruning              AntMan\n10x                                                    4x                         30x\n\nTable 3: Test Perplexity for PTB model for various levels of computation compression using different compression techniques\n\nCompute Reduction        Small RNN Perplexity         SVD RNN Perplexity       AntMan Perplexity\n10x                                               80.06                                     78.63                                74.6\n50x                                               99.96                                     81.4                                  77.4\n100x                                           129.3                                       88.59                                78.6\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1482/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1482/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1482/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AntMan: Sparse Low-Rank Compression To Accelerate RNN Inference", "abstract": "Wide adoption of complex RNN based models is hindered by their inference performance, cost and memory requirements.

Existing works focused on pruning and regularization based approaches where as this paper explores structured sparsity on RNNs, using predefined compact structures.\n\nThey replace matrix-vector multiplications which is the building computational block part of RNNs, with localized group projections (LGP). where LGP divides the input and output vectors into groups where the elements of the output group is computed as a linear combination of those from the corresponding input group. Moreover, they use a permutation matrix or a dense-square matrix to combine outputs across groups. They also combine LGP with low-rank matrix decomposition in order to further reduce the computations. \n\nStrong points: \n\nPaper shows how combining the SVD and LGP can reduce computation. In particular in matrix-vector multiplications Ax, low rank reduces the computation by factorizing A into smaller matrices P and Q, while LGP reduces computation by sparsifying these matrices without changing their dimensions.\n\nThe paper discussed that their model target labels alone does not generalize well on test data and they showed teacher-student training helps greatly on retaining accuracy. They use the original uncompressed model as the teacher, and train the compressed model(student) to imitate the output distribution of the teacher, in addition to training on the target labels.\n\nPaper is well written and easy to follow. \n\nThis paper would be much stronger if it compared against quantization and latest pruning techniques. \n\nThis paper replace matrix-vector multiplications with the lowRank-LGP, but they only consider RNN networks. I am wondering how it affects other models given the fact that matrix-vector multiplications is the core of many deep learning models. It is not clear why their approach should only work for RNNs.\n\nTable 1 shows the reduction in computation and model size over the original matrix-vector multiplications Ax. I think in this analysis the computation of the those approaches are neglected. For example running the SVD alone on A (n by m matrix) takes O(m^2 n+n^3). That is true that if P and Q are given, then the cost would be n(m+n)/r. However, finding P and Q takes O(m^2 n+n^3) that could be very expensive when matrices are large.\n\nTable 2 only shows the LGB-shuffle resuts. What about the combined SVD and LGP?
