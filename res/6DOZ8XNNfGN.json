One was unconvincing experimental\nvalidation. Another, more conceptual one was that this is a 'unifying\nframework' rather than a novel method. Additionally, there were a number of\nminor points that were not clear. However, the authors have provided\nadditional experiments that the reviewers consider convincing, and\nwere able to provide sufficient clarification.\n\nRecommendation:\nThe reviewer's verdict post-discussion favors publication, and I\nagree. The authors have convincingly addressed the main concerns in discussion, and novelty is not a necessity: Unifying frameworks often seem an end in themselves, but this one is\npotentially useful and compellingly simple.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Graph Traversal with Tensor Functionals: A Meta-Algorithm for Scalable Learning", "authorids": ["~Elan_Sopher_Markowitz2", "keshavba@usc.edu", "mehrnoom@usc.edu", "~Sami_Abu-El-Haija1", "~Bryan_Perozzi1", "~Greg_Ver_Steeg1", "~Aram_Galstyan1"], "authors": ["Elan Sopher Markowitz", "Keshav Balasubramanian", "Mehrnoosh Mirtaheri", "Sami Abu-El-Haija", "Bryan Perozzi", "Greg Ver Steeg", "Aram Galstyan"], "keywords": ["Graph", "Learning", "Algorithm", "Scale", "Message Passing", "Node Embeddings"], "abstract": "Graph Representation Learning (GRL) methods have impacted fields from chemistry to social science.

The idea is beautifully simple, and generalizes running independent random walkers, an approach that is used in deriving many related algorithms.  The biasing and accumulation functions are user provided, and the authors show how different choices of these functions can be used to approximate a number of graph representation learning schemes.  The authors also provide a software framework, though it was inaccessible at review due to anonymization.  Experiments show the approach is much more scalable than competing approaches (though, to be fair, some of the competition was not targeting scalability).\n\n### Minor points\n\n- The \"CompactAdj\" format seems equivalent to compressed sparse row (or compressed sparse column) storage for the adjacency.  Is there any difference?\n- It might be worth commenting (possibly in appendices) on the data structures used for accumulation in the different concrete instances that are presented.  For example, the sparse matrix data structure used in 3.3.1 is presumably a neighbor list or equivalent, and not the CompactAdj format (since rebuilding the latter at every step seems needlessly expensive).\n- The claim at the end of section 4.1 that \"although naive calculation of $T^k$ is cubic, GTTF can estimate it in time complexity independent of the number of nodes\" is imprecise to the point of being misleading.  One can exactly compute a single row of $T^k$ for arbitrary $T$ via repeated sparse matrix-vector products time time proportional to the graph size times $k$, and one can do an approximate  computation of a row of $T^k$ even more cheaply using the method sketched here.  One can also get efficient estimates of various properties of matrix powers.  But actually getting estimates of all elements of the matrix $T^k$ in general is going to depend on the size of the graph, particularly when $k$ gets to the order of the graph diameter.\n\n### Typos\n\n- In the related work section, the table lists \"DGI\" -- I believe this is referring to DGL.\n- For the paper, I recommend writing out \"without loss of generality\" rather than using the abbreviation at the start of section 3 (unless it leads to going over space)\n- Add \"the\" before \"node embedding WYS\" at the start of 4.3.\n\n### Update\n\nThanks to the authors for their clarifications (and to the other reviewers).  I am more comfortable with my accept recommendation now, and have updated my confidence accordingly.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper880/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper880/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Graph Traversal with Tensor Functionals: A Meta-Algorithm for Scalable Learning", "authorids": ["~Elan_Sopher_Markowitz2", "keshavba@usc.edu", "mehrnoom@usc.edu", "~Sami_Abu-El-Haija1", "~Bryan_Perozzi1", "~Greg_Ver_Steeg1", "~Aram_Galstyan1"], "authors": ["Elan Sopher Markowitz", "Keshav Balasubramanian", "Mehrnoosh Mirtaheri", "Sami Abu-El-Haija", "Bryan Perozzi", "Greg Ver Steeg", "Aram Galstyan"], "keywords": ["Graph", "Learning", "Algorithm", "Scale", "Message Passing", "Node Embeddings"], "abstract": "Graph Representation Learning (GRL) methods have impacted fields from chemistry to social science.

Now it is extremely clean and modular. More importantly, it has a few key performance enhancement including:\n* Utilization of data loaders of pytorch and tensorflow. Now the Walk Forests are generated in parallel, as models are computing.\n* Efficient \"trimming\" and \"untrimming\" (this is our terminology). Many message-passing models compute $AXW$, where $A$ is some form of normalized adjacency, $X$ is node feature matrix (can also be node latents) and $W$ is trainable weight matrix. Starting from seed (batch) nodes, our walk forest traversal outputs extremely sparse $A$. While multiplication $AX$ is very efficient (using TF/Torch sparse-times-dense), it results in many rows of $X$ being zero (where traversal did not reach) and therefore some of the computation of $(AX)W$ is wasted as $W$ will be multiplied by many zero-rows producing zero-rows, unless the practitioner is careful. To resolve this, we offer this trimming and untrimming natively. With this, we can train small datasets in sometimes less than a second or two, and it has allowed us to run some complex models (e.g. 60-layer GCNII) over large datasets (Redit) in ~2 minutes per epoch.\n* We were slightly able to improve some metrics. E.g. we found hyperparameters for GCNII that make us outperform the authors' published results (we just their deep model thinner for pubmed, but same depth) [this also shows improvement on \"validation\" partition i.e. reflects test accuracy with proper model selection]\n* At this point, we have made many shell scripts as `<method>_on_<dataset>.sh`   and each invoke a runner (there is one runner for pytorch, and another for tensorflow) \n\nWe are now compiling a comprehensive table of results that we might add to the main paper or the appendix, since we get a 9th page with your recommendation for acceptance. We summarize it here (many entries are running or scheduled to run).\n\n|  | Cora | Citeseer | Pubmed | Redit |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| GAT |     83.2         |     72.4  | 77.7          |     OOM       |\n| F(GAT) |  83.3  |   72.5        |    77.8           |     ?       |\n| GCN |     81.5     | 70.3     |      79.0         |       OOM     |\n| F(GCN) | 81.9     |  69.8      |    79.4        |        94.9    |\n| MixHop |  81.9     |  71.4       |    80.8           |        OOM    |\n| F(MixHop)| 83.1    |  71.8         |   80.9           |       94.5     |\n| SimpleGCN |  81.0 |     71.9      |       78.9        |      94.9 on CPU OOM on GPU    |\n| F(SimpleGCN) |  81.0  |  71.9         |   79.0            |      94.8      |\n| GCNII |    85.5  |   73.4     |     80.3          |     OOM      |\n| F(GCNII) | 85.9   |     73.4     |      80.7      |     ? 94.1       |\n\nNotes:\n\n* ? means scheduled or currently running (i.e. results may improve)\n* SimpleGCN has a convex objective (only one trainable layer).

Our intent is to show that re-implementation of the underlying methods do not show any performance losses. We acknowledge that having a table containing the cross product of all datasets against all models might look more convincing. However,  in our experiments we have tried to include the (model, dataset) combinations that are most relevant. For example, our initial experiments showed that SAGE performs worse on articles datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed), perhaps because these datasets are transductive whereas SAGE model design is geared towards inductive settings. Also it is not possible to run methods like GCN on large datasets such as Amazon and Reddit. Based on your suggestion, we would be willing to add a complete table to the appendix (and the table will have a number of OOM entries for some baselines not using GTTF). \n * We were not aware of GCNII by the time we conducted the experiments (it looks like the paper made it to arxiv in July, around the time we were finalizing our experiments, we apologize for the omission). Nonetheless, we were able to wrap the author\u2019s code with GTTF: Namely, we replaced their line 63 in their train.py (direct link: https://github.com/chennnM/GCNII/blob/master/train.py#L63) with one that feeds an adjacency sampled from GTTF, and we re-ran their code. We used faounts=[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5] i.e. only 6 hops.

We are echoing your sections in our response.\n\n## Clarity\nWe understand the confusion -- wikipedia says there are multiple common usages of \u201ctensor\u201d, including vector field (physics), muscles (anatomy/medicine), and our intended usage: multi-dimensional array (deep learning). Therefore, to clarify to readers, we added a footnote in the introduction: \u201cTo disambiguate: by *tensors*, we refer to multi-dimensional arrays, as used in Deep Learning literature; by *operations*, we refer to routines such as matrix multiplication, advanced indexing, etc\u201d. \n\nThe accumulate function will almost certainly have side-effects, but has no return value. The text has a description of what the accumulate function does (second to last paragraph, of Section 3.2) and how it is specialized (Section 3.3). Nonetheless, we modified the pseudo-code comment for the AccumulateFn in the algorithm section to help readers who jump into the algorithm section prior to reading the text: \u201cfunction: with side-effects and no return. It is model-specific and records information for computing model and/or objective, see text\u201d -- you may review in the revised paper.\n\n\n## Significance\nThe form we analyze is common in the literature. We added a sentence after Prop3:\n\u201cThe above form of $\\mathcal{L}$ covers a family of contrastive learning objectives that use cross-entropy loss and assume a logistic or (sampled-)softmax distributions.\u201d\n\nIt is hard to do an analysis on the \u201cuniverse of all objective functions involving A or T\u201d Nonetheless, we just did back-of-the-envelope math on matrix factorization (decomposition) of $\\mathcal{T}^k$. It is also unbiased! Specifically, let $L = \\frac{1}{2} ||Q R - \\mathcal{T}^k||^2_F$ be the true objective with parameters $Q, R^\\top \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ and let $\\widehat{L} = \\frac{1}{2} ||Q R - \\widehat{\\mathcal{T}}^k||^2_F$ be an estimated objective where $\\widehat{\\mathcal{T}}^k$ is sampled using GTTF. We need to show that $\\mathbb{E}[\\partial  \\widehat{L} / \\partial Q] = \\partial L / \\partial Q$ and similarly for $R$. We know that $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial Q} = (QR - \\mathcal{T}^k) R^\\top$ and that $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial R} = Q^\\top (QR - \\mathcal{T}^k)$. It turns out, when analyzing $\\mathbb{E}[d  \\widehat{L} / d Q]$, we can push the expectation all the way onto $\\widehat{\\mathcal{T}}$:\n$\\mathbb{E}[\\partial \\widehat{L} / \\partial Q] = \\mathbb{E}[(QR - \\mathcal{T}^k) R^\\top] = (QR - \\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{T}^k]) R^\\top = (QR - \\mathcal{T}^k) R^\\top $\nWhere the last equality follows from Prop1 and the second-to-last follows from using linearity and scaling properties of expectation: https://www.randomservices.org/random/expect/Matrices.html. This can be extended to a linear combination of T^k (e.g. $\\sum_k c_k \\mathcal{T}^k$ and QR decomposition on adjacency A. We can add this analysis to the paper, if it gets accepted, as we would get a 9th page allowance."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper880/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper880/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Graph Traversal with Tensor Functionals: A Meta-Algorithm for Scalable Learning", "authorids": ["~Elan_Sopher_Markowitz2", "keshavba@usc.edu", "mehrnoom@usc.edu", "~Sami_Abu-El-Haija1", "~Bryan_Perozzi1", "~Greg_Ver_Steeg1", "~Aram_Galstyan1"], "authors": ["Elan Sopher Markowitz", "Keshav Balasubramanian", "Mehrnoosh Mirtaheri", "Sami Abu-El-Haija", "Bryan Perozzi", "Greg Ver Steeg", "Aram Galstyan"], "keywords": ["Graph", "Learning", "Algorithm", "Scale", "Message Passing", "Node Embeddings"], "abstract": "Graph Representation Learning (GRL) methods have impacted fields from chemistry to social science.

We could create a table showing the complexity of other algorithms, if you\u2019d like, to compare to GTTF (such as, other sampling methods or models implemented not under GTTF). In practice, GTTF is more useful for large datasets (as its runtime memory does not depend on size of graph) but we also wanted to highlight that it does not suffer accuracy even when applied to small datasets.\n * While the sampling in GTTF bears similarity to other sampling methods, there are significant differences. As mentioned in the related work section, GTTF additionally generalizes to node embedding methods whereas sampling methods we are aware of focus only on message passing methods. Also, not all sampling methods are unbiased (e.g. ClusterGCN). Second, GTTF\u2019s stochastic walk is implemented using fast vectorized operations, which were possible to implement given our Compact Adjacency. By customizing bias and accumulation functions, GTTF can recover both other sampling methods as well as other models. This is exemplified in how we recover the sampling from node2vec by modifying the bias function (Appendix C.1.2).

Our energy feeds on positive (and negative constructive) feedback, regardless of the final decision. Thank you, too, for the elaborate summary.\n\n## Minor Points \n\n * While similar to CSR format, Compact Adjacency is not the same. Namely, adjacency A is binary ({0, 1} entries) while CompactAdj stores node IDs ({0, \u2026, n} entries) . Nonetheless, your intuition is correct: it is much faster to store our Compact Adjacency matrix in CSR format as, when visiting a node, we want access to its neighbors which live in the same row. \n\n * Correct: the CompactAdj is built only once and stays fixed throughout training. Building it is linear in the edges (it takes  <1 second for small datasets, but up to a few minutes, for larger datasets). Our code has the option to cache it on disk (to save time when doing hyperparameter sweeps). For accumulation, the data structure is dependent on the algorithm being recovered and we will comment about the complexity of maintaining the data structure in the main paper (when we have more space). In the section you mention, the data structure is the true adjacency, but only marking edges visited during the walk forrest. Your guess is correct, our code maintains an adjacency list and converts at-once to a sparse matrix (to feed back into TensorFlow/PyTorch).\n\n * Reading your feedback here: you are spot on! We concede that our claim is misleading. Computing a single row of $T^k$ via repeated sparse matrix-vector multiplications can be accomplished in $\\mathcal{O}(mk)$. Therefore computation of all rows of $T^k$ using this approach takes $\\mathcal{O}(nmk)$. Thank you for pointing this out! We have corrected the text in the paper.\n\n## Typos\n\n * We fixed all typos. You may verify in the revised version uploaded above.

nice paper with wide range, suffering from a few problems", "review": "# Quality\n\nThis paper, as far as I can tell, is technically solid.\nThe authors present an algorithm, show how it can be specialized to a variety of other methods, then prove the conditions under which it estimates loss functions, gradients, and powers of transition matrices without bias.\nThey then demonstrate how their method can be used to approximate graph representation learning techniques over a variety of datasets, as well as enabling the application of non-scalable techniques to large graphs.\n\n# Clarity\n\nThis paper is mostly well-written, with a few issues throughout.\n\nOne issue I took was with the authors' use of the term \"tensor:\" they claim that their method allows for efficient implementation via standard tensor operations.\nThis was deceiving when first reading the paper: I expected this approach to involve tensors in the sense of a multilinear operator, and for operations to be understood in terms of that operator.\nThe approach in this paper doesn't resemble tensor methods in that way: it would be better described as graph representation learning with sparse edge lists.\n\nThere is also some ambiguity in Algorithm 1: it is unclear what AccumulateFn *does*.\nWithout thoroughly looking at the specific applications, it is not easy to tell what effect line 10 in Algorithm 1 has.\nIt would significantly improve readability to be specific about side-effects, return values, etc. of AccumulateFn in general.\n\n# Originality\n\nThis paper is somewhat original.\nThe authors do not formulate anything particularly new: rather, they unify a variety of algorithms for graph representation learning under a common approach, parameterized by two functions (Accumulate and Bias).\nThe algorithm in this paper takes very similar form to that written in the most popular GRL papers, so I would not evaluate it as being a particularly novel contribution.\n\nHowever, there is novel value in the analysis of the meta-algorithm as an unbiased estimator of loss functions dependent on powers of a transition matrix.\nThis is similar in spirit to the cited paper [Qui et al., 2018], where a link is made between these methods and matrix factorization techniques.\nHere, the authors have made a link between many methods and a general framework, from which they can form computationally efficient approximations.\n\n# Significance\n\nOne contribution of this work to the community is a \"unified look\" at a wide array of node embedding methods.\nThe authors have identified common features of approaches such as node2vec, DeepWalk, GCN, etc., and formulated a stochastic approach that is flexible enough to reflect each of these algorithms.\nI wouldn't characterize this formulation as inherently significant, since the form of all of these algorithms is written in a similar way.\n\nA more concrete contribution of this work is the analysis of this formulation as a computationally efficient (Propositions 6 and 7) approximator for powers of a transition matrix (Propositions 1 and 2), which has applications in many representation learning tasks.\nIt is established that using the proposed estimator of the transition matrix yields unbiased estimates and gradients for a class of loss functions (Propositions 3, 4, and 5).\n\nThis yields the most significant contribution of this paper: if a practitioner can write the loss function in the form provided in Proposition 3, the formulation of the authors can be justified as a good, computationally efficient approximant for their case.\nThis impact is demonstrated in the experiments using WYS, where the authors' form is shown to perform similarly to WYS on graphs of small scale, and then shown to be feasible on graphs of large scale, while the original form of WYS does not scale.\nThat is, the proposed framework appears to be a reasonable way to approximate methods that are not scalable, showing potential in bridging theory and practice.\n\nBeyond the special case where a method's loss function can be written in terms of a transition matrix raised to some power, though, this paper falls short.\nIt would be useful to understand the behavior of this approach when used to approximate methods that cannot be written in the form of Proposition 3.\nBecause of this, the scope of analysis in this paper is somewhat limited: the authors should more directly discuss cases where this is not true, beyond the brief mention of node2vec in the appendix.\n\n# Overall review\n\nThis paper takes a broad view of graph representation learning problems, proposing a generic algorithm that they show can recover many popular approaches.\nAlthough there are a few missing pieces, the proposed approach is useful in scaling approaches that were previously not scalable, and thus warrants being accepted into ICLR 2021.", "rating": "7: Good paper,
