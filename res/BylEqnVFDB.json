Below we address your concerns one-by-one. \n\n1, The complexity of the method:\nThe complexity of calculating the Ricci curvature exactly would require solving |E| LP problems but one could use approximation methods parallel computation which is much faster. Also, the curvature values are only computed once as a preprocessing step. We reported the computation time in the Appendix (A.4) of the revised version of our paper. Please also see the discussion with Reviewer #2.\n\nIn this paper, we mainly focused on the problem of node classification tasks in this paper, so the pooling layer is not necessary. For a graph classification task, as pooling would only reduce the size of the graph, we expect that the computation will be of the same scale as in our setting. For graph classification tasks, most graphs are of much smaller sizes; on these graphs, the computation of curvature can be done within seconds.\n\n2, Isolated nodes:\nThe curvature is defined on edges. For isolated nodes, there is no message passing with the rest of the graph. Thus curvature information is not relevant. In general, we run convolution for each connected component of the graph independently, although they share common filter parameters.\n\n3, Weight using kappa:\nThat is a good idea. We added the discussion to Appendix A.5. We report the suggested baseline using the curvature kappa_{xy} as weights for message passing in Table 5. As we observe, curvature alone cannot provide the best reweighting scheme for graph convolution. Only learning from the data helps us determine how weights on different channels should be dependent on kappa. In appendix A.5 (Figure 7), we also show for one example graph how tau_{xy} at different channels change according to kappa_{xy}. We observe weights of different channels are changing very differently w.r.t. kappa_{xy}; some are increasing w.r.t. kappa_{xy}, others are decreasing. MLP is necessary in learning such dependence from data. Using MLP enhances the model flexibility and model capacity. But also note that curvature kappa is the essential input that the MLP relies on. \n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper112/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper112/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["yeze16159@gmail.com", "kiliu@cs.stonybrook.edu", "tengfei.ma1@ibm.com", "jgao@cs.stonybrook.edu", "chao.chen.1@stonybrook.edu"], "title": "Curvature Graph Network", "authors": ["Ze Ye", "Kin Sum Liu", "Tengfei Ma", "Jie Gao", "Chao Chen"], "pdf": "/pdf/ebd5bb55274d158dbe408c51953238ae5a92b9e0.pdf", "abstract": "Graph-structured data is prevalent in many domains.

The complexity of the proposed model should be discussed. For a graph with V nodes and E edges, it seems that the authors need to solve E linear programming problems. The scale of each problem is decided by the number of neighbors per node. For large-scale graphs with dense connections, the scalability of the proposed method will be a problem. When the GCN models are with adaptive pooling layers, the curvature will change with respect to the layers of the model, and the scalability problem may become more serious. \n2. For the graphs with isolated nodes, do we need to calculate the curvature associated with such nodes? If yes, how to calculate?\n3. The authors introduce additional parameters to model the weight tau_{xy} from the curvature kappa_{xy}, i.e., Eq. (3.4). I wonder whether we can use kappa_{xy} directly as the weight tau_{xy} or not. It would be nice if the authors can add an experiment for this variant. \n\nOverall, I think the idea of the proposed method is interesting. Introducing Ricci curvature to GCN is a potential method to take advantage of structural information beyond the adjacency matrix.
