We claim that different meaningful aspects of the generated image can be intervened on independently in such a way, and our result on the CelebA support our claim surprisingly well.

We provide below answers to your main concerns.\n1.\tWhat is the causal estimand?\nVery good point, we clarified this in the revision by first defining unit-level counterfactuals in section 2 (Definition 2) and then introducing the hybridization operation as counterfactuals in section 3.1. Finally, the causal estimand (at the population level) is written in equation 1 and corresponds to the average absolute value of the unit level causal effect in the potential outcome framework.\n2.\tJustification for the number of clusters\n Assessing the optimal number of clusters is a notoriously difficult and still debated problem in unsupervised learning. We addressed it by quantifying the consistency of the labelling provided by the clustering algorithm, when it is trained on different but overlapping datasets. One benefit of such approach is that this analysis can be applied to any clustering approach, which allowed us to compare the performance of the classical k-means algorithm with respect to our NMF based approach. This is described in the revised section 4.1, and the results depicted on Fig. 5 (in the appendix) suggest using NMF with 3 clusters is a reasonable choice as the consistency drops strongly for 4 clusters. \n3.\tSubjective interpretation of the results\nAssessing objectively the performance of generative models is also still largely debated in the field. We have however performed quantitative analysis in this revision by investigating in Fig. 3 the magnitude of the causal effect as a function of the size of the modules that we create with clustering and intervene on. The results are interesting as they exhibit to some extent a linear dependency between the causal effect and the size of the cluster, that tends to become more complex for layers closer to the image.\n4.\tStrange layout\nWe reduced and moved the optics and related work sections to introduction.\n5.\tAbstruse Definition 1\nWe rewrote the Definition 1 and provided more extensive explanations below, however we could not see an easy way to lead with observed variables, as in our analysis (including new definition 2 and 5 and proposition 1), the mapping from latent space to observations is central. As we added in the comments below Definition 1, the present context is quite different from classical causality settings as we are given the whole generator architecture, so every variables, included latent ones can be observed by the user. In that context, emphasizing the deterministic mapping from the latent to the output variables seemed more natural to us.\n6.\tDeterministic mapping in structural equations\nIt is correct, the deterministic mapping plays a key role for our counterfactual analysis, and follows from the very definition of structural equation models. We clarified this after the Definition 1 and added reference to chapter 7 of Pearl, 2009, where structural equation are first introduced in a deterministic setting.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1555/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1555/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1555/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Tinkering with black boxes: counterfactuals uncover modularity in generative models", "abstract": "Deep generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and\nVariational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are important tools to capture and investigate\nthe properties of complex empirical data.

Here are concise replies to your concerns.\n1)\tYes the concept is consistent with counterfactual as defined by Pearl and with the potential outcome framework of Rubin. We added Definition 2 and 5 in order to precisely define counterfactuals and hybridization as a special case. Essentially, we based our framework on unit level counterfactuals (Pearl, 2014) consisting in: a) assigning the distribution of latent variables to a deterministic value obtained on a single sample of the latent variables (called unit in this framework). 2) intervening on one or several variables of the causal model. In the case of hybridization, the intervention consists in assigning to the output values of a subsets of channels in a layer to the value they take for another sample of the latent variables.\n2)\tWe updated Definition 1 and provided more explanations below. We now draw and explicit connection between disentanglement and interventions in the context of causal models with the newly introduced Proposition 1.\n3)\tWe described now rigorously hybridization as an intervention in section 3.1, for which we also improved and simplified the explanation.

Several issues have been raised by fellow reviewers as well. I think that they are not trivial and they regard key aspects like paper structure, quality of exposition and experimental analysis. I have detailed my initial opinion in response to the author request for more details.  I hope this will serve as useful  guidelines for improving the paper in the future. \n\n------------\nThe method tackles the problem of interpretability that is a very important issue for usually black-box deep networks. Unfortunately it is not very clear how is the achieved. I have read several times the part explaining the influence maps and the clustering based on them and it still doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I think that part has to be better justified and exposed. Moreover, results do not support the claim which makes me doubt even more about how effective the method proposed actually is.

The authors propose to examine modularity through the lens of interventions on the generative networks. After observing that the nodes within the generative network obey a deterministic relationship, they propose a proxy for intervention which takes samples and creates \u201chybrid\u201d samples by replacing the activation output of one sample with the others. Given the vast number of nodes that exist within a generative network, the authors propose a heuristic for choosing the nodes to perturb. \n\nI found the underlying premise of this paper to be very strong (identifying modularity in generative networks), however I think there is a substantial amount of work that should go into this paper before acceptance. While the authors begin by working within the framework of causal reasoning there is no mention of what the effect is that they are seeking to measure, i.e. what is the causal estimand here? The influence maps provide an intuitive answer to this, but not one that defines a clear estimand. I would like to see additional evaluation. The evidence provided largely leaves the reader to interpret results subjectively, rather than providing clear evidence. I was also uncomfortable with the selection on hyperparameters (3 clusters). It would be very nice to either have a selection criterion or show the sensitivity of the proposed methodology to other choices. \n\nOverall, I think this is an interesting idea in a very important area, but one that is not quite ready for publication.\n\nSome editorial comments:\n\nThe layout of this paper is slightly strange. After the introduction, the authors introduce the notion of disentanglement and lead with an example from optics. This motivation should either be moved to the introduction or removed. After the definitions the authors jump into a related work section that feels slightly disjointed from the previous section.\n\nI found definition 1 to be abstruse. In addition there are a couple of typos that should be addressed (\u201cconsists in a distribution\u201d \u2192 \u201cconsists of a distribution\u201d). It is non-standard to lead with the latent variables. I think it makes for a much easier narrative to describe the observed variables and structure first, before carrying on to the latent variables. Additionally, I believe you are stating an observation made by Pearl (2001) that after observing the noise variable, relationships become deterministic. This is slightly non-obvious from the wording used (and is also missing the proper reference).\n\nParens are missing from the following citation:\n\u201cgenerative models encountered in machine learning Besserve et al.
