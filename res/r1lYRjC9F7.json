Given this, it is not clear that it is necessary to reproduce this function using neural network generation of sounds.\n\nSynthesizing realistic audio from symbolic representations is a complex task. While there are many good sounding piano synthesizers, many of them fall well short of producing audio that would be a convincing substitute for a real piano recording. For example, the SoundFont technology referenced can only play particular samples for particular notes (with some simple effects processing). It is incapable of modeling complex physical interactions between different parts of the piano, such as sympathetic resonance, and is limited by the quality and variety of samples included with a particular font (for example, the ability to play longer notes is often achieved by simply looping over a section of a sample). That said, there are some piano synthesis systems that can do a good job of modeling these types of interactions, though they are not as widely available as SoundFonts and are difficult to create. For a good overview of the difficulties and successes in piano modeling, see the paper we cited by Bank et al. \n\nOur WaveNet model is able to learn to generate realistic-sounding music with no information other than audio recordings of piano performances, information which would be insufficient for the creation of a SoundFont or physics-informed model. The \u201cTranscribed\u201d WaveNet model clearly demonstrates this because we use only the audio from the dataset and we derive training labels by using our transcription model. By training on the audio directly, we implicitly model the complex physical interactions of the instrument, unlike a SoundFont.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that the WaveNet model recreates non-piano subtleties of the recording, including the response of the room, breathing of the player, and shuffling of listeners in their seats. These results are encouraging and indicate that such methods could also capture the sound of more dynamic instruments (such as string and wind instruments) for which convincing synthesis/sampling methods lag behind piano. To clarify this point, we have added a paragraph to the Piano Synthesis section of the paper.\n\nWe have also updated the paper to further demonstrate our ability to control the output sound by adding year conditioning. Different competition years within the MAESTRO dataset had different microphone placements (e.g., near the piano or farther back in the room), and by conditioning on year, we can control whether the output sounds like a close mic recording or one with more room noise. We present several audio examples in the online supplement: https://goo.gl/6RzHZM\n\n* The further limitation of the proposed approach seems to be the challenge of decoding raw music audio with chords, multiple overlaid notes or multiple tracks.  MIDI as a representation can support multiple tracks, so it is not necessarily the bottleneck.\n\nWe chose to model the music with full polyphony for a couple reasons. One is that, as described above, there are complex interactions in the physical piano and recording environment that would not be reproducible by rending notes separately and then layering them into a single output. Another is that the training data is presented as a single MIDI stream and the audio is not easily separated into multiple tracks.\n\n* How much does the data augmentation (audio augmentation) help?\n\nWe have added a table showing the differences between training with and without audio augmentation. In the process of analyzing these results, we realized that audio augmentation helps significantly when evaluating on the MAPS dataset (likely because the model is more robust to differences in recording environment and piano qualities), it actually incurs a slight penalty when evaluating on the MAESTRO test set. We have updated the paper with a discussion of these differences."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper917/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper917/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper917/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Enabling Factorized Piano Music Modeling and Generation with the MAESTRO Dataset", "abstract": "Generating musical audio directly with neural networks is notoriously difficult because it requires coherently modeling structure at many different timescales.

Having worked with this data I can almost swear that at least a portion of it (in particular, the data used here for test) sounds like live piano performance captured on Disklavier. Possibly I'm mistaken, but this is worth a double check.\n\nAccording to the PDF file that accompanies the MAPS dataset (\u201cMAPS - A piano database for multipitch estimation and automatic transcription of music\u201d): \u201cThese high quality files have been carefully hand-written in order to obtain a kind of musical interpretation as a MIDI file.\u201d We have updated the citation to point to this paper specifically to make things more clear. More information about the process is available on the website that contains the source MIDI files for MAPS: http://www.piano-midi.de/technic.htm\n\n* Referring to the triple of models as an auto-encoder makes me slightly uncomfortable given that they are all trained independently, directly from supervised data. \n\nThis is a very reasonable point, because there are no learned feature vectors in the latent representation (they come from labels). We have updated the text to instead refer to the model as a \u201cgenerative model with a discrete latent code of musical notes\u201d. We have kept the encoder/decoder/prior notation because it still seems appropriate. \n\n* The MAESTRO-T results are less interesting than they might appear at first glance given that the transcriptions are from train. The authors do clearly acknowledge this, pointing out that val and test transcription accuracies were near train accuracy. But maybe that same argument could be used to support that the pure MAESTRO results are themselves generalizable, allowing the authors to simplify slightly by removing MAESTRO-T altogether. In short, I'm not sure MAESTRO-T results offer much over MAESTRO results, and could therefore could be omitted. \n\nOur goal with the MAESTRO-T dataset was to clearly demonstrate that both the language modeling tasks (Music Transformer) and audio synthesis (WaveNet) can produce compelling results without having access to ground truth labels. We agree that using the train dataset does somewhat diminish this demonstration, but argue that it does more clearly demonstrate the usefulness of the \u201cWave2Midi2Wave\u201d process than just using ground truth labels. In future work, we plan to expand our use of these models to datasets that do not have ground truth labels. We have added to the conclusion to clarify this point.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper917/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper917/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper917/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Enabling Factorized Piano Music Modeling and Generation with the MAESTRO Dataset", "abstract": "Generating musical audio directly with neural networks is notoriously difficult because it requires coherently modeling structure at many different timescales.

As a result of the new dataset being nearly an order of magnitude larger than existing resources, each component model (with some additional tuning to increase capacity) yields impressive results, outperforming the current state-of-the-art on each component task. \nOverall, while the modeling advances here are small if any, I think this paper represents a solid case study in collecting valuble supervised data to push a set of tasks forward. The engineering is carefully done, well-motivated, and clearly described. The results are impressive on all three tasks. Finally, if the modeling ideas here do not, the dataset itself will go on to influence and support this sub-field for years to come. \nComments / questions:\n-Is MAPS actually all produced via sequencer? Having worked with this data I can almost swear that at least a portion of it (in particular, the data used here for test) sounds like live piano performance captured on Disklavier. Possibly I'm mistaken, but this is worth a double check.\n-Refering to the triple of models as an auto-encoder makes me slightly uncomfortable given that they are all trained independently, directly from supervised data. \n-The MAESTRO-T results are less interesting than they might appear at first glance given that the transcriptions are from train. The authors do clearly acknowledge this, pointing out that val and test transcription accuracies were near train accuracy. But maybe that same argument could be used to support that the pure MAESTRO results are themselves generalizable, allowing the authors to simplify slightly by removing MAESTRO-T altogether. In short, I'm not sure MAESTRO-T results offer much over MAESTRO results, and could therefore could be omitted. \n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper917/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Enabling Factorized Piano Music Modeling and Generation with the MAESTRO Dataset", "abstract": "Generating musical audio directly with neural networks is notoriously difficult because it requires coherently modeling structure at many different timescales.

The available techniques today for audio or music generation are not able to sufficient handle the many levels at which music needs to modeled.  The result is that while individual music sounds (or notes) can be generated at one level using tools like WaveNet, they don't come together to create a coherent work of music at the higher level.  The paper proposes to address this problem by imposing a MIDI representation (piano roll) in the neural modeling of music audio that serves as an intermediate (and interpretable) representation between the analysis (music audio -> MIDI) and synthesis (MIDI -> music audio) in the pipeline of piano music generation.  In order to develop and validate the proposed learning architecture, the authors have created a large data set of aligned piano music (raw audio along with MIDI representation).  Using this data set for training, validation and test, the paper reports on listening tests that showed slightly less favorable results for the generated music.  A few questions and comments are as follows.  MIDI itself is a rich language with ability to drive the generation of music using rich sets of customizable sound fonts.  Given this, it is not clear that it is necessary to reproduce this function using neural network generation of sounds.  The further limitation of the proposed approach seems to be the challenge of decoding raw music audio with chords, multiple overlayed notes or multiple tracks.  MIDI as a representation can support multiple tracks, so it is not necessarily the bottleneck.

The networks and the dataset together present a promising approach toward creating new expressive and interpretable neural models of music.", "keywords": ["music", "piano transcription", "transformer", "wavnet", "audio synthesis", "dataset", "midi"], "authorids": ["fjord@google.com", "astas@google.com", "adarob@google.com", "iansimon@google.com", "annahuang@google.com", "sedielem@google.com", "eriche@google.com", "jesseengel@google.com", "deck@google.com"], "authors": ["Curtis Hawthorne", "Andriy Stasyuk", "Adam Roberts", "Ian Simon", "Cheng-Zhi Anna Huang", "Sander Dieleman", "Erich Elsen", "Jesse Engel", "Douglas Eck"], "TL;DR": "We train a suite of models capable of transcribing, composing, and synthesizing audio waveforms with coherent musical structure, enabled by the new MAESTRO dataset.", "pdf": "/pdf/ced843930e16b6829293532407cbae254ab1a5af.pdf", "paperhash": "hawthorne|enabling_factorized_piano_music_modeling_and_generation_with_the_maestro_dataset", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nhawthorne2018enabling,\ntitle={Enabling Factorized Piano Music Modeling and Generation with the {MAESTRO} Dataset},\nauthor={Curtis Hawthorne and Andriy Stasyuk and Adam Roberts and Ian Simon and Cheng-Zhi Anna Huang and Sander Dieleman and Erich Elsen and Jesse Engel and Douglas Eck},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1lYRjC9F7},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper917/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234347295, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "r1lYRjC9F7", "replyto": "r1lYRjC9F7", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper917/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335832595, "tmdate": 1552335832595, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper917/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 9}
