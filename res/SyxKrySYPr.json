The experimental results look good, however, I have problems in understanding the motivation, the intuition of the proposed methods, the experimental design, and the general implication to the research community that is using the Transformer in their day-to-day research.\nFirst, the paper was based on the hypothesis of the authors that the Transformer is not stable, however, there is no comprehensive study on the unstability, and deep understanding on the root cause of it. It would be much more convincing to give a form definition of unstability and to add experimental study and theoretical analysis to the motivation part, instead of just based on a hypothesis.\n\nSecond, the proposal of the new structures (e.g., reordering the layer normalization, adding the gating layer) are quite ad hoc. There is not very solid motivation and theoretical analysis on why they could solve the unstable problem of the Transformer.  For example, by changing the order of layer normalization, there are direct identity mapping from the first layer to the last layer, making the information flow smoother. However, why this will make the Transformer more stable? The hypothesis and intuitive analysis are not very convincing. For another example, why replacing the residual connection with the gating layer can make the Transformer more stable? It seems to me that these are mostly heuristics, but not verified or strongly motivated solutions.\n\nThird, if the proposal is sound, it should not be effective only for reinforcement learning. It should be able to improve the performance or stability of the Transformer in general (e.g., in NLP tasks). However, there is no experiments and discussions regarding this.\n\nFourth, the experiments on the reinforcement learning is a little narrow, and many famous RL benchmarks and environments were not tested. This makes it unclear whether the proposed approach is generally effective.\n\n\n**I read the author responses, however, they do not really change my assessment on the paper.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1700/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1700/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Stabilizing Transformers for Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Emilio Parisotto", "Francis Song", "Jack Rae", "Razvan Pascanu", "Caglar Gulcehre", "Siddhant Jayakumar", "Max Jaderberg", "Rapha\u00ebl Lopez Kaufman", "Aidan Clark", "Seb Noury", "Matt Botvinick", "Nicolas Heess", "Raia Hadsell"], "authorids": ["eparisot@cs.cmu.edu", "songf@google.com", "jwrae@google.com", "razp@google.com", "caglarg@google.com", "sidmj@google.com", "jaderberg@google.com", "rlopezkaufman@google.com", "aidanclark@google.com", "snoury@google.com", "botvinick@google.com", "heess@google.com", "raia@google.com"], "keywords": ["Deep Reinforcement Learning", "Transformer", "Reinforcement Learning", "Self-Attention", "Memory", "Memory for Reinforcement Learning"], "TL;DR": "We succeed in stabilizing transformers for training in the RL setting and demonstrate a large improvement over LSTMs on DMLab-30, matching an external memory architecture.", "abstract": "Owing to their ability to both effectively integrate information over long time horizons and scale to massive amounts of data, self-attention architectures have recently shown breakthrough success in natural language processing (NLP), achieving state-of-the-art results in domains such as language modeling and machine translation.

The authors provide some explanations about why the reordering works, but they seem not intuitive. More analysis about why the reordering works would significantly enhance this paper. \n\nWe first want to reiterate that reordering the layer norm is not an original contribution of our work, as we cited in our paper it has been established in transformers previously [7][8] and earlier for convolutional networks [9]. A definitive reason for keeping the residual stream untransformed through depth still remains an open question. Our work empirically demonstrates that it provides substantial improvements in stability for RL domains which we believe, by itself, is an important contribution for others working in the field. See our answer to point (3-4) for a summary of a previously established hypothesis for why reordering normalization works.\n\n>Have you tried simply removing the layer normalization layer?\nAn initial experiment removing layer norm performed substantially worse, even on a shallow 4-layer transformer. \n\n> TrXL-I moves two layer-normalization layers together. Have you tried only moving one of them? Which modification contributes more?\nWhile this is definitely an interesting question, it is a convention to place the layer norm at the same place and due to the already substantial amount of computation time the ablations required, we were not able to test this. \n\n> Specific Points (3-4) \nWe believe our reasoning for reordering the layer norm operator largely follows the same lines as previous work examining normalization placement (see section 2 of [9]). Having an identity mapping (the skip connection in the residual connection) enables gradients to flow from any layer l to any shallower layer k<l untransformed, allowing an easier optimization as e.g. gradients can flow from the policy and value head outputs directly to the image encoder without any intermediate transformation. If the layer norm was placed after residual recombination, then during backpropagation the gradients at a shallower layer k<l are non-linearly transformed by the backwards pass of each layer m\u2019s layer norm, where k<m<l. \n\n[1] Recurrent Experience Replay in Distributed Reinforcement Learning.

We hope to address your concerns below:\n\n> Lack of experiments on benchmark and large environments... it is unclear whether the proposed transformer can scale to large environments\n\nWe want to highlight that DMLab-30 is a large-scale, multitask benchmark arguably more challenging than Atari-57, comprising 30 first-person, 3D environments with image observations. The tasks require a range of agent competencies such as language comprehension, navigation, handling of partial observability, memory, planning, and other forms of long horizon reasoning, with episodes lasting over 4000 steps. It has been used in a large number of previous works, see e.g. [1][2][3][4][5] for a subset, with the previous multitask state-of-the-art being [3]. With the substantial amount of previous work that went into obtaining high scores on the DMLab-30 suite as context, the GTrXL results we report in this paper are the highest so far obtained for this benchmark.\n\n> The authors did not evaluate their model on the widely used benchmark Atari-57.\n\nThe transformer is mainly a memory architecture and previous work has shown minimal improvement from using memory on Atari-57 (see e.g.in RND [6], on Montezuma\u2019s Revenge a feedforward CNN achieves scores close to a recurrent model). While the Atari-57 tasks themselves might not always be fully observable, they are not meant to test the memory of the agent. On the other hand, DMLab-30 was explicitly designed to require memory in order to solve it.\n\nDespite this, we have run the GTrXL on the Atari-57 suite. As in previous work, memory does not seem to play a large part in performance and there is no substantial improvement of the transformer over a baseline LSTM architecture. However, we can at least note that the GTrXL suffers no performance degradation on this set of environments, and that it shows stability comparable to an LSTM. \n\nAtari-57:\nModel  | Median Human Normalized Score  \nLSTM  | 136.6 +- 3.4 \nGTrXL | 137.1 +- 5.0 \n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1700/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1700/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Stabilizing Transformers for Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Emilio Parisotto", "Francis Song", "Jack Rae", "Razvan Pascanu", "Caglar Gulcehre", "Siddhant Jayakumar", "Max Jaderberg", "Rapha\u00ebl Lopez Kaufman", "Aidan Clark", "Seb Noury", "Matt Botvinick", "Nicolas Heess", "Raia Hadsell"], "authorids": ["eparisot@cs.cmu.edu", "songf@google.com", "jwrae@google.com", "razp@google.com", "caglarg@google.com", "sidmj@google.com", "jaderberg@google.com", "rlopezkaufman@google.com", "aidanclark@google.com", "snoury@google.com", "botvinick@google.com", "heess@google.com", "raia@google.com"], "keywords": ["Deep Reinforcement Learning", "Transformer", "Reinforcement Learning", "Self-Attention", "Memory", "Memory for Reinforcement Learning"], "TL;DR": "We succeed in stabilizing transformers for training in the RL setting and demonstrate a large improvement over LSTMs on DMLab-30, matching an external memory architecture.", "abstract": "Owing to their ability to both effectively integrate information over long time horizons and scale to massive amounts of data, self-attention architectures have recently shown breakthrough success in natural language processing (NLP), achieving state-of-the-art results in domains such as language modeling and machine translation.

We believe that supervised and reinforcement learning domains are sufficiently distinct (e.g. for RL: learning rate schedules being more difficult to tune, no regularization, gradient clipping having a larger effect, higher variance of the objective function, etc) and that focusing on only one of the domains is valid. We leave applying the gated transformer to supervised learning settings to future work.\n\n> the experiments on the reinforcement learning is a little narrow, and many famous RL benchmarks and environments were not tested\n\nBeyond DMLab-30, there are a very limited number of partially-observable reinforcement learning benchmarks where memory plays a critical role in performance, and that none of these reach the difficulty of multitask DMLab-30. Standard benchmarks such as Atari-57 and the Mujoco OpenAI gym environments do not make extensive use of memory (or are even fully observable), and applying the transformer there would not be informative. For further proof, we have run the GTrXL on Atari-57 and, as expected from previous work, the transformer\u2019s memory provides no substantial gain over a baseline LSTM agent.\n\nAtari-57:\nModel  | Median Human Normalized Score  \nLSTM  | 136.6 +- 3.4 \nGTrXL | 137.1 +- 5.0 \n\n\n[1] Recurrent Experience Replay in Distributed Reinforcement Learning.

These results were obtained over a large number of seeds and hyperparameter settings. Therefore the instability of the canonical transformer was not a hypothesis, it was repeatedly empirically demonstrated within our paper. We ask the reviewer to be more specific on what is insufficient about these results to make it not possible for us to claim that canonical transformers are unstable in RL domains. Beyond our own results, as referenced in the text, previous work [9] explicitly states a negative result when attempting to use a transformer for RL.\n\n> It would be much more convincing to give a form definition of unstability and to add experimental study and theoretical analysis to the motivation part, instead of just based on a hypothesis.\n\nOur paper is an empirically-driven study on using transformers in large-scale partially-observable RL environments, encompassing domains with high-dimensional observations and discrete, continuous and hybrid action spaces. Through a large number of experiments and ablations we propose a new gated variant of the transformer that is robust and easy to train (Sec. 4.3.2), and achieves the highest scores obtained so far on the DMLab-30 environment using less data than previous methods (Sec. 4.1) [1][2][3][4][5]. Our results are statistically significant, obtained over several seeds and hyperparameter settings. We believe it is unreasonable to discard these extensive empirical results only because there isn\u2019t a strict theoretical understanding of the architecture.\n\n> It seems to me that these are mostly heuristics, but not verified or strongly motivated solutions.\n\nIt is not clear that an improved architecture design needs theoretical insight as a prerequisite to being useful to the field, as even the original transformer paper does not present substantial theoretical results. Previous work which applied gating / multiplicative interactions in feedforward architectures and demonstrated significant empirical improvements had widespread impact to their respective fields [6][7][9][10].

We hope to address your concerns below: \n\n>DMlab-30 is still a relatively new environment suite and it is difficult to place the result of this paper in the context of broader work.\n\nWe will make more effort to better contextualize the DMLab-30 results that we reported and intend to expand this exposition in the next version of the paper. To summarize: (1) there has been significant previous work on improving scores on DMLab-30 (and subsets of the 30 levels), see e.g. [1][2][3][4][5] for a few works, and (2) our proposed architecture achieves the best scores so far reported on this benchmark and with better data efficiency, even reporting scores better than previous results where different models were trained on each of the 30 levels [1][2].\n\n> In addition, the comparison is against LSTM on a new objective. While Transformer is able to beat LSTM on the same objective, it is unclear whether that is a success of the objective or the architecture.\n\nWe want to highlight that the LSTM trained with the V-MPO objective is state-of-the-art for LSTM architectures on DMLab-30 over all RL algorithms reported so far, and we believe this provides evidence that the objective does not somehow unfairly bias improved performance only in transformer architectures. \n\n> In Numpad, the transformer architecture shows an improvement over LSTM, but no comparisons are made to any other memory-based agents.\n\nThe toy numpad environment was mainly to highlight that our model works much better than an LSTM even within partially-observable continuous control applications. \n\n> adequate theoretical understanding of architecture\n\nOur goal in this paper was not a theoretical understanding of the optimization stability of transformers and we make no claim towards that goal. Our goal was instead to (1) demonstrate that there is significant empirical instability when the canonical transformer is used in RL applications, and (2) propose a set of modifications which seem to alleviate instability, validated in a large-scale rigorous empirical study. We believe these results will be valuable to others who want to exploit the powerful memory capability of transformers in RL. Previous work that applied gating to feedforward architectures had a substantial impact on their respective fields without a formal theoretical understanding of why gating helps [6][7][8][9].\n\n> \u2026 the paper notes that gating mechanisms have been used to handle the vanishing gradients problem. The paper also notes that vanishing gradients is not an issue in transformers.\n\nWe believe the transformer\u2019s recent success on long-range modeling of temporal dependencies provides evidence that vanishing gradients are not an issue for transformers along the time axis. The gating mechanism we applied was along the depth axis, not time, and therefore we believe our statements were not in direct contradiction. \n\n[1] Recurrent Experience Replay in Distributed Reinforcement Learning.

Summary\nThis paper introduces architecture modifications for self-attention to stabilize transformers in reinforcement learning.\nThe new architecture, Gated Transformer-XL, replaces the order of the layer norm blocks to preserve an identity mapping.\nMultiple existing gating layers are proposed to replace the residual connections of transformer.\nThe new architecture is compared against MERLIN and LSTM on DMlab-30, and further ablation studies are done on Numpad and Memory Maze.\nIt is noted that they use the recent V-MPO objective to train LSTM and transformer.\nTheir results show that transformers are able to learn in memory-intensive environments, with some gating combinations surpassing LSTM.\n\n* Decision\nThis paper presents promising empirical results, however the experiments are limited, making it difficult to place in the broader work.\nIn addition, the contribution is incremental and not well-motivated.\nI would recommend a weak rejection.\nStill, I think the paper is well written and could be improved upon.\n\n* Reasons\nWhile the empirical results are impressive, they are not put into context.\nDMlab-30 is still a relatively new environment suite and it is difficult to place the result of this paper in the context of broader work.\nIn addition, the comparison is against LSTM on a new objective.\nWhile Transformer is able to beat LSTM on the same objective, it is unclear whether that is a success of the objective or the architecture.\nIn Numpad, the transformer architecture shows an improvement over LSTM, but no comparisons are made to any other memory-based agents.\nThe hyperparameter studies on Memory Maze also show improvements in memory-related tasks, but do not help in understanding of the proposed work.\n\nThe choice of architecture modification is also not well motivated.\nAs the paper mentions, initializing near identity has been shown to be important in the supervised learning literature.\nFor the topic of this paper however, I do not think this adequetly explains the instability of transformers in reinforcement learning.\nIn the related work section for example, the paper notes that gating mechanisms have been used to handle the vanishing gradients problem.\nThe paper also notes that vanishing gradients is not an issue in transformers.\nHence, it is unclear why gating would stabilize transformers for reinforcement learning.\n\nThe paper is overall well written and the ideas developed are clear.\nUnfortunately, the impressive results on DMlab are not sufficient for both the lack of deeper empirical study and better theoretical motivation for the architecture modifications.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures":

The authors demonstrate that Canonical Transformer is unstable. The authors introduce two modifications to the Canonical Transformer. The first is to move the layer normalization layer to the input stream. The second is to replace residual connections with gating layers. The experimental results show that (1) the first modification, i.e., moving the layer normalization layer to the input stream significantly stabilizes the training; (2) Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) gating seems to be most effective gating mechanism.\nMy decision is Weak Reject, considering the following aspects.\n\nPositive points: (1) The experiments seem solid. The authors have evaluated the overall performance, as well as hyperparameters, seeds, and ablations. (2) Moving the layer normalization layer to the input stream seems to be surprisingly effective. This could be an interesting finding. (3) The paper is well organized.\n\nNegative points: (1) Lack of experiments on benchmark and large environments. The authors did not evaluate their model on the widely used benchmark Atari-57. Also, it is unclear whether the proposed transformer can scale to large environments. (2) Lack of understanding of the layer normalization. The authors provide some explanations about why the reordering works, but they seem not intuitive. More analysis about why the reordering works would significantly enhance this paper. \n\nSpecific questions: (1) Have you tried simply removing the layer normalization layer? (2) TrXL-I moves two layer-normalization layers together. Have you tried only moving one of them? Which modification contributes more? (3) Could you provide more explanations about why the modification of the layer normalization layer works? (4) Have you experimentally validated the proposed hypothesis as to why the Identity Map Reordering, such as recording the evolution of the produced values in the submodules?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1700/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1700/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Stabilizing Transformers for Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Emilio Parisotto", "Francis Song", "Jack Rae", "Razvan Pascanu", "Caglar Gulcehre", "Siddhant Jayakumar", "Max Jaderberg", "Rapha\u00ebl Lopez Kaufman", "Aidan Clark", "Seb Noury", "Matt Botvinick", "Nicolas Heess", "Raia Hadsell"], "authorids": ["eparisot@cs.cmu.edu", "songf@google.com", "jwrae@google.com", "razp@google.com", "caglarg@google.com", "sidmj@google.com", "jaderberg@google.com", "rlopezkaufman@google.com", "aidanclark@google.com", "snoury@google.com", "botvinick@google.com", "heess@google.com", "raia@google.com"], "keywords": ["Deep Reinforcement Learning", "Transformer", "Reinforcement Learning", "Self-Attention", "Memory", "Memory for Reinforcement Learning"], "TL;DR": "We succeed in stabilizing transformers for training in the RL setting and demonstrate a large improvement over LSTMs on DMLab-30, matching an external memory architecture.", "abstract": "Owing to their ability to both effectively integrate information over long time horizons and scale to massive amounts of data, self-attention architectures have recently shown breakthrough success in natural language processing (NLP), achieving state-of-the-art results in domains such as language modeling and machine translation.
