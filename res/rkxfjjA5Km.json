We offers a promising general framework through the latent variable $Z$. The pros and cons compared to the other alternative deep learning frameworks are waiting to be further investigated. \n\n1. We added section 3.1 to provide theoretical justification for the existence of latent variable $Z$ for any $X$ from non-degenerate distributions (continuous or categorical).  For the continuous $X$, we provide Lemma 1 and its proof in section 3.1.  \nWe also provide examples and a new graph Figure 1 to illustrate the relationship the latent Z and X in Hidden Markov Random Field .  We also added more conceptual explanation for our framework in section 3.2. \n\n2. We split the original introduction section into two sections, add more conceptual explanation of the Model-X knockoff, and provide summary of contributions in paragraph 2. \n\n3. We moved the proof of theorem 3.3 (previous theorem 2.2) to appendix A. We added a remark after the theorem 3.3.  In the remark we clarifies the limitation of the current theory in FDR guarantee, when the rate a_n in theory 3.3 is not guaranteed.  \n(See our further discussion with Reviewer 3 in the forum that even a_n rate is larger than n^{-1/2}, with a larger training sample size of X than the sample size of (X,Y), our method still can achieve FDR guarantee.)\n\n4. We added a section 4 Goodness of Fit to give a comprehensive description for how to validate deep learning generated knockoffs in practice.  We also propose a way to check the model fitting for our framework is to check X-\\hat{f}(\\tilde{Z}) is mutually independent. Some preliminary results of graphical check of this goodness of fit diagnostic is included in appendix C.\n\n5. We moved the implementation details of the simulations to appendix B. We changed the titles the simulation figures for clarity. \n\n6. We revised the discussion section. We moved the previous discussion about independence check to section 4 goodness of fit. We briefly discussed about how our current implementations performed with the graphical check. We added some discussion about the emerging other framework of Deep knockoff Generator in discussion section and further clarifies the unique contribution of our framework to this emerging subfield of representative learning.\n\nWe would like to mention that there is a submission of another paper on using deep learning to generate Knockoff for ICLR 2019, entitled 'KnockoffGAN: Generating Knockoffs for Feature Selection using Generative Adversarial Networks'.  The two papers although used different deep generative models, but are comparable in contribution, experiment results and judging the interests of ICLR attenders in this new topic. \n\nWe hope these revisions would resolve the previous concerns and facilitate a favorable decision of our work.\n\nThanks\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper602/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper602/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper602/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Auto-Encoding Knockoff Generator for FDR  Controlled Variable Selection", "abstract": "A new statistical procedure (Cande\u0300s,2018) has provided a way to identify important factors using any supervised learning method controlling for FDR.

Response for concerns with Theorem 3.2\nZ is a latent variable that exists but not observed.\n\\tilde Z is the variable generated from the conditional distribution Z|X, thus (\\tilde Z|X) and (Z|X) have the same distribution, i.e. p(\\tilde Z|X)= P(Z|X). Therefore we have\n1). the joint distribution of (X, Z) and (X, \\tilde Z) are also the same since p(X, Z)=p(X)p(Z|X).\n2). the marginal distribution of $\\tilde Z$ and $Z$  are the same since p(Z)=\\int _x p(x, Z) d F_X(x)\n3). The conditional distributions of  X|\\tilde{Z} and X|Z is the same based on 1) and 2), since p(X|Z)=p(X, Z)/p(Z).\n\nIn the current proof of Theorem 3.2, we skipped the above steps to justify that the right-hand side of the first equation in the proof is equal to that with all the Z's changed to \\tilde Z.  Thanks for pointing that out, we would make Theorem 3.2 more easy to digest when we got the chance to submit the final revision. \n\nWe think Theorem 3.2 itself is a contribution of this paper. It characterizes the key for the latent knockoff generation framework to work is the components of X need to be mutually independent given Z, i.e.  p(X_1,...X_p|Z)= p(X_1|Z)*p(X_2|Z)*...*p(X_p|Z).  This conditional independence is needed in proof for the equality between line 1 and line 2, where we factored P_{X|Z} into P_{X_j|Z} * P_{X_{-j}|Z}.\n\nWe agree X->\\tilde{Z}->\\tilde{X} is a Markov chain. However, that is not a sufficient criterion for \\tilde{X} is a knockoff of X. \n\n\n2. Response for a_n in Theorem 3.3\nIn the provided rate for Theorem 3.3, the asymptotic convergence of FDR needs a_n ~ o(n^{-1/2}).\nFor the nonparametric rate of a_n~ O(n^{-1/3}) or parametric rate a_n~ O(n^{-1/2}, they are too large for the bound of Theorem 3.3 to converge to q.\nHowever, this does not mean our framework cannot control for FDR in practice.\n\nIn practice, the distribution of X is usually estimated with a much larger sample size than the number of samples with the complete observation of both X and Y.  (refer to the original Model-X paper (Candes 2018)).\nDenote N to be the number of data used to estimate the working models (for which we observed X, but may not have Y). \nAnd denote n to be the sample size of complete pairs of (X,Y), which is used for variable selection.\nAssume a_n ~ O(N^{-b}), with some b>0. \n\nThen we just need O(N^{-b}) ~ o(n^{-1/2}) to guarantee FDR bound converge to q. This is not hard to achieve when we can collect X more easily than collecting Y. \n\nThanks for pointing out. We would revise Theorem 3.3 and its remark to reflect this point when we can submit another revision.\n\nWe hope these responses resolve the concerns and let us know if further explanation is needed.\n\nThanks much."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper602/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper602/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper602/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Auto-Encoding Knockoff Generator for FDR  Controlled Variable Selection", "abstract": "A new statistical procedure (Cande\u0300s,2018) has provided a way to identify important factors using any supervised learning method controlling for FDR.

Notice that in the previous version, we include some of the discussion in the discussion section.  In this revision we expand this in to a more comprehensive description and  discussion, we also include some numerical results in Appendix C.\n\nThere are two approaches to validate the knockoffs.  One evaluation approach proposed by Candes 2018,  is to estimate the empirical FDR for simulated $Y$ and $X$ of the real data, and compare the power and FDR control performance of knockoffs from various generator. Then it will provide confirmation for domain scientist that if the true signal is similar to the simulated settings, the FDR is controlled.\n The other approach proposed by a most recent preprint (omitted the name for double blinded review purpose), is to compose some goodness of fit metrics based on the distributional discrepancy between $(X,\\tilde{X})$ and $(X,\\tilde{X})_{swap}$.   Both approaches offer tools to compare and choose the best knockoff generator for each specific real data applications. To further fill in the gap between theory and practice, new Robust knockoff theories need to be further investigate to link these empirical goodness of fit metrics with bound to FDR.\n\nAnd in addition to the metrics shared with the other knockoff generators, our framework has an unique measurement for goodness of fit, which is that $X|Z$ are independent. Specifically, if the $q_\\epsilon$ is assumed to be additive error, i.e. $\\tilde{X_j} = \\hat{f_j}(\\tilde{Z})+\\epsilon_j$. The mutual independence of the residuals $X-\\hat{f}(\\tilde{Z})$, which is the difference of  the real data $X$ and its fitted means,  indicate good model fitting.\n\nPlease refer to the revised section 3, 4, 7 and appendix C. for  expanded explanation of this point.\n\nThanks,\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper602/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper602/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper602/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Auto-Encoding Knockoff Generator for FDR  Controlled Variable Selection", "abstract": "A new statistical procedure (Cande\u0300s,2018) has provided a way to identify important factors using any supervised learning method controlling for FDR.

Both numerical simulations and real-data experiments are provided to corroborate the proposed method.   Although the problem of generating knockoffs based on VAE is novel, the paper presentation is not easy to follow and the notation seems confusing. Moreover, the main idea of this paper seems not entirely novel. The proposed method is based on combining the analysis in ''Robust inference with knockoffs'' by Barber et. al. and the VAE. '' \n\nResponse:\nWe summarized the contributions at the second paragraph of introduction section of the revision.\nOur main contribution is to provide a practical method to generate knockoffs. While writing and revising this paper, there are 2 other works on deep knockoff generators. One is based on GAN and the other is based on Generalized Moment Matching. We think the novelty of this work is comparable with these works and it remains for future investigation on systematic comparison of these methods.\n \nDetailed comments:\n1. ``The presentation of the main results is a bit short. Section 2, the proposed method, only takes 2 pages. It would be better to present the main results with more details. ''\nResponse: \nThanks for the comment. For the readers to digest the idea of the paper, we have extended the presentation of the methods into 4 pages (excluding numerical results) in the revision. We added more motivation for the proposed framework and include a figure of Hidden Markov Random Field as a general example where a latent $Z$ can help generating $X$.  Section 3.1 to showed the existence of $Z$. Section 4 to explain the general strategy to evaluate generated knockoffs.\n\n2. ``The method works under the assumption that there exists a random variable $Z$ such that $X_j$'s are mutually independent conditioning on $Z$. Is this a strong assumption? It seems better to illustrate when this assumption holds and fails.''\n\nResponse:\nThanks for the comment. We now added section 3.1 to discuss this in details.  In summation, the latent $Z$ always exist for non-degenerate $X$.  We illustrate a lot of examples as well provide Lemma 3.1 to justify the existence of Z.\n\n3. ``The notation of this paper seems confusing. For example, the authors did not introduce what $(X_j, X_{-j}, \\tilde X_j, \\tilde X_{-j} )$ means. Moreover, in Algorithm 1, what is $\\hat \\theta$ and $\\hat f$.\"\nResponse:\nWe now have added more explanation for the notations. We moved the notation explanation that appears inside Algorithm 1 to a separate paragraph: paragraph 4 section 3.2.\n\n4. ``I think there might be a typo in the proof of Theorem 2.1. In the main equation, why $\\tilde Z$ and $\\tilde X$ did not appear? They should show up somewhere in the probabilities.\"\nResponse:\nWe did not find a typo in the proof of Theorem 2.1 (now 3.2). \\tilde X does appear as \\tilde X_j and \\tilde X_{-j};  We considers \\tilde Z  from distribution of Z|X, and argues that \\tilde X generated from X|Z, with Z take the value of the generate \\tilde Z, satisfies the knockoff's definition.\n\n5.`` In Theorem 2.2, how strong is the assumption that $\\sup_{z,x} | log (density ratio)| $ is smaller than $\\alpha_n$? Usually, we might only achieve nonparametric rate for estimating the likelihood ratios. But here you also take a supremum, which might sacrifice the rate. The paper suggested that $\\alpha_n$ can be o( (n \\log p)^{-1/2}). When can we achieve such a rate?\"\nResponse: \nWe clarified the limitation of Theorem 3.3 (previous 2.2) as a remark and moved the proof to the appendix. We also discussed further about the limitation of Theoretical guarantee for deep knockoff generators in section 7 and the alternative solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper602/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper602/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper602/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Auto-Encoding Knockoff Generator for FDR  Controlled Variable Selection", "abstract": "A new statistical procedure (Cande\u0300s,2018) has provided a way to identify important factors using any supervised learning method controlling for FDR.

Moreover, the main idea of this paper seems not entirely novel. The proposed method is based on combining the analysis in ''Robust inference with knockoffs'' by Barber et. al. and the VAE.  \n\nDetailed comments:\n\n1. The presentation of the main results is a bit short. Section 2, the proposed method, only takes 2 pages. It would be better to present the main results with more details. \n\n2. The method works under the assumption that there exists a random variable $Z$ such that $X_j$'s are mutually independent conditioning on $Z$. Is this a strong assumption? It seems better to illustrate when this assumption holds and fails.\n\n3. The notation of this paper seems confusing. For example, the authors did not introduce what $(X_j, X_{-j}, \\tilde X_j, \\tilde X_{-j} )$ means. Moreover, in Algorithm 1, what is $\\hat \\theta$ and $\\hat f$. \n\n4. I think there might be a typo in the proof of Theorem 2.1. In the main equation, why $\\tilde Z$ and $\\tilde X$ did not appear? They should show up somewhere in the probabilities.\n\n5. In Theorem 2.2, how strong is the assumption that $\\sup_{z,x} | log (density ratio)| $ is smaller than $\\alpha_n$? Usually, we might only achieve nonparametric rate for estimating the likelihood ratios. But here you also take a supremum, which might sacrifice the rate. The paper suggested that $\\alpha_n$ can be o( (n \\log p)^{-1/2}). When can we achieve such a rate?\n\n6. Novelty. Theorem 2.2 seems to be an application of the result in Barber et. al. Compared with that work, this paper seems to use VAE to construct the distribution $ P_{\\tilde X| X}$ and its analysis seems hinges on the assumptions in Theorem 2.2 that might be stringent.\n\n7.

The basic idea is to exploit ideas from variational autoencoders to create a generic knockoff generation mechanism. Specifically, the main idea of the paper is to map the input covariates X into latent variable Z using a variational auto-encoder, generate the knockoffs \\tilde{Z} in the latent space, and then map \\tilde{Z} back to the input space to get the knockoffs \\tilde{X}. The authors claim that their contribution in threefold: \n\n(1) Given the assumption is valid that X is mutually independent conditional on Z, the generated knockoffs \\tilde{X} is proved to be valid in terms of satisfying the necessary swap condition. \n\n(2) Given (1) holds, and given that the discrepancy (measured by KL-divergence) between the true conditional probability Q(Z|X) and its estimate using variational auto-encoder is bounded by o((nlogp)^{-1/2}), the FDR is also bounded.\n\n(3) The proposed knockoffs generating procedure can achieve controlled FDR and better power. \n\nIn agreement with the above intuition, I have major concerns about the correctness of the paper.\n\nThe cornerstone of the proof in contribution (1) relies on the assumption that X is mutually independent conditional on Z. However, this assumption is invalid if there are dependencies between x_i and x_j. Therefore, the proposed knockoffs \\tilde{X} cannot be proved valid by Theorem 2.1.\n\nThe erroneous proof in contribution (1) leads to the failure of contribution (2) stated in Theorem 2.2. The FDR is no longer controlled. Intuitively, according to algorithm 1, \\tilde{Z} and \\tilde{X} are expected to have the same distribution as Z and X, respectively; therefore, the FDR cannot be controlled.\n\nThe experimental results are suspicious. In general, it seems fishy that the proposed VAE approach outperforms Model X in the fully Gaussian case.  In this setting, Model X should have an advantage, since it is specifically designed for Gaussian generated data.  Related to this, the text is confusing: \"Since the data were not Gaussian, the second-order matching method has the lowest power.

I will write the formal point to point response latter. However, I found there is a major concern for the theoretical results about the proof of contribution (1) that I want to discuss ahead and  to make sure we understand the concern. \n\n\"The cornerstone of the proof in contribution (1) relies on the assumption that X is mutually independent conditional on Z. However, this assumption is invalid if there are dependencies between x_i and x_j. Therefore, the proposed knockoffs \\tilde{X} cannot be proved valid by Theorem 2.1.\"\n\nEven if two variables X_i and X_j are not independent. Conditional on Z, X_i and X_j can be independent. \nFor example, Z is a standard normal variable,  e1 and e2 are two independent error variables (e1 and e2 are independent, and they are independent of Z).  Generate  X_1=Z+ e1, X2=Z+e2.  Then X_1 and X_2 are independent conditional on Z.   \n\nOur proposed method relies on 'X_i is independent of X_j conditional on Z'.    Indeed we are using the VAE for approximate the latent Z that de-correlates X's.  There are some works in pre-prints that actually point out in the informatics theory, VAE is targeting to find the Z that de-correlates X. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05822.pdf\n\nDoes this clarification solve the concern about 1)?  \n\nAdmittedly, we should move the proofs to the appendix and so to have  a longer introduction and results discussion. Sorry for the confusion it caused.\nFor the major concerns about our simulation results.  'In this setting, Model X should have an advantage, since it is specifically designed for Gaussian generated data.' I understand this sentence as describing the Fixed X Knockoff method in Barber 2014.  It is proposed for Gaussian outcomes with fixed X. \n'Since the data were not Gaussian, the second-order matching method has the lowest power.' We wanted to express is that the X's in this setting are not generated from Gaussian distribution, but the model X (with second order matching) is proposed for X that generated from Gaussian distribution.\n'The assumptions of the Fixed knockoff generations holds for the Gaussian cases, \u2026\" is to say the Fixed-X method is proposed for when the outcomes are generated from Gaussian. (linear regression models) Sorry for the confusion.\n\n We will revise for a better  presentation of the paper.  And meanwhile, I would appreciate your letting us know if I have misunderstood your concerns and if there are other concerns you may have for our paper.\n\nThanks.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper602/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper602/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper602/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Auto-Encoding Knockoff Generator for FDR  Controlled Variable Selection", "abstract": "A new statistical procedure (Cande\u0300s,2018) has provided a way to identify important factors using any supervised learning method controlling for FDR.
