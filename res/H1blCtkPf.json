The key difference from past work is that this paper assumes no access to \"skill tags\", which indicate what skills a particular question needs to be solved. Instead, these \"skill tags\" are learned by the model. I think this is a cool problem, but the paper is hard to understand; in particular, design decisions such as constraining the learned tag matrix to binary are not properly motivated, and there are no qualitative comparisons to learned tags. Overall, I hope the authors can spend more time explaining why they built their model the way they did in future versions of the paper; as is, I cannot recommend its acceptance.\n\ndetailed comments:\n- Please give more explanation as to what exactly knowledge tracing is (i.e., with an example showing skill tags etc.). Currently, the introduction is very hard to follow (what does a skill tag look like? what are\"question-space\" and \"tag-space\" answers?)\n- Please explain Figure 1 in the caption, or at least a high-level overview of what I'm supposed to take away from the figure. \n- Why is it desirable to have a binary tag matrix? For interpretability? It seems like there is no reason to enforce this binary constraint since you do not have ground-truth tag labels... If you didn't have the binary constraint, couldn't you just put attention over a real-valued matrix and interpret the attention weights?\n- What do you mean by \"binarize it to 0 or 1 on a certain condition\"? What is this condition? \n- Do not understand Figure 3; what am I supposed to learn from it? How can I conclude that the learned tags are \"more hierarchical\" from these graphs?\n- How do the learned tags qualitatively compare to the human ones? This seems like the main motivation of the paper: to show that we can learn tags that are as interpretable as human ones (otherwise why use a binary matrix)?", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "End-to-End Deep Knowledge Tracing by Learning Binary Question Embedding", "abstract": "Recent advancements in computer-assisted learning systems have increased the research of knowledge tracing, which estimates student proficiency.

In this context, the method called Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) shows remarkable performance; however, existing DKT requires human labeling of required skills to solve a question. This limits the optimization of modeling student proficiency and application to real-world data, which are often not well-organized. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end DKT model, which does not depend on any human labeling. Using two datasets, we empirically validated that the learned tags show the same or better performance on DKT and have an information-efficient structure.
