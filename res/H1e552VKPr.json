The attention basically subsamples subtrees so that each node can have the same number of attention candidates. Then, we can the attention network as many other papers.

We have added new baseline algorithms GAM and CapsGNN for graph classification in Table 3. We have also improved the graph classification performance of SubGattPool by adding L2 and dropout regularizers on the pooling layers.  In Table 3, SubGattPool performs the best on the first four datasets and for the last two datasets, GIN and SubGattPool perform better than the other baselines. So overall, the performance of SubGattPool turns out to be the best or highly competitive over all the state-of-the-art graph classification algorithms. We have also updated the published code of SubGattPool to ensure the reproducibility of the results.\n\n2. There was some confusion in the information provided in the description of the datasets for graph classification in Table 1b. We have updated them appropriately.\n\n3. We have added a new section A.2 in the Appendix to discuss the node classification performance of SubGatt and comparison on the publicly available node splits of the datasets, as asked by Reviewer #4.\n\nAs asked by Reviewer #4, we have also added the graph classification results in the set up used in GIN, in the respective comment section."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper124/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper124/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["sambaran.ban89@gmail.com", "manasvia@iisc.ac.in", "mnm@iisc.ac.in"], "title": "Subgraph Attention for Node Classification and Hierarchical Graph Pooling", "authors": ["Sambaran Bandyopadhyay", "Manasvi Aggarwal", "M.

However, the focus of the paper was not to test multiple attention mechanisms, but to show the importance of attention over the subgraphs for node and graph classification.

The concept of subgraph attention is proposed in a generic sense, and can be applied for both node and graph representation. Whereas, intra and inter level attention mechanisms are specific to hierarchical graph classification purpose. So subgraph attention is independent of intra and inter level attention mechanisms. However, inter-level attention is an attention mechanism over the output of intra-level attention of different levels in the hierarchical architecture of SubGattPool. All these 3 types of attention mechanisms are proposed in this work.\n\n15% training size in MUTAG dataset leads to only 28 graphs in the training set. We are still able to produce reasonably good performance because of the two reasons. First, the number of parameters to learn in SubGattPool is small compared to many GNN based graph classification algorithms, as discussed in the last paragraph of Section 4. Hence training the SubGattPool network with a small number of graphs is possible. Second, each graph has multiple nodes and edges, and SubGattPool also exploits the structure of each graph in its learning.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for bringing the point on the experiment with max subgraph size (T). When T=1, there is only one possible subgraph (i.e., rooted subtree of size 1) \u2018a\u2019 for any node \u2018a\u2019. Thus, it does not make sense to consider this case.\n\nPlease note, T denotes the maximum size of a subgraph selected in SubGatt. So, a candidate subgraph can have length from 1 to T in that case. Thus, it is possible that the set of subgraphs with high attention values are the same for two different values of T (for e.g., when T=3 and when T=4). Hence, with the increasing subgraph size T, the performance may not always improve.\n\nHowever, to see the improvement of considering the attention mechanism over subgraphs, rather than only the immediate neighboring nodes, please compare the performance of GAT and SubGatt in Table 2 for node classification.\n\nFigure 3 shows the complete set of graphs in MUTAG dataset. We used 80% of the graphs to train the algorithms and then show the final representations (for e.g., the output of inter-level attention for SubGattPool) of all the graphs using t-SNE.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper124/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper124/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["sambaran.ban89@gmail.com", "manasvia@iisc.ac.in", "mnm@iisc.ac.in"], "title": "Subgraph Attention for Node Classification and Hierarchical Graph Pooling", "authors": ["Sambaran Bandyopadhyay", "Manasvi Aggarwal", "M.

Please note that the subgraphs selected can have different sizes. The only restriction is that the maximum size of any subgraph (or the length of a rooted subtree) is a hyper-parameter and fixed. The novelty of the work lies in the design of a subgraph attention mechanism which is proposed for the first time in the graph representation literature. Also, our graph classification architecture, which consists of the subgraph attention, intra-level attention and inter-level attention is another novel aspect of the paper. We also conduct a short ablation study in Section 5.3 to show the effect of these components for graph representation.\n\nTo address Point 1 of R#4, we do NOT sample a subset of nodes from one hop neighborhood of a node. Rather, we sample a subset of subgraphs (in the form of rooted subtrees as discussed in Section 3.1) for each node. The self-attention is also computed over the set of subgraphs. In GAT, the self attention is calculated on the set of neighbor nodes. Please note, computing attention scores over the immediate neighbors and use neighborhood feature aggregation in multiple layers can capture weighted information beyond the immediate neighborhood, but the propagated features would be corrupted due to information aggregation in multiple stages. We also explain this in the second paragraph of Section 1 with the help from Figure 1. For example, the attributes of node \u2018c\u2019 cannot be propagated as it is to node \u2018a\u2019 in a GAT/GCN type of framework, because of the intermediate attribute aggregation (averaging) happened at node \u2018b\u2019 in Figure 1.\n\n\nTo address Point 2 of R#4, our node classification experimental setting is different from GCN or GAT papers. As explained in Section 5.1 of the paper, we use 80% of the total node labels for training the algorithms and remaining 20% for testing. Further, 10% of the training set is used as validation. The splits are made randomly. We conduct all the experiments 10 times and reported the mean and standard deviation of classification accuracy on the test sets for all the algorithms. Similarly, experiments on graph classifications are also conducted over multiple splits. This set up also evaluates the robustness of different algorithms for node and graph classification. Same splits are used for the baselines and our proposed algorithms to ensure fairness.\n\nHowever, as suggested by the reviewer, we will update the results on the set up used in GCN and GAT for node classification within the author rebuttal period. For graph classification, mean accuracy and standard deviation based on 10-fold cross validation are reported in the GIN paper.\n\n\nTo address Point 3 of R#4, we agree that SubGattPool is not always the best performing graph classification under all the training sets. But, overall its performance is competitive and often better on most of the datasets. Standard deviation on the performance of SubGattPool is also less or comparable to other baselines, which shows the stability of the algorithm. Also note that the selected baseline algorithms, such as DIFFPOOL, GIN and SAGPool are all recently proposed and state-of-the-art GNN based graph classification algorithms.\n\n\nTo address Point 4 of R#4, we are not sure about the architecture the reviewer meant by GCN+GAT. GAT uses self attention over the immediate neighborhood and then does neighborhood feature aggregation. The second part is similar to GCN. So we are not sure if the reviewer indicates GAT by GCN+GAT. We have compared the performance of SubGatt with GAT and GCN in Table 2 of the paper."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper124/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper124/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["sambaran.ban89@gmail.com", "manasvia@iisc.ac.in", "mnm@iisc.ac.in"], "title": "Subgraph Attention for Node Classification and Hierarchical Graph Pooling", "authors": ["Sambaran Bandyopadhyay", "Manasvi Aggarwal", "M.

The proposed method gives an attention to a subgraph instead of a node by which importance can be controlled as a set of nodes. Further, the authors also introduce two types of attention in the hierarchical structure of the network called intra- and inter- level attention.\n\nConsidering subgraph attention would be novel and a reasonable idea. The sampling-based approach is a bit naive though it would be easy to implement. Reliability of some results are not clear for me because of the small training set.\n\nThe intra- and inter- attention approach would be a reasonable, but the relation with subgraph attention is not mentioned in my understanding. These two are independent approaches? Nothing is related to each other?\n\nThe MUTAG dataset has only 188 graphs, and so, in the smallest case in Table 3, the training data only contains 188*0.15 = 28.2 graphs. For me, learning an attention neural network with less than 30 sample is difficult to evaluate. Is there any rationale that the proposed method works on such a small dataset?\n\nIn sensitivity analysis in A.1, the performance on different max subgraph size (T) is shown, and the change of the performance is moderate. One of the main claims of the paper is that considering a subgraph (not a node) increases the performance. This results does not show the increase of the performance with the increase of the subgraph size T.

Compared to the previous graph attention layer, the node in the graph attends to its subgraph. The subgraph is represented by an aggregated feature representation with a sampled fixed-size subgraph. The methods are evaluated on both node classification and graph classification problems.\n\nI have major concerns about the novelty, and experiments in this work.\n\n1. The motivation is not clear. Using a subgraph or neighborhood to represent a node is reasonable. However, this work samples a subset of nodes from the one-hop neighborhood and aggregates them for attention mechanism. It is very similar to a GCN + GAT. The sampling process even loses some neighborhood information in the graph.\n\n2. The experimental setups are very strange. In Table 2, the methods are compared to GCN and GAT on node classification problems. The performance of GAT is too low and even lower than that reported in GAT. Can authors explain this? It is highly recommended to use the same experimental settings as in GCN and GAT. The same problem exists in Table 3. Can authors provide a performance comparison based on the same settings in GIN?\n\n3. The performance improvements are very unstable and marginal. In Table 3, the proposed methods can not compete with previous methods especially on large datasets like IMDB-MULTI. I wonder how the proposed methods perform on very large datasets such as reddit.\n\n4. Can authors provide comparisons with a simple GCN+GAT?
