It is empirically competitive, but this insensitivity places a strong upper bound on its performance. The paper does make this clear, but it seems salient enough to warrant a brief mention in the introduction or discussion sections.\nA: We have added the discussion about the word order insensitivity in the analysis of experiment results in the updated version.\n\nQ: If I understand correctly, your attention strategy is based more closely on the general/bilinear strategy of Luong et al. '15 than it is on the earlier Bahdanau work. You should probably cite the former (or some other more directly relevant reference for that strategy).\nA: We have cited Luong et al. '15's work stead in the description of attention layer.\n\nQ: Since the NTN risks overfitting because of its large number of parameters, did you try using a version with input dimension l and a smaller output dimension m (so an l*l*m tensor)?\nA: We set the m to be 100 and 50 respectively, and tune the regularization in the same way, but didn't get a better performance.\n\nQ: You should probably note that SubMultNN looks a lot like the strategy for *sentence*-level matching in the Lili Mou paper you cite.\nA: We've cited Lili Mou's paper instead when describing the element-wise comparison."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Compare-Aggregate Model for Matching Text Sequences", "abstract": "Many NLP tasks including machine comprehension, answer selection and text entailment require the comparison between sequences.

(We didn't show the worse performance in this version.) For example, in the MovieQA task where plot is a very long sequence, CNN built on the plot could detect whether the words in the question and the answer appear in the same sentence of the plot. However, building CNN on the question will not have this benefit. In the InsuranceQA task where the answers are very long sequences, the longer the sequences are, the more differences between the answers. CNN built on the answers is to detect these differences, such as the continuously matched words in the answers and even the frequency of the matched words. \nOverall, we think CNN can detect the local matching information which is more fruitful in the longer sequences and that can benefit the performance.\n\nWe have also made a comparison between the performance on sequence pairs with big length differences and sequence pairs with similar lengths on the WikiQA development and test data sets. (As the other data sets are not suitable to make this comparison, we didn\u2019t conduct any further evaluation on them.) The set of sequence pairs with big length differences has a length ratio larger than 4 while the other set of sequence pairs has a length ratio below 4. On the development set, we find that the set with big length differences (56 pairs) has a MAP score of 0.82 while the other set (70 pairs) has a MAP score of 0.69. On the test set, the set with big length differences (118 pairs) has nearly the same score as the other set (125 pairs).  Based on these results, we believe the big length difference between the two sequences in a pair does not affect the performance of our model.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Compare-Aggregate Model for Matching Text Sequences", "abstract": "Many NLP tasks including machine comprehension, answer selection and text entailment require the comparison between sequences.

In the approach, soft attention is first used to derive alignments between the tokens of the two texts, then a comparison function uses the resulting alignments (represented as pairs of attention queries and attention results) to derive a representations that are aggregated by CNN into a single vector from which an output can be computed. The paper both presents this as an overall modeling strategy that can be made to work quite well, and offers a detailed empirical analysis of the comparison component of the model.\n\nThis work is timely. Language understanding problems of this kind are a major open issue in NLP, and are just at the threshold of being addressable with representation learning methods. The work presents a general approach which is straightforward and reasonable, and shows that it can yield good results. The work borders on incremental (relative to their earlier work or that of Parikh et al.), but it contributes in enough substantial ways that I'd strongly recommend acceptance.\n\nDetail: \n- The model, at least as implemented for the problems with longer sequences (everything but SNLI), is not sensitive to word order. It is empirically competitive, but this insensitivity places a strong upper bound on its performance. The paper does make this clear, but it seems salient enough to warrant a brief mention in the introduction or discussion sections.\n- If I understand correctly, your attention strategy is based more closely on the general/bilinear strategy of Luong et al. '15 than it is on the earlier Bahdanau work. You should probably cite the former (or some other more directly relevant reference for that strategy).\n- Since the NTN risks overfitting because of its large number of parameters, did you try using a version with input dimension l and a smaller output dimension m (so an l*l*m tensor)?\n- You should probably note that SubMultNN looks a lot like the strategy for *sentence*-level matching in the Lili Mou paper you cite.\n- Is there a reason you use the same parameters for preprocessing the question and answer in (1)? These could require different things to be weighted highly.\n", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Compare-Aggregate Model for Matching Text Sequences", "abstract": "Many NLP tasks including machine comprehension, answer selection and text entailment require the comparison between sequences.

We have made the revisions in the new pdf version. \n\nA and Q are the raw word vectors. Equation 1 is inspired by LSTM/GRU and it doesn't capture word order.\n\nIt would be a better way to use LSTM/GRU to chain up the words such that we can capture some contextual information, while this could be computationally expensive for long sequences. In our experiments, we only used LSTM to pre-process the sequences for the SNLI task.
