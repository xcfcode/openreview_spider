This is achieved in an unsupervised manner from unstructured data, through an approach heavily influenced by recent work by Henderson and Popa, which \"reinterprets word2vec\" by modeling distributions over discrete latent \"pseudo-phrase\" vectors. That is, instead of using two vectors per word, as in word2vec, a latent representation is introduced that models the joint properties of the target and context words. While Henderson and Popa represent the latent vector as the evidence for the target and context, or the likelihood, this work suggests to represent it based on the posterior distribution instead. The resultant representations are evaluated on Weeds et al.'s (2014) version of BLESS, as well as the full BLESS dataset, where they do better than the original.\n\nThe paper is confusingly written, fails to mention a lot of related work, has a weak evaluation where it doesn't compare to related systems, and I feel that it would benefit from \"toning down\". Hence, I do not recommend it for acceptance. In more detail:\n\n1. The idea behind Henderson and Popa's model, as well as the suggested modification, should be easy to explain, but I really had to struggle to make sense of it. This work relies very heavily on that paper, and would be better off if it was more standalone. I think part of the confusion stems from using y for the latent representation but not specifying whether it is a word or latent representation in Equation 1 - that only becomes obvious later. The exposition clearly needs more work, and more precise technical writing.\n\n2. There is a lot of related work around word embeddings that is not mentioned, both on word2vec-style representation learning (e.g. it would be useful to relate this more to word2vec and what it learns, as in Omer Levy's work on \"interpreting\" word2vec, rather than reinterpreting) and word embeddings on hypernymy detection and lexical entailment (see e.g. Stephen Roller's thesis for references).\n\n3. There has been a lot of work on the Weeds BLESS dataset that is not mentioned, or compared against, including unsupervised approaches (e.g. Levy's work, Santus's work, Kiela's work, Roller's work, etc.), that perform better than the numbers in Table 1. There are many other datasets that measure lexical entailment, none of which are evaluated on (apart from the original BLESS set, which is mentioned in passing). It would make sense to show that the method works on more than one dataset, and to do a thorough comparison against other work; especially given that:\n\n4. The tone of the work appears to imply that word2vec was wrong and needs to be reinterpreted: the work leads to \"unprecedented results\" (not true), claims to be a completely novel method for inducing word representations (together with LSA, BOW and Word2Vec, third paragraph; not true), and suggests it has found \"the best way to extract information about the semantics of a word from this model\" (7th paragraph; not true). This, together with the \"reinterpretation of word2vec\" and the proposed \"new distributional semantic models\" almost makes it hard for me to take the work seriously.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unsupervised Learning of Entailment-Vector Word Embeddings", "abstract": "Entailment vectors are a principled way to encode in a vector what information is known and what is unknown.

This is a conference on representation learning.  This is a paper on representation learning.  Other than papers already cited, none of the work referred to is on representation learning, and none of it gives comparable empirical results.  That is why we did not cite it in the submission.\n\nPoint 1: Reviewer 1 states that the model should it be easy to explain.  This is not true.  The fundamental difficulty comes from the novelty of the model, not from the writing.  If a reader is not familiar with Henderson and Popa 2016, then it is impossible to explain this vector-space model convincingly and still have space for the novel contributions of this submission.  This vector-space representation is just too different from previous vector-space representations.\n\nPoint 2: There is a huge literature on word embeddings for similarity, but it is not relevant here, as explained above.  This work is on embeddings which capture entailment, in contrast to similarity.\n\nPoint 3: Reviewer 1 claims \"there has been a lot of work on the Weeds BLESS dataset that is not mentioned\".  This is not true.  None of the authors mentioned have published results on the Weeds et al. 2014 dataset.  The only recent unsupervised results I can find for this dataset are those reported in the submission from Shwartz, which are BELOW CHANCE.  Perhaps others have tried but chosen not to publish such poor results.  We stay with this evaluation setup precisely because it has been shown that similarity-based measures do not perform well.  Unfortunately, most of the results from Shwartz et al. 2017 use a nonstandard evaluation measure which can easily be gamed, so we cannot make use of them for comparison.  \n\nPoint 4: Reviewer 1 provides no evidence for any of their claims in this point.  All these claims are false; we stay with the claims made in the submission.  We certainly never claim that word2vec was wrong.  Our point in this regard is that using similarity-based embeddings (like word2vec) to address entailment does not address the real issue, namely how to induce embeddings which intrinsically capture entailment.  Reviewer 1 is very confident about their judgements for someone who says themselves that they did not understand the paper.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unsupervised Learning of Entailment-Vector Word Embeddings", "abstract": "Entailment vectors are a principled way to encode in a vector what information is known and what is unknown.
