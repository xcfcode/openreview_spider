The paper still has issues with presentation, and weak comparisons to earlier methods. However, the field is currently rapidly developing, and comparing to earlier works is often difficult. I believe the Langevin-based prediction is a significant and clever contribution. I'm raising my score to 6.\n\n------\n\nThe paper proposes an end-to-end neural architecture for learning protein structures from sequences. The problem is highly important. The method proposes to use a Langevin simulator to fold the protein \u2018in silico\u2019 from some initial state, proposes numerous tricks for the optimisation, and proposes neural networks to extract information from both the sequence and the fold state (energy function). The system works on internal coordinates, which are conditioned and integrated on the fly. The method seems to perform very well, improving upon their baseline model considerably.\n\nIn spite of the paper being an outstanding work, I have two criticisms about the accessibility and impact of the paper on the broader ICLR audience. In its current form and complexity, the paper feels accessible mostly to a narrow audience.\n\nFirst, the framework proposed in the paper is massive, containing a large amount of components, neural networks, simulators, integrators, optimisation tricks, alignments, profiles, stabilizations, etc. The amount of work done in the manuscript is staggering, but the method is also difficult to understand from reading the main manuscript alone. The 10+ page appendix is critical for understanding (for instance, the appendix reveals that MSA is used to generate more data), and even with it the method is difficult to grasp as a whole. This paper should be presented in a journal form with a presentation not hindered by page limits, while currently one needs to jump between the main text and appendix to get the whole picture. I also wonder if some parts of the system have already been published, and perhaps the presentation could be condensed that way. \n\nSecond, the introduction lists numerous competing methods both on the protein modelling side and on the MCMC vs optimisation side. The paper does not compare to any of these, which is strange, and makes it difficult to assess how much this paper improves upon state-of-the-art. Right now its unclear what is state-of-the-art in general. No bigger context of protein folding is given either, for instance, how well the method fares against purely alignment based approaches, or against purely physics-based simulators. Finally, the experimental section poorly describes how all the pieces of the system affect the final predictions. The discussion on the exploding gradients and dampening is excellent however. The only baseline is one with the simulator replaced by an RNN. There does not seem to be any running time analyses. As such, it is hard to interpret the current system, and it feels like a black box.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1020/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Protein Structure with a Differentiable Simulator", "abstract": "The Boltzmann distribution is a natural model for many systems, from brains to materials and biomolecules, but is often of limited utility for fitting data because Monte Carlo algorithms are unable to simulate it in available time.

I recommend to the authors revise their manuscript to make it more accessible to the machine learning community and that they provide better context to allow them to assess the relative quality of the work compared to state of the art results.\n\n# Quality\n\nThe hypothesis that the authors set out to resolve is whether there is an advantage in using an energy function sampled by Langevin dynamics versus simply using a neural network to regress shape from sequence. They construct a flexible deep energy model where the sequence and structure dependent parts are separated in such a way that fast rollouts are possible. They also adapt the learning algorithm to  ensure that long rollouts can be carried out and present a clever trick for integrating internal coordinates efficiently on a GPU. \n\nThe only criticism in terms of quality of work is that it somewhat lacks putting in context with results from the larger community, for example how well does the model compare in terms of speed and accuracy with co-evolutionary approaches? I realise it will not be possible to give a completely fair like to like comparison, but it will help readers put the results in context if they understood, for example, what the average TM score for CASP12 results was, as summarized in this paper for example: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/prot.25423. Similarly, it would be useful to compare the baseline - at least qualitatively - with the results from AlQuraishi et. al. whose model seems very similar in spirit.\n\n# Clarity\n\nI think in terms of clarity, the paper could be improved a little to take into account the audience of ICLR. In particular:\n\n* It may be useful to add a sentence of how profiles have been found to improve secondary structure prediction greatly. Currently the text makes it sound as though they constitute a sort of 'data augmentation', whereas in my opinion they add information compared to the sequence alone. In fact a brief explanation of the importance of homology might help the reader understand the relevance of the hierarchical approach taken to splitting the training set.\n\n* Fig. 2 caption. Could add some information to explain what panel B is showing. I think this would go a long way to explain why both cartesian and internal coordinates are important.\n\n* Fig. 4 second panel. The x axis should be labeled fraction or be numbered 0-100.\n\n* Fig 4. caption. The figure does not have a caption explaining what the graphs are showing. This would be a good place to explain that the colors refer to test sets that overlap with the training set in the full CATH code (black), overlap only in the CAT code (orange) etc. I admit I had found the explanation of the test/train/validation split rather confusing. It is not clear what the validation set is used for, i.e. which hyper-parameters have been tuned on it etc.\n\n* The nature of the loss. The appendix does a good job in describing each term in the loss function, but does not explain how the empirical loss function and the log-likelihood terms are mixed together. \n\n# Originality\n\nThe work is original and is references the relevant literature.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1020/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Protein Structure with a Differentiable Simulator", "abstract": "The Boltzmann distribution is a natural model for many systems, from brains to materials and biomolecules, but is often of limited utility for fitting data because Monte Carlo algorithms are unable to simulate it in available time.

Our primary goal is to explore the utility of a learned, differentiable simulator in the context of the challenging problem of protein folding and to show that it can have better inductive bias than an approach based directly on angle-prediction (i.e. AlQuraishi and our baseline RNN). To be clear, we do not expect that this method would be competitive at CASP (where all forms of sequence and structure data before a certain date are fair game), as the cost of scaling training limited us to a medium-sized dataset of proteins of limited length (200 AAs) from which many topologies and architectures have additionally been held out.\n\nWe feel that it is still useful to present this novel methodology before it can scale to the challenge of CASP, because we are trying to argue about the inductive bias of simulators and not to make a general claim about deep methods versus conventional methods. Both our method and AlQuraishi\u2019s can create models with hundreds to thousands of atoms in milliseconds to seconds, which is far off from the timescales of physics based approaches (even the very impressive work of Jumper et al measures simulation times on the order of CPU-days), and we consider that sufficiently interesting to motivate research on \u2018deep\u2019 approaches.\n\nWith that in mind, we believe that the RNN baseline is a meaningful comparison and not \u2018artificial\u2019. Within the very recently emerging field of end-to-end models of protein structure, the idea of directly predicting internal coordinates (AlQuraishi) may be considered the other established paradigm (In Anand et al\u2019s currently available manuscript, they focus on structural imputation & generation rather than prediction). Like AlQuraishi\u2019s work, our RNN baseline composes a multilayer, bidirectional LSTM that predicts internal coordinates (in our case, coarse) with a scoring function on the resulting atomic Cartesian structure (in our case, after imputation). If we were to directly retrain the AlQuraishi model on our dataset, there are many possible explanations for performance differences such as different losses, the imputation network, training details, etc. We designed the experiments around our baseline because it allowed us keep those factors constant while replacing only the simulator portion of the model (this is what we meant by \u201cwhere differences in performance come from\u201d). Regarding the methods of Jumper and Krupa, we certainly want to acknowledge their contributions and related ideas but find that the costs of training (much longer simulations per protein) would be very challenging to scale to our dataset of 35k proteins.\n\nTo your other suggestions, we will add per-protein running time statistics and specific schematics for the 1D and 2D neural network modules upon revision. \n\nWe thank you for your patience with this work, and hope that the ICLR community can find value in the methodological and conceptual contributions.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1020/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1020/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1020/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Protein Structure with a Differentiable Simulator", "abstract": "The Boltzmann distribution is a natural model for many systems, from brains to materials and biomolecules, but is often of limited utility for fitting data because Monte Carlo algorithms are unable to simulate it in available time.

As described very nicely in the introduction, the main energy-based method to compare are Jumper and Krupa, while AlQurashi and Anand are the competing deep models. Both AlQurashi and Anand are very recent, and there does not seem to be a public manuscript of the Anand yet, hence comparing to them would be unreasonable. However, both Jumper and Krupa models seem simple enough to be implemented and compared to (neither seem to have implementations available). The Jumper's method claims 3 days of computations per protein, and in that case the key characterisation would be accuracy vs speed of different methods.\n\nFurthermore, In AlQurashi they explicitly compare to CASP 7-12 top methods, which seem to be the classic conventional methods Rosetta, I-TASSER, HHPRED, etc. They also seem to recreate the conditions of earlier CASPs to get comparable results, which is a great idea. \n\nOne needs to lay out the baselines and compare to earlier methods, especially when one is proposing a novel paradigm (deep learning). Using only RNN as baseline is not sufficient to evaluate how the proposed method performs in different cases. You claim to focus on \"comparing to end-to-end approaches\", however there seem to be none currently except for the somewhat artificial RNN baseline. CASP methods or standard protein servers as baselines are then necessary to show that the new (deep) paradigm has merit. I would also encourage to authors to check the developments in CASP13. I think comparisons are the main issue with the paper, and needs to be properly addressed. \n\nI'm also not sure how the RNN baseline shows \"where differences in performance come from\". Can you explicate what parts of NEMO cause its performance to be better than RNN, and why? \n\nThe running times could be more specific by detailing processing time required per protein.\n\nOn the presentation, I think the paper mostly needs a \"big picture\" figure that shows how the neural networks play into the simulation and energy systems. For instance, AlQurashi's figs 1+2 are very illuminating in this respect.

We hope that with improved presentation and contextualization, it can be relevant to a broad audience at ICLR.\n\n> In its current form and complexity, the paper feels accessible mostly to a narrow audience.\n> The amount of work done in the manuscript is staggering, but the method is also difficult to understand from reading the main manuscript alone. The 10+ page appendix is critical for understanding \u2026 This paper should be presented in a journal form with a presentation not hindered by page limits\u2026 I also wonder if some parts of the system have already been published, and perhaps the presentation could be condensed that way.\n \nWhile a journal might better accommodate the appendix, we believe that the complete system can be of interest to a general audience at ICLR because it connects recent interesting ideas in machine learning (e.g. differentiable simulators & meta-learning) to a challenging and well-known application domain with novel methodology (transform integrator, stabilization strategies, etc). To make these contributions more accessible, we have simplified the presentation of the model in the main text and added previously missing legends and overview paragraphs. (Lastly, in case its relevant, no parts of the model have previously been published.)\n\n> The paper does not compare to any of these, which is strange, and makes it difficult to assess how much this paper improves upon state-of-the-art. Right now its unclear what is state-of-the-art in general.\n\u2026 The only baseline is one with the simulator replaced by an RNN\n\nWe focus on comparing to end-to-end approaches with a controlled dataset, largely due to the computational challenges of training the differentiable simulator model. We have added a discussion of Advantages and Disadvantages that more explicitly makes the connection to recent end-to-end methods for predicting protein structure in terms of angles (AlQuraishi et al)  and our baseline RNN. We focus on comparing to the RNN baseline because it shares the same loss and data augmentation strategies as our simulator, thus making clearer where differences in performance come from. While we do see that our differentiable simulator model can generalize more effectively to distant folds on our controlled dataset of ~35k proteins < 200AAs, the dataset splitting and significant cost of training (2 months on 2 GPUs) mean that it is difficult to evaluate the approach performance on large proteins. Nevertheless, new models in machine learning with better inductive biases but greater computational demands often get their start via medium-sized controlled datasets.\n\n> There does not seem to be any running time analyses\n \nThanks for pointing this out. We have added a table of qualitative running times in the results section.\n \n> the experimental section poorly describes how all the pieces of the system affect the final predictions\n> it feels like a black box.\n \nWhile we could not afford to perform ablation studies of individual components given the long training time, we believe that structured nature of a differentiable simulator can make it easier to interpret and engineer than purely neural architectures. For example, the Markov Random Field formulation of the energy function means the sequence and structure features can be interpreted separately, and both the efficacy of Langevin dynamics and benefits of alternative coordinate parameterizations to sampling are well-understood phenomena."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1020/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1020/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1020/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Protein Structure with a Differentiable Simulator", "abstract": "The Boltzmann distribution is a natural model for many systems, from brains to materials and biomolecules, but is often of limited utility for fitting data because Monte Carlo algorithms are unable to simulate it in available time.

I found this paper very interesting and the idea of training the network through the sampling procedure promising. The authors present the challenges and techniques (damping, Lyapunov regularization etc) in detail.\n\nThe paper is clearly written, however the description of the method can be confusing. This stems in part from the many components of the network as well as the fact that the protein is represented using various coordinate systems and features, so that it is not easy to follow which applies at each stage. Fig. 6 in the appendix helps, however it would be better to have a (perhaps more concise) overview in the main text.\n\nIn the evaluation, the NEMO method is compared to a baseline approach using RNNs. While NEMO trained on profile features performs best, the baseline is trained on sequences only. However, it outperforms the NEMO model trained on sequence-only in every category. Therefore, it would be interesting to see whether NEMO outperforms a baseline trained on profile features. Otherwise, I am not certain whether I can follow the conclusion that \"NEMO generalizes more effectively\". Beyond that, it would be interesting to see some generated atomic substructures from the imputation network, in particular an analysis of how diverse the generated atom positions are and whether they depend on the local environment.\n\nOverall, I appreciate the general idea and find the proposed approach very interesting.

The scale goes from 0-1 and the axis label states that the units are % sequence ID (i.e. the maximum value is 100).\n\n\"Hierarchical purging\" like that is commonly practised in the comp. biol. community but it's unclear how that purging process has been extended to the _test_ set, which is based on CATH 4.2. I understand that you have split your _train_ and _validation_ sets according to a randomly selected subset of C, CA, CAT numbers found in CATH 4.1 - that's fine - I get that bit - but after training with that validation set, you cannot then have the same purged CAT numbers present in your test set because you will have fitted your model to your training set and then selected a model which does well on the domains in the validation set.\n\nIn reality you need to produce three splits of the CATH classification - train, validation and test. The test CAT codes should not have been used for either training or validation.  Possibly this is exactly what you did, but it really could do with some clarification in the text.\n\nHowever, if that is what you did, then I don't understand how you can end up with the plot in Fig. 4B - because that would suggest that you have a lot of protein domains which have _different_ topologies (T in CATH) but which still have very high sequence similarity. That just can't be right. There are virtually no known examples of proteins with high sequence similarity which do not have the same topology. Even a sequence identity of just 30% is typically enough to guarantee that the two structures will have the same topology (TM-score > 0.5).\n\nFrom what you say, though,  it sounds like your test set was simply all the new domains added to CATH 4.2, and that some happen to overlap with the training set domains and some don't. That would explain what I see in Figure 4B alright, but it would pretty much invalidate your final results as your test set would be contaminated. Surely you don't mean that?\n\nSorry to bang on, but if it wasn't such a potentially interesting paper I wouldn't care enough to ask!\n", "title": "Still a bit unclear on the purging"}, "signatures": ["(anonymous)"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1020/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["(anonymous)", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Protein Structure with a Differentiable Simulator", "abstract": "The Boltzmann distribution is a natural model for many systems, from brains to materials and biomolecules, but is often of limited utility for fitting data because Monte Carlo algorithms are unable to simulate it in available time.

So, after collecting all folds in 4.1 (subject to max length 200 and class 1,2,3), we then randomly selected a subset of A classifications and purged all folds descending from these into the A-level validation set. We repeated this process two more times for T and H. While the specific domain-level splits are contained in a large table not feasible for attaching to an openreview submission, we intend to make these available and will try to summarize the high level held out classifications at next update to the manuscript.\n\nRegarding the middle panel of Figure 4, the x axis is correct and our test set from CATH 4.2 does (naturally) contain some folds of very high (sometimes complete) sequence overlap. However, because we purged the training set (as just described above), the test set also contains many sequences of low/random sequence overlap (left cluster in middle panel) and low classification overlap. The color coding on this scatter plot indicates how close the given test domain is to the training set, where blue means that the ATH classifications were not present in train (column C in table 1), magenta means TH were not present in train (column A), orange means H was not present in train (column T) and gray (column H) means that the full CATH classification *was* present in train.\u00a0The showreel plot contains only folds from the A and T columns (magenta and orange). \n\nWe hope that hierarchical purging approaches to evaluation such as this will be more widely used in the future because they allow testing fold generalization more systematically across thousands of domains (rather than only doing temporal purging).\n\nTo conclude, our main claim is that the model is able to (sometimes) produce reasonable (TM>0.5) predictions for these difficult ATH, TH, and H problems created by our purging process and that it does so more accurately than a baseline that predicts angles directly without a folding process."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1020/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1020/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1020/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Protein Structure with a Differentiable Simulator", "abstract": "The Boltzmann distribution is a natural model for many systems, from brains to materials and biomolecules, but is often of limited utility for fitting data because Monte Carlo algorithms are unable to simulate it in available time.

The key issue when reviewing papers on protein structure prediction is whether or not there is any overlap between the training/validation data sets and testing data. Here it seems that you have tried to be very stringent about this by splitting your dataset of domains along CATH boundaries - so two domains with different CATH codes should in theory be unrelated and thus have no detectable sequence similarity. Likewise two proteins with different CAT codes should have different folds, CA different architectures and C having different classes. Having trained and validated on the domains in CATH release 4.1 you then tested on domains in CATH release 4.2, but only those that are unrelated to the training set (different CATH numbers) or have different folds (different CAT numbers). Assuming that was done without bugs, then I find it hard to understand the middle panel of Figure 4. Unless I\u2019m misunderstanding what\u2019s going on there (the x-axis scale is wrong by the way), it seems to suggest that a large proportion of your testing set is actually quite similar to your training set. In some cases identical (100% identical protein sequence). Does that not indicate that there is sequence overlap between training and test data. Of course it\u2019s impossible to know whether the overlap is with the validation set rather than the training set, but that would still be problematic.\n\nIf those highly similar sequences were included in the statistics shown in Table 1, for example, it would make the results there very difficult to interpret.\n\nLooking at some of the specific examples of folded domains shown, it would have been useful to know what the sequence similarity is between the target and the most similar protein domain in the training/validation set. For example, I note that domain 2oy8A03 shares 100% sequence identity with domain 3ckgA02 (one is simply a deletion mutant relative to the other), which was already present in CATH release 4.1 and so must have been either in the training set or at least the validation set. If this is true, then the network has simply recapitulated what it has already seen and hasn\u2019t actually predicted anything. Other examples shown have similar issues e.g. 4ykaC00, which is identical to 2wa9B00 in CATH 4.1 and indeed has the exact same CATH code, and so I don\u2019t think should be included in the test set at all.

We introduce techniques for stabilizing backpropagation under long roll-outs and demonstrate the model's capacity to make multimodal predictions and to, in some cases, generalize to unobserved protein fold types when trained on a large corpus of protein structures.", "keywords": ["generative models", "simulators", "molecular modeling", "proteins", "structured prediction"], "authorids": ["john.ingraham@gmail.com", "adam.riesselman@gmail.com", "cccsander@gmail.com", "deboramarks@gmail.com"], "authors": ["John Ingraham", "Adam Riesselman", "Chris Sander", "Debora Marks"], "TL;DR": "We use an unrolled simulator as an end-to-end differentiable model of protein structure and show it can (sometimes) hierarchically generalize to unseen fold topologies.", "pdf": "/pdf/74eea8275d283c962a2181cc5925e4f4ed8eeac1.pdf", "paperhash": "ingraham|learning_protein_structure_with_a_differentiable_simulator", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\ningraham2018learning,\ntitle={Learning Protein Structure with a Differentiable Simulator},\nauthor={John Ingraham and Adam Riesselman and Chris Sander and Debora Marks},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byg3y3C9Km},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1020/Public_Comment", "rdate": null, "ddate": null, "expdate": null, "duedate": null, "tmdate": 1542311697659, "tddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "reply": {"signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*|\\(anonymous\\)", "description": "How your identity will be displayed."}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "forum": "Byg3y3C9Km", "readers": {"description": "Select all user groups that should be able to read this comment.", "value-dropdown-hierarchy": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1020/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1020/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1020/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "replyto": null, "content": {"comment": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}", "required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters)."}, "title": {"value-regex": ".{1,500}", "required": true, "order": 0, "description": "Brief summary of your comment."}}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values-copied": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference", "{signatures}"]}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "invitees": ["~"], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1020/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1020/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1020/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "multiReply": true, "taskCompletionCount": null, "transform": null, "cdate": 1542311697659}}}], "count": 17}
