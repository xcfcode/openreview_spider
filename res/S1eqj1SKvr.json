Here we list your concerns and answer them one by one.\n\nR2Q1: novelty\nIt is a novel way to conduct feature space attack with the combination of style transfer and manipulation of model internal embedding, as pointed out by Review #1. Common style transfer task requires additional information such as painting styles. In this paper, we instead use samples from the same class that share rich style features, which is not explored by existing work. We leverage these implicitly learned features to launch our feature-space attack, which distinguishes ours among various existing attack methods.\nUnlike in [3], where a vanilla GAN-based attack method generates over a distribution of limited support, and has no control of the generated samples, our encoder-decoder based structure enables attacking each individual sample with controlled content and there is no limit on the number of samples, which is also mentioned in Review #3.\nWe also conducted an experiment that explores the defensive methods in different spaces. We observed that pixel-level defense is not effective against feature-space attack, and as we will show in the R2Q2 and R1Q3, existing defense that can be used in the feature space cannot defend our attack.\n\nR2Q2: add Pixel-DP as possible feature space defense \nWe use the code provided by authors and the same setting to conduct experiments on Pixel-DP defense. When using l2 norm bound of 0.1, the model accuracy (with Pixel-DP defense) is 80% under PGD l2 attack and 0% under our feature space attacks. When using l2 norm bound of 1, the model accuracy (with Pixel-DP defense) is 31% under PGD l2 attack and 0% under ours. When further increasing l2 norm bound to 10, we found the accuracy on normal images degrades to below 15%. Pixel-DP is hence ineffective against our feature space attack. The results are reasonable as Pixel-DP can only certify the l_2 norm bound up to 1, whereas our feature space attack generates adversarial samples with l_2 norm usually larger than 10.\nWe have also conducted adversarial training experiments over pixel/feature spaces, which is shown in Table 4 in appendix. When the model is trained with one type of adversarial attacks, it can only achieve non-trivial accuracy on the same attack but is ineffective to other types of attacks. It is non-trivial to design an effective adversarial training that is robust to all types of adversarial attacks, and it is out of scope of this paper. \n\nR2Q3: color space attacks\nThe paper [1] proposed to modify the HSV color space to generate adversarial samples, which transforms all pixels by a non-parametric function uniformly.  The experiments were only conducted on CIFAR-10 dataset and Madry model. Differently, feature space attack changes colors of specific objects or background alone and the transformation is learned from similar images, which is more imperceptible.  The paper [2] proposed to change the lighting condition and color similarly in [1] to generate adversarial samples. We observe in experiments that feature space attack also learns to modify lightning condition, color and texture as well, please refer to Fig. 3. Compared to these, our attack is more general, and the features attacked are more subtle. We will include the discussion in the paper.\n\nR2Q4: large and visible perturbation\nOur Decoder is trained to minimize difference between the reconstructed image and the original image. We only modify the mean and variance of activations that are considered style of features [5], where the content of images is preserved. When launching attack, we bound the perturbation of mean and variance, which controls the perturbation introduced in the pixel space. Fig. 3, Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 show the pixel/feature space distance of all the generated adversarial samples. It can be observed that our feature space attack has small feature space distance and even smaller than (pixel-space l_inf bounded) PGD attack in most cases. And we conducted an additional user study, suggesting feature space attack has comparable perceptual quality as PGD, please refer to R1Q1.\n\n[1] H. Hosseini, R. Poovendran.

Every pair is repeated for 3 times, making a total of 600 pairs. The adversarial samples are for targeted attack on ImageNet, where PGD has 58% successful rate and Feature Space Attack has 88% successful rate. \nThe worker is asked \u201cWhich image appears more natural, reasonable and realistic to you? Choose left or right to indicate your choice.\u201d The order in pair is shuffled.\n40% of users chose samples Feature Space Attack and 60% users chose samples from PGD. It shows that although the images by PGD are slightly more natural than ours. They are comparable. \nAlso, we provide a set of adversarial samples for inspection along with the code at https://github.com/JerishDansolBalala/FeatureSpaceAtk .\n\nR1Q2: unbroken detection mechanism\nWe were not aware of that \u201cThe Odds are Odd\u201d has been broken during the submission period and will add this information in the paper. The attack [4] specifically designed for the detection approach requires a much stronger threat model, where the attacker already knows the existence of the defense. In our case, however, we are able to evade the detection method without knowing its existence or mechanism.\n\nR1Q3: add dKNN as feature space detection\nWe use the same setting as in the original paper and the code provided by authors to conduct the experiments. We test on CIFAR-10  and two models (CNN+MLP in the default setting and ResNet18). For CNN+MLP, the detection rate against PGD attack is 3.9% and our feature space attack 1.9%. For ResNet-18, the detection rate against PGD attack is 11% and ours 5.4%. Our proposed feature space attack is stronger than pixel-level attacks, and can effectively evade feature based detection methods.\n\n[1] H. Hosseini, R. Poovendran.

Here we list our response as follows.\n\nReview #3\nR3Q1: intuition of Eq. (5) and (6)\nThe choice of mean and variance as style is largely an empirical observation. Previous work observed that normalized output of shallow convolutional layers keeps the shape of images. Paper [5] found statistics (e.g., correlation of feature maps) of an image represent style. Paper [6] found that instance normalization (IN) increases the quality of style transfer. Paper [7] investigated IN and proposed to use AdaIN, which transfer mean and variance only at a given layer. These experiment results from previous work show that statistics from model layers carry style information. We will add the discussion to the paper.\n\nR3Q2: Compare to other pixel space attacks and code release\nWe additionally compared to pixel attacks FGSM, CW and DeepFool on CIFAR10. They have the same bound as PGD. The accuracies are respectively 61.06% for FGSM, 61.38% for DeepFool, 81.24% for CW. Compared with 8.64% for feature space attack and 54.02% for PGD. Our comparison aims to show the different nature of pixel attacks and feature attacks renders existing pixel defense ineffective. We have additionally experimented a recent feature space defense. Please see R1Q3 and R2Q2.\n\nWe release the code at https://github.com/JerishDansolBalala/FeatureSpaceAtk .\n\nR3Q3: Missing citation:\nPaper [3] is a closely related work. It adds additional losses to GAN for generating unrestricted adversarial samples.  A vanilla GAN model only generates over a distribution of limited support, while an autoencoder can attack specific sample. We will add this discussion to the paper.\n\n\n[1] H. Hosseini, R.

Specifically, the proposed method firstly learns an encoder that encodes features into the latent space, where style features are learned. At the same time, a decoder is learned to reconstruct the images with the encoded features. To conduct attacks, perturbations are added into the encoded features and attack images are generated with the decoder given the perturbated features. The experiment results look promising, showing that the proposed method achieves better attack performance with realistic adversarial images.\n\nThe general idea of perturbating the feature (latent) space is not a novel one, which has been studied in [1]. However, the proposed one is with an autoencoder framework instead of GAN used in [1]. Therefore, the proposed approach is able to construct adversarial examples for specific images. In addition, the training of the encoder is adapted from a style transfer method, which seems to learn good features that capture style features. \n\nIt is a bit unclear on the intuition of the constructions of Eq. (5) and (6). The details may be in Huang & Belongie, 2017. But it is better to provide more intuitive explanation and discussion on why these constructions capture style variation.\n\nThe results shown in the paper look promising. But it would be more comprehensive to compare with other pixel attacks in addition to PGD. Moreover, it is unclear whether it is a fair comparison between the proposed approach and pixel attacks, even under the same amount of perturbations. It would be good if the code will be released.\n\nMinor:\n\nLast sentence in the first paragraph of page 3: a missing reference.\n\n[1] Song, Yang, Rui Shu, Nate Kushman, and Stefano Ermon. \"Constructing unrestricted adversarial examples with generative models.\" In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 8312-8323. 2018."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1925/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1925/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["xu1230@purdue.edu", "taog@purdue.edu", "516030910472@sjtu.edu.cn", "lintan@purdue.edu", "xyzhang@cs.purdue.edu"], "title": "TOWARDS FEATURE SPACE ADVERSARIAL ATTACK", "authors": ["Qiuling Xu", "Guanhong Tao", "Siyuan Cheng", "Lin Tan", "Xiangyu Zhang"], "pdf": "/pdf/ae90756467d49a5e64354909a228e90836147ab4.pdf", "abstract": "We propose a new type of adversarial attack to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for image classification.

It is well written and easy to follow.  Its main contribution is the joining of ideas developed in the style transfer literature with those from the adversarial literature.  \n\nThe authors establish that they are able to create adversarial attacks that look similar to the original image but are miss classified. These images are not bounded by small epsilons, but are said to be indistinguishable by people. They illustrate a sample of these attacks, but no human study is employed to back up this claim. A simple human evaluation to prove that the attacks are indistinguishable from unperturbed images would strengthen the work (This can be done easily and at low cost by  employing mechanical Turk or an equivalent system for example).  \n\nThey make use of a detection mechanism (The Odds are Odd, Rothet al.) to verify that their adversarial attacks are hard to detect, but this particular detection mechanism has already  been broken (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12138.pdf). If there is an as of yet unbroken detection mechanism that could be tested, that would improve the work. Alternatively the authors should acknowledge that there are simpler ways of evading this detection method.    \n\nThe attack that they propose targets the feature space, but no feature space detection methods are tested. The work would be improved by testing on a feature based detection methods such as dKNN (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01889.pdf)\n\nOverall the work is interesting and novel, and creatively joins together two otherwise distinct areas of machine learning research to make a modest but novel contribution to the field."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1925/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1925/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["xu1230@purdue.edu", "taog@purdue.edu", "516030910472@sjtu.edu.cn", "lintan@purdue.edu", "xyzhang@cs.purdue.edu"], "title": "TOWARDS FEATURE SPACE ADVERSARIAL ATTACK", "authors": ["Qiuling Xu", "Guanhong Tao", "Siyuan Cheng", "Lin Tan", "Xiangyu Zhang"], "pdf": "/pdf/ae90756467d49a5e64354909a228e90836147ab4.pdf", "abstract": "We propose a new type of adversarial attack to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for image classification.
