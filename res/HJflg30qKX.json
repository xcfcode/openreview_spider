They show that asymptotically gradient descent minimizes the risk, each weight matrix converges to its rank one approximation and the top singular vectors of two adjacent weight matrices align. Furthermore, for the logistic and exponential loss the induced linear predictor converges to the max margin solution. \n\nThis work is very interesting and novel. It provides a comprehensive and exact characterization of the dynamics of gradient descent for linear networks. Such strong guarantees are essential for understanding neural networks and extremely rare in the realm of non-convex optimization results. The work is a major contribution over the paper of Gunasekar et al. (2018) which assume that the risk is minimized. The proof techniques are interesting and I believe that they will be useful in analyzing neural networks in other settings.\n\nRegarding Lemma 3, the proof is not clear. Lemma 8 does not exist in the paper of Soudry et al. (2017). It is also claimed that with probability 1 there are at most d support vectors. How does this relate with assumption 3, which implies that there are at least d support vectors?\n\n-------Revision---------\n\nThank you for the response.

For strictly decreasing loss like the logistic loss, this paper shows 1) the loss goes to 0, 2) for every layer the normalized weight matrix converges to a rank-1 matrix 3) these rank-1 matrices are aligned. For the logistic loss, this paper further shows the linear function is the maximum margin solution.\n\nComments:\nThis paper discovers some interesting properties of deep linear networks, namely asymptotic rank-1, and the adjacent matrix alignment effect. These discoveries are very interesting and may be useful to guide future findings for deep non-linear networks. The analysis relies on many previous results in Du et al. 2018, Arora et al. 2018 and Soudry et al. 2017  authors did a good job in combing them and developed some techniques to give very interesting results. \nThere are two weaknesses. First, there is no convergence rate. Second, the step size assumption (Assumption 5) is unnatural. If the step size is set proportional to 1/t or 1/t^2  does this setup satisfies this assumption? \n\nOverall I think there are some interesting findings for deep linear networks and some new analysis presented, so I think this paper is above the bar.\nHowever, I don't think this is a strong theory people due to the two weakness I mentioned.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1043/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Gradient descent aligns the layers of deep linear networks", "abstract": "This paper establishes risk convergence and asymptotic weight matrix alignment --- a form of implicit regularization --- of gradient flow and gradient descent when applied to deep linear networks on linearly separable data.

We wish to communicate with the reviewer during this feedback phase in order to come to a consensus on this comment, and subsequently update the submission to accurately present what is new and what is old in the analysis.\n\nTo start this discussion, we clarify how our analysis goes beyond what was known.\n(1) We first argue that Theorem 1 (and analogously Theorem 3) sharply depart from prior work.  In particular, the tools from (Arora et al., 2018; Du et al., 2018) are only used at the beginning of Lemma 2, and moreover Lemma 2 is not nearly strong enough to prove Theorem 1: first, it is still possible for the iterates to get trapped in saddle points, or more generally in a bounded domain; second, even if the iterates grow unboundedly, the risk may still not converge to zero. These problems are handled in the proofs of Lemma 1 and Theorem 1 respectively, using techniques which have not previously appeared. \n(2) Theorem 2 (and Theorem 4) also depart from prior work.  We invoke a lemma of Soudry et al. (2017) in our technical Lemma 3; otherwise, the proofs of Lemma 4 and Theorem 2 are new.  Indeed, the work of Soudry et al. (2017) is for linear predictors, whereas we consider deep linear networks.\n\nOn a separate note, we agree that producing rates and practical step sizes would be ideal. However, the analysis of gradient flow is already an interesting stepping stone, indeed one which is the main topic of prior work (Arora et al., 2018; Du et al., 2018).  Our step sizes are not standard, but we note that they can be computed easily via the expression for beta(R) given in Lemma 5.\n\nWe thank the reviewer once again, and look forward to further comments!"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1043/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1043/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1043/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Gradient descent aligns the layers of deep linear networks", "abstract": "This paper establishes risk convergence and asymptotic weight matrix alignment --- a form of implicit regularization --- of gradient flow and gradient descent when applied to deep linear networks on linearly separable data.
