The scale of the data set is significantly larger than any existing ones. However, from the technical perspective, the reviewer feels this work has limited novelty and does not advance the research frontier by much. The detailed comments are listed below.\n\n1) Limitation of the dataset: While the authors claim this is a general approach to support seq2sql, their dataset only covers simple queries in form of aggregate-where-select structure. Therefore, their proposed approach is actually an advanced version of template filling, which considers the expression/predicate for one of the three operators at a time, e.g., (Giordani and Moschitti, 2012).\n\n2) Limitation of generalization: Since the design of the algorithms is purely based on their own WikiSQL dataset, the reviewer doubts if their approach could be generalized to handle more complicated SQL queries, e.g., (Li and Jagadish, 2014). The high complexity of real-world SQL stems from the challenges on the appropriate connections between tables with primary/foreign keys and recursive/nested queries. \n\n3) Comparisons to existing approaches: Since it is a template-based approach in nature, the author should shrink the problem scope in their abstract/introduction and compare against existing template approaches. While there are tons of semantic parsing works, which grow exponentially fast in last two years, these works are actually handling more general problems than this submission does. It thus makes sense when the performance of semantic parsing approaches on a constrained domain, such as WikiSQL, is not comparable to the proposal in this submission. However, that only proves their method is fully optimized for their own template.\n\nAs a conclusion, the reviewer believes the problem scope they solve is much smaller than their claim, which makes the submission slightly below the bar of ICLR. The authors must carefully consider how their proposed approach could be generalized to handle wider workload beyond their own WikiSQL dataset. \n\nPS, After reading the comments on OpenReview, the reviewer feels recent studies, e.g., (Guu et al., ACL 2017), (Mou et al, ICML 2017) and (Yin et al., IJCAI 2016), deserve more discussions in the submission because they are strongly relevant and published on peer-reviewed conferences.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Seq2SQL: Generating Structured Queries From Natural Language Using Reinforcement Learning ", "abstract": "Relational databases store a significant amount of the worlds data.

It also proposes a reinforcement-learning based model for this task.\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to emphasize that the creation of a large scale semantic parsing dataset is fantastic, and it is a much appreciated contribution. However, I find its presentation problematic. It claims to supplant existing semantic parsing and language-to-SQL datasets, painting WikiSQL as a more challenging dataset overall. Given the massive simplifications to what is considered SQL in this dataset (no joins, no subqueries, minimal lexical grounding problem), I am reluctant to accept this claim without empirical evidence. For example, how well does the proposed model work when evaluated on an existing dataset containing full SQL queries, such as ATIS? That being said, I am sympathetic to making simplifications to a dataset for the sake of scalability, but it shouldn't be presented as representative of SQL.\n\nOn the modeling side, the role of reinforcement learning seems oddly central in the paper, even though though the added complexity is not well motivated. RL is typically needed when there are latent decisions that can affect the outcome in ways that are not known a priori. In this case, we know the reward is invariant to the ordering of the tokens in the WHERE clause. There are far simpler solutions that would achieve the same result, such as optimizing the marginal likelihood or even simply including all orderings as training examples. These should be included as baselines.\n\nWhile the data contribution is great, the claims of the paper need to be revised.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Seq2SQL: Generating Structured Queries From Natural Language Using Reinforcement Learning ", "abstract": "Relational databases store a significant amount of the worlds data.

We recognize that the queries in WikiSQL are simple. It is not our intention to supplant existing models for SQL generation from natural languages. Our intention is to tackle the problem of generalizing across tables, which we believe is a key barrier to using such systems in practice. Existing tasks in semantic parsing and natural language interfaces focused on generation queries from natural language with respect to a single table. Our task requires performing this on tables not seen during training. We argue that while WikiSQL is not as complex as existing datasets in its query complexity, it is more complex in its generalization task.\n\n2. We could not find existing tasks that focus on generalization to unseen tables, but recognize that we may have missed existing work that the reviewer is aware of. We would be happy to apply our methods to such a task.\n\n3. We agree that the existing semantic parsing approach we compare against is more general. Our intention is to introduce baselines for the WikiSQL task that generalizes to unseen tables. The baselines are tailored to the particular task of generating SQL queries, but range from general and unstructured (e.g. augmented pointer) to templated and structured (e.g. WikiSQL).

It is not at all our intention to claim that WikiSQL supplants existing datasets. Our intended emphasis is that WikiSQL requires that models generalize to tables not seen during training. We are not aware of a semantic parsing dataset that 1. Provides logical forms 2. Requires generalization to unseen tables/schemas 3. Is based on realistic SQL tables in relational databases. We do recognize that WikiSQL, in its current state, contains only simple SELECT-AGGREGATE-WHERE queries. More complex queries contain, as you said, joins and subqueries. We will take this into account and elaborate on the generation of WikiSQL (which we placed into the appendix due to length considerations). In particular, we will explicitly emphasize the fact that WikiSQL does not contain subqueries nor joins.\n\n2. We agree that reinforcement learning seems like a general and complex solution to a specific problem that can be solved in other ways. In fact, another submission to ICLR leverages this insight to incorporate structures into the model to do, say, set prediction of WHERE conditions (https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkYibHlRb&noteId=S12EyE1bz). We chose to use the RL approach as the baseline for WikiSQL because it is easy to generalize this approach to other forms of equivalent queries should we expand WikiSQL in the future. We also found that it is simple to implement in practice. \nWe agree though that given the current state of WikiSQL, there are simpler approaches to tackle the WHERE clause ordering problem. We incorporated your suggestion of augmenting the training set with all permutations of the WHERE clause ordering. By doing this, we obtained 58.97% execution accuracy and 45.32% logical form accuracy on the test set with the Seq2SQL model without RL. The higher execution accuracy and lower logical form accuracy suggests that annotators were biased and tended to agree with the WHERE clause ordering presented to them in the paraphrasing task. Because we permute the ordering of the WHERE clause in training, the model does not see this bias during training and obtains worse logical form accuracy. With RL and augmented training set, we obtained 59.6% execution accuracy and 45.7% logical form accuracy."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Seq2SQL: Generating Structured Queries From Natural Language Using Reinforcement Learning ", "abstract": "Relational databases store a significant amount of the worlds data.

We computed the run time of the model with RL and without RL. There is a subtlety regarding the runtime computation in that we run the evaluation during each batch, which inherently does database lookup (e.g. to calculate the execution accuracy). The result of evaluation is used as reward in the case of reinforcement learning. Because of this, using RL does not really add to the compute cost, apart from propagating the actual policy gradients because reward computation is always done as a part of evaluation. Taking this into account, the per-batch runtime over an epoch for the no-RL model took 0.2316 seconds on average with a standard deviation of 0.1037 seconds, whereas the RL model took 0.2627 seconds on average with a standard deviation of 0.1414 seconds.\n\n2. Regarding your main concern (that we compare to other datasets), we are not aware of other datasets for natural language to SQL generation that requires generalization to new table schemas. For example, WikiSQL contains ~20k table schemas while other SQL generation tasks focus on a single table. As a result, we decided to compare our model against an existing state of the art semantic parser on our task instead. We would be happy to study the effect of our proposed method on other datasets.\n\n3. Our RL model is initialized with the parameters from the best non-RL model. This RL model is trained with Adam with a learning rate of 1e-4 and a batch size of 100. We use an embedding size of 400 (300 for word embeddings, 100 for character ngrams) and a hidden state size of 200. Each BiLSTM has 2 layers.

We reference several semantic parsing papers that convert natural language questions to logical forms. Moreover, we reference works that apply semantic parsing or other neural models to tables. We can and will certainly add the recent work you listed to our paper, but perhaps the phrase \"neglect all previous studies\" is a bit harsh?\n\nI am not certain as to whether it is appropriate to mention anonymous NIPS reviews, but the main concern from our NIPS reviews (e.g. the only negative review) was that we do not compare to semantic parsing results. We have since rewritten the paper to clarify this point. Namely, our baseline is a state-of-the-art neural semantic parser by Dong et al., who demonstrated its effectiveness on four semantic parsing datasets. The particular review you mention was actually the most positive, with its conclusion being \"the experiment part is solid and convincing\" and \"I believe release of the datasets will benefit research in this direction.\"\n\nRegarding your concern about novelty:\n\nPrior work, including those you cite (and which we will certainly add to our references), mainly focus on semantic parsing over knowledge graphs or synthetic datasets. For example, the first work you reference by Liang et al. works on WebQuestionsSP, which has under 5k examples. The second work you reference by Mou et al. uses a dataset by Yin et. al that contains 25k synthetic examples from a single schema (the Olympic games table). Finally, your third reference by Guu et al uses SCONE, which is a synthetic semantic parsing dataset over 14k examples and 3 domains. \n\nIn contrast, WikiSQL (which this paper introduces) spans 80k examples and 24k schemas over real-world web tables - orders of magnitude larger than previous efforts. The number of schemas, in particular, poses a difficult generalization challenge. Moreover, WikiSQL contains natural language utterances annotated and verified by humans instead of generated templates.  One of the novelties of our approach (Seq2SQL) is that while we operate on SQL tables, we do not observe the content of the table. That is, the rewards our model observes comes from database execution (as oppose to self execution). This also makes policy learning more challenging, because an important part of the environment (e.g. table content) is not observed. This is distinct from prior work, including those you reference, that learn using table content. Our approach forces the model to learn purely from the question and the table schema. This enables our model to act as a thin and scalable natural language interface instead of a database engine because it does not need to see the database content.\n\nFinally, as an impartial means to gauge the impact of our work, despite not having been published, WikiSQL is already seeing adoption and Seq2SQL is already being used as a reference baseline by the community (including submissions by other groups to this conference)."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Seq2SQL: Generating Structured Queries From Natural Language Using Reinforcement Learning ", "abstract": "Relational databases store a significant amount of the worlds data.
