Computing the matching score of two inputs (e.g. two images) involves the following steps: (i) assuming a Gaussian distribution in the embedding space, computing the mean and standard deviation for each input, (ii) drawing a set of samples from each distribution, (3) computing the normalized distances between the samples and (iv) averaging to obtain a global score.\n\nThe proposed approach is validated on a new benchmark built on MNIST.\n\nOn the positive side:\n-\tThe topic of injecting uncertainty in neural networks should be of broad interest to the ICLR community.\n-\tThe paper is generally clear.\n-\tThe qualitative evaluation provides intuitive results.\n\nOn the negative side:\n-\tThe whole idea of drawing samples to compute the distance between two Gaussian distributions seems unnecessarily complicated. Why not computing directly a distance between distributions? There exist kernels between distributions, such as the Probability Product Kernel (PPK). See Jebara, Kondor, Howard \u201cProbability product kernels\u201d, JMLR\u201904. The PPK between two distributions p(x) and q(x) writes as: \\int_x p^a(x) q^a(x) dx, where a is a parameter. When a=1, it is known as the Expected Likelihood Kernel (ELK). When a=1/2, this is known as the Hellinger or Bhattacharyya kernel (BK). In p and q are Gaussian distributions, then the PPK can be computed in closed form. If p and q are mixtures of Gaussians, then the ELK can be computed in closed form. \n-\tThe Mixture of Gaussians embedding extension is lacking in details. How does the network generate C Gaussian distributions? By having 2C output branches generating C means and C standard deviation vectors? \n-\tIt might be useful to provide more details about why the self-similarity measure makes sense as an uncertainty measure. In its current state, the paper does not provide much intuition and it took me some time to understand (I actually understood when I made the connection with the ELK). Also, why not using a simpler measure of uncertainty such as the trace of the covariance matrix?\n-\tThe experiments are lacking in some respects:\no\tIt would be useful to report results without the VIB regularization.\no\tThe focus on the cases D=2 and D=3 (embedding in a 2D or 3D space) shades some doubt on the practical usefulness of this framework in a higher-dimensional case.\n\nMiscellaneous:\n-\tIt seems there is a typo between equations (4) and (5). It should write z_1^{(k_1)} \\sim p(z_1|x_1)\n\n--- \n\nIn their rebuttal, the authors satisfyingly addressed my concerns.

We have revised the submission according to reviewers\u2019 suggestions and proposals (see summary of updates below). We respond to each reviewer\u2019s comments below.\n\n\n= Summary of updates in revision:\n\n- Discussion of conceptual inapplicability of MC dropout for probabilistic embedding in Section 3 (R1).\n- Discussion of the intuition behind self-similarity for uncertainty measure and its conceptual advantage over the trace of covariance matrix (R2).\n- Description of network architecture for MoG embedding in Section 2.2 (R2).\n- New appendix section E for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the impact of KL divergence regularization term (R2).\n- Added (N=2, D=3) columns in tables 1 and 2.\n- Typos (R2,3).\n\n\n= R1: Comparison against \u201cexisting uncertainty methods like dropout\u201d.\n\nRandomness in MC dropout is independent of input. It is designed to measure model uncertainty (epistemic uncertainty). On the other hand, our model is designed to measure input uncertainty (aleatoric uncertainty). They are conceptually distinct methods.  We have added this discussion in Section 3, \u201cProbabilistic DNNs\u201d paragraph of the revision.\n\n\n= R1: Unlike MC dropout, \u201chyperparameters [such as number of components for MoG] are a pain point\u201d.\n\nWe have found results to be fairly insensitive to number of mixture components in the MoG. Note that MC dropout also has parameters to tune!\n\n\n= R1: How should I choose the number of components given that there are ten possibilities for each digit?\n\nDo cross-validation if performance is critical. We have shown, however, that both a single Gaussian and two-component MoG perform well in our setup (Section 4.3).\n\n\n= R2: Sampling based similarity computation is \u201ccomplicated\u201d. Why not compute analytic distances for Gaussians like Expected Likelihood Kernel or Hellinger Kernel? \n\nOur similarity computation based on distance samples is motivated by the contrastive loss metric learning objective (Section 2.1), where Euclidean distances between embeddings encode similarity of inputs. Compared to divergence (KL or JS), inner product (ELK), or Hellinger kernel based distances, HIB is designed to more directly represent distributions of Euclidean distances on the embedding space (through the match probability, Equation 2). However, we agree that it would be interesting to explore no-sampling alternatives in future work.\n\n\n= R2: What is the intuition behind self-similarity for uncertainty? Why not use the trace of the covariance matrix for uncertainty?\n\nThe self-similarity uncertainty measure starts from the intuition that for ambiguous inputs, their embeddings will span diverse semantic classes (as in Figure 1b). To quantify this, we have defined self-similarity as the chance that given an input x and two independent samples (z1, z2) from its embedding p(z|x), they belong to the same semantic cluster (i.e., their match probability).\n We do not use volumetric uncertainty measures like trace or determinant of covariance matrix because it does not make sense for multi-modal distributions like MoG.

Point embedding are conventional embedding where an input x is deterministically mapped to a vector in embedding space.\n\ni.e         f(x) = z where f may be a parametric function or trained Neural network.\n\nNote that this point embedding means that every x is assigned a unique z, this might be an issue in cases where x is confusing for example if x is an image in computer vision pipeline then x may be occluded etc. In such cases paper argues that assigning a single point as embedding is not a great option.\n\nPaper says that instead of assigning a single point it's better to assign smear of points (collection of points coming from some distributions like Gaussian and mixture of Gaussian etc) \n\nThey provide a technique based on variational inference to train the network to produce such embeddings. They also propose a new dataset made out of MNIST to test this concept.\n\n# Concerns\n\nAlthough they have results to back up their claim on their proposed dataset and problem.
