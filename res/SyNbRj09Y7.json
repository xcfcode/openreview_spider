Reference State Initialization (RSI) is a term from Peng et al 2018. Each simulated tasks has a motion capture clip that is used in the reward function for computed distances between the agent and desired motion where the timing for the motion capture clip is controlled by the environment. RSI makes further use of the motion capture in the environment by sampling initial poses for episodes randomly from this motion capture clip. The idea is to help the agent see more states that are close to the desired motion and tends to improve the overall motion quality. However, for our work we find that too much random pose initialization leads to a bad distance function estimator. \n\nEESP is new. If you have a sequence of length T one might consider cropping out a window of this sequence for training. We find that randomly starting the cropping window by choosing a w_s (window start) from 0, ... , T with equal probability helps, as does cropping the end of the sequence w_e (window end) in w_s + 1, ..., T. However, this randomization will cut off the beginnings of sequences too often. It is important that the distance metric be accurate at the beginning of a the episode. To assist in this we perform EESP where the probability of choosing w_s from 0, ..., T decays linearly with the probability of w_s = (T - i)/sum(0, ..., T). This same decaying probability is applied to the end of the crop window as well, prob w_e = ((T-w_s)-i)/sum(0, ..., T-w_s). This increases the probability of starting the cropping window earlier and increases the probability of shorter windows which helps overall distance metric accuracy for earlier parts of episodes."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper870/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper870/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper870/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Visual Imitation Learning with Recurrent Siamese Networks", "abstract": "People are incredibly skilled at imitating others by simply observing them.

One comparing our method to GAIL and a VAE, and another comparing our method to a non-recurrent version that is similar to TCN. Please see figure 4a of the revised manuscript. \n\nBased on these additional experiments we observe: \nthat training a VAE to learn an encoding to compute distances using an Euclidean norm is not effective.\nPolicies trained with GAIL often stand still or are jerky. Standing still is within the distribution of example imitation data.\nExamining the new figure 4b:\nWe find that our method that takes advantage of temporal structure works well. Our method does not assume time alignment like many current TCN like methods and makes use of temporal structure that many current GAIL-based methods do not.\nWe also compare our method to the default manual reward function. We consistently find that both TCN and our method learn faster compared to learning with a manual reward function. We believe this is an indication that learned reward functions may provide a more dense reward landscape compared to the manual reward that can appear more sparse after the agent diverges from the desired behaviour.\nWe conduct an additional ablation analysis in figure 3c to compare the effects of particular methods used to assist in training the recurrent siamese network.\nWe find it very helpful to reduce Reference State Initialization (RSI). If more episodes start in the same state it increases the temporal alignment of training batches for the RNN.\nWe believe it is very important that the distance metric be most accurate for the earlier states in an episode so we use EESP (Early Episode Sequence Priority). Meaning we give the chances of cropping the window used for RNN training batches closer to the beginning of the episode. Also, we give higher probability to shorter windows. As the agent gets better the average length of episodes increases and so to will the average size of the cropped window.\nLast, we tried pretraining the distance function. This leads to mixed results. Often pre training overfits the initial data collected leading to poor early RL training. However, in the long run pretraining does appear to improve over its non pretrained version.\nWe have also added experiments learning more tasks, including running and back/front flipping. We remark that:\nThe quality of the policy for running is reasonable (figure 6)\nWhile the quality of the flipping is not as high as other methods it is important to remark that here we provide neither motion phase information to the policy nor any of the many \u201chints\u201d that have been used to engineer other humanoid simulation RL techniques.\nStill we are able to see some interesting behaviour that attempts to reproduce safer motions that match the motion timing -- in other words, our methods appear to learn in a ways closer to how real humans learn.\n\nThank you for your suggestions we have made numerous updates and added extensive imagery to illustrate these additions, as such the paper may take a long time to download. The paper is one page longer to accommodate the requested additional experimental work; however, we will work to compress the paper further should it be accepted.  Finally, we also provide a new video at the link below where we have added new results for the additional humanoid3d tasks:\n\nThanks for the various pointers to related work. We have added and discussed a number of them in the revised manuscript.

We understand that the dense pose or robot state space is a poor space to compare distances. We instead believe that a more appearance based distance function based on video will allow us to learn a better distance function and therefore policy. We focus on sequence-based distances as we believe that imitation often involves an inherent temporal structure that is not captured by current versions of GAIL. The extension that video-based methods may extend the imitation capabilities of robots even further is also a desired consequence.\n\nCurrently, we use rendered video data from the simulation. This gives us the possibility to continuously generate more video data. However, we are interested in extending this work to taking video input from other sources, for example, youtube or possibly the kinetics or NTURGB-D datasets. We leave this as exciting future work.\n\nWe have included additional motion tasks for imitation. These tasks include running backflipping and front flipping for the 3D biped. While the resulting policies are not of remarkable quality I would like to note that compared to prior methods published at SIGGRAPH we don\u2019t provide motion phase information to the policy and our reward function is pure imitation and does not contain the many \u201chints\u201d used in the DeepMimic/SVF/OpenAIGym environments for humanoid controllers.\n\nBaselines:\nWe have processed additional comparisons to other baselines. These include a version of GAIL, non-recurrent vs recurrent examples and TCN examples. Most of these benchmarked on the 2d biped walking example. We are also working on an ablation study. We have also performed new comparisons to a multi-modal version of the recurrent method. Where we learn a distance function between the agents pose and the imitation video. This will also be included in the analysis.\n\nRelated work and details:\nThank you very much for the additional related papers. \n\nWe are currently editing the paper, this will all be included in an updated version of the paper in a few days. This updated version will also give many more details on the training process. In particular details on how the positive and negative examples are generated. In short we use a sequence-based version of a TCN like loss combine with class-by-class loss for the 3d humanoid where we have examples motions from other classes (running, backflipping and frontflipping).\n\nWe also thank the reviewers for their editing comments.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper870/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper870/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper870/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Visual Imitation Learning with Recurrent Siamese Networks", "abstract": "People are incredibly skilled at imitating others by simply observing them.

The motivation for using videos as a demonstration source could be more clearly stated. One reason is because it would pave the way to learn from real-world video demonstrations. Another reason is that robot's state space is an ill-suited space to be comparing distances over and image space is more suitable. Choosing one would help the readers identify the paper's motivation and contribution.\n\nOriginality: The individual parts of this work (siamese networks, inverse RL, learning distance functions for IRL, tracking from video) have all been previously studied (which would be good to discuss in a relate work section), so nothing stands out as original, however the combination of existing ideas is well-chosen and sensible.\n\nSignificance: There are a number of factors that limit the significance of this work. \n\nFirst, the demonstration videos come from synthetic rendered systems very similar the characters that imitate them, making it hard to evaluate whether this approach can be applied to imitation of real-world videos (and if this is not the goal, please state this explicitly in the paper). Some evaluation of robustness due to variation in the demonstration videos (character width, color, etc) could have been helpful to assure the reader this approach could scale to real-world videos.\n\nSecond, only two demonstrations were showcased - 2D walking and 3D walking. It's hard to judge how this method (especially using RNNs to handle phase mismatch) would work for other motions.\n\nThird, the evaluation to baselines is not adequate. Authors mention that GAIL does not work well, but hypothesize it may be due to not having a recurrent architecture. This really needs to be evaluated. A possibility is to set up a 2x2 matrix of tests between [state space, image space] condition and [recurrent, not recurrent] model. Would state space + not recurrent reduce to GAIL?\n\nFourth and most major to me is that looking at the videos the method doesn't actually work very well qualitatively, unless I'm misunderstanding the supplementary video. The tracking of 2D human does not match the style of the demonstration motion, and matches even less in 3D case. Even if other issues were to be addressed, this would still be a serious issue to me and I would encourage authors to investigate the reasons for this when attempting to improve their work.\n\nOverall, I do not think the results as presented in the submission are up to the standards for an ICLR publication.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper870/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Visual Imitation Learning with Recurrent Siamese Networks", "abstract": "People are incredibly skilled at imitating others by simply observing them.

Since the algorithm does not have direct access to the underlying actions or rewards, the agent aims to learn an embedding space over instances with the hope that distance in this embedding space corresponds to reward. Deep RL is used to optimize a policy to maximize cumulative reward in an effort to reproduce the behavior of the expert.\n\nHigh-level comments:\n- My biggest concern with this paper is the lack of a baseline example that we can use to evaluate performance. The walking task is interesting, but the lack of a means by which we can evaluate a comparison between different approaches makes it very difficult to optimize. This makes evaluation of quality and significance rather difficult. A number of other questions I have stem from this concern:\n    = The paper is missing a comparison between the recurrent Siamese network and the non-recurrent Siamese network. The difficulty in comparing these approaches without a quantitative performance metric.\n    = The authors also mention that they tried using GAIL to solve this problem, but do not show these results. Again, a success metric would be very helpful here.\n    = Finally, a simpler task for which the reward is more easily specified may be a better test case for the quantitative results. Right now, the provided example of walking agents seems to only provide quantitative results.\n- The authors need to be more clear about the structure of the training data and the procedure. As written, the structure of the triplet loss is particular ambiguous: the condition for positive/negative examples is not clearly specified.\n- There are a number of decisions made in the paper that feel rather arbitrary or lack justification. In particular, the \"normalization\" scaling factor fits into this category. Some intuition or explanation for why this is necessary (or why this functional form should be preferred) would be helpful.\n- A description of what the error bars represent in all of the plots is necessary.\n\nMore minor comments and questions:\n- The choice of RL algorithm is not the purpose of this paper. Much of this section, and perhaps many of the training curves, are probably better suited to appear in the Appendix. Relatedly, why are training curves only shown for the 2D environment? If space was a concern, the appendix should probably contain these results.\n- An additional agent that may be a useful comparison is one that is directly provided the actions. It might then be more clear how well. (Again, this would require a way to compare performance between different approaches.)\n- How many demonstrations are there? At training vs testing?\n- Where are the other demonstrations? The TSNE embedding plot mentions other tasks which do not appear in the rest of the paper. Did these demonstrations not work very well?\n\nA Comment on Quality: Right now, the paper needs a fair bit of cleaning up. For instance, the word \"Rienforcement\" is misspelled in the abstract. There is also at least one hanging reference. Finally, a number of references need to be added. For example, when the authors introduce GAIL, they mention GANs and cite Goodfellow et al. 2014, but do not cite GAIL. There is also a lot of good research on Behavioral Cloning, and where it can go wrong, that the authors mention, but do not cite.\n\nConclusion: At this point it is difficult to recommend this paper for acceptance, because it is very hard to evaluate performance of the technique. With a more concrete way of evaluating performance on a different task with a clearer reward function for comparison, the paper could be much stronger, because this would allow the authors to compare the techniques they propose to one another and to other algorithms (like GAIL).\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper870/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Visual Imitation Learning with Recurrent Siamese Networks", "abstract": "People are incredibly skilled at imitating others by simply observing them.

They are able to do this by using a recurrent siamese network architecture to learn a distance function, which can be used to provide rewards for learning behaviors, without the need for any explicit pose estimation. They demonstrate effectiveness on 2 different locomotion domains. \n\nOverall impression:\nOverall, my impression from this paper is that the idea is to use a recurrent siamese network to learn distances which make sense in latent space and provide rewards for RL. This is able to learn interesting behaviors for 2 tasks. But I think the writing needs significant work for clarity and completeness, and there needs to be many more baseline comparisons. \n\nAbstract comments:\ntrail and error -> trial and error\n\nIntroduction comments:\n\nAlternative reasons why pose estimation won\u2019t work is because for any manipulation tasks, you can\u2019t just detect pose of the agent, you also have to detect pose of the objects which may be novel/different\n\nFew use image based inputs and none consider the importance of learning a distance function in time as well as space -> missed a few citations (eg imitation from observation (Liu, Gupta, et al))\n\nTherefore we learned an RNN-based distance function that can give reward for out of sync but similar behaviour -> could be good to emphasize difference from imitation from observation (Liu, Gupta, et al) and TCN (Semanet et al), since they both assume some sort of time alignment\n\nMissing related work section. There is a lot of related work at this point and it is crucial to add this in. Some things that come to mind beyond those already covered are:\n1. Model-based Imitation Learning from State Trajectories\n2. Reward Estimation via State Prediction\n3. infoGAIL\n4. Imitation from observation \n5. SFV: Reinforcement Learning of Physical Skills from Videos\n6. Universal planning networks\n7. https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00928\n8. This might also be related to VICE (Fu, Singh et al), in that they also hope to learn distances but for goal images only.\nIt seems like there is some discussion of this in Section 3.1, but it should be it\u2019s own separate section.\n\nSection 3 comments:\na new model can be learned to match this trajectory using some distance metric between the expert trajectories and trajectories produced by the policy \u03c0 -> what does this mean. Can this be clarified?\n\u2028The first part of Section 3 belongs in preliminaries. It is not a part of the approach. \n\nSection 3.2\nEquations 9 and 10 are a bit unnecessary, take away from the main point\n\nWhat does distance from desired behaviour mean? This is not common terminology and should be clarified explicitly.\n\nEquation 11 is very confusing. The loss function is double defined.  what exactly Is the margin \\rho (is it learned?) The exact rationale behind this objective, the relationship to standard siamese networks/triplet losses like TCN should be discussed carefully. This is potentially the most important part of the paper, it should be discussed in detail.Also is there a typo, should it be || f(si) - f(sn)|| if we want it to be distances? Also the role of trajectories is completely not discussed in equation 11.\n\nSection 3.3 \nThe recurrent siamese architecture makes sense, but what the positive and negative examples are, what exactly the loss function is, needs to be defined clearly. Also if there are multiple demonstrations of a task, which distance do we use then?\n\nThe RL simulation environment is it made in-house, based on bullet or something else?\n\nData augmentation - how necessary is this for method success? Can an ablation be done to show the necessity of this?\n\nAlgorithm 1 has some typos \n- > is missing in line 3\n- Describe where reward r is coming from in line 10\n\nSection 4.1\nWalking gate -> walking gait\n\nThere are no comparisons with any of the prior methods for performing this kind of thing. For example, using the pose estimation baseline etc. Using the non-recurrent version. Using TCN type of things. It\u2019s not hard to run these and might help a lot, because right now there are no baseline comparisons\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper870/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Visual Imitation Learning with Recurrent Siamese Networks", "abstract": "People are incredibly skilled at imitating others by simply observing them.
