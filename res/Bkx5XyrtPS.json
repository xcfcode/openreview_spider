Please see the inline responses.\n\n> Comments: \n>\n> 1) I understand that there exists some work on deep linear network recently. However, they seem to be only for theoretical purpose. Most of the current practical problems do not consider this kind of network for training. If it has high impact in practice, then people are starting to use it. Could you please provide more reasons why we need to care about this impractical network? \n\nIt is true that deep linear networks are not used much, if any, in practice (though two layer linear networks, e.g. matrix factorization, is broadly used for recommender systems). The main reason to study this is to gain insight and to invent tools to understand the practical case. This is quite common practice (for example, recent studies on wide shallow networks) when we are unable to solve the eventual question but we would still like to make progress.\n\n> 2) It is still unclear about the contributions of the paper. Why \u201cdeep linear network has no spurious local minima as long as it is true for the two layer case\u201d is important? And what we can take any advantage from here? \n\nBoth nonlinearity and depth can increase the complexity of the optimization landscape. It would be super interesting to show that depth does not hurt. Our paper showed that this is the case for deep linear networks. This is an interesting conceptual contribution. The proof requires a few novel arguments too. \n\n> What if there exist some spurious local minima for the two layer case (which is widely true)?\n\nWe know they do not exist for quadratic loss and  for any differentiable convex loss when there is no bottleneck. Actually we were unable to construct an example (although we suspect they do exist).\n\n> 3) The paper looks like a technical report and seems not to be ready. \n\nThe paper was intended as a clean proof of a clean statement. Your (and others) comments have been very useful for clarifying the contribution of the paper and improving the presentation. We would appreciate any further advices on what to include in the paper.\n\n> The results are quite incremental from the existing ones. The contributions of this work to the deep learning community are still ambiguous.\n\nBesides the contribution stated above, with our paper, we now know that there is no spurious local minima in deep linear network for quadratic losses (this was only known conditionally before our paper). In addition, our proof is quite accessible which we hope to help to enable further progress on related topics."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1627/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1627/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Depth creates no more spurious local minima in linear networks", "authors": ["Li Zhang"], "authorids": ["liqzhang@google.com"], "keywords": ["local minimum", "deep linear network"], "TL;DR": "We show that a deep linear network has no spurious local minima as long as it is true for the two layer case.

The first part of proof of Theorem 1 is obvious and straightforward, and the other direction has been used before for multiple times as claimed in the paper, what is your novelty exactly here? \n\nThe main technical contribution is Lemma 1. The other claims (Theorem 1, 2, Cor 1) follow more or less directly from it, but they are interesting conceptually. We did state explicitly in the proof of Theorem 1 that the implication of Lemma 1 to Theorem 1 (a rather easy argument) is included for the completeness.  The fact that the property of deep linear networks can be determined by the two layer network is certainly novel and interesting too (in our opinion). Besides the conceptual novelty, there is also technical novelty, as stated below.\n\n> For the key technical claim of Lemma 1, it looks like this perturbation technique already exists in (Laurent & Brecht, 2018), why do you claim it as a novel argument?\n\nThe proof is inspired by Laurent & Brecht, 2018, as explicitly stated in the paper. Especially, it follows the same argument to construct a family of local minima (up to line 14 on page 5.) But then the proof branches from there. In Laurent&Brecht, the critical condition used is that the null space is the entire space. So it only requires one line (formula (21) in that paper) to carry the induction. But here, because of the existence of bottleneck, the critical condition is that the local minima must lie on some subspace. It requires to generalize the argument to deal with this case. The bulk of the proof of Lemma 1 (from line 15 on) is about carrying the induction through with this weaker constraints. But we should contrast this better in the paper.\n\n> Besides novelty, there are also some other unclear pieces in this paper needs clarification:\n> 1)\tIs the main result which is \u201cno spurious local minima for deep neural network\u201d holds for any differentiable convex loss other than quadratic loss?\n\nThe main result is as stated in Theorem 1, i.e.  for any differentiable convex loss, whether a deep linear network has spurious local minima reduces to the two layer case. \n\n> How will Theorem 1 help us understand the mystery of neural network? \n\nConceptually, it shows that depth does not introduce extra local minima for deep linear networks. In general, the complexity of landscape can be caused by the non-linearity and/or depth. Here we show that depth does not make the landscape more complex for the linear networks. We think this is a progress towards understanding the mystery of neural networks. And if not,  any understanding of deep neural network should include deep linear network as a special case. So it is a pre-requisite to some sense.\n\n> 2)\tHow does the result help us understand non-linear deep neural network, which is commonly use in practice?\n\nGood question. We can only speculate here --- perhaps similar phenomena exist for non-linear networks? It would greatly simplify our task if we can reduce the study to two or small number of layers. We have shown this is possible for deep linear networks, which is perhaps interesting, at least conceptually?\n\n> 3)\tThe paper should give some explanations about why the results help training neural networks.\n\nThe paper is solely about understanding the landscape of deep linear networks, which is, in our opinion, an important question which needs to be answered even before studying the convergence."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1627/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1627/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Depth creates no more spurious local minima in linear networks", "authors": ["Li Zhang"], "authorids": ["liqzhang@google.com"], "keywords": ["local minimum", "deep linear network"], "TL;DR": "We show that a deep linear network has no spurious local minima as long as it is true for the two layer case.

Our  proof builds on the work in (Laurent & von Brecht, 2018) and develops a new perturbation argument to show that any spurious local minimum must have full rank, a structural property which can be useful more generally", "pdf": "/pdf/a19b8ec3346af2360040a0059c740b3fa900c6b8.pdf", "paperhash": "zhang|depth_creates_no_more_spurious_local_minima_in_linear_networks", "original_pdf": "/attachment/a19b8ec3346af2360040a0059c740b3fa900c6b8.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nzhang2020depth,\ntitle={Depth creates no more spurious local minima in linear networks},\nauthor={Li Zhang},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkx5XyrtPS}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
