One detail that is still unclear; when you say \"we train a policy network that outputs option $o$\", what is the input to that policy network? Judging by the figure, the input is a single state (rather than a sequence), correct? Does this mean that a single time step is passed into this network to generate $o$, which then gets decoded to $\\hat{a}_{0, \\ldots,k}$, which are potentially used to act for up to $k+1$ time steps depending on termination? If so this is quite different from the typical form of options which prescribes a policy that gets to react to the future states visited. It is okay if the two methods are different of course. Perhaps this is where some of the confusion was coming from. It is a point that may want to be emphasized.\n\nRe A9: Thank you for the response! In a similar spirit to my comment Re A8, options are typically used to capture action-correlations conditioned on a particular state or given a sequence of states visited by the option policy (see: Konidaris and Barto IJCAI 2007, for instance). My comment was pointing out that action correlations alone, without any amount of state history, are probably less useful. I take your reaction to suggest that action correlations alone can be useful. Regardless, my question here was clarified, so thank you!\n\nReferences:\n\nKonidaris, George, and Andrew G.

I would suggest rephrasing the statement 'smooth option space provides the RL algorithm with a better search space' to something like 'smooth option space allows interpolation between different options', or something to that affect. By my knowledge, we don't know whether a smooth or non-smooth option space is more useful for RL.\n\nRe A3: Understood -- this is a new framework for learning temporal abstractions. It's unclear why comparison can't be made to existing HRL methods, though; it is known that HRL can help speed up RL (see references from the review; Nachum et al. 2019, Levy et al. 2019, Sutton et al. 1999, and so on). However, contrasting the learning gains made by TIAC to something standard like the Option Critic would add clarity to the conditions under which TIAC is well suited to improve RL. As it stands, when would we expect to see TIAC improve over something like the Option Critic? One point is discussed (as in Q4/A4): the Option Critic requires tuning of the parameter specifying the number options. However, we could naturally not tune that parameter and still run the Option Critic (just pick a large number, for instance)---would we expect the Option Critic to outperform TIAC or not? Under what circumstances? Carrying out systematic experimentation to highlight when and why TIAC is effective would be helpful. Since the support offered for the method is empirical, I take it to be important to relate its performance to at least one other HRL (and specifically option) method. Perhaps the other reviewers can chime in here, though my reading is that R2 has a similar view.\n\nRe A5: Understood, thank you!\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1176/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1176/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["wenshanw@andrew.cmu.edu", "yaoyuh@andrew.cmu.edu", "basti@andrew.cmu.edu"], "title": "Learning Temporal Abstraction with Information-theoretic Constraints for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Wenshan Wang", "Yaoyu Hu", "Sebastian Scherer"], "pdf": "/pdf/a140c75853b27a3fb11e1a7b48bfd639a5a808a2.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a novel HRL framework, in which we formulate the temporal abstraction problem as learning a latent representation  of  action  sequence.", "abstract": "Applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world problems will require reasoning about action-reward correlation over long time horizons.

We ask the authors to clarify this in the paper.\n\nA1: Yes. $E$, $D$, $F$ and $P$ are trained in the first phase using action-state sequences, which in our experiments come from the agent\u2019s own experiences. They can also come from expert demonstration, in which case we speculate will be better. We haven\u2019t done much study on how the experience could influence the learned option. But some primitive experiments show that better experiences result in better options, as briefly discussed in the 4th paragraph of 4.2.2. \n\n>> Q2: In Algorithm 1, we don't see how F is trained. Is this missing or not part of the algorithm at all? Also, in line 10, how is MSE calculated if i != j?\n\nA2: We omitted $F$ in the Algo 1 because it is not part of termination condition. But $F$ is trained together with $E$, $D$ and $P$ as described in Section 3.3. The network $F$ takes in the option and outputs the start state $s$ and the end state $s\u2019$. The weights of $F$ is optimized to minimize the prediction loss $L_{adv}$. At the same time, the weights of $E$ are regularized by maximizing the loss $L_{adv}$. \n\nThanks for pointing out the mistakes in the Algo 1. We set $j=i-1$. The reconstruction loss is calculated by $L_{Recons}=MSE(\\hat{a}_{0\u2026(i-1)}, a_{0\u2026(i-1)})$. We\u2019ll update the paper accordingly. \n\n>> Q3: In the experimental section, experience is collected using a PPO agent. A flat policy is used as a baseline. Is the experience collection included in the number of interactions or just used to pre-train (parts of) the model? In the latter case, the comparison might be improper. \nAlso, flat policy might be a weak baseline given recent progress on HRL. Comparison with other recent methods such as those in [1][2][3] would be desirable, but not a must.\n\nA3: The interaction in the experience collection is not included. We agree that the comparison in this setup advantages the HRL algorithm, because the HRL method is exposed to extra information, which is the past experiences. The main message we\u2019d like to convey is that our framework presents an efficient way of taking advantage of the past experiences to accelerate the learning task. We didn\u2019t count the interaction in the pre-train process, because the experiences can also come from expert demonstration or from the pre-training on simpler tasks (e.g. in the setup of Section 4.3). \n\nWe agree that adding more baselines on HRL side would enhance the paper. However, in this work, we propose to handle HRL with a new framework. We have a two-stage procedure, which is different from existing methods. Our primary intention is to show that performance of an RL learner could be improved based on our proposed framework. One can improve the performance by inserting a more powerful RL algorithm, or learning options from better experiences (using expert demonstration for example). By showing that our framework can learn useful abstractions from action sequences, and showing that the learned option could accelerate training of both seen and unseen tasks, we demonstrate the framework is effective and can be improved in many ways, as we discussed in the last section.

SeCTAR [1] also uses an RVAE to encode trajectories (both states and actions) for HRL. The authors should include a reference to the paper and discuss similarities and differences between SeCTAR and their own work. Other missing recent related works include HIRO [2] and Hierarchical Actor Critic [3].\n\nA4: Thanks for pointing out these related works. We\u2019ll include these references in the paper. \n\nThe SeCTAR algorithm is very interesting and related. Both of us proposed a HRL framework by learning a latent representation from trajectories using RVAE. Both works learned a predictive model: SeCTAR learned a model capturing environment dynamics, while we use a predictive model to regularize the RVAE. \n\nHowever, there are significant differences. SeCTAR learns a latent representation from state sequences, while our proposed TAIC learns from action sequences. From our understanding, this difference comes from the different motivations and intuitions behind the two frameworks. SeCTAR focuses on learning a sub-policy and predictive model that follow a state trajectory. The intuition is that instead of learning a fine-grain temporal predictive model, SeCTAR only needs to predict the temporally extended behaviors of the sub-policy. The learned model and sub-policy can facilitate a higher-level model-based method such as MPC. On the other hand, our intuition (as we described in the reply to reviewer #1) is that there are USEFUL PATTERNS in action sequences. Take human motion for example, you can clearly distinguish raising hands by a normal person and a person with Parkinson disease. Although there are infinite ways of raising hands, a lot of action combinations (e.g. the way a person with Parkinson disease raising his hand) are not that useful and common. Learning the patterns of useful action sequences could help us better control the body and achieve our goals more efficiently. So our focus is on learning useful action representations. \n\nSeCTAR has some nice properties such as close-loop sub-policy, exploration module and an online iterative learning mechanism. Incorporating these ideas into our TAIC framework would be very interesting future work, as we have discussed in the last section. We conjecture one disadvantage of the SeCTAR is that it could be more sensitive to environmental changes, since the sub-policy is tightly coupled with the environment dynamics. While the latent representation of TAIC purely depends on the actions, the learned skills could be easily transferred between different tasks (without any finetuning of the sub-policy), as we shown in Fig 8. In addition, SeCTAR use fixed-length trajectory, while we have investigated several termination conditions, which allow the sub-policy outputs variable length trajectories. \n\n>> Q5: To our knowledge, however, the first HRL with temporal abstraction was published 1990-1991. See the references in section 10 of the overview http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html. How does the work of the authors go beyond this original work on learning temporal abstractions for HRL? \n\nA5: Thanks for pointing out those classic papers. Personally speaking, I have been greatly inspired by the work of Prof Schmidhuber and his team. I think a lot of their ideas (such as recurrent world models, curiosity, data compression, etc.) are so beyond their times, and could be dug deeper in the current context.

(2) \"...allow us to do planning at a higher level, and easily transfer the knowledge between different tasks\". Including experiments that explicitly evaluate the capacity of the learned representation to carry out planning would help support these claims.  (3) the contribution could be focused to model-free and policy-based learning, which is where the empirical evidence currently offers the most support. \n\nA1: We believe these questions are caused by our misuse of the word \u201cplanning\u201d. \n(1) By planning, we meant to say the \u201cHRL process\u201d (i.e. the decision making process based on the learned options). We shouldn\u2019t have used the word \u2018planning\u2019, because the process does not involve a model. \n(2) By \u201cdo planning at a higher level\u201d we mean that we do HRL using the learned option. By saying \u201ctransfer the knowledge\u201d, we use the Ant-Maze task, in which we show the option learned in a simpler task (Ant running) can benefit the learning of more difficult Ant-Maze tasks. \n(3) We believe the confusion comes from the misuse of the word \u201cplanning\u201d. Thanks for the valuable suggestions.\n\n>> Q2: \"Further, the interpolations between two sequences smoothly transfer from one to the other, which is a desired property to have during planning, because the smooth option space provides the RL algorithm with a better search space.\" By my reading of the paper, this claim is not studied. \n\nA2: This claim is just an intuitive explanation about why the learned option could benefit RL training. We show in gym tasks (Fig 7) and ant-maze tasks (Fig 8) that using option significantly speeds up the high-level learning. If we ask why using option is helpful, it\u2019s very difficult to analyze. We try to show some qualitative analysis by visualizing the option space of the simple 2D navigation example (Fig 5). Figure 5 shows interesting results that you can do interpolation between two options, and then decode them into action sequences. Those action sequences form a smooth transition (Fig 5 (a)). This is not surprising, it\u2019s kind of a known property of VAE. Intuitively speaking, search in a smooth option space should be easier to find a better solution than searching in an unsmooth one. \n\n>> Q3: No HRL baselines are compared to in the experiments. \n\nA3: In this work, we propose to handle HRL with a new framework. We have a two-stage procedure, which is different from existing methods (and which makes it harder to compare). Our primary intention is to show that performance of an RL learner could be improved based on our proposed framework. One can improve the performance by inserting a more powerful RL algorithm, or learning options from better experiences (using expert demonstration for example). By showing that our framework can learn useful abstractions from action sequences, and showing that the learned option could accelerate training of both seen and unseen tasks, we demonstrate the framework is effective and can be improved in many ways, as we discussed in the last section. In our opinion, the experiments have shown strong evidence of the effectiveness of our framework. \n\n>> Q4: The paper currently highlights the fact that the option-critic requires a pre-specified number of options: this is true, but it is not discussed why is this problematic, or how the current proposal remedies this difficulty. \n\nA4: The number of options has to be tuned for different tasks. As the case in the option-critic paper, they use different numbers for the navigation task and the pinball task. Their experiments showed that the performance is very sensitive to the number. Especially in real life applications, it is often very expensive to train multiple times in order to choose the parameters. \n\n>> Q5:  Why is the posterior (on $o$) conditioned only on the action history, and not state? \n\nA5: This is a design choice. We have a brief discussion on the open-loop controller and close-loop controller in the conclusion part. A close-loop controller would depend on state $s$. This could be a good direction for future study. \n\n>> Q6:  Additionally $o$ is being treated as a random variable through 3.2. So, what is $o$? Where is the randomness coming from? \n\nA6: The option in our formulation is a latent representation of a sequence of actions. We model the option following the definition of VAE, which treats the latent representation as a random variable. We should not have emphasized this too much, because the option does not have to be random in the TAIC framework. One can also use vanilla Auto-Encoders instead of VAE. It will also be an interesting study to analyze and compare the two. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1176/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1176/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["wenshanw@andrew.cmu.edu", "yaoyuh@andrew.cmu.edu", "basti@andrew.cmu.edu"], "title": "Learning Temporal Abstraction with Information-theoretic Constraints for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Wenshan Wang", "Yaoyu Hu", "Sebastian Scherer"], "pdf": "/pdf/a140c75853b27a3fb11e1a7b48bfd639a5a808a2.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a novel HRL framework, in which we formulate the temporal abstraction problem as learning a latent representation  of  action  sequence.", "abstract": "Applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world problems will require reasoning about action-reward correlation over long time horizons.

I am confused as to what the is L2 distance defined with respect to. \n\nA7: Sorry for the confusion. We followed the work of VAE (Kingma & Welling (2013)) and RVAE (Ha & Eck (2017)). \n\nFirst, let me clarify the notation. The $\\mathcal{A}$ denotes the action set. We use lower-case $a$ to denote a single action, which is a real value vector $\\mathbb{R}^n$ in our case. The $a_{0...k}$ denotes a sequence of actions. \n\nIn Section 3.2, we describe how we use the RVAE to encode the action sequences $a_{0...k}$  into an option $o$ (Ha & Eck (2017) did similar things to encode a sequence of strokes) (in which case an option $o$ is a real value vector). The RVAE minimizes a reconstruction loss plus a KL divergence loss (Eq 3). The reconstruction loss is defined as the L2 distance between two action sequences. \n\nIn Figure 1, we use the arrow to denote action, and the arrow trajectory denotes the action sequences. In Figure 1, the purple and blue action sequences are closer, however, they have different consequences (the ending state). While the purple and green ones are more different, but they have the same consequence. Under the definition of VAE\u2019s loss function, the blue and purple ones will be encoded closer. However, we argue it makes more sense to encode action sequences according to their consequences, which mean the purple and green one should be closer. This is the motivation of adding the information-theoretic constraints.\nOur method introduces a new regularization over the learned latent representation $o$ (or option $o$) in addition to the L2 distance. The new regularization encourages $o$ to encode action sequences in a way that options with similar consequences (state change) will be closer to each other. \n\n>> Q8: How is the estimate of the posterior actually used to act? The output of $D$ in Figure 2 is $\\hat{a}_{0...k}$. What is the type of this entity? Is it guaranteed to be an element of $\\mathcal{A}$? If so, then the \"option\" here is a policy that maps $o$ and the action history $a_{0...k}$ to a new action, correct? Ah, so in Figure 3, it looks like $D$ will have different output depending on how the termination condition is handled. Are the actions output by $D$ then executed by the RL agent, or is there some additional decision making that goes on downstream?\n\nA8: Sorry for the confusion. We find the Figure 2 is somehow too abstracted and confusing. In the above answer, we explained that we use RVAE to encode and decode action sequences and options. The RVAE has two parts, an encoder $E$ (maps action sequence $a_{0...k}$ to option $o$) and a decoder $D$ (maps opposite way). So the \u201coption\u201d is a latent representation of an action sequence. We first train this RVAE on pre-collected experiences (state-action sequences). Then the $D$ is fixed and works as a sub-policy in the HRL setting. We train a policy network that output option $o$, in order to maximize the reward, given a certain task. The option $o$ is decoded into a sequence of action by $D$, and executed in the simulation environment. \n\n>> Q9: Early on the section states \"In contrast to precisely reconstructing the action sequences, our goal is to extract the latent variable capturing  the information which could benefit RL training.\" It might be helpful to include some intuition about what this information would look like. It's unclear why action history would be all that meaningful on its own (without say, the state history). It would help the section to provide some intuition for such a latent variable existing; is there an idealized, simple case that would help convey the idea? \n\nA9: Generally speaking, the intuition behind learning abstraction from action sequence is that there are USEFUL PATTERNS in action sequences. Take human motion for example, you can clearly distinguish raising hands by a normal person and a person with Parkinson disease. Although there are infinite ways of raising hands, a lot of action combinations (e.g. the way a person with Parkinson disease raising his hand) are not that useful and common. Learning the patterns of useful action sequences could help us better control the body and achieve our goals more efficiently. In section 3.3, we describe this objective by saying \u201cextract the latent variable capturing the information which could benefit RL training\u201d. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1176/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1176/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["wenshanw@andrew.cmu.edu", "yaoyuh@andrew.cmu.edu", "basti@andrew.cmu.edu"], "title": "Learning Temporal Abstraction with Information-theoretic Constraints for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Wenshan Wang", "Yaoyu Hu", "Sebastian Scherer"], "pdf": "/pdf/a140c75853b27a3fb11e1a7b48bfd639a5a808a2.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a novel HRL framework, in which we formulate the temporal abstraction problem as learning a latent representation  of  action  sequence.", "abstract": "Applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world problems will require reasoning about action-reward correlation over long time horizons.

The $o$ is conditioned on $a_{0...k}$. We omit the $a_{0...k}$ for simplification.\n\n>> Q11: It is unclear how the option learning coordinates with the RL algorithm used. That is, suppose we train the HRL component to learn the mapping from $s, a_{0...k}$ to the constituents identified in Figure 2/3. Where does the actual RL take place? Does the algorithm just execute the actions output by $D$ at each time step? \n\nA11: Yes, you are correct. There are two learning phases. First we do the option learning, which involves every component except the RL in Figure 2. In the second phase, we train RL using PPO (it can be any RL algorithms) on the specific task. The policy pi trained by PPO algorithm outputs an option $o$, which is decoded to a sequence of actions $a_{0...k}$, which will be executed in the environment.   \n\n\n>> Q12: I do not understand Figure 6. It would be helpful to know the range of values it can take on, and how those values map to the displayed colors. Moreover, what is the take away from the figure? \n\nA12: As described in Section 3.3, we apply constraints on the encoder, so that the option is more correlated with state changes. Fig 6 gives a qualitative evaluation on this. How do we achieve this? The short answer is we execute options and see how the state changes. We first randomly sample 1000 options $\\{o_0, \u2026 o_{999}\\}$ (specific for the 2D navigation task, each option is a 6-d vector). Then we decode these options into action sequences $\\{a_{0...k_0}, a_{0...k_1}, ... , a_{0...k_{999}}\\}$. We apply these action sequences to the same state $s_{start}$, resulting in 1000 different end states $\\{s_0, ... , s_{999}\\}$. Thus, we visualize the correlation between 1000 options and 1000 end states (because the start states are the same, we use end state to denote state changes). How do we visualize the correlations? We now have 1000 one-to-one correspondence between option and state changes. The option is a 6-d vector, while the state is a 2-d vector. We use t-SNE to convert option to 3-d vector, which is associated to an RGB color. The state 2-d vector is associated to the 2-d coordinates. The take away message is that each point in the figure denotes a option-state correspondence. The more ordered (e.g. Figure 6, c) of the color, the more correlated of the state-option pair. \n\n>> Q13: In Figure 5, what does \"dimension disturbance in option space\" mean?\n\nA13: Each option is a 6-d vector. Fig 5 (b) visualizes what each dimension is encoding. How do we achieve this? The short answer is we disturb one dimension of the option at each time, decode the changed option and see how the action sequence change. We first encode an action sequence $a_{0...k}$ to an option $o$, disturb one dimension of $o$ by changing it gradually from -2.0 to 2.0 while fixing the other five dimensions. Then we decode the changed option $o\u2019$ into action sequence. In Fig 5 (b), the red trajectory is the original action sequence $a_{0...k}$, the other trajectories are the disturbed ones. We find each dimension of the option is interpretable. The first two dimensions are encoding the moving direction of the action sequence, while the rest are encoding the curvature. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1176/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1176/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["wenshanw@andrew.cmu.edu", "yaoyuh@andrew.cmu.edu", "basti@andrew.cmu.edu"], "title": "Learning Temporal Abstraction with Information-theoretic Constraints for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Wenshan Wang", "Yaoyu Hu", "Sebastian Scherer"], "pdf": "/pdf/a140c75853b27a3fb11e1a7b48bfd639a5a808a2.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a novel HRL framework, in which we formulate the temporal abstraction problem as learning a latent representation  of  action  sequence.", "abstract": "Applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world problems will require reasoning about action-reward correlation over long time horizons.

It appears to me that the experiment section does not provide a comparison with previous discrete option based methods as well.\n\nA1: Although the option we use in this paper is continuous, but our framework also supports discrete options.  We have not come to the conclusion of whether continuous or discrete options is more preferable. The main purpose of our method is trying to abstract high-level representations from the action sequences. In order to do so, we utilize the RVAE, which encodes sequential data into a continuous latent representation. It will be an interesting future direction to see how it works if we use discrete latent representation. For example, we can assume Bernoulli distribution instead of Gaussian distribution in the RVAE latent space, which will result in a discrete option. In this case, we can use DQN or other discrete RL solvers on top of it. \n\nOne obvious tradeoff between continuous and discrete options is that the continuous option has more expressibility (theoretically, it can model an infinite number of action sequences uniquely); while training discrete options might be harder, but it can gigantically reduce the size of option space, which could benefit the RL training. \n\n>> Q2: It appears to be that the\"option\" is a sequence of actions? This can only happen in the deterministic environment. What will you do if applying pi does not give the same sequence of actions? For instance, from (s1,a1) -> (s2, a2), where s2 is generated from a random distribution, and a2 is based on s2.\n\nA2: The option in our formulation is a latent representation of a sequence of actions. \nThen the decoder D is responsible for decoding the option back into a sequence of action. The learning happens in two phases. First, the encoder E and decoder D are trained on sequences of actions with other networks (P and F) as regularization. Second, during the HRL training, the policy pi learns to output an option, which is decoded by the decoder D. The algorithm is not restricted to deterministic environments, because the policy pi learns to output accordingly with the state. In our experiments, the pi outputs a random variable, same as the setup in the PPO algorithm. \n\n>> Notations and typo.\nWe have added the notation, and changed the typo. \n\n>> The paper is overlength \nThe current manuscript is in the limit of ICLR, which is 10 pages.

More recent work seeks to learn the temporal abstraction with deep learning (Florensa et al., 2017; Tessler et al., 2017; Haarnoja et al., 2018a). However, many of these methods still require a predefined hierarchical policy structure (e.g. the number of sub-policies), or need some degree of task-specific knowledge (e.g. hand-crafted reward function).\"\n\nThese are rather recent references.

Additionally, the paper proposes to regularize the learning of this representation using an information-theoretic constraint, yielding Temporal Abstraction with Information-theoretic Constraints (TIAC). Indeed, one promise of HRL is to allow for learning and decision making algorithms to take the long-term consequences of a decision into account when planning, exploring, assigning credit, or simply acting. The options framework (Sutton, Precup, and Singh; 1999) is a promising and well-studied toolkit for investigating these capacities of HRL. For this reason, the topic of the paper is well chosen: continuing to understand how options can benefit and accelerate RL in rich environments is an important direction for research. The idea at the core of the paper is new to my knowledge: learning an encoding of action sequences with a continuous latent representation. It could be a promising technique for HRL. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the method in several environments, including a continuous gridworld, control tasks, and problems involving transfer learning. \n\nVerdict: Due to lack of clarity in describing the main methods, and missing comparison to any HRL/option baselines, I recommend rejection.\n\nMore Detail:\n\nThe paper is lacking clarity in its current form. I view the main contribution as the development of the architecture and loss function that together learn an appropriate latent action representation. There are two key issues with clarity at present: 1) The presentation of the core technical contributions could be improved (see comments below in \"Q1\"), and 2) Motivation for this style of option learning is missing, with evidence that the proposed method is in fact learning an appropriate thing.\n\nToward (1): I provide suggestions where clarity could be improved below in \"Q1'.\n\nToward (2): There are a few aspects of the motivation that could be improved. First, the paper mentions that the learned options/representation will help in planning, but planning is not studied in the paper. For example: \"Further, the interpolations between two sequences smoothly transfer from one to the other, which is a desired property to have during planning, because the smooth option space provides the RL algorithm with a better search space.\" By my reading of the paper, this claim is not studied. Similarly, in the intro: \"...allow us to do planning at a higher level, and easily transfer the knowledge between different tasks\". Including experiments that explicitly evaluate the capacity of the learned representation to carry out planning would help support these claims. Or, alternatively, the contribution could be focused to model-free and policy-based learning, which is where the empirical evidence currently offers the most support. Second, no HRL baselines are compared to in the experiments. One natural comparison to include would be to the Option-Critic, which was the first technique for combining option learning with deep RL. To determine whether TIAC is a sensible approach to learning and using options, a comparison to at least one other option learning method is needed. The paper currently highlights the fact that the option-critic requires a pre-specified number of options: this is true, but it is not discussed why is this problematic, or how the current proposal remedies this difficulty. Others that may be relevant include FuN (Vezhnevets et al. 2017), the recent methods of Nachum et al. (2018), among others (Tiwari and Thomas 2019, Harb et al. 2018, Harutyunyan et al. 2019, Levy et al. 2019).\n\nIn short: the results here are promising, so I encourage the authors continue in this direction. The paper will be improved if the presentation of Section 3 is sharpened (see questions regarding clarity below) and a comparison with relevant baselines is included. \n\nMain Questions:\n\nQ1: The exposition of the main method (Section 3) was unclear to me. Here are a few questions I was left with:\n\n\t(a) Why is the posterior (on $o$) conditioned only on the action history, and not state?\n\t(b) Additionally $o$ is being treated as a random variable through 3.2. So, what is $o$? Where is the randomness coming from?\n\t(c) Section 3.3 states \"it encodes the action sequences with respect to the L2 distance in action space\". Does this mean the action space is always a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$? But, it looks like $\\mathcal{A}$ is just defined as some set: in Section 3.1, \"$\\mathcal{A}$ is the action set\". So, I am confused as to what the $L_2$ is distance defined with respect to. If the actions are always assumed to be real numbers that is entirely okay, but it would be helpful to have that stated early on. From the additional text in Section 3.3, it sounds like the transition function of each action is involved in computing this distance (\"...only have small difference in each step of action. Due to the error compounding, the two sequences...\"). \n\t(d) How is the estimate of the posterior actually used to act? The output of \"D\" in Figure 2 is $\\hat{a_{0...k}}$. What is the type of this entity? Is it guaranteed to be an element of $\\mathcal{A}$? If so, then the \"option\" here is a policy that maps $o$ and the action history $a_{0...k}$ to a new action, correct? Ah, so in Figure 3, it looks like D will have different output depending on how the termination condition is handled. Are the actions output by $D$ then executed by the RL agent, or is there some additional decision making that goes on downstream?\n\t(e) Early on the section states \"In contrast to precisely reconstructing the action sequences, our goal is to extract the latent variable capturing  the information which could benefit RL training.\" It might be helpful to include some intuition about what this information would look like. It's unclear why action history would be all that meaningful on its own (without say, the state history). It would help the section to provide some intuition for such a latent variable existing; is there an idealized, simple case that would help convey the idea? Note that this proposal comes across as different from the original proposal of the options framework: As an example, Sutton, Precup, and Singh (1999) say: \"options enable temporally abstract knowledge and action to be included in the reinforcement learning framework in a natural and general way\". This temporally abstract knowledge need not be a function of the entire action history. I like this aspect of the method as it makes the proposed algorithm quite novel, but the motivation for why this should work didn't come through for me.\n\t(h) Should the mutual information in Eq. 4 be the conditional mutual information given $a_{0...k}$? (Same question for the remaining uses of $I$ and $H$).\n\t(i) It is unclear how the option learning coordinates with the RL algorithm used. That is, suppose we train the HRL component to learn the mapping from $s, a_{0...k}$ to the constituents identified in Figure 2/3. Where does the actual RL take place? Does the algorithm just execute the actions output by $D$ at each time step? \n\nQ2: In the first experiment, it is stated: \"because the smooth option space provides the RL algorithm with a better search space.\" Any thoughts as to why this is true? Including some discussion here might help motivate the approach.\n\n\nMinor Comments:\n\n\tC1: I do not understand Figure 6. The color is said to denote \"the distribution of options\", but I couldn't quite make out what this was, precisely. It would be helpful to know the range of values it can take on, and how those values map to the displayed colors. Moreover, what is the take away from the figure? The text states \"with information-theoretic constraints the options and state changes become more correlated\" but I am having trouble connecting that claim with the visuals themselves.

It proposes a framework TAIC that learns temporal abstraction from past experience or expert demons without task-specific knowledge. The method is to formulate the problem by a temporal abstraction problem. That is, they assume that the action sequence is generated by a latent variable o. By regularizing the latent space by adding information-theoretic constraints, they are able to learn the representation. The paper later uses visualization to demonstrate the effectiveness of the learning. \n\nI would think this paper is slightly below the borderline. It is an interesting method of encoding the option sequence by a continuous variable. Therefore, the action space becomes continuous rather than discrete. However, I found it not convincing why continuous option space is better than discrete ones. It appears to me that the experiment section does not provide a comparison with previous discrete option based methods as well. \n\nComments:\n* 4th line of related work: Parr --> \"Parr & Russel\"\n* Page 2, problem formulation: in beta(s,o), s is not defined. Maybe you can denote it as beta_o(.).\n* It appears to be that the\"option\" is a sequence of actions? This can only happen in the deterministic environment. What will you do if applying pi does not give the same sequence of actions? For instance, from (s1,a1) -> (s2, a2), where s2 is generated from a random distribution, and a2 is based on s2.\n* the paper is overlength "}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1176/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1176/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["wenshanw@andrew.cmu.edu", "yaoyuh@andrew.cmu.edu", "basti@andrew.cmu.edu"], "title": "Learning Temporal Abstraction with Information-theoretic Constraints for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Wenshan Wang", "Yaoyu Hu", "Sebastian Scherer"], "pdf": "/pdf/a140c75853b27a3fb11e1a7b48bfd639a5a808a2.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a novel HRL framework, in which we formulate the temporal abstraction problem as learning a latent representation  of  action  sequence.", "abstract": "Applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world problems will require reasoning about action-reward correlation over long time horizons.
