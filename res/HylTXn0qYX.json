Furthermore, the optimality test also requires a robust analysis. Therefore, I believe the current version is still incomplete so I changed my score. I encourage author(s) to add the robust analysis and submit to the next top machine learning conference.\n\n-------------------------------------------\nPaper Summary:\nThis paper gives a new algorithm to check whether a given point is a (generalized) second-order stationary point if not, it can return a strict descent direction even at this point the objective function (empirical risks of two-layer ReLU or Leaky-ReLU networks) is not differentiable.\nThe main challenge comes from the non-differentiability of ReLU. While testing a second-order stationary point is easy, because of the non-differentiability, one needs to test 2^M regions in the ReLU case. This paper exploits the special structure of two-layer ReLU network and shows it suffices to check only the extreme rays of the polyhedral cones which are the feasible sets of these 2^M linear programs. \n\nComments:\n1. About Motivation. While checking the optimality on a non-differentiable point is a  mathematically interesting problem, it has little use in deep learning.  In practice, SGD often finds a global minimum easily of ReLU-activated deep neural networks [1].\n2. This algorithm can only test if a point is a real SOSP. In practice, we can only hope to get an approximate SOSP. I expect a robust analysis, i.e., can we check whether it is a (\\epsilon,\\delta) SOSP?\n3. About writing: g(z,\\eta) and H(z,\\eta) appear in Section 1 and Section 2, and they are used to define generalized SOSP. However, their formal definitions are in Lemma 2. I suggest give the formal definitions in Section 1 or Section 2 and give more intuitions on their formulas.\n\nMinor Comments:\n1. Many typos in references, e.g., cnn -> CNN.\n2. Page 4: Big-Oh -> Big O.\n\n\n\nOverall I think this paper presents some interesting ideas but I am unsatisfied with the issues above. I am happy to see the authors\u2019 response, and I may modify my score. \n\n\n[1] Zhang, C., Bengio, S., Hardt, M., Recht, B., & Vinyals, O. (2016).

Please refer to item (1) of the comment.\n\n2) It is true that the set of nondifferentiable points has measure zero. On the other hand, please note that a nondifferentiable point can have multiple boundary data points, i.e., x_i\u2019s that satisfy [W_1 x_i + b_1]_k = 0 for some k (input to the k-th hidden node is zero for this x_i). Also, such nondifferentiable points with many boundary data points lie on the intersection of subsets of the parameter space, where each subset corresponds to one boundary data point x_i and contains the parameter values satisfying [W_1 x_i + b_1]_k = 0.\nOur experiments were run for an extended period of time with exponentially decaying step size, to get as close to the exact nondifferentiable point (potentially local minimum) as possible. And then, we counted the number of \u201capproximate\u201d boundary data points, i.e., x_i\u2019s that satisfied abs( [W_1 x_i + b_1]_k ) < 1e-5 for some k. In our experimental settings, it turns out that gradient descent pushes the parameters to a point with multiple boundary data points (i.e., M is large), but there are usually very few flat extreme rays (i.e., L is small).\n\n3a) At our current stage of results, we are not claiming that our algorithm is useful in practice. By the experimental results, we are claiming the following: 1) given that M can be large in practice, our analysis of nondifferentiable points is meaningful, 2) L is usually very small in our experiments, so testing local minimality at nondifferentiable points can be tractable.\n\n3b) Our analysis for now is limited to one-hidden-layer networks. For deeper networks, perturbation on the first layer may affect later layers, so the extension to deep networks is beyond the scope of this paper. For now, we leave this extension as future work.\n\n3c) Due to multiple reviewers with similar concerns, we addressed this issue in a separate comment above. Please refer to item (2) of the comment.\n\n3d) Your observation is true, because other activation functions do not have nondifferentiable points. In such cases, we can directly compute the gradient and Hessian, so the second-order stationarity test is straightforward. However, ReLU is one of the most popular activation functions, and it inevitably introduces nondifferentiable points in the empirical risk, which are difficult to analyze. The goal of our paper is to shed light on a better understanding of such nonsmooth points."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1404/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1404/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1404/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Efficiently testing local optimality and escaping saddles for ReLU networks", "abstract": "We provide a theoretical algorithm for checking local optimality and escaping saddles at nondifferentiable points of empirical risks of two-layer ReLU networks.

We would like to emphasize that this paper is a theoretical contribution seeking to understand the nondifferentiable points of the empirical risk surface of ReLU networks. As noted in the introduction, our understanding of nonsmooth points of empirical risk is limited, but in some cases, nonsmooth points can be precisely the \u201cinteresting points\u201d that we care about. In this paper, we are theoretically/empirically showing that testing local optimality/second order stationarity at nondifferentiable points can be tractable (if the number of flat extreme rays is small), by exploiting the geometric structure of empirical risk.\nBut we fully agree (as also noted in Section 1 in the Remarks and in Section 5) that creating a numerically robust version of this algorithm that works for \u201cclose-to-nondifferential\u201d points and approximate SOSPs will be needed before our theoretical work can attain its true practical significance---this goal requires a fairly substantial amount of effort (both theory and practice) and we hope to tackle it in the future.\n\n(2) Regarding practical usefulness of the algorithm \nReviewers 1 and 4 raised concerns whether this algorithm is really meaningful in practice, given that SGD already performs well enough without our algorithm. It is true that in practice, SGD easily achieves near-zero empirical risk most of the time. However, please note that the solutions that we obtain at the end of training are not necessarily global or even local minima, because in practice we don\u2019t have optimality tests / certificates during training.\nIn contrast, one of the most important beneficial features of convex optimization is existence of an optimality test (e.g., norm of the gradient is smaller than a certain threshold) for termination, which gives us a certificate of optimality. One of our motivations is that deep learning may also benefit from such optimality tests. Our analysis and experimental results suggest that even in the nonconvex and nonsmooth case of ReLU networks, it is sometimes not too difficult to get such a certificate of local optimality (we remind the readers that in general detecting local optimality for nonconvex problems is \u201cNP-Hard\u201d).\nWith a proper numerical implementation of our algorithm (although we leave it for future work), one can run a first-order method until it gets stuck near a point, and run our algorithm to test for optimality/second-order stationarity. If the point is an (approximate) SOSP, we can terminate without further computation time over many epochs; if the point has a descent direction, our algorithm will return a descent direction and we can continue on optimizing. Note that the descent direction may come from the second-order information; our algorithm even allows us to escape nonsmooth second-order saddle points.\n\nWe address the remaining points individually."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1404/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1404/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1404/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Efficiently testing local optimality and escaping saddles for ReLU networks", "abstract": "We provide a theoretical algorithm for checking local optimality and escaping saddles at nondifferentiable points of empirical risks of two-layer ReLU networks.

As these test can be written as QPs, the core challenge is that if there are M boundary points in the dataset, i.e.,  data points on a non-differentiable region of the ReLU function, then the FOSP test requires 2^M tests of extreme rays -- each boundary partition the whole space into at least two parts.

The technique is non-trivial and requires some key observation to make it computationally efficient. However, I have the following concerns:\n1) such a test may need very high numeric precision. For instance, you cannot make sure whether a floating point number is strictly greater than 0 or not. The small error may critically affect the property of a point. \n2) boundary points of a ReLU network should have measure 0 (correct me if not). The finding in the experiment shows surprisingly many boundary points. This is counter-intuitive. Is it because of numeric issues? You might misclassify non-boundary points.\n3) Usefulness. \n    a.

The proposed \"checking algorithm\" involves solving convex and non-convex quadratic programs (QP) which can be done in polynomial time. The paper is well organized and technically correct with detailed proofs.\n\nComments:\n1) Applicability issue: the conditions required by the proposed checking algorithm are too ideal, making it difficult to apply in practical applications. For example, the first step of the proposed algorithm is to check whether 0 belongs to the subdifferential. In practice, the iterates may get very close to a stationary point, but arriving to a stationary point might be too time-consuming and unrealistic. If the problem is smooth, then the gradient is expected to be small so that one can easily relax this first order optimality condition by allowing a small gradient. However, since here the problem is nonsmooth, in general the subgradient could be still very large even when the iterate is very close to a stationary point.  Therefore, one would need to relax the ideal conditions in the proposed algorithm to make it more applicable.\n\n2) Another concern is that the efficiency of the proposed method relies too much on the empirical result that the number of flat extreme ray is small. The computational complexities for the test of the local optimality is exponentially depending on the number of flat extreme rays. Thus to guarantee a high efficiency of the proposed test algorithm and to make the main theory sound, it is important to provide a theoretical bound on this number. Without appropriate theoretical guarantees on the upper-bound of this number, it is not persuasive to claim that the proposed theoretical algorithm is of high efficiency.\n \n3) The computational complexity is proportional to the number of training data points which could be huge. Is it possible to have a stochastic version?\n\nTypos:\n1) On page 2, under Section 2, ``$h(t):=$\" should be ``$h(x):=$\"\n\n2) In section 2.1, at the end of the paragraph \"Bisection by boundary data points\": change $b_1$ by $\\delta_1$ in ``$\\Delta_1x_i+b_1$\".\n\n3) On page 4, when defining B_k, change x by x_i. \n\n4) On page 5, above Lemma 1, when defining C_k, N(x_i) is not well defined.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1404/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Efficiently testing local optimality and escaping saddles for ReLU networks", "abstract": "We provide a theoretical algorithm for checking local optimality and escaping saddles at nondifferentiable points of empirical risks of two-layer ReLU networks.

The method works for a specific non-differentiable loss.  In the worst case, there can be exponentially many flat directions to check (2^L), but usually this is no the case.\n\nOverall, I'm impressed. The analysis seems solid, and a lot of clever ideas are used to get around issues (such as exponential number of regions, and non-convex QPs that cannot be solved by the S-procedure or simple tricks). A wide-variety of techniques are used: non-smooth analysis, recent analysis of non-convex QPs, copositive optimization.\n\nThe writing is clear and makes most arguments easy to follow.\n\nThere are some limitations:\n\n(1) the technical details are hard to follow, and most are in a lengthy appendix, which I did not check\n\n(2) there was no discussion of robustness. If I find a direction eta for which the directional derivative is zero, what do you mean by \"zero\"? This is implemented on a computer, so we don't really expect to find a directional derivative that is exactly zero.  I would have liked to see some discussions with epsilons, and give me a guarantee of an epsilon-SOSP or some kind of notion.  In the experiments, this isn't discussed (though another issue is touched on a little bit: you wanted to find real stationary points to test, but you don't have exactly stationary points, but rather can get arbitrarily close).  To make this practical, I think you need a robust theory.\n\n(3) The numerical simulations mainly provided some evidence that there are usually not too many flat directions, but don't convince us that this is a useful technique on a real problem.  The discussion about possible loss functions at the end was a bit opaque.  Furthermore, if you can't find a dataset/loss, then why is this technique useful?\n\nThe paper is interesting and novel enough that despite the limitations, I am supportive of publishing it. It introduces new ideas that I find refreshing. The technique many not ever make it into the state-of-the-art algorithms, but I think the paper has intellectual value regardless of practical value.\n\nIn short, quality = high, clarity=high, originality=very high, and significance=hard-to-predict", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1404/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Efficiently testing local optimality and escaping saddles for ReLU networks", "abstract": "We provide a theoretical algorithm for checking local optimality and escaping saddles at nondifferentiable points of empirical risks of two-layer ReLU networks.
