Surprisingly, there seems to be no trade-off, but too low a number of power iterations will result in sub-optimal performance even if the average correlation is already low. We describe this qualitatively in the section on the experiments using synthetic data, and we included the progression plots for both metrics in the Appendix. \n\nAlso, in Section 6.1, we conducted new experiments with non-linear models (a quadratic expansion network, common for non-linear SFA, and a multi-layer perceptron) on a non-linearly distorted version of the synthetic data. The experiments show that gradient-based training can improve performance when compared with greedy layer-wise training. \nTwo things should be noted: (a) The experimental setup is not exhaustive (e.g., no systematic model selection has been conducted), but we believe it does illustrate the conceptual promise of the paradigm. (b) Kernelized SFA has not been included in these experiments, as there is no implementation readily available at the moment. \n\nThe new architectures have been shared as a high-level overview in the Appendix and as actual implementation in the provided code. \n\n\nOn Clarity & Reproducibility:\nTo promote reproducibility, we uploaded code for the synthetic experiments (including the newly conducted ones) as well as for the NORB experiments. The \"Discussion\" section contains a link to the archive. The code includes a stand-alone implementation of the whitening layer in the Keras framework. We hope that this improves comprehensibility and encourages original experimentation with this method.\n\n\nOn Significance:\nNothing for us to reply to here, the description is spot-on.\n\n\nOn Originality:\nWe tried to make the differences between the mentioned work and ours more visible. While both papers are aiming to solve a similar problem, our method relies mainly on an simple architectural change (which is, however, applicable independently of the objective), while SpINs are theoretically derived directly from a more general problem formulation and their success stems from a smart optimization of a loss that enforces the constraints. We do see distinct merit in both approaches.\n\n\nOn Details:\na) The noise is a precautionary measure as closed-form SFA can have the problem of breaking due to linear dependencies in the data, and we do sample the data-generating coefficients randomly. While the current version of MDP (the framework we used for closed-form SFA) available on github includes methods to deal with this problem, the initial experiments have been conducted with the version published on PyPI which does not have this feature yet. We included a brief note on this in Section 6.1.\nb, c, d) Have been corrected.\ne) We agree that it is a little bold, but we decided to go with this name for two reasons: It hints at the core method underlying the algorithm and thus might be a useful mnemonic, and it caught on in our discussions, despite the actual decision to change it. As it is hard to come up with memorable and descriptive names, we ultimately decided to be a little bold.\n\nWe greatly appreciate the time and effort you spent on reviewing our submission and hope you find your concerns addressed in our current revision.\n\nRespectfully,\nthe Authors"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper172/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper172/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper172/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Gradient-based Training of Slow Feature Analysis by Differentiable Approximate Whitening", "abstract": "We propose Power Slow Feature Analysis, a gradient-based method to extract temporally slow features from a high-dimensional input stream that varies on a faster time-scale, as a variant of Slow Feature Analysis (SFA).

While we did not perform major refactoring of the manuscript, we feel that this has already made a difference in accessibility. To make the method more understandable, the source code for the whitening layer, as well as for most experiments, was made available online (link in \"Discussion\").\n\n\nOn SpIN:\nWe did remove the note that this contribution was simultaneous to SpIN to resolve the ambiguity. Also, we tried to elaborate on our stance on the qualitative differences of these methods, even though both are applied to similar problems.\nSpecifically, one advantage of our method lies in versatility and simplicity while SpINs do have a stronger theoretical foundation and are derived directly from the problem formulation. Due to this difference, we see merit in pursuing both approaches in distinct investigations.\n\nOn the incremental nature of our work:\nWe agree with the interpretation you described. The novelty of our work is mainly contained in the idea to use differentiable whitening to make it possible to train SFA by gradient-descent. This is incremental, but in two ways:\n1) It allows to possibly improve upon solutions found in the expansion + closed-form setting. We added a small experiment to Section 6.1 to illustrate this.\n2) It allows to use arbitrary architectures for slow feature extraction without much additional effort, as long as they are differentiable. Having modern architectural design choices or even proven, possibly pre-trained, architectures at your disposal might aid model performance when applying SFA.\nWe hope that this contributes to a more thorough, future investigation of the slowness principle for learning useful representations.\n\n\nThank you again for your time and advice!\n\nRespectfully,\nthe Authors"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper172/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper172/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper172/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Gradient-based Training of Slow Feature Analysis by Differentiable Approximate Whitening", "abstract": "We propose Power Slow Feature Analysis, a gradient-based method to extract temporally slow features from a high-dimensional input stream that varies on a faster time-scale, as a variant of Slow Feature Analysis (SFA).

In fact, it is just an unordered version of the original SFA loss (which is in itself differentiable already).\n\nThe whole novelty lies in the idea of using the described whitening layer, thus, incorporating the constraints in the model rather than the loss function. The paper you mentioned can be seen as doing the latter. Thus, we understand it to fall in line with \"Bergstra, J. and Bengio, Y. - Slow, decorrelated features for pretraining complex celllike networks\" where a penalty term for covariances is included in the loss function. Futhermore, the probabilistic model by Turner and Sahani is not optimized by gradient-descent, but trained by the Expectation Maximization algorithm.\n\nWe tried to clarify that the derivation of the objective function is not an involved or novel part of our algorithm, e.g., in the description for equation (2).

The resulting method is thus more flexible and expressive and less hand-crafted than traditional SFA approaches. The paper shows experiments that validate that the method can learn meaningful representations in practice.\n\nThe writing is difficult to follow, unclear in several places, and has grammatical mistakes. As a result, it is more challenging to understand the proposed method, its motivation, and its precise place among related literature. For example, the authors discuss SpIN, and from that discussion, it seems that SpIN are quite similar; SpIN was submitted to arXiv 3-4 months before the ICLR deadline and thus is not concurrent as the authors claim (on my understanding, from reading the ICLR and other ML conference guidelines).\n\nThe approach does seem somewhat incremental, though I would be open to changing my mind on author response.

A set of experiments illustrates that this way of doing nonlinear SFA is meaningful.\n\nQuality\nAlthough the idea is pretty straight forward and the paper shows qualitative results on a number of datasets, the relative merit of the approach is empirically not well characterized.\n\nClarity\nThe manuscript is in general well written and the technical content is well accessible. However the description of the whitening layer implementation needs some more details.\n\nOriginality\nThe idea of using a whitening layer together with the slowness objective has not been explored before. There is a second ICLR 2019 submission (Pfau et al.) with a very similar idea, though.\n\nEmpirical Evaluation\nThe approximate whitening should lead to a trade-off between whitening and slowness optimization. I miss an experiment illustrating that trade-off. Also the comparison to nonlinear SFA using expansion or kernelization of hierarchical SFA is empirically not properly characterized. In the end, if one takes the slowness objective seriously, one would use the method yielding slower results.\n\nSignificance\nThe manuscript introduces a way of running nonlinear SFA with approximate constraints in a general deep learning setting with a differentiable implementation using a dedicated whitening layer based on power iterations.\n\nReproducibility\nThe data is either synthetic or publicly available. The Keras implementation of the PowerWhitening layer as well as the entire neural network along with its optimization schedule is not shared. Hence, there should be some effort involved to reproduce the experiments.\n\nPros and Cons\n1+) The idea of an approximate whitening layer is conceptually simple and clear.\n2-) The description of the practical implementation of the power iteration is slightly imprecise.\n3-) The algorithm scales badly in the number of output dimensions. This scaling is bad in a computational sense and also in a statistical sense.\n\nDetails\na) Section 6.1: Why do you need to add the noise term?
