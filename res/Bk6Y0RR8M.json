In the context of EEG, only a few exploratory works have proposed and the authors blame the limited spatial resolution of EEG, that keeps from having rich graph structure.\nThe authors propose a two-step method to build such structure and evaluate different approaches to do so. The EEG signal is split in F=8 frequency bands. The first step is to define an intra-band connectivity for a given band between the electrode, then to compute an inter-bad connectivity. The EEG signal is thus converted in FxN nodes, where N is the number of electrodes. \nThe experiments are conducted on DEAP dataset, using ChebNet architecture to process the input graphs. The results are interesting and show that using an inter-band connectivity depending on the distance between electrodes yields the best results, the choice for intra-band connectivity has no specific effect and a random graph offers good performances.\nThe contribution is very interesting as finding a correct representation of EEG signal is still an important challenge for deep architecture.
