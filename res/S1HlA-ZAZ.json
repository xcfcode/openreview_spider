The claim is that this approach is easier to train than other memory-based architectures. The model seems sound, and it is described clearly. The experimental validation seems a bit limited: most of the comparisons are against plain VAEs, which aren't a memory-based architecture. The discussion of \"one-shot generalization\" is confusing, since the task is modified without justification to have many categories and samples per category. The experiment of Section 4.4 seems promising, but this needs to be expanded to more tasks and baselines since it's the only experiment that really tests the Kanerva Machine as a memory architecture. Despite these concerns, I think the idea is promising and this paper contributes usefully to the discussion, so I recommend acceptance.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Kanerva Machine: A Generative Distributed Memory", "abstract": "We present an end-to-end trained memory system that quickly adapts to new data and generates samples like them.

Neat idea, little discussion and comparison to related work.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "review": "The generative model comprises a real-valued matrix M (with a multivariate normal prior) that serves\nas the memory for an episode (an unordered set of datapoints). For each datapoint a marginally independent\nlatent variable y_t is used to index into M and realize a conditional density\nof another latent variable z. z_t is used to generate the data.\n\nThe proposal of learning with a probabilistic memory is interesting and the framework proposed is elegant and cleanly explained. The model is evaluated on the following tasks:\n* Qualitative results on denoising and one-shot generation using the Omniglot dataset.\n* Qualitative results on sampling from the model using the CIFAR dataset.\n* Likelihood estimation on the Omniglot dataset\n\nQuestions and concerns: \n\nThe model appears novel and is interesting, the experiments, however, are lacking in that they\ndo not compare against other any recently proposed memory augmented deep generative models [Bornschein et al] and [Li et. al] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07416.pdf). At the very minimum, the paper should include a discussion and a comparison with the latter. Doing so will help better understand what is gained from using retaining a probabilistic form of memory versus a determinstic memory indexed with attention as in [Li et. al].\n\nHow does the model perform as a function of varying T (size of episodes) during training? It would be interesting to see how well the model performs in the limiting case of T=1.\n\nWhat is the task being solved in Section 4.4 by the DNC and the Kanerva machine? Please state this in the main paper.\n\nTraining and Evaluation: There is a mismatch in the training and evaluation procedure the implications of which I don't\nfully understand yet. The text states that the model was trained where each observation in an episode comprised randomly sampled datapoints. This corresponds to a generative process where (1) a memory is randomly drawn, (2) each observation in the episode is an independent draws from the memory conditioned decoder. During training,\npoints in an episode are randomly selected. At test time, (if I understand correctly, please correct me if I haven't), the model is evaluated by having multiple copies of the same test point within an episode. Is that correct? If so, doesn't that correspond to evaluating the model under a different generative assumption? Why is this OK?\n\nLikelihood evaluation: Could you expand on how the ELBO of 68.3 is computed under the model for a single test image in the Omniglot dataset? The text says that the likelihood of each data-point was divided by T (the length of the episode considered). This seems at odds with models, such as DRAW, evaluate the likelihood -- once at the end of the generative drawing process. What is the per-pixel likelihood obtained on the CIFAR dataset and what is the likelihood on a model where T=1 (for omniglot/cifar)?\n\nUsing Labels: Following up on the previous point, what happens if labelled information from Omniglot or CIFAR is used to define points within an episode during the training procedure? Does this help or hurt performance?\n\nFor the denoising comparison, how do the results compare to those obtained if you simulate a Markov Chain (sample latent state conditioned on noisy image, sample latent state, sample denoised observation, repeat using denoised observation) using a VAE?", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Kanerva Machine: A Generative Distributed Memory", "abstract": "We present an end-to-end trained memory system that quickly adapts to new data and generates samples like them.

We have added a new paragraph (3rd in the Discussion section) to describe the relations with these 2 papers.\nWhile both of these models share some commonalities with our model, they also have key differences which make direct experimental comparisons problematic.  As we describe in more detail in the Discussion, our paper addresses a different, although related, problem --- updating memory optimally.  As you mentioned, such update is not possible with the memory in Li et al., which is fixed over the course of episodes. Similarly, the likelihoods from our model have a very different meaning from Bornschein et al., since the only ambiguity in retrieving stored patterns in their model was in the categorical addressing variable; their model stores images in memory in the form of raw-pixels. We instead store compressed embeddings in a distributed fashion. As a result, the objective function we use (eq. 2) becomes a constant 0 for the model in Bornschein et al., since the mutual information between the memory and an episode of images I(X; M) is simply the entropy of these images H(X), when all these images are directly stored in the memory.\n\nHow does the model perform as a function of varying T (size of episodes) during training? ... the limiting case of T=1.\n\n-- The performance under varying T is shown in figure 6 (right). There is a smooth rise of test loss with increasing T, and T=1 does not seem to be very different.\n\nWhat is the task being solved in Section 4.4 by the DNC and the Kanerva machine? Please state this in the main paper.\n\n-- We now clarify this in the main paper. It is the same episode storage and retrieval task as earlier in the paper, only we now look at the test regime where episode lengths are longer.\n\nTraining and Evaluation: There is a mismatch in the training and evaluation procedure the implications of which I don't fully understand yet \u2026\n\n-- With one exception there is no mismatch in training and evaluation, though we can now see where confusion may have crept in. We have revised the description in the paper to clarify this. In general, training and testing follow the same sampling procedure in constructing the episodes. The single exception is in the omniglot one-shot generation and comparison with DNC, where we control the number of Omniglot classes in an episode during testing for illustrative purpose only [i.e. to illustrate what happens with different levels of redundancy in the input data].  For all other comparisons the train and test losses and visualisation are identical.\n\nLikelihood evaluation: ... how the ELBO of 68.3 is computed \u2026 This seems at odds with models, such as DRAW \u2026 What is the per-pixel likelihood obtained on the CIFAR dataset...?\n\n-- \u201cT\u201d has different meanings in our model and in DRAW. DRAW is an autoregressive model that uses T steps to construct *one* image; in our model, T is the number of images, so we divide the total log-likelihood of T (conditionally) independent images by T for comparison. The likelihood of 5329 can be converted to the per-pixel bits 4.4973.\n\n--To get the number of 68.3, we first compute the ELBO for the conditional log-likelihood of an episode with 32 images, which is log P(x_1, x_2, \u2026 x_32 | M)  = 2185.6. Since log P(x_1, x_2, \u2026 x_32 | M) = log P(x_1|M) + log P(x_1|M) + ..+ log P(x_32|M) (conditional independence / exchangeability), we can compute the average ELBO for each image by dividing 2185.6 / 32 = 68.3.\n\nUsing Labels: ... what happens if labelled information from Omniglot or CIFAR is used to define points within an episode during the training procedure? \n\n-- This is an interesting point. We think it will help performance, since the additional label information may help the model further reduce redundancy. We only trained on the worst case scenario without such information.\n\nHow do the results compare to those obtained if you simulate a Markov Chain using a VAE?\n\n-- We tried iterative sampling using a VAE as well. However, iterative sampling did not improve performance with a VAE --- which is why, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been used in previous literature. In our model iterative sampling works because of the structure of the generative model (section 3.5). We now discuss this in the revision and illustrated it in a new figure (Figure 8 in the Appendix).\n\nMany thanks for the comments which have helped us improve the manuscript.
