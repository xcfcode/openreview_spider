Specifically, this paper builds very closely on the work started by  Henderson et al. 2017, building a conversation around the importance of more rigorous and careful scientific study of published algorithms. This paper identifies many \"code-level optimizations\" that account for the differences between the popular TRPO and PPO deep policy gradient algorithms. The paper then subselects four of these optimizations and carefully investigates their impact on the final performance of each algorithm. The clear conclusion from the paper is that the touted algorithmic improvement of PPO over TRPO has negligible effect on performance, and any previously reported differences are due only to what were considered unimportant implementation details.\n\nReview\n\nThis paper investigates the claims made by Schulman et al. 2017 carefully, by investigating the impact of PPO's clipping mechanism on maintaining a valid trust-region; the central claim made by PPO's originating paper. The empirical results suggest that PPO is not sufficient for maintaining a valid trust-region, however the \"code-level optimizations\" that differ between the TRPO implementation the PPO implementation are sufficient. The ablation study of the four optimizations studied by the paper shows dramatic and clear results suggesting that annealing stepsizes and normalize rewards make very strong differences in learning performance; much more effect than demonstrated by the differences between TRPO and PPO's core algorithmic contribution as demonstrated in Figure 2 and even more strongly in Figure 3. I find the work included in this paper to be novel and a valuable contribution to the field.\n\nFor the above reasons, I recommend to accept this paper for publication at ICLR. In the following paragraphs I will discuss why I only recommend a weak accept instead of a strong accept.\n\nMy primary concern with the empirical study is the use of only three random seeds. As demonstrated in Henderson et al. 2017 (which is heavily cited in this paper), using such a small number of random seeds can have very misleading results. Although the effects appear very strong in the empirical studies in this paper, the effects likewise appear strong in Henderson et al.'s Figure 6 where 10 random seeds were split into two groups for the same algorithm. For this paper to make such strong claims about the negligence of the careful scientific study on TRPO and PPO, it would be best if this paper included far more random seeds in its investigation.\n\nMy second concern is with the discussion and conclusions drawn from Tables 1 and 2. It appears that the inclusion of clipping plays a strong role in the variance of each algorithm on every domain except Hopper. Specifically, the algorithms that include clipping appear to be much lower variance than the algorithms including clipping. Admittedly using only 3 seeds means that investigating the variance appropriately is near impossible (see the above paragraph), however variance should be considered and discussed in a conversation about the effects of the core contribution of PPO. If clipping leads to more consistent results across runs, even if those results are a little worse, it is still a valid and important contribution.\n\nThe paper cites Henderson et al. 2017 in several places. I would point out (perhaps in the introduction) that this paper builds on work already done in Henderson et al. 2017. Specifically, Henderson et al. 2017 investigates the effects of using different codebases for TRPO and shows that these different codebases result in dramatically different performance. The similarity to the investigation in this paper to too close to be unreported. However, I find that the investigation in this paper is much more complete and insightful than that of Henderson et al. 2017 (this paper has a more narrow focus), thus contributes significantly and meaningfully to this ongoing conversation.\n\nAdditional Comments (do not affect score)\n\nIt might be worthwhile to move the related work section to the beginning of the paper, either merged with the introduction or immediately after. This section is of critical importance to understanding the scope of this paper and for understanding why you are studying what you study. In fact, there is already a bit of duplication between the related works and introduction sections, so the paper could likely gain some additional real-estate by combining these.\n\nI disagree with the terminology \"code-level optimizations\" and I find that it is misleading. This caused a bit of confusion on my first pass reading the paper, as I originally was expected the code differences to be more akin to using Tensorflow vs PyTorch or switching hash table functions, etc. Instead the changes focused on in this paper are changes to the problem specification and algorithm implementation. These are not simply implementation details as \"code-level optimizations\" suggests, but are rather details that necessarily must be included in peer-reviewed works.

The main takeaway is that the performance gains observed in PPO (compared to TRPO) are actually caused by differences in implementation, and not by the differences between the two learning algorithms. In particular, adding to the TRPO code the same implementation changes as in PPO makes TRPO on par with (and possibly even better than) PPO. The clipping objective of PPO is also found to have no significant impact on its performance.

If I were to add anything to this paper, it would be to see if these results continue to hold even on smaller domains with simpler neural networks. Perhaps a domain on the scale of a simple gridworld task, where a small single layer neural network could appropriately solve the task. In this setting, dozens of random seeds could be tested overnight on a modern laptop and strong statements of statistical significance could be made. While less indicative of impact on real-world tasks, this would at least ease concerns that differences are due to chance.

However, we have updated the caption of Figure 1 to better describe the plot style (as it is somewhat unconventional), hopefully alleviating this concern.\n- We have updated both the captions of Figure 2 and 3 to fix the noted issues, and also added (left), (middle), and (right) to our references to Figures 2 and 3\n- We have fixed various typos/confusing wordings, including those found by the reviewer.

We address each point raised in the original review below:\n\nThree random seeds: For the ablation study, we only used three random seeds for computational reasons (as every random seed requires running all of the hyperparameter configurations). However, it appears as though the reviewer is (rightfully) more concerned with Tables 1 and 2---both of these, however, actually used 10 random seeds rather than 3. We have added this to their captions to clarify this issue. We will also run a few more random seeds and update the means and variances accordingly when the results become available (we cannot guarantee this before the rebuttal deadline, however.)\n\nDiscussing variances in Table 2: We agree that a discussion of a possible variance reduction induced by clipping would improve the paper. In order to make sure that the apparent reduction in variance is not spurious we will be sure to run more random agents\u2014if the trend remains, we will certainly include a discussion of how clipping might serve to reduce the variance in PPO rather than its \u201cconventionally perceived\u201d purpose of ensuring monotonic reward increase. \n\nDiscussion of Henderson et al: We agree with the reviewer that our work builds on that of Henderson et al, and certainly did not intend to imply otherwise (hence the extensive citation noted by the reviewer). We have taken the reviewer\u2019s advice and moved the related work to Section 2, and added the suggested mention of building on Henderson et al there.\n\n\u201cCode-level optimizations\u201d: We initially chose to use the term \u201ccode-level optimization\u201d to indicate that these were algorithmic optimizations that are for the most part found only in the code of RL algorithms. However, we appreciate the reviewer\u2019s point that the term may cause confusion. To avoid this confusion and for lack of a better term, we have, in our revision, added a footnote which indicates precisely what we mean by \u201ccode-level optimization.\u201d We would be happy to amend this footnote or change the term if our fix has not alleviated the issue.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1661/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1661/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Implementation Matters in Deep RL: A Case Study on PPO and TRPO", "authors": ["Logan Engstrom", "Andrew Ilyas", "Shibani Santurkar", "Dimitris Tsipras", "Firdaus Janoos", "Larry Rudolph", "Aleksander Madry"], "authorids": ["ailyas@mit.edu", "engstrom@mit.edu", "shibani@mit.edu", "tsipras@mit.edu", "firdaus.janoos@twosigma.com", "rudolph@csail.mit.edu", "madry@mit.edu"], "keywords": ["deep policy gradient methods", "deep reinforcement learning", "trpo", "ppo"], "abstract": "We study the roots of algorithmic progress in deep policy gradient algorithms through a case study on two popular algorithms: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO).
