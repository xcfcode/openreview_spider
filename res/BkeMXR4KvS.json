The convergence of the proposed method is analyzed in terms of regret bound and is compared to similar results for ADAM. The method is validated with experiments on both convex and non-convex objectives as well as in applications to transfer learning.\n\nThe paper is well written and provides novel, to the best of my knowledge, theoretical results on the convergence of adaptive moment methods when augmented with non-uniform data sampling, which is quite interesting. However, my main concern is the proposed implementation of non-uniform sampling. In particular, the adaptive probability of every training sample is set proportional to its gradient and, in theory, this has to be updated at every iteration. This essentially means that the full batch gradient is available at every iteration and, since the full gradient is available, wouldn\u2019t it be better to use full batch gradient descent instead?\n\nThe proofs in the appendix repeat the known results in detail, while the definitions and proofs of the concepts related to the main contribution of this paper are rather short. In particular:\n1. The expectations are not formally defined. The expectation with respect to p_{1:T} must be with respect to the join of all distributions from every iteration (?); sometimes there is conditioning on parameters and sometimes it disappears (proof of Lemma 1). This should be clarified.\n2. It would also be helpful to see more detailed proof of Lemma 3 since it is not obvious and is the key ingredient of the presented results. \n3. As a sanity check, I would expect that the results of Th. 1 and Th. 2 (or Corollary 1.1 and Corollary 2.1) should coincide when p is set to the uniform distribution. Is this correct and, if yes, can one show this?\n\nLess important questions:\n1. In Algorithm 2, there is a parameter J which controls the frequency of computation of optimal probabilities. How is this parameter set and what are the tradeoffs? After the parameters are updated, does it actually help to use such probabilities from the previous step when the parameters are in fact different?\n2. Why parameter epsilon is introduced in Algorithm 2? How is it set?\n3. Gradient aggregation methods are mostly criticized for their linear runtime in the number of examples n (see, e.g., Bottou et. al. 2016), while adaptive moment methods are widely used in practice since their runtime doesn\u2019t depend on n. Since the proposed method is also linear in n, it would be interesting to see how it compares to aggregation methods in practice.\n4. Conceptually, what is the difference of the results in Theorem 1 and Corollary 1.1 from the previous results in Kingma & Ba (2014) and Reddi et. al. (2018)?\n5. In Lemma 4, there is unnecessary \\alpha_t in the denominator. Does it change the final result?\n6. To improve the runtime of the proposed algorithm, can one develop any approximation of optimal probabilities that wouldn\u2019t require full data pass?\n\nMinor:\n1. p. 3, \u201cDuchi et. al.\u201d is this a reference?\n2. functions phi and psi are called proximal; are they related to proximal operators?\n3. typos: p. 3, \u201cwe first we\u201d; p. 5, \u201can may\u201d\n4. p. 2, it is AMSGrad, not ADAM; betas aren\u2019t defined\n5.

If we divide both sides by T, the right side of the inequality is still upper bounded by \\sqrt{T}, it is not convergent. Otherwise, please correct me and show the convergence rate of the proposed method.\n3) The same question in Corollary 2.1 about the convergence result. \n4) Some variables are not defined clearly in the paper, e.g., \\bar g and  \\beta_{1_{t}}  in corollary 1.1.\n5) Algorithm 2 requires to compute p every J iterations.

The paper presents standard analysis in the stochastic convex setting which raised some question for me (presented below). The empirical results are promising but in my opinion can be further improved through minor changes to experimental procedure.\n\n\nOverall:\n\n1) There are a few instances of undefined notation. For example, $\\beta_1(t)$ in the definition of Adam/AMSGrad or $V_t$ (the latter I assume is the average over all datapoints?).\n\n2) Theorem 1 is stated very informally with some notation left unexplained (e.g. V_t above or E_n[...]). Further, it is not clear to me whether the authors are proving results in the online convex optimization setting or the stochastic convex optimization setting (though, there is some equivalence between them). Finally, I am concerned by the presentation of Theorem 1 and Corollary 1.1 as it has been shown by Reddi et al. that Adam does not have bounded regret in general without algorithmic changes. In particular, bimodal gradient noise distributions can be designed such that the average Regret is unbounded (see Reddi et al. for details). While these issues can be addressed through modifications to the standard Adam algorithm I am unable to find a suitable discussion within the paper.\n\n3) Theorem 2 introduces DASGrad which has not yet been clearly defined (Algorithm 1 depends on averaging functions of the past gradients for flexibility --- which averaging functions are being used here?). Once again, the notation Var_n appears whose definition is not clear to me. Additionally, could you provide a citation for the optimal adaptive probabilities and clearly state under which conditions these adaptive probabilities are optimal?\n\nThe crux of Theorem 2 depends on the informal statements present in Section 3.3, in which it is claimed that the variance of the second order moments are sufficiently large to dominate the sum of gradient histories. I am having a hard time seeing how this would be true generally and I believe that further theoretical analysis is necessary to justify this discussion.\n\n4) The introduction of Algorithm 2 felt like a bait-and-switch. This algorithm seems intuitively sensible and uses the same check-pointing ideas that have been introduced in recent variance reduction methods (e.g. [1]). However, this is a different algorithm which is not analyzed in this paper. \n\nAdditionally, the fourth line of Algorithm 2 says to compute p_t lying in the simplex --- I believe this is a typo? Further, could you explain the introduction of epsilon in line 4. This seems unnecessary given the propto symbol but I am worried I am missing something.\n\n5) The empirical results introduce an additional deviation from the proposed algorithm by using batch sizes of 32. Could the authors please explain how the adaptive sampling probabilities are used in this setting? (My apologies if this is obvious, I am not overly familiar with such methods).\n\nOverall I felt that the empirical results were fairly promising but some questions remained for me. The toy experiments in section 6.1 were illustrative but seem to only consider adaptive probabilities without the adaptive moments?\n\nSection 6.3 was also an interesting experimental setup which is well suited to DASGrad but I felt that the baseline comparison was unfair. DASGrad was provided with the ground-truth balance statistics in the importance weights while the baselines were trained without any correction. I would recommend that the authors explore combinations of enabling balance correction in the baseline methods (possibly through reweighting the loss according to the balance statistics) or requiring DASGrad to compute the optimal probabilities through the adaptive moments as suggested throughout the rest of the paper.\n\nMinor:\n\n- Pg 3, typo \"we first we extend\"\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Accelerating Stochastic Gradient Descent using Predictive Variance Reduction, Rie Johnson and Tong Zhang\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1030/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1030/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DASGrad: Double Adaptive Stochastic Gradient", "authors": ["Kin Gutierrez", "Cristian Challu", "Jin Li", "Artur Dubrawski"], "authorids": ["kdgutier@cs.cmu.edu", "cchallu@cs.cmu.edu", "jinl2@cs.cmu.edu", "awd@cs.cmu.edu"], "keywords": ["stochastic convex optimization", "adaptivity", "online learning", "transfer learning"], "TL;DR": "Stochastic gradient descent with adaptive moments and adaptive probabilities", "abstract": "Adaptive moment methods have been remarkably successful for optimization under the presence of high dimensional or sparse gradients, in parallel to this, adaptive sampling probabilities for SGD have allowed optimizers to improve convergence rates by prioritizing examples to learn efficiently.
