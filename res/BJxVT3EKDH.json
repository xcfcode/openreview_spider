I initially assumed an existence of a sentiment dictionary for Amharic, but section 3 introduced other resources, e.g., English/Amharic dictionary, which are not clearly stated in the introductory nor in the beginning of section 3. I'd strongly suggest the author to make it clear what kind of assumptions are made, e.g., existence of bilingual dictionary, or not. Otherwise, it is very hard to replicate the experiments.\n\n- Baselines sound not appropriate. Authors should conduct additional studies, e.g., graph propagation algorithm, to make sure that the proposed heuristic based approach is superior or not.\n\nI think this work should have been submitted to other conferences, workshops or journals, focusing more on low resource languages."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper222/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper222/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "Sentiment classification is an active research area with several applications including analysis of political opinions, classifying comments, movie reviews, news reviews and product reviews.

In order to save time and costs for the resource-limited language, the lexicon is generated from an Amharic news corpus by the following steps: manually preparing polarized seed words lists (strongly positive and strongly negative), calculating the co-occurrence of target word in its context via Positive Point-wise Mutual Information (PPMI) method, measuring the similarity between target words and seed words by cosine distance, iterating with the threshold 100 and 200. The PPMI lexicon is stemmed and evaluated from aspects of subjectivity detection, coverage, agreement and sentiment classification. Three other lexicons: Manual developed by manual, SOCAL and SWN developed by bilingual dictionary, are used as benchmark to compare with the PPMI lexicon. In sentiment classification experiment the PPMI lexicon did not show a superior performance. All the four lexicons have similar accuracy, between 42.16% ~ 48.87%.  Only when the four are combined together the result is improved to 83.51%. \n\nWhile this paper presents an economical and practical method to generate a sentiment lexicon for resource-limited language it is not acceptable in it's current state to ICRL. The following points should be improved or clarified. \n(1) The generalizability to any language needs to be shown. What are the lessons learned for any resource-limited language?\n(2) The fit to ICLR is not perfect. I would expect a stronger focus on representation learning.\n(3)\tThe conclusion is not well proved. Especially about the claim that their method is \u201cwith almost minimal costs and time\u201d. PPMI lexicon might cost less than Manual lexicon, but SWN and SOCAL (Neshir Alemneh et al., 2019) are automatically generated by English-Amharic dictionary, not manually. Their generation costs and time are not told and can not be compared here. \n(4)\tThe paper is incorrectly structured. The part \u201c4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\u201d presents neither results nor discussion. Part 4.1 shows seed words which should belongs to part 3. Part 4.2 shows stemming which should belong either to part 3 or to part 5. Therefore, it is better to make a restructure. \n(5)\tThe contents following \u201cDiscussion:\u201d in part 5 are not discussion.  Moreover, there is almost no discussion in this paper. \n(6)\tIn part 5.4 Table 4, why there is result of PPMI in column \u201c2500 Amharic Comments\u201d but no result in column \u201c20 million Amharic tokens\u201d? Are the 2500 comments stemmed? \n(7)\tIn part 5.6, why negation handling is adopted in part 5.6?\n\nMinor comments:\n(1)\tGrammatical problems such as: Page 3 last paragraph: \u201cAmharic is highly morphological language both inflectional and derivational morphology is complex.\u201d \n(2)\tPage 6 last paragraph: \u201cWe will evaluate in three ways: external to lexicon and internal to lexicon.\u201d It should be two ways. \n(3)\tThe number of facebook comments varies: it is 2800 in part 5.3, 2500 in 5.4 including Table 4, and 2821 in 5.6.  \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper222/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper222/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "Sentiment classification is an active research area with several applications including analysis of political opinions, classifying comments, movie reviews, news reviews and product reviews.

Instead, this work proposes to automatically generate a semantic lexicon using distributional semantics from a corpus.\n\nThe proposed approach starts from a seed list of sentiment words in 3 pre-determined POS classes. This is followed by deriving a PPMI matrix from the word-context co-occurence matrix (context size= 2). Now given a word, the cosine distance is computed from centroid of each seed classes and words which are similar than a given threshold, are added to the original list. This process is repeated for a pre-specified number of iterations. They apply the generated lexicons to subjectivity detection and sentiment classification task in a small annotated Amharic corpus of facebook posts\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. NLP tasks on low-resource language is very challenging. This paper proposes a efficient, unsupervised way of gathering semantic lexicons that perform reasonably well on a downstream task.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. Related work: The paper needs to cite and mention a much more broader literature. Currently, it mentions just 3 related work, and contrasts itself with one. But given there is so much work on distributional semantics (in English and other languages), they deserve mentioning. Few example of ones are 1. The distributional inclusion hypotheses and lexical entailment (Geffet and Dagan 2005), Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality (Mikolov et al., 2013), Improving hypernymy detection with an integrated path-based and distributional method (Shwartz et al., 2017), Distributional Inclusion Vector Embedding for Unsupervised Hypernymy Detection (Chang et al., 2018). However, this is by no means a complete list and you should refer to these papers to get a list of other relevant work.\n2. Novelty of work: The novelty of the work is rather limited and the paper should try more low-dimensional embedding based approaches which has been proven to be very effective for a wide variety of tasks. In section 3, the paper mentions there are primarily two kinds of approaches (count based vs embedding based) \u2014 The paper should motivate why it chose one over another.\n3. Baselines: The paper would benefit from having some comparison with learned baselines trained from some distantly supervised data from, for example the SWN and SOCAL lexicons. \n4. Organization of the paper: The writing and the organization of the paper needs to be better. For example, equation 3, 4, 5 are rather simple and can be condensed to one equation (no need to show averaging of the seed embeddings). Also in equation 3, would \\vec{w} would be \\vec{x}?. The results and discussions did not have either and over-all there are many grammatical errors. \n5. I am not sure what the subjectivity detection task is in Table 3. Is it a standard task -- if not, the paper should define it first.\n\nOverall, the paper is a nice effort but in its current form it is not ready for ICLR and I hope the comments will help make the paper better for upcoming NLP workshops and conferences."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper222/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper222/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "Sentiment classification is an active research area with several applications including analysis of political opinions, classifying comments, movie reviews, news reviews and product reviews. To employ rule based sentiment classification, we require sentiment lexicons. However, manual construction of sentiment lexicon is time consuming and costly for resource-limited languages. To bypass manual development time and costs, we tried to build Amharic Sentiment Lexicons relying on corpus based approach. The intention of this approach is to handle sentiment terms specific to Amharic language from Amharic Corpus. Small set of seed terms are manually prepared from three parts of speech such as noun, adjective and verb. We developed algorithms for constructing Amharic sentiment lexicons automatically from Amharic news corpus. Corpus based approach is proposed relying on the word co-occurrence distributional embedding including frequency based embedding (i.e. Positive Point-wise Mutual Information PPMI). First we build word-context unigram frequency count matrix and transform it to point-wise mutual Information matrix. Using this matrix, we computed the cosine distance of mean vector of seed lists and each word in the corpus vocabulary. Based on the threshold value, the top closest words to the mean vector of seed list are added to the lexicon. Then the mean vector of the new sentiment seed list is updated and process is repeated until we get sufficient terms in the lexicon. Using PPMI with threshold value of 100 and 200, we got corpus based Amharic Sentiment lexicons of size 1811 and 3794 respectively by expanding 519 seeds. Finally, the lexicon generated in corpus based approach is evaluated.\n", "title": "Corpus Based Amharic Sentiment Lexicon Generation", "keywords": ["Amharic sentiment lexicon", "Amharic sentiment classification", "seed words"], "pdf": "/pdf/83490390395f4cc7d4f43ec60ce7be223b2b6f19.pdf", "authors": ["Girma Neshir", "Andeas Rauber", "and Solomon Atnafu"], "TL;DR": "Corpus based Algorithm is developed generate Amharic Sentiment lexicon relying on corpus", "authorids": ["girma1978@gmail.com", "rauber@ifs.tuwien.ac.at", "solomon.atnafu@aau.edu.et"], "paperhash": "neshir|corpus_based_amharic_sentiment_lexicon_generation", "original_pdf": "/attachment/83490390395f4cc7d4f43ec60ce7be223b2b6f19.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nneshir2020corpus,\ntitle={Corpus Based Amharic Sentiment Lexicon Generation},\nauthor={Girma Neshir and Andeas Rauber and and Solomon Atnafu},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxVT3EKDH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
