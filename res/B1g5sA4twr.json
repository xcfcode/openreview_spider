It investigates presence of this behaviour in a range of neural network architectures and apart of identifying it as a function of the model size it also identifies it as a function of training time which I believe is novel. Overall I think the paper presents results valuable to the community. At the same time it has several issues that need to be addressed. If the issues are addressed in a satisfactory manner I will recommend acceptance of the paper. \n\nIssues and questions: \n\n** \"Such a phenomenon was first postulated by Belkin et al. (2018) who named it \u201cdouble descent\u201d and demonstrated it on MNIST with decision trees, random features, and 2-layer neural networks with `2 loss.\" This is not a correct statement. The authors cite works (Advani & Saxe 2017) and there is also \"Stefano Spigler, Mario Geiger, Stephane d\u2019Ascoli, Levent Sagun, Giulio Biroli, and Matthieu Wyart. A jamming transition from under-to over-parametrization affects loss landscape and generalization. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.09665, 2018.\" that both identified this behaviour prior to the Belkin et al. (2018) work. There is even a much older line of work identifying the peak in the generalization error by Opper's group: \nhttp://www.ki.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/fg135/publikationen/opper/Op03b.pdf (1995)\nSiegfried B\u00a8os and Manfred Opper. Dynamics of training. In Advances in Neural Information\nProcessing Systems, pages 141\u2013147, 1997.\nhttp://www.ki.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/fg135/publikationen/opper/Op01.pdf\n\nMoreover, as is only said in the supplementary material, Geiger et al. also tested on the CIFAR dataset, while the introduction of the present article only mentions previous experiments on MNIST. The fact that previous work also observed this in CIFAR should be moved in the introduction. \n\n** The authors claim to define the \"effective model complexity (EMC)\" and claim this as one of the main results of the paper.\n\nPresenting this as a new measure is strange, this exactly is what Geiger et all call jamming transition/threshold in Stefano Spigler, Mario Geiger, St\u00b4ephane d\u2019Ascoli, Levent Sagun, Giulio Biroli, and Matthieu Wyart. A jamming transition from under-to over-parametrization affects loss landscape and generalization. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.09665, 2018. And very closely related to what Belkin calls \"interpolation threshold\" (to define interpolation threshold we could fix the model and vary the number of samples, Belkin et all fix number of samples and vary size of the model, but one is just the dual of the other). Giving it a yet completely new name seems to create more noise than value.\n\nThe relation between EMC and the jamming transition is discussed in the supplement. However, not in a accurate way. The authors say \"a \u201djamming transition\u201d when the number of parameters exceeds a threshold that allows training to near-zero train loss.\" but jamming is inspired by the physical phenomena when spheres are added into a finite volume box and the more spheres we have the harder it gets to fit them all in until it is not possible anymore. The analogy here is that fitting sphere in = reaching training error zero. Then number of spheres = number of samples. Thus the more samples the harder it is to get the training error to zero, leading to the jamming transition. Both in training and jamming the number of samples at which this happened depends on the details of the protocol/training, thus it does depend on things such as regularization.\n\nThe only aspect that I have not seen covered in the jamming analogy is the epoch-wise double descent.\n\nIn any case the discussion in the paper needs to be adjusted and these relevant relations to previous work corrected and moved from the supplement to the introduction.  \n\n** \"Informally, our intuition is that for model-sizes at the interpolation threshold, there is effectively only one model that fits the train data and this interpolating model is very sensitive to noise in the train set and/or model mis-specification.\" This intuition is correct I believe. However, it should not be called \"our intuition\" as it already appeared in the line of work by Opper cited above. \n\n** The authors present as another main result the fact that under comparable training conditions training with more data samples provides worse generalization, examples of this is also included already in the papers by Opper et al. cited above.

It shows a rather extensive set of simulations, that enrich the observations of the so-called double descent phenomena, and shows empirically its apparent generality. Also, the Effective Model Complexity seems to be a good description of what is empirically observe. All in all, i definitely support publication.\n\nI have, however, two comments: first, a minor one: there is a part of the story on double descent that is completely forgotten: the fact that there is a pic in the data for some classificators at #example close to #parameters was known at least in the 90! It is discussed in \"Statistical Mechanics of Learning\" A. Engel & C. Van den Broeck, 2001, page 61, with a plot that  comes rather from an old work of Pr. Manfred Opper (1995), can be seen here: http://www.ki.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/fg135/publikationen/opper/Op01.pdf FIG 10 \nFrom this work, it is also rather clear that increasing the number of training examples can hurt performances (this is exactly what the plot says), at least without regularisation. Since the authors are quite thorough in their review of history -especially in the appendix- I thought I would point this reference.\n\nThe second comment is that the paper should acknowledge the work of the  Geiger et al more explicitly, and cite as well the related work of  Spiegler et al (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09665) rather explicitly! Virtually all they show was already shown in this work (which by the way PREDATES Belkin et al), albeit only for a simpler set of data.  I agree that the authors extend a lot on this papers, especially in terms of dataset and completeness of experiments, but they are definitely closely related, and the fact that it is not cited is a serious flaw to the current version.\n\nAlso, in the conclusion  \"We note that many of the phenomena that we highlight often do not occur with optimal early- stopping.

This is a good question, and the issue is subtle.\n\nFor test error to increase with sample size, at least one of the following must occur:\n(A): Training error increases with sample size\n(B): Generalization gap (= Test Error - Train Error) increases with sample size.\n\nNow, all possible settings can occur in practice:\nThere exist cases where (A) is true and (B) is false,\nwhere (A) is false, and (B) is true,\nand where both (A) and (B) are true.\n\nFor cases where (A) is true: As you mention, in Figure 26 (intermediate model) the train error increases and the generalization gap does not increase. \n\nWhere (A) and (B) are both true: This occurs in Figure 9b, for the Smaller Model in the range of samples 0-10k. Here, both the train loss and the generalization gap increase.\nHere's the plot including train loss for Figure 9b: https://i.imgur.com/ITJHMeG.png\n\n\nWhere (A) is false and (B) is true: This is most evident in the case of Random Fourier Features (Figure 11). Consider a RFF model with embedding-dimension d = 1000. This is simply linear regression in the embedded space, and this model can exactly interpolate (train error is exactly 0) up to n <= d samples.\nWhen n <= d, the linear model is the min-norm interpolating solution of the (embedded) train set. (This is the solution that would be found by gradient descent/flow).\n\nThis plot shows 1D slices of Figure 11: https://i.imgur.com/NBqJjul.png\nNow, compare n = 500 to n = 1000 samples. Both have 0 train error, but the generalization gap grows (and peaks at n=1000). In our framework, moving from n=500 to n=1000 shifts the model from being \"very overparameterized\" to being \"critically parameterized\".\n\nAt n = 1000, there is exactly one interpolating solution -- and intuitively, since the model is misspecified (ie, the true distribution is not linearly separable under the embedding), forcing this model to interpolate the data does not perform well. Whereas for n < 1000, there are many interpolating solutions, and choosing the min-norm one acts as a good regularizer.\n\n\nNote that sample-wise nonmonotonicity occurs even without random-features: it occurs for standard linear regression, when the data-distribution is (for example) gaussian with observation noise. In this case, the peak in test error occurs for similar reasons -- because the variance of the interpolating estimator grows at n = d.\n(A related analysis is in: https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07571)\n\nOur intuition is that this setting (where (B) is true) is most indicative of the mechanisms of sample-wise nonmonotonicity: for the critical number of samples, the models must \"try very hard\" to fit the train set, which can destroy their global structure. Whereas for fewer samples, the models are overparameterized enough to fit the train set while still behaving well on the distribution."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1329/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1329/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["preetum@cs.harvard.edu", "galkaplun@g.harvard.edu", "ybansal@g.harvard.edu", "tristanyang@college.harvard.edu", "b@boazbarak.org", "ilyasu@openai.com"], "title": "Deep Double Descent: Where Bigger Models and More Data Hurt", "authors": ["Preetum Nakkiran", "Gal Kaplun", "Yamini Bansal", "Tristan Yang", "Boaz Barak", "Ilya Sutskever"], "pdf": "/pdf/2313f8e4c1bbcb174b1e34904fbc5f638c589efa.pdf", "TL;DR": "We demonstrate, and characterize, realistic settings where bigger models are worse, and more data hurts.", "abstract": "We show that a variety of modern deep learning tasks exhibit a \"double-descent\" phenomenon where, as we increase model size, performance first gets worse and then gets  better.

The observation regarding the  sample-wise non-monotonicity is quite interesting, and I would like to understand it better.\n\nMy understanding is that, for any model, there's a particular range of training set sizes (roughly centered around the interpolation threshold?), where the test error can actually increase with the sample set size. The  \"discussion\" section 5 already provides some nice intuition as to why this may be happening (I enjoyed reading this section!): it seems that somehow adding more datapoints which the model cannot fit well, probably ends up dismantling the global structure that the network could learn with fewer datapoints. \n\n\nI'd like to gain a clearer understanding of this intuition. Specifically, does this point to some optimization issue or some statistical issue? To help answer this, I think it may be useful to identify which of the following is true:\nA. In this interval of sample sizes, does the generalization gap (test minus train error) decrease with sample size, while the training error increases with sample size?\nB. Or does the generalization gap (test-train error) too increase with the sample size within this interval (and then start dipping beyond some dataset size)?\n\nIf A is true, then I'd understand that this observation arises purely from the inability of SGD to find low training error models in this regime. And so, even though there is better generalization, the poorer fit on the training data leads to poorer test performance. On the other hand, if A is not true but B is, then it means that there is some counter-intuitive statistical phenomenon at play here. \n\nThe middle line in Figure 26 (right) may have some answer to my question (implying that A is true), but I can't conclude confidently from this plot. So I'd love to hear what the authors think!\n"}, "signatures": ["~Vaishnavh_Nagarajan1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["~Vaishnavh_Nagarajan1", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["preetum@cs.harvard.edu", "galkaplun@g.harvard.edu", "ybansal@g.harvard.edu", "tristanyang@college.harvard.edu", "b@boazbarak.org", "ilyasu@openai.com"], "title": "Deep Double Descent: Where Bigger Models and More Data Hurt", "authors": ["Preetum Nakkiran", "Gal Kaplun", "Yamini Bansal", "Tristan Yang", "Boaz Barak", "Ilya Sutskever"], "pdf": "/pdf/2313f8e4c1bbcb174b1e34904fbc5f638c589efa.pdf", "TL;DR": "We demonstrate, and characterize, realistic settings where bigger models are worse, and more data hurts.", "abstract": "We show that a variety of modern deep learning tasks exhibit a \"double-descent\" phenomenon where, as we increase model size, performance first gets worse and then gets  better.
