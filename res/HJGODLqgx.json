We will emphasize the benefits of utilizing bi-RNN as encoder in the refined version.\nTo answer your questions: \n1) For intuition: We\u2019ve briefly discussed the intuition of choosing bi-RNN in Section 3. Recall the forward-backward algorithm is doing the exact inference, we expect the bi-RNN to mimics this forward-backward procedure, and thus, achieving a good approximation. From this perspective, the bi-RNN already takes the structure into account. Specifically, the forward messages are computed in a recursive markovian and linear way; while in forward RNN, the hidden layers are also recursively computed in a nonlinear way. For backward process, similar analogy is applied. Computing the marginal in bi-RNN is also analogous. \n\nThe structured mean field could be another option. However, it requires the lower bound implied by the structured distribution must be available in closed form (Hoffman & Blei, 2014) in order to be efficient. Also, it\u2019s inference still requires the calculation of the normalization term, which won\u2019t have advantage of speed over bi-RNN. \n\nFor implementation: bi-RNN is quite simple to implement and easy to train (by sgd); \n\nFor performance: We\u2019ve also explored one directional RNN in our early stage, and found bi-RNN works better.\n\n2) In our earlier experiments, the sequences in each datasets are very long (e.g., ~40k in Physionet). So each dataset has roughly 0.1~0.3*10^6 high dimensional observations. Actually, the main computational challenge comes from the length of sequence (complexity is analyzed in Section 4.1) rather than the number of sequences (since we can always use stochastic training to sample i.i.d. sequences, as in line 5 of Algorithm 1). \n\nWe\u2019ve addressed your suggestion by including an experiment on a new dataset constructed based on Physionet. The dataset consists of 2750 sequences, where each sequence has ~1.5k 4-D observations, resulting ~4.5 *10^6 observations in total. We did 5-fold cross validation in this case.\nFor more information about the dataset and experimental details, please check our updated paper. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Recurrent Hidden Semi-Markov Model", "abstract": "Segmentation and labeling of high dimensional time series data has wide applications in behavior understanding and medical diagnosis.

Thus we re-implemented with the extension to continuous case. We also extended with more powerful emission model for P(x_i | y_i), like mixture of Gaussian (where the number of mixtures is tuned). \nOverall the crf-autoencoder is not performing well in our segmentation task. It achieves similar or worse performance than classical HSMM. We conjecture the major issue lies in the modeling part. In CRF-autoencoder, the reconstruction model is conditional i.i.d, and the CRF encoder is markovian. Comparing to HSMM, it ignores the segmentation structures in modeling and more similar to HMM, which is weaker for segmentation task.\n\nWe believe the CRF-autoencoder can be further improved by introducing more useful features (e.g., in the original paper they used information like word-cluster, etc.), but it will be beyond the focus in our paper.

The differences between the proposed model and algorithm and the CRF autoencoder are listed below:\n\ni), Model: \nThe generative model (reconstruction) used in Ammar et.al., is HMM with conditional iid emission, which doesn\u2019t have duration concept. Their generative model needs to be simple, in order to get a tractable form to optimize in their \\lambda step. Thus in their paper the generative HMM can be factorized and get a nice form in Eq (1).  \nOur model incorporates explicitly modeling the duration. Moreover, we use the mixture of  recurrent neural networks as the emission model to capture the switch between different generative processes in different state, which are more flexible in modeling and much harder to be learned (Chiappa 2014, Murphy 2012). \n\nii), Inference:\nIn Ammar et.al., the inference is done by solving MAP in CRF, which requires a dynamic programming. This is efficient for HMM, but not for our recurrent HSMM. Thus we propose to use variational encoder. Our variational bi-rnn decoder is much more efficient while getting the similar performance, as shown in our experiments. \n\niii), Learning: \nIn general, we extended the the penalty method into distributional space to learn the proposed recurrent-HSMM and the sequential VAE. Specifically,\n\n**for encoder:\nIn Ammar et.al., the \\lambda-step learns encoder via gradient based algorithm. Optimizing their Eq (1) will marginalize over all possible latent variables. Therefore, a restricted generative model, as well as a tractable CRF is necessary. In our model, the latent variables are sampled from auxiliary distribution \\tilde{Q}. Thus the variational bi-rnn only needs to focus on the sampled latent variables, which doesn\u2019t put too much limitation to the generative model. \n\n**for decoder:\nAmmar et.al., use EM to learn the generative HMM. We argued that full EM is computationally too expensive for recurrent HSMM. So we also use samples of latent variables to learn the parameters of HSMM and generative RNNs. \n\nWe will include this reference into our main text. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Recurrent Hidden Semi-Markov Model", "abstract": "Segmentation and labeling of high dimensional time series data has wide applications in behavior understanding and medical diagnosis.

Due to the difficulty in obtaining the label information for high dimensional data, realizing this objective in an unsupervised way is highly desirable. Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM) is a classical tool for this problem. However, existing HSMM and its variants has simple conditional assumptions of observations, thus the ability to capture the nonlinear and complex dynamics within segments is limited. To tackle this limitation, we propose to incorporate the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to model the generative process in HSMM, resulting the Recurrent HSMM (R-HSMM). To accelerate the inference while preserving accuracy, we designed a structure encoding function to mimic the exact inference. By generalizing the penalty method to distribution space, we are able to train the model and the encoding function simultaneously. Empirical results show that the proposed R-HSMM achieves the state-of-the-art performances on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
