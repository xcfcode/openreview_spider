We have divided our reply into three sections following the order in your comment:\n\n1. At each training step, DQ samples a topology-aware N-element mask, where N is the number of nodes in the graph. Nodes with higher degree have a higher chance to be kept at FP32 at any given training iteration. At each node, the aggregation stage uses messages that are quantised depending on the neighbours\u2019 mask value (therefore some of the messages are FP32 and some are INT8/4); then the result of the aggregation gets quantised depending on whether the node should be protected (kept at FP32 or not), which again depends on the DQ mask. We have added a detailed diagram to the appendix to illustrate how DQ quantization (Figure 11) is applied to GCN in comparison to nQAT (shown in Figure 12). We have also shown in a separated diagram (Figure 13) how graph summarization (which we distinguish from node aggregation -- which we focus on in this work) functions with our method; further techniques for graph summarization are interesting but beyond the scope of this work -- which is a foundational work in this area, and hence focuses on a general method useful to a wide variety of practitioners.\n\n2. Regarding how masks are generated for nQAT, you are correct when assuming these are independent of node degrees. The stochastic element of nQAT is only applied to the weight quantization stage: weights are shared across all nodes in the graph. At each training stage and each layer, this mask is generated by sampling from a Bernoulli distribution. The ratio of weights to keep at FP32 is a hyperparameter that we fine tuned individually for each dataset-model pair. It is worth emphasizing again that nQAT is not \u201cgraph-aware\u201d like our technique: it is, however, a well performing stochastic quantization technique for CNNs/Transformers.\n\n\n3. Following your suggestion, we have updated Table 9 with a more thorough analysis on the impact of percentiles when excluded from DQ and when used in combination with nQAT. The expanded table shows that the graph-aware DQ masking is often sufficient to achieve good results, but the addition of percentile results in higher accuracies in most cases and improves stability. We observed that with the use of percentiles much fewer hyperparameter samples were needed to achieve top results. When combining percentiles with nQAT, although helpful to improve performance in some cases, is not sufficient to achieve results comparable to those obtained by the full DQ method (see Table 2). In some cases the drop in performance is severe (e.g. ZINC-GIN).\n\nIn summary: the stochastic element of DQ is vital for extracting the best performance. Adding the percentile to nQAT does not yield performance levels obtained by the full DQ method.\n\n______________________________________\nWhen running the experiments for Table 9 we realised that the result we had in Table 2 for DQ W4A4 CORA-GAT was not making use of percentiles, therefore leaving out some performance. We have updated table 2 and put the result previously shown there in Table 9. We gain an additional 6.8%.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2013/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2013/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Degree-Quant: Quantization-Aware Training for Graph Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~Shyam_Anil_Tailor1", "~Javier_Fernandez-Marques1", "~Nicholas_Donald_Lane1"], "authors": ["Shyam Anil Tailor", "Javier Fernandez-Marques", "Nicholas Donald Lane"], "keywords": ["Graph neural networks", "quantization", "benchmark"], "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance on a wide variety of tasks due to their ability to model non-uniform structured data.

If I understand you correctly, you are performing the aggregation of node representations at the graph level in the quantized setting in all cases, correct? I was particularly interested to see if using a similar strategy as for message aggregation (stochastically switching to full precision for some graphs during training) would yield any improvements. The results in Fig. 6 indicate that this is clearly a source of error when going from int8 to int4, so this may be another win.\n\n\nNow that I understand quantization slightly better, I have a follow-up question: how are the masks determined for the nQAT model in the experiments? From the comments and the presence of Table 9 in the appendix, I assume that they are independent of node degrees?\n\nOverall, I think the paper could be improved by doing a more careful separate analysis of the two proposed techniques. Table 9 is a start towards that, but I believe having two extra rows in Table 2 (for QAT + degree-based mask choice and QAT + percentile tracking) would be quite insightful.

We very much appreciate the suggestions and thoughts you have provided.\n\nYou are correct to point out that there are some other works exploring inference-time efficiency: it would be more correct of us to write \u201crelatively little\u201d as the number of works is much smaller than that existing for CNNs or language models. We have corrected this point and cited appropriately.\n\n\nWe would like to emphasize that a very important quality of our work is that it is inference-time focused, and generalises to unseen graphs. As you mention, there are hardware accelerators for GNNs, but we also note that these are more focused on training-time optimization as they often involve expensive preprocessing steps [1] or require multiple passes to achieve good performance [2]. The work you cite regarding depth compression has also only been shown to work for semi-supervised scenarios, and not the general case. We think that these works are really interesting however they are not able to offer the latency speedups we describe in our work for unseen graphs. Nonetheless, we are confident that combining our approach with other methods can yield even greater results in the future.\n\nIn the updated PDF we address your point regarding smartphone deployments by using less absolute language. To expand on our explanation in the paper, there are also concerns about runtime memory usage and data movement. Moving data can be hundreds or thousands of times more expensive energy-wise than an integer add/multiply operation; reducing runtime memory consumption (which we achieve with quantization) is therefore a major driver in reducing overall energy consumption associated with inference [3, 6]. \n\nWe have incorporated the bold phrase in the Table 1 caption into our abstract.\n\nWe have not supplied wallclock training times but instead a table of latency results on CPU and GPU (Table 4); this table is also expanded in Table 10 in the appendix. All the quantization baselines as well as DQ models were implemented using uniform quantization (as it was first mentioned in the Introduction), and therefore all would result in the same speedup during inference. Alternatives to uniform quantization exist [4, 5] and might result in higher speedups. We see this study as an interesting future direction for our work.\n\nWe emphasize that one of the benefits of quantization is inference-time improvements once the model is deployed. In this work we did not consider accelerating training using quantization. However, we believe that our insights regarding numerical precision are helpful with regard to using mixed-precision training (e.g. FP16/BF16/TF32) approaches that have become popular for CNNs/Transformer training -- so our work should be useful for achieving training time speedups too.\n\nFinally, we have updated Figure 1 to remove the lines.\n\n\n______________________________________________________________\n[1] Xiaobing Chen, Yuke Wang, Xinfeng Xie, Xing Hu, Abanti Basak, Ling Liang, Mingyu Yan, Lei Deng, Yufei Ding, Zidong Du, Yunji Chen, and Yuan Xie.

The paper identifies the aggregation step to be where quantization introduces the most numerical error, and use stochastic masking and clipping the top/bottom values to mitigate the issue. \n\nThis topic is very relevant and interesting, and novel to the best of my knowledge---although I'm not familiar with the literature surrounding quantized neural networks. \n\nThere are places where the writing can be more careful. For example, in the abstract the authors write: \"little research exploring methods to make GNN more efficient at inference time\". However, there has been research focusing on both hardware acceleration [1] and making GNN models smaller [2]. Quantization isn't the only approach to make GNN inference faster. Claims like \"it is not possible to deploy this technique on smartphones\" (from intro paragraph 2) should be supported, since it's difficult for a reader\nto verify such a claim.\n\nSome of the claims, like the one bolded in Table 1, should be in the abstract. I'm not sure if this is typical in the quantization literature, but a wallclock time comparison would be useful in Table 2 to compare the time speedup against the baseline.\n\nOne other presentation feedback: in figure 1, the x-axis is not continuous. A line chart is not appropriate since the slope of the line segments in the chart is meaningless. Removing the lines connecting the dots would make more sense.\n\n[1] Zeng and Prasanna.

I am, however very familiar with the GNN literature.\n\nSummary\n-------------\nA method to train GNNs such that later quantization works well is presented. The authors first analyse the message passing definition to identify those computation steps whose results show the largest variance, and hence suffers most from the imprecision introduced by quantization. Consequently, hey focus on the message aggregation phase of message passing. \nThey then propose two improvements to more standard quantization-aware training (QAT): (1) applying quantization during the forward pass only on message aggregation outputs (and doing it more often on nodes that receive many messages); and (2) using percentile-based statistics for determining the ranges of values considered during quantization.\nFinally, experiments show that the resulting training procedure works well for GNNs on a number of datasets, matching or slightly improving the baseline performances. In most cases, the proposed Degree-Quant method also outperforms baseline QAT methods.\n\nStrong/Weak Points\n-------------\n* (+) Empirical results show moderate gains over the baseline QAT methods for int8 quantization, and substantial gains for very coarse quantization to int4.\n* (+) Thoughtful experimental ablations study the effect of the two improvements separately, and further empirically verify the theoretical analysis of sources of errors.\n* (-) The paper is not self-contained and hence not easily readable for people without background knowledge in quantization. While GNNs are fully (though very densely) defined in Sect. 2.1, no technical details on quantization are provided in Sect. 2.2. I ended up skimming some of the cited papers to even understand how values are practically mapped between fp32 and int8. Consequently, Sect. 3.2 is discussing extensions and alternatives to concepts that are simply not explained in the paper.\n\nRecommendation\n-------------\nI think this paper can be accepted and would be useful for the very narrow segment of people interested and knowledgeable in GNNs and quantization. However, in the current form, it is inaccessible to a wider audience and I believe that it could be significantly improved in that regard.\n\nQuestions\n-------------\n(1) Message aggregation is identified as a key source of quantization error due to the variance in the number of messages. For graph-level tasks (such as MNIST, CIFAR and ZINC), the aggregation of node representations to a graph representation should lead to a similar problem. Do you have deeper analysis on this aspect?\n\nDetail Feedback\n-------------\n* Sect. 3.1, end: the mixing of GCN and GIN is somehow confusing and it would be wortwhile to restructure this. (i.e., $\\mathbf{y}_{GIN}^{(i)}$ is defined before the equation its used in, but $\\mathbf{y}_{GCN}^{(i)}$ after, etc.)\n* Sect 3.2 / Alg. 1: I found the use of \"mask\" / \"masking\" here highly confusing, as I associate it with removing a value (as in masking of loss components, dropout masks, hiding a human face behind a cat mask, ...), but here the semantics is inverted: masks determine which values are \"more visible\" (by not applying the quantization to them). Unless this term is already in standard related use in the quantization literature, I would strongly recommend to use a different term here (e.g. \"preserved\", \"protected\", ...) \n* Fig 5/6 are not readable for colorblind people.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2013/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2013/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Degree-Quant: Quantization-Aware Training for Graph Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~Shyam_Anil_Tailor1", "~Javier_Fernandez-Marques1", "~Nicholas_Donald_Lane1"], "authors": ["Shyam Anil Tailor", "Javier Fernandez-Marques", "Nicholas Donald Lane"], "keywords": ["Graph neural networks", "quantization", "benchmark"], "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance on a wide variety of tasks due to their ability to model non-uniform structured data.
