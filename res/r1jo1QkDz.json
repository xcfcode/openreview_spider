An experiment is performed which shows that the proposed Modular And Self-Adaptable (MASA) approach is more robust to sensor noise than the traditional approach.\n\nThere are two main issues.\n\nFirst, the focus of the paper is on the robotics design methodology, which is quite off-topic in a conference about learning representations. The work should rather have been focused on the experiments performed in appendix C2 where PPO (Schulman 2017) is used to learn a task with the modular robot, but unfortunately this is not the case.\n\nSecond, the authors build on Brooks' 86 vision of bottom-up robotics, but they seem to ignore a lot of more recent research about modular and self-adaptive robotics, such as the work of Josh Bongard, Hod Lipson and many other very visible researchers in the domain.\n\nTo me, these two issues are enough to reject the paper.\n\nApart from that, though I'm quite sympathetic to the overall methodology, my feeling is that the performed experiment is not strong enough to support it, and that the very short \"Biological inspiration\" appendix is detrimental to the quality of the paper rather than it improves it.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Towards self-adaptable robots: from programming to training machines", "abstract": "We argue that hardware modularity plays a key role in the convergence of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
