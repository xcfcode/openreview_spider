We are of course happy to continue to respond to any further comments and questions.\n\nWe have responded to individual reviewers below. Here is a brief summary:\n\n-Rev 1 has a positive view of our paper and suggested it could be further improved with experiments that illustrate the tangible benefits of our approach. Accordingly, we have added experiments to show the much larger batch-size practically allowed by our method, and the corresponding benefits to computational efficiency from better utilizing available parallel cores on a GPU.\n\n-Rev 2\u2019s main concern is that given the memory cost savings one gets from checkpointing, our method may not be practically needed. We have noted that our method can be used not just independently (it has lower computational overhead than the cost of a forward pass for checkpointing) but also along with checkpointing---since these are independent and complementary strategies for reducing memory use. (We have clarified this in the revision). \n\nWhile check-pointing has a sub-linear (sqrt) memory cost wrt the number of layers, incorporating our method provides a factor improvement on that asymptotic cost (sqrt(An) vs sqrt(n) for A =\u215b or \u00bc).  We believe that there are many cases when checkpointing alone is not sufficient and further memory savings are needed, especially when a network is large not just because of depth (n), but also because of per-layer size: e.g., fully-convolutional networks with high-resolution images.\n\n-Rev 3 asked about our relationship to Hubara et al\u2019s work which also deals with quantization. We have clarified that their work does not reduce memory usage during training, but instead, seeks to reduce memory required for inference. We have included this in the revised related work section.\n\nWe have also adopted Rev 3\u2019s suggestion of moving tensorflow-specific implementation details to an appendix.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper604/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper604/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper604/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Backprop with Approximate Activations for Memory-efficient Network Training", "abstract": "With innovations in architecture design, deeper and wider neural network models deliver improved performance on a diverse variety of tasks.

But, we would like to emphasize that our method is not an alternative, but **complementary**, to gradient checkpointing. One doesn\u2019t preclude the use of the other.\n \nCheckpointing saves memory by dropping some activations and recomputing them during the backward pass. We reduce the amount of memory needed to save each set of activations. And so, within checkpointing, our method will require fewer activations to be dropped and recomputed, in turn improving the computational overhead of checkpointing.\n\nThus, checkpointing and our method are both ways of reducing the memory footprint of training,  each with their own trade-off. More importantly, they can be used by themselves or together. And since state-of-the-art networks for most tasks are only getting deeper, researchers and practitioners will be interested in exploiting all possible avenues for saving memory. This is why we are certain our method will be practically useful in many cases.\n\nGradient checkpointing is an elegant solution, and likely the best possible one for exact computation---as we already say in our paper (third para, Sec 2).

The results are as follows:\n\nAll numbers are Baseline vs 4-bit Approximation, in that order.\n\nResnet-1001-4x: [Max Batch Size: 26  vs 182   ]  [Time per sample: 130.8 ms vs 101.6 ms]\nResnet-1001:      [Max Batch Size: 134 vs 876  ]  [Time per sample:  31.3 ms vs  26.0 ms]\nResnet-488:        [Max Batch Size: 264 vs 1468]  [Time per sample:  13.3 ms vs  12.7 ms]\nResnet-254:        [Max Batch Size: 474 vs 2154]  [Time per sample:   6.5 ms vs   6.7 ms]\nResnet-164:        [Max Batch Size: 688 vs 2582]  [Time per sample:   4.1 ms vs   4.3 ms]\n\nThus our method allows significantly larger batches to be fit in memory. These are actual gains from our implementation, which will be released publicly with the paper. Moreover, for larger networks, our method provides us an advantage in wall-clock time. This is because the computation becomes memory bound when using lower batch sizes with regular training, and not all GPU cores are saturated. For smaller networks where the baseline is able to fit in a large enough batch to saturate the GPU, we have a small increase in the time.  This increase corresponds to time for computing the approximation.\n\nWe sincerely thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We believe these experimental results give readers tangible numbers that illustrate the benefits of using our approach in practice. We will add them to the paper.\n\n\n-Multi-GPU Training: Our implementation also supports multi-GPU training with data parallelism (i.e., splitting batches across GPUs). Here, our approximation allows for lower memory and therefore larger batches on each GPU. Note that the time per sample metric also applies to multi-GPU training, where it corresponds to time per sample per GPU. Thus, for a fixed number of GPUs, the wall-clock time advantage of our method for larger networks carries over.\n\nSince the original submission, we have run an experiment to train a larger 152 layer Resnet for Imagenet. These results were obtained by splitting the computation across two GPUs. The relative accuracy results were similar to the 34-layer version, with 10-crop Top-5 error rates being [Baseline: 7.2%], [8-bit: 7.7%], and [4-bit: 7.7%]. \n\nWhile our approximation method was able to fit the entire batch of 256 on two GPUs (128 on each), for the baseline we again had to do two forward-backward passes and average gradients (with 64 on each GPU in each pass). In this case too, we saw an advantage in wall-clock time because a batch of 64 for the baseline wasn't able to saturate all cores on each GPU. Our method took 17 seconds per iteration for the full batch (1 pass parallelized over two GPUs), while baseline training took 20 seconds (total of 2 passes over two GPUs)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper604/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper604/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper604/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Backprop with Approximate Activations for Memory-efficient Network Training", "abstract": "With innovations in architecture design, deeper and wider neural network models deliver improved performance on a diverse variety of tasks.

Please find answers to specific concerns below:\n\n- Regarding the Hubara et al. paper and comparisons to it:\n\nHubara et al. address a very different problem than we do. Crucially, their method does not reduce memory usage **during training**, which is the goal of our work. Instead, they reduce the amount of memory and computation the network would need for inference (i.e., after training).\n\nHubara et al.\u2019s goal is to enable the use of quantized weights and activations at \u201ctest time\u201d to reduce memory usage and computation cost in deployed networks. They train networks that can work with binary activations during inference, because it reduces model size and saves computation by turning floating point multiplications into binary operations. The paper addresses the challenge of how to train such quantized models, even though they are technically non-differentiable.\n\nTheir approach provides no memory advantage during training itself (unlike us, this is not their goal). This is because their training method still relies on full-precision real-valued versions of the weights and activations, with discretization interspersed to match test time performance. Specifically, \u201cAlgorithm 1\u201d in their paper clearly describes how their backward computation uses the real-valued versions of their binarized weights and activations. These are stored in memory at full precision during training.\n\nOur paper has a different goal: to train standard network models that will be used with full precision activations and weights for inference, using approximations to reduce their memory footprint during training. This is useful as training requires substantially more memory than inference, especially for deeper networks, due to the need for storing all intermediate activations. To clarify this, we will add a discussion of the Hubara et al. paper in our related work section.  \n\n- Regarding Description of Experimental Setup: We will adopt the reviewer's suggestion and split the description of the implementation. We will first describe the general approach, and later specify the relationship to the Tensorflow toolkit. We note that we rely on Tensorflow simply as a matter of convenience. We use it because it allows us to call the efficient GPU routines for per-layer forward and gradient computation.\n\n- Regarding memory management: There is typically no loss or gain in efficiency due to memory allocation calls since these allocation calls are made once at the beginning of training and not at every iteration. This is true for our implementation, as well as regular training in most toolkits (including Tensorflow). This is because the structure of the network does not change from iteration to iteration, and so the toolkit is able to allocate all required buffers a-priori (or during the first iteration). Thus the main advantage of our method is in the reduction of total allocated memory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper604/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper604/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper604/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Backprop with Approximate Activations for Memory-efficient Network Training", "abstract": "With innovations in architecture design, deeper and wider neural network models deliver improved performance on a diverse variety of tasks.

We would like to clarify that the baseline (without approximation) that we compare to does in fact include the \"cheap\" form of checkpointing that the reviewer suggests (we agree it is the right baseline to compare to). We indicate this in the end of the first para of Sec 3.2 and in the third para of Sec 4---but we realize that it could have been stated more clearly (i.e., without notation), and we shall do so in the revised version.\n\nThus, our baseline in fact does only store one set of activations for the set of batchnorm, relu, and conv (we count this as one layer in our definition of L). And our approximation strategy provides us a saving (of ~ 4x to 8x) over and above those of this basic form of checkpointing. Instead of storing that one set of activations in full floating point precision, we approximate it (after using the full precision version for the forward pass).\n\n- Also we want to clarify that compared to the more expensive forms of checkpointing---which permit sub-linear memory usage but require expensive recomputation of groups of conv layers--our method is nearly free in terms of computation cost---the only additional cost is elementwise rounding of activations, which is relatively negligible in a typical network as noted in the experiments. And even though our savings are linear, we believe a factor of 4x or 8x savings with nearly identical computational cost can be extremely useful in many settings.\n\nMoreover, in cases where memory is especially at a premium, our approximation-based method can be _combined_ with checkpointing. When breaking up the network into groups of layers, our method can be used to reduce the memory footprint even further for back-propagating within each group, thus allowing larger groups, fewer checkpoints, and hence less computational cost for the same memory budget. Essentially, our strategy is orthogonal (and therefore, potentially complementary) to checkpointing.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper604/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper604/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper604/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Backprop with Approximate Activations for Memory-efficient Network Training", "abstract": "With innovations in architecture design, deeper and wider neural network models deliver improved performance on a diverse variety of tasks.

While this scheme does not benefit from computational speedups of activation quantization on both passes (and indeed has a slight computational overhead), the authors demonstrate that for common convolutional architectures it nicely preserves the accuracy of computation by computing the forward pass at full accuracy and limiting propagation of errors in the backward pass. This is possible because the majority of errors are introduced in gradient calculation of the weights and not the inputs each layer. The authors also wisely perform quantization after batch normalization and use the known mean and variance of the activations to scale the quantization and reduce errors. They demonstrate very slight drops in performance accuracy for ResNets on Cifar10, Cifar100, and ImageNet with memory compression factors up to 8. They also point to natural future directions such as using vector quantization to better leverage the activation statistics. The paper is also very clearly written with appropriate references to the relevant literature. \n\nAn area of improvement I could see for the paper would be to demonstrate the utility of the reduced memory footprint. Their motivation clearly outlines that reducing memory can allow for larger batch sizes and larger networks that can improve the performance of training, but the authors do not demonstrate an example of this principle. They do mention that they are able to train with a larger batch size on ImageNet without combining batches, but more quantitative evidence of improvements in wall clock time (for different batch sizes) or improvement in performance (for larger networks) would help support the arguments of the paper. Given that the authors are focusing on single device training, they don't have to necessarily improve the state of the art, but a relative comparison would be illustrative. Also, specific measurements of the change in memory footprint for real networks would be helpful.

But the increased memory footprint of these models presents a challenge during training, when all intermediate layer activations need to be stored for back-propagation. Limited GPU memory forces practitioners to make sub-optimal choices: either train inefficiently with smaller batches of examples; or limit the architecture to have lower depth and width, and fewer layers at higher spatial resolutions. This work introduces an approximation strategy that significantly reduces a network's memory footprint during training, but has negligible effect on training performance and computational expense. During the forward pass, we replace activations with lower-precision approximations immediately after they have been used by subsequent layers, thus freeing up memory. The approximate activations are then used during the backward pass.
