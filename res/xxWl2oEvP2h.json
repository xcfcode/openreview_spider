As for the traditional heuristics, ant colony is selected as a native  baseline, while OR-tools and LKH3 stand for more integrated commercial solvers and state-of-the-art solutions. Thus, the ant colony here is rather only an academia representative, while LKH3 is the state-of-the-art meta-heuristic among all and could provide strong enough comparison. While, our contribution is solving the large scale VRP by learning methods. The major baselines are the recent proposed RL based approaches for VRP. In summary, the comparisons with up-to-date meta-heuristic solvers and RL methods as baselines are extensive for the performance evaluation.\n\n\n$\\textbf{Question 2:} $ Whether runing with a timeout strategy, and what is the CVRP model selection in OR-Tools settings.\n\n$\\textbf{Response:} $ In our experiment, OR-Tools is run to optimal, and its performance is worse than both LKH3 and our method. Thus if it is run with a timeout strategy, the performance will be worse. The fundamental CVRP model is used in running OR-tools. We use the code and default settings in the official guides: \nhttps://developers.google.com/optimization/routing/cvrp. \n\n$\\textbf{Question 3:} $  Is there any information about the optimality gap of the found solutions?\n\n$\\textbf{Response:} $ For large-scale VRP, since it is unfeasible to find the exact optimal solution, the optimality gap usually cannot be obtained. Thus, we compare the performance obtained by different heuristics or learning-based baselines in our experiments. \n\n$\\textbf{Question 4: } $ Explanation of the metric used to compare both selection strategies.\n\n$\\textbf{Response: } $  Figure 3 demonstrates the results of the two region-selection strategies (adjacent v.s. RL). We first compute the performance ratio of the current solution of every rollout step to the final optimal solution, whose value are larger than 1. We further reduce it by 1 to generate the final metric, and plot in the log scale. We utilize this metric to better showcase the performance improvement along the rollout steps and distinct the comparison between the two methods, as shown in Figure 3. We have clarified the above metric description in the caption of Figure 3.\n\n$\\textbf{Question 5:} $ Whether the performance is gained from the partitioning&rewriting in general according to the close performance in Sec 4.2.\n\n$\\textbf{Response:} $ We agree with that results in Sec 4.2 suggests the general rewriting process benefits for the performance gain compared to other methods, while the attention-selection design also provides further improvements. The major framework of RBG is the hierachical  structure that combines meta-heuristics and RL methods. It benifits from the meta-heuristic idea, integrated in the rewriter, to guarantee the high solution quality while the learning nature, especially the generator, guarantees the computation efficiency for inference. In the detailed rewriter design, either a fixed strategy or an RL agent can execute the heuristic operations. Sec 4.2 demonsrates that the RL agent is a better choice due to its performance improvement.\n\n$\\textbf{Question 6:} $ Did the authors test to pick a fixed heuristic strategy, e.g. pick the adjacent partition that has not been touched the longest or that had the biggest improvement before (or any other, there are several choices)? Did you have a look at the strategy the LSTM converges to?\n\n$\\textbf{Response:} $ Thanks for the constructive suggestions. The performance comparison analyzed in Sec 4.2 is a semi-fixed heuristic strategy as suggested. The selecting is not totally random by setting a hyperparameter K as the adjacent range, and the rewriter selects one region randomly from the K neighbors to operate. More deterministic heuristic strategy designs proposed by the reviewer are interesting suggestions, and we will upload the relative comparison once new results come out. \n\nAs for the convergence of the RL based rewriter, it tends to select spatially close regions when the network converges, as shown in Figure 7. The visualization of the final solutions demonstrates that the network do not mix one region with another that is far away, but only generate close selections. The convergence results match with the simple fact that customer locations within a route should be close to reduce the traveling cost.\n\n$\\textbf{Minor Commets:} $ Typo modifications. \n\n$\\textbf{Response:} $ We appreciate you for pointing out the language problems.  We have improved the writting throughout our paper.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1488/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1488/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Rewriting by Generating: Learn Heuristics for Large-scale Vehicle Routing Problems", "authorids": ["~Hansen_Wang1", "~Zefang_Zong1", "~Tong_Xia1", "syluo@hitachi.cn", "mzheng@hitachi.cn", "jindp@tsinghua.edu.cn", "~Yong_Li3"], "authors": ["Hansen Wang", "Zefang Zong", "Tong Xia", "Shuyu Luo", "Meng Zheng", "Depeng Jin", "Yong Li"], "keywords": ["vehicle routing problem", "reinforcement learning", "optimization"], "abstract": " The large-scale vehicle routing problems are defined based on the classical VRPs with thousands of customers.

In our previous response, \"OR-Tools is run to optimal\" means that we report the best performance which OR-tools can reach under the settings, but not the real optimality among all possible solutions for the problem. In fact, OR-Tools can hardly achieve the real global optimality, according to Bello et al., \"it is a common choice for general routing problems and provides a reasonable baseline between the simplicity of the most basic local search operators and the sophistication of the strongest solvers.\"\n\nWe further exploited how OR-Tools handled its exploration process under its default settings as we apply. In the default searching strategy, the \"automatic\" local search, \"lets the solver select the metaheuristic\" directly. While for our evaluation it selects greedy-descent local search. OR-Tools can keep accepting improving local search neighbors without a timeout. However, a problem for such an algorithm is the presence of plateaus, where no local move will decrease the cost and that is when OR-Tools stop running. Thus, the final result is only a local minimum but not a global optimality. That is also why OR-Tools are worse than LKH3 (the state-of-the-art meta-heuristic so far according to Helsgaun et al. and Lu et al).\n\nFor reference, LKH3, as a meta-heuristic method, outperforms OR-Tools on all scales in recent works, including on small scales (N=20,50,100) in both [2] and [3], and on large scales (N=500,1000,2000) in our experiment. However due to the rapid increase in solution space, both two methods face the challenge of exploration efficiency, while our proposed method could decompose the large scale problem and solve them via a hierarchical RL framework. This is the reason why RBG shows its superiority on both inference speed and solution quality when the problem scale becomes large enough.\n\n[1]Irwan Bello, Hieu Pham, Quoc V Le, Mohammad Norouzi, and Samy Bengio.

The intuition is that the solution is more likely to improve when two \"near\" regions are merged. When the problem size increases, the regions will have more neighbor regions under a global scope. Therefore, for N=500,1000,2000, we choose K to be 5,8,9 increasingly. We have made the details more clear in Sec3.3. \n\n$\\textbf{Question 10:} $ Why AM-train-on-100 have better performance compared to  AM-sampling?\n\n$\\textbf{Response:} $ On small-scale problems, it is true that training on the same size as test data will result in the best performance as shown by AM-sampling as the previous work presented. However, this characteristic does not remain in large-scale problems as the exponential growth in complexity. When the scale is large, directly training on such data suffers from terribly delayed reward and the enormous searching space, which makes it hard to be trained and find the close-optimal solution (This is also part of the motivation of our work). On the other hand, the model trained on small size may learn easier, while the knowledge it learned is generalizable(e.g., choosing the near customers from the current position may be better than choosing the far-away customers),  thus it can perform relatively good compared to AM-sampling on larger graphs. Note that we have renamed AM-train-on-100 to AM_100-greedy for better formatting.\n\n$\\textbf{Question 11:} $ Regarding AM-train-on-100, was sampling or greedy rollout used?\n\n$\\textbf{Response:} $ AM-train-on-100 is greedy, we have clarified it in the paper by renaming it to AM_100-greedy. We appreciate the reviewer for pointing it out.\n\n$\\textbf{Question 12:} $ Whether the results averages over a number of runs in Table 2 and any intuition about why the values are so close in all cases.\n\n$\\textbf{Response:} $ The result in Table 2 is a single run with the same random seed. The result suggests that our framework has a good ability of generalization, and knowledge on different scales is transferable to another. More experiments to generate the averages over a number of runs can be a great augmentation to the evaluation results. We appreciate for the reviewer's careful review and we are supplementing  experiments accordingly.\n\n$\\textbf{Question 13:}$ Figure 3: what are the \"rollout steps\" here exactly? Do you have an explanation for the rapid drop of the ratio right before 100?\n\n$\\textbf{Response:}$  A \"rollout step\" is a rewriting step, i.e., we split-merge-regenerate the solution once. We run 100 rollout steps for each instance at evaluation. \n\nFor the second question, we have clarified the metric description in the caption of Figure3, where we compare the result of the two region-selection strategies (adjacent v.s. RL). We first compute the performance ratio of the current solution of every rollout step to the final optimal solution, whose value is larger than 1. We further reduce it by 1 to generate the final metric for comparison. For a better comparison we plot the figure by computing the log value.  Since the performance is tending to be the optimal when the rewriting gradually ends, the metric is approaching to zero and the log value thus drops rapidly.\n\n$\\textbf{Question 14:} $ Figures 7 and 8: Why are the routes not starting and ending at the depot in red?\n\n$\\textbf{Response:}$ Every route starts and ends at the depot indeed. In these figures, we omit these two line segment, one starting and another one ending at the depot, for clarity in visualization, referring to Kool et al, 2019. The visualization will be too vague if they are plotted. We have clarified it in the description of Figure7 and Figure8 in the paper.  \n\n================================================================\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1488/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1488/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Rewriting by Generating: Learn Heuristics for Large-scale Vehicle Routing Problems", "authorids": ["~Hansen_Wang1", "~Zefang_Zong1", "~Tong_Xia1", "syluo@hitachi.cn", "mzheng@hitachi.cn", "jindp@tsinghua.edu.cn", "~Yong_Li3"], "authors": ["Hansen Wang", "Zefang Zong", "Tong Xia", "Shuyu Luo", "Meng Zheng", "Depeng Jin", "Yong Li"], "keywords": ["vehicle routing problem", "reinforcement learning", "optimization"], "abstract": " The large-scale vehicle routing problems are defined based on the classical VRPs with thousands of customers.

We respond to your question as follows,\n\n$\\textbf{Question 1:} $ The reason to choose VRP as the target problem and the generalizability to other combinatorial optimizations.\n\n$\\textbf{Response:} $ Existing heuristic approaches for VRP face the major shortcomings of computational efficiency. In order to solve this problem, learning based methods has aroused much  attention recently, including many works in ICLR and NeurIPS (Kool et al., 2019; Nazari et al.,2018; Lu et al., 2020), which could generate VRP solution within seconds while the heuristic have to take hours. However,  all these methods only perform well when trained on usually no more than 100 customers, which cannot handle large-scale instances, i.e., thousands of customers, due to the unstable training caused by the exponentially expanding exploration space. Thus, it is important to develop a learning based solution to solve large-scale VRP, following the same problem setup proposed by the above works. This is the major reason that we choose VRP as the target problem. \nMoreover, our proposed solution can also be generalized as a framework for other specific combinatorial optimizations. For instance, to solve the large-scale KnapSack problem, the large amount of items and the total weight constraint can be clustered into groups. A global RL based rewriter with the current design is responsible to merge-repartition the regions while the the generator keep generating local solutions. The rewriter and the generator are trained under a hierarchical framework, which forms RBG. We have supplemented the discussion on generalizability in Sec 5.\n\n$\\textbf{Question 2:} $ Technical novelty of the proposed framework compared to meta-heuristics.\n\n$\\textbf{Response:} $ The motivation of this paper is to propose a learning based framework to solve the large-scale VRP. The high solution quality of previous meta-heuristics and the computation efficiency of reinforcement learning motivate us to combine the ideas from both fields of Operations Research and machine learning together. Thus, our designed rewriter agent is inspried by the idea of merging-repartitioning operations, and the related technical contribution is to conduct operations for exploration via a learning-based agent instead of a fixed or handcrafted heuristic strategy. The strength of such operations is able to construct an effective exploration process in the enormous searching space, while the hierarchical reinforcement learning design can guarantee the computation efficiency from the prospect of fast solution generation on test instances that have similar distribution with training ones.  Moreover, the combination of two techniques can also inspire solution to solve other combinatorial optimization problems. We have added the related discussion in the fourth paragraph of Sec 3.\n\n$\\textbf{Question 3.} $ The reason of not addressing constraints/considerations in real VRP applications in the current model. \n\n$\\textbf{Response:} $ The main contribution of this paper is proposing an effective RL based learning solution to solve the large-scale VRP, which follows the same problem setup as the recent work in ICLR (Lu et al., 2020) where only the basic CVRP is selected as the problem setup. Thus, we did not address the detailed constraints/considerations in real VRP applications, since a realistic solver with details is not our first goal. Meanwhile, our model have the ability to consider more detailed real-life constraints with minor respective modification on the generator. For example, to solve the vehicle routing problem with time window(VRPTW) with the consideration of the time window constraint and the cooperations between different vehicles, we only need to replace the generator by the one that includes these new constraints, for example, the RL based VRPTW solver (Zhang et al., 2020). The entire hierarchical structure remains the same. More generally, new constraints/considerations can be handled by designing adaptive generators for small-scale problems alone, and the supplemented discussion on these considerations is added in Sec 5.\n\n[1]Kool W, van Hoof H, Welling M.

As for the non-learning heuristics, the ant colony is selected as a native well-known academia baseline proved by its 1227 citations up to now, while OR-tools and LKH3 stand for more integrated commercial solvers. The chosen of ant colony here is rather only an academia representative, while LKH3 is the state-of-the-art meta-heuristic among all and could provide strong enough baseline comparison. Besides, the motivation of our proposed framework is to tackle the large scale problem for learning methods. The major comparison of our experiments is with the recent RL based approaches for VRP. Providing comparisons with up-to-date methods from both two techniques is strong enough for the experiment comparison.\n\n$\\textbf{Feedback 19: } $Reference for the expression \u201c\u2026many realistic industrial applications in which a vast number of customers may occur frequently.\u201d\n\n$\\textbf{Response:} $ Arnold et al., for example, claimed that \"even though some applications like waste collection and parcel distribution can require tens of thousand of customers to visit, almost all research thus far has been targeted at solving problems of no more than a few hundred customers.\" Here we also aim to point out that customer size may explode into much larger scales than the algorithm could estimated, while our framework can still be pratical.  We have added the reference in Sec 4.1. Besides, CVRP, the setting we focus on, does not limit the number of vehicles as generated routes can be assigned to multiple vehicles finally. In Arnold's paper, a general VRP solver was proposed without considering multiple vehicles as well.

Due to the page limit we did not address too many detailed considerations on VRP, including the multi-vehicle setting as the reviewer stated. Meanwhile, our model is capable to be applied to other large scale combinatorial problems with more constraints and considerations. For instance, in the vehicle routing problem with time window(VRPTW), the cooperation between vehicles and the individual time windows are additional constraints. The method for such an adaptation is to\u00a0replace the generator by the one that includes these new constraints, such as the small-scale RL based VRPTW solver proposed in(Zhang et al., 2020) recently, while the entire hierarchical structure remains the same. Thanks for this comment and we are going to explore the  generalizability to not only the variants of VRP, but also other combinatorial optimizations as our future work.\n\n[1]Lu H, Zhang X, Yang S.

We intended to mean that large-scale VRP is unexplored for learning-based methods originally. We have clarified it in the paper, \"Therefore, providing effective and efficient solutions for large-scale VRP is a challenging problem.\"\n\n$\\textbf{Question 7:} $ How to guarantee the feasibility of hyper-region splitting?\n\n$\\textbf{Response:} $ We divide the hyper-region into regular-sized regions according to the features of 'routes' instead of 'customers'. Therefore, maintaining the routes computed in the hyper-region can always be guaranteed. The detail is as follows. \n\nIn the example provided by the reviewer, if there are route A, B, C in a hyper region, we will first get the geographic centre of all customers in A, B and C separately. Based on the spatial proximity, we can assign A with its customers as region G_1, and combine B, C into region G_2. Finally region G_1 and region G_2 have 10 and 20 customers, respectively. We thus clarify here that although we can always maintain the routes in the hyper-region, the \"regular size\" condition, i.e., close number of customers, is only a closed approximation but not a strict constraint. \n\n\"Regular sized\" regions are optimal, but extreme cases may happen, e.g., uneven customer distribution after splitting as in the example above. But the generator is generalizable on a range of problem sizes, thus it can still handle the scale after merging two non-standard regular sized regions. In addition, as we observed in our experiments, after several merge-and-split steps with other regions, the number of customers in every region is tending to be close.\n\n$\\textbf{Question 8:} $ Reference of \u201cThese heuristics usually have a time complexity of O(n 2 log n 2 )\u201d .\n\n$\\textbf{Response:} $ After reviewing the related literature, we find that the time-complexity statement is not accurate enough. We appreciate the reviewer for pointing it out. The time complexity of O(n 2 log n 2 ) actually  denotes the complexity of VRPTW solved by meta-heuristics(El-Sherbeny, 2010). In general, solving CVRP by heuristics have a polynomial complexity, and may vary according to the detailed method. We have removed the statement in the paper. \n\n[1]El-Sherbeny N A.

Finding something more recent or performant would however strengthen the presentation of the results, even though I do not expect it to outperform the presented method.\nIs OR-Tools run with a timeout or is it solved to optimality? Which CVRP model was used there?\nIn general, is there any information about the optimality gap of the found solutions?\n\nIn Sec. 4.2 (Analysis of Rewriting Strategy) I do not completely follow the metric used to compare both selection strategies.\nCould the authors clarify this?\nAlso, the difference between both strategies are mostly small, which indicates that most of the performance benefits stem from the partitioning & rewriting in general and less from the learned selection strategy.\nSince one of the strategies is random, did the authors test to pick a fixed heuristic strategy, e.g. pick the adjacent partition that has not been touched the longest or that had the biggest improvement before (or any other, there are several choices)?\nDid you have a look at the strategy the LSTM converges to?\n\n# Minor Comments\n\nThere are a couple of language problems in the paper and an additional round of proof-reading would be beneficial.\nE.g. the \"problem\" in the title should be plural, the first sentence in the 2. paragraph of page 1 has some extra words (\"those two lines\"), and there are multiple other issues.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1488/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1488/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Rewriting by Generating: Learn Heuristics for Large-scale Vehicle Routing Problems", "authorids": ["~Hansen_Wang1", "~Zefang_Zong1", "~Tong_Xia1", "syluo@hitachi.cn", "mzheng@hitachi.cn", "jindp@tsinghua.edu.cn", "~Yong_Li3"], "authors": ["Hansen Wang", "Zefang Zong", "Tong Xia", "Shuyu Luo", "Meng Zheng", "Depeng Jin", "Yong Li"], "keywords": ["vehicle routing problem", "reinforcement learning", "optimization"], "abstract": " The large-scale vehicle routing problems are defined based on the classical VRPs with thousands of customers.

A \u201crewriting agent\u201d is responsible for dividing the customers into regions while a \u201cgenerating agent\u201d is responsible for computing the vehicle routes in each region, independently. The rewriting agent learns to score pairs of regions to be merged, using as a reward the reduction of VRP cost gained by the merge. The VRP costs are computed by the generating agent, which is based on the attention model of (Kool et al 2019), that is known to perform well for smaller scale VRPs. \n\nStrong points\n-------------------\n1. The main contribution of the paper is the novel rewriting process that allows to decompose the problem into smaller subproblems, that can then be tackled with state-of-the-art methods.\n2. The numerical experiments show that this approach allows to efficiently solve large problems (2000 nodes).\n\nWeak points\n------------------\n3. Many confusions in the text, in particular regarding the related works (see Feedback to improve the paper)\n4. To validate the hierarchical framework and the rewriting process, it would have been great to apply it to other large scale combinatorial problems. For instance, the multiple vehicle routing problem, where the rewriter would be responsible of assigning the customers to the vehicles.\n5. The authors do not mention whether they will release their code.\n\nRecommendation\n-------------------------\nI would vote for accept. To me the hierarchical framework and the rewriting process are novel in this context and can potentially be applied in other problems. \n\n\nQuestions to authors\n-----------------------------\n6. \u201clarge-scale VRP is an *unexplored* and challenging problem\u201d: VRP is one of the most studied problems in Operations Research. Among other aspects, there are of course works that aim at solving large scale problems. What do you mean by unexplored?\n7. In Section 3.3, after the selection and merging phases, the hyper-regions are again split into 2  \u201cregular sized\u201d regions, while maintaining the routes computed in the hyper-region. Is this always guaranteed to be feasible? Say you end up with 3 routes, of 10 customers each, in the hyper-region. How to split them in this case?\n8. \u201cThese heuristics usually have a time complexity of O(n 2 log n 2 )\u201d can you share a reference for this claim?\n9. Sec 3.3 \u201cwe restrict Gj to the K nearest regions to Gi\u201d. How is K chosen?  \n10. Table 1: The results reported for AM-sampling vs AM-train-on-100 are a bit surprising to me. The paper (Kool et al 2019) reported the best performance when the model was trained and tested on the same size. Do you have an idea of why it\u2019s not the case here? \n11. Regarding AM-train-on-100, was sampling or greedy rollout used?\n12. Table 2: are these results averages over a number of runs? Do you have an intuition about why the values are so close in all cases?\n13. Figure 3: what are the \"rollout steps\" here exactly? Do you have an explanation for the rapid drop of the ratio right before 100?\n14. Figures 7 and 8: Why are the routes not starting and ending at the depot in red?\n\nFeedback to help improve the paper\n---------------------------------------------------\n15. In the introduction, \u201csince pre-defined rules are not suitable for various cases of customer distribution, those methods have poor generalization ability\u201d. It does not make sense to talk about generalization ability for non-learning based methods.\n16. The \u201cexploration space of large-scale VRP\u201d / \u201cexploration complexity\u201d is confusing. I think you mean solution space instead of exploration space.\n17. There are confusions at several points regarding heuristics vs learning algorithms: \u201c....can be divided into heuristics and reinforcement learning (RL)\u201d. RL-based approaches are also computing heuristics to solve the VRP, in the sense that they are not computing exact solution of the problem. So I guess here by heuristics, the authors mean non-learning based heuristics.\n18. The Ant Colony baseline of 1999 does not look competitive at all with the other standard Operations Research heuristics for VRP (here LKH3 and OR Tools) so I don\u2019t see the point in reporting its results (Table 1).\n19. Sec 4.1 \u201c\u2026many realistic industrial applications in which a vast number of customers may occur frequently.\u201d Do you have any reference for that? I would guess that when the number of customers is really large, it\u2019s more likely to resort to the multiple vehicle problem.\n20. Sec 4.3 \u201c\u2026this is the rare case in real-world.\u201d Do you have a reference? Intuitively I tend to disagree, customers are likely to be grouped within cities for instance.\n21.

It borrows the idea of the hierarchical RL agent, which consists of two parts: \"Generator\" and \"Rewriter\". In the generation process, the graph is divided into several sections and in each section, an RL algorithm runs to get the best route. Then, the rewriter gets the solution of all generators and tries to connect them together with the goal of globalizing them with a smaller route. To this end, the rewriter merges each of two sub-problems together and then divides it into another two sub-problem and solves each again. Doing this helps decrease the route length. This diving and merging is learned by an RL agent (think of the outer agent in the hierarchical RL) so that the rewriter learns when and how to do this. The rewriter uses the attention mechanism to choose two parts of the merged routes, and then get a new solution for each part using the inner-agent. To get the initial sub-problems, K-mean clustering is used to get sub-problems of about 100 nodes. In the evaluations, CVRP of size 500, 1000, and 2000 are considered. The results are compared to LKH3 and google OR-Tools, along with RL algorithms.
