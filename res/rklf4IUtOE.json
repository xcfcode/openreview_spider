The proposed model consists of a VAE (as a class-conditioned encoder)  and a SVG decoder (with LSTM and MDN layers) and can generate reasonable images for digits and letters.\n\nPros:\n\n1. The generated characters are good. We can easily recognize the generated characters. And they are of various fonts.\n\n2. Since the encoder is class-conditioned, we can generate other characters of the same font given one character.\n\n3. The learned latent embeddings are meaningful.\n\nCons & questions:\n\n1. The description of the model is not very clear. It is better to add more details.\n\n2.
