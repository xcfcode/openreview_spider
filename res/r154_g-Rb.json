A MDP over options does not necessarily need to be solved with RL; if the transition function is known then you can use planning to solve the MDP which is exactly what the authors do here with Dijkstra's algorithm.

The high-level task plan is not learned, but is computed using Dijkstra's algorithm. The benefit of this method (called the \"Attribute Planner\", or AP) is that it is able to generalize to tasks requiring multi-step plans after only training on tasks requiring single-step plans. The AP is compared against standard A3C baselines across a series of experiments in three different domains, showing impressive performance and demonstrating its generalization capability.\n\nPros:\n- Impressive generalization results on multi-step planning problems.\n- Nice combination of model-based planning for the high-level task plan with model-free RL for the low-level actions.\n\nCons:\n- Attributes are handcrafted and pre-specified rather than being learned.\n- Rather than learning an actual parameterized high-level transition model, a graph is built up out of experience, which requires a large sample complexity.\n- No comparison to other hierarchical RL approaches.\n\nQuality and Clarity:\n\nThis is a great paper. It is extremely well written and clear, includes a very thorough literature review (though it should probably also discuss [1]), takes a sensible approach to combining high- and low-level planning, and demonstrates significant improvements over A3C baselines when generalizing to more complex task plans. The experiments and domains seem reasonable (though the block-stacking domain would be more interesting if the action and state spaces weren't discrete) and the analysis is thorough.\n\nWhile the paper in general is written very clearly, it would be helpful to the reader to include an algorithm for the AP.\n\nOriginality and Significance:\n\nI am not an expert in hierarchical RL, but my understanding is that typically hierarchical RL approaches use high-level goals to make the task easier to learn in the first place, such as in tasks with long planning horizons (e.g. Montezuma's Revenge). The present work differs from this in that, as they state, \"the goal of the model is to be able to generalize to testing on complex tasks from training on simpler tasks\" (pg. 5). Most work I have seen does not explicitly test for this generalization capability, but this paper points out that it is important and worthwhile to test for.\n\nIt is difficult to say how much of an improvement this paper is on top of other related hierarchical RL works as there are no comparisons made. I think it would be worthwhile to include a comparison to other hierarchical RL architectures (such as [1] or [2]), as I expect they would perform better than the A3C baselines. I suspect that the AP would still have better generalization capabilities, but it is hard to know without seeing the results. That said, I still think that the contribution of the present paper stands on its own.\n\n[1] Vezhnevets, A. S., Osindero, S., Schaul, T., Heess, N., Jaderberg, M., Silver, D., & Kavukcuoglu, K.

The authors claim that the novelty is in using the framework for test generalization.\u201d \n\nWe respectfully disagree.  The framework discussed in the paper is not a semi-MDP.  In our work, we have a Markovian environment which does not give any reward. Other than the attribute specification (either an explicit mapping or (state, attributes) training examples), all the agent\u2019s interaction with the environment is unsupervised. \n\nThis is most visible in section 4.2 (Stacking Blocks).  In this experiment, the agent acts randomly at train time, and its policy is trained by trying to regress the action it actually took given a (state, next_attribute) pair.  This unsupervised training only sees 1-step transitions.  At test time, the agent is asked to go from a state to relatively distant set of attributes, requiring multiple steps.    \nThus, while as mentioned in the text, there is a part of the setup that could be trivially framed in terms of options, the framing does not help with the tasks we study.\n\nFundamentally, semi-MDP and options are methods for formalizing temporal abstraction in an RL setting.   Our work is about using supervision to parameterize a space of tasks, independent of RL.  We have tried to explain that the learning paradigm described in the paper is not really even RL at all, even though we use some of the same language.  We will try to make the text clearer, but we also hope the reviewers can try to understand the learning paradigm we have studied, rather than trying to force our work into a hierarchical RL template.   \n\n\n> \u201cNo comparison to other hierarchical RL approaches\u201d  \n\nAs discussed, our paradigm differs from RL, thus it is not trivial to adapt hierarchical RL for this setting. In particular, hierarchical RL still requires a reward signal in order to learn a meta-policy over options, which is not provided in our setting; and in particular these methods require access to rewards from full-length trajectories, which our method does not.   Furthermore, most existing approaches to HRL require that a set of low-level options are provided (which they are not here);  there has been little success for methods that learn options in complicated state spaces with function approximation.\n\n\n> \u201cThe author should give better account of the relation between the proposed method to other frameworks. The authors mentioned that the proposed method can be placed into the framework of option. However, the option frame is mainly dealing with temporal abstraction, whereas this work seems have much more to do state abstraction.\u201d\n\nWe agree that the discussion of related work could be improved, particularly the connections to and differences with options frameworks. We will revise the paper to make this clearer.   However, note also that we emphasize in the related work that our approach is most similar to Factored MDP and Relational MDP; these deal with state abstraction.\n\n\n> \u201cIn this work, the attributes are provided by human, which certainty can incur a significant amount of effort hence limit is generalizable of the proposed method.\u201d \u201c For instance automatically discovering attributes is the next big open question and authors allude to it.\u201d\n\nWe agree that automatically discovering attributes is an important and interesting problem, and would complement this work on using attributes for planning. However, we believe there is value in testing the building blocks of a system in isolation before trying to put the whole system together, and as learning attributes is challenging in its own right, it is not in the scope of this work.   \nWe also believe that there are many situations where an attribute space can be readily provided externally, e.g. block stacking, starcraft, minecraft, house navigation, robotics, etc. Therefore, this approach has immediate value and doesn\u2019t require the hard problem of representation learning to be solved. Furthermore, in the tasks we use for our experiments, we find that attribute specification is not overly onerous, requiring only a few thousand labeled examples to specify the attribute space for block stacking, and for grid worlds only a few hundred.\n\nOther work, such as Policy Sketch (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01796.pdf ; ICML best paper) also assumes that external task supervision can be provided without being learned from scratch."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Composable Planning with Attributes", "abstract": "The tasks that an agent will need to solve often aren\u2019t known during training. However, if the agent knows which properties of the environment we consider im- portant, then after learning how its actions affect those properties the agent may be able to use this knowledge to solve complex tasks without training specifi- cally for them. Towards this end, we consider a setup in which an environment is augmented with a set of user defined attributes that parameterize the features of interest. We propose a model that learns a policy for transitioning between \u201cnearby\u201d sets of attributes, and maintains a graph of possible transitions. Given a task at test time that can be expressed in terms of a target set of attributes, and a current state, our model infers the attributes of the current state and searches over paths through attribute space to get a high level plan, and then uses its low level policy to execute the plan. We show in grid-world games and 3D block stacking that our model is able to generalize to longer, more complex tasks at test time even when it only sees short, simple tasks at train time.\n", "pdf": "/pdf/d667839da2c68b0934c71feb8368c7a70eb53ff8.pdf", "TL;DR": "Compositional attribute-based planning that generalizes to long test tasks, despite being trained on short & simple tasks.", "paperhash": "zhang|composable_planning_with_attributes", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nzhang2018composable,\ntitle={Composable Planning with Attributes},\nauthor={Amy Zhang and Adam Lerer and Sainbayar Sukhbaatar and Rob Fergus and Arthur Szlam},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=r154_g-Rb},\n}", "keywords": ["Planning", "Compositionality", "Attributes", "Reinforcement learning"], "authors": ["Amy Zhang", "Adam Lerer", "Sainbayar Sukhbaatar", "Rob Fergus", "Arthur Szlam"], "authorids": ["amyzhang@fb.com", "alerer@fb.com", "sainbar@cs.nyu.edu", "fergus@cs.nyu.edu", "aszlam@fb.com"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "duedate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "tmdate": 1516825730726, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper605/Official_Comment", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"replyto": null, "forum": "r154_g-Rb", "writers": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper605/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper605/Authors|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper605/Area_Chair|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper605/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper605/Authors|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper605/Area_Chair|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "value-dropdown": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper605/Authors_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper605/Reviewers_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper605/Area_Chairs_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 0, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper605/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper605/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper605/Area_Chair", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "cdate": 1516825730726}}}], "count": 10}
