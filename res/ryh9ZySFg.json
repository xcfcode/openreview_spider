We have revised Section 2 of the manuscript by adding the following descriptions: \n+ Each memory module is learned via a lookup table with a constant input at each position (e.g. 1 as input to the first position and t as input to position t). \n+ To learn each of the L memory matrices, we use a separate lookup table. \n+ Essentially each vector of a lookup table learns to encode the representation of that position with an embedding vector of dimension p, where p is a hyperparameter we specify (more details below in A3). \n+ Each lookup table is progressively learned during training. However, it is indeed different from the writing module in traditional memory papers such as the Neural Turing Machine.  \n+ We encode the test input using another lookup table with the actual sequence as input to produce the input matrix S. Thus, this lookup table is of dimension p, with input size 4 (for A,C,G,T, which are represented as 1,2,3,4)."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Memory Matching Networks for Genomic Sequence Classification", "abstract": "When analyzing the genome, researchers have discovered that proteins bind to DNA based on certain patterns on the DNA sequence known as \"motifs\".

We tried the case of setting p=2, 4, 8, 16. p=4 gave the best overall classification performance. \n+ Since each position of both the input DNA sequence and memory units are represented in an embedding space of dimension p, we can vary the hidden dimension p to any size. \n+ Interestingly, we also tried another memory-NN structure by (1) encoding the input sequence as one-hot vectors, (2) setting p=4 for the memory lookup tables, and (3) then adding a softmax operation on each column vector of M_i. The rest of the network are the same as the proposed. train the whole network. Training on the same datasets, this actually resulted in better accuracy (mean AUC of 0.94), but we implemented this after the submission so the results were not reported.

In the authors' experiments on a previously studied dataset, their technique exceeds the accuracy of convolutional and recurrent neural networks.\n\nPros:\n-The authors have taken on an important problem--TF binding is critical to gene regulation and our present models are insufficient to precisely predict bound sites in large mammalian genomes. Advances in this space have great value, and the authors may have an advance here.\n\nMajor Cons:\n-The most substantial problem is the authors' suggestion that the memory in their model is \"dynamically learned\" without any description of how that aspect is implemented. Though the authors describe how the memory is used, I'm clueless as to how the memory is specified or \"learned\". This is a significant absence, and a dealbreaker for my recommendation as a reviewer.\n-Furthermore, the authors also decline to describe the second layer of LSTMs in the form of the g function. The authors state that the f function maps DNA sequences to a vector, and they state that the g' function shares the weights from f. The authors suggest that g is an LSTM, but fail to explain why or how the LSTM operates on a single vector.\n\nMinor Cons:\n-The authors suggest that the memory matrix column size p can take values other than 4. Doesn't this dimension refer to the 4 nucleotides? When p is set to different values, how are the authors representing the DNA sequences?\n-If the authors care about producing a useful tool for biologists, they will have to relax their assumption of a dataset balanced between positive and negative examples. TFBS in mammalian genomes is picking needles out of a haystack.\n-The language in the paper is sloppy in multiple places. E.g. current TFBS motifs aren't \"manually\" defined as the authors state; they are computationally defined using different methods. The authors also suggest that doctors may be reluctant to use their model, which is irrelevant; doctors do not examine TFBS.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Memory Matching Networks for Genomic Sequence Classification", "abstract": "When analyzing the genome, researchers have discovered that proteins bind to DNA based on certain patterns on the DNA sequence known as \"motifs\".
