It does so by letting neurons be of only compact support and thus if the input is out of distribution (OOD) it is expected to be outside that support and therefore the output will be zero. This is used to detect OOD examples. A parameter alpha is used in the algorithm that determines the size of the support. When it is small then the network acts very similarly to a regular network and when it increases the support is limited. Therefore, to make training stable, they start with a small alpha and then increase it throughout the training. \nThen in inference, a value for alpha should be selected that balances the classification accuracy and the OOD detection. For small alpha the classification accuracy is relatively good, yet, the OOD detection is virtually zero. When alpha is very large the OOD detection rate is very high but the classification accuracy deteriorates significantly. \n\nThe strategy proposed in this work is quite interesting and might be useful. Yet, I have some concerns:\n\nTo make the comparison fair for all the methods, the same test error should be used. As can be seen from the graphs, the OOD decreases significantly when the Test error decreases. \n\nAlso, a discussion on the selection of alpha is missing.

Units can smoothly be changed between standard (dot-product) and RBF type through a shape hyperparameter. During training, this hyperparameter is slowly moved in the direction of the RBF shape. Empirical comparisons on three OOD problems are presented, showing that the proposed approach is competitive.\n\n\n### Score\nThe authors propose a novel algorithmic idea for OOD detection and show that it is competitive. However, the results show that their approach is highly sensitive to the choice of the shape hyperparameter alpha. In practice, robust ways of choosing and annealing the shape hyperparameter alpha will be needed for the method to be useful. As detailed below, I think this aspect is not addressed in satisfactory detail. Hopefully the weaknesses and comments will be addressed by the authors during rebuttal, currently, I view the paper as marginally below acceptance.\n\n### Pros\n+ New methods to reliable detect OOD samples are potentially impactful, since they can be applied across different domains\n+ The authors present a novel algorithmic idea to the best of my knowledge\n+ CSNNs overall show good performance when compared against alternative approaches\n\n### Cons\n- The results show that the authors method is highly sensitive to the choice of the shape hyperparameter alpha. For their empirical comparisons the authors chose alpha as follows: \u201cBased on these insights, for each dataset we chose the classifier corresponding to the largest \u03b1 where the test error takes a value comparable to the other methods compared, and reported the AUROC and NZ values in Table 1\u201d. This selection strategy can hardly be transferred to practice \u2014 it would mean training another OOD method first, in order to select a suitable alpha. For the proposed algorithm to be useful in practice, it is central to devise and demonstrate robust schemes of finding the shape hyperparameter that do not rely on running another method. Else, methods that can be more easily used and show comparable performance, such as deep ensembles, may be preferable despite higher training times\n- Similar to the UCQ paper, it would be worthwhile to report performance of larger ensemble methods, e.g., ensemble of 10 networks\n- No variability in performance metrics is provided in Table 1, runs should be repeated and reported with different seeds and measures of variability (e.g. the standard error of mean) should be reported\n\n### Additional comments\n- My understanding from reading the paper is that neurons with zero outputs are pruned. In figure 9, the amount of neurons with non-zero outputs (NZ curve) seems to quickly go down to 0. Wouldn\u2019t this imply that all neurons in the output layer are pruned, i.e., how can such a network still be used?\n- The curves for train and test error of MNIST in Figure 9 seem to be identical, is there an explanation for this?\n- Reference section should be revised carefully, e.g.: Goodfellow et al. (2014) was published in ICLR 2015, Hendrycks et al. (2017) misses venue\n\n\n### Update\n\nThe authors have not sufficiently addressed my comments regarding the choice of alpha in practice. While a possible strategy was proposed, it has not been evaluated empirically, see comments below for more details.

Is that correct? How about other metric? How about to pre-calculate the distance on dataset in the representation space, and reject those samples which are away from the class center?\n\nYes, the distance is assumed to be meaningful, but the neurons are not centered on the class centers, but are supposed to cover the instance space. In our model one neuron could be involved in multiple classes and multiple neurons are usually involved for one class.\nThe assumption that the classes are separable and can be covered by one neuron each is much stronger.\nFor example it does not hold for the moons dataset but our model can handle this data without problems.\n\n- The performance gain of proposed method comparing to other baseline methods which can also stable the training of RBF network is marginal (especially in Table.1).\n\nWe now added a standard CNN to Table 1. One could see that the DUQ, which is the only other RBF-based method, obtains worse results than the standard CNN on two out of three datasets, while our method obtains the much better results than DUQ or the standard CNN on all three datasets.\n\n- The backbone and the training datasets of RBF network are quite small, could the proposed method stable the training of large network with large dataset (such as training deeper ResNet on Imagenet)?\n\nYes, because we start from a pretrained deep network. Training just the last 2 layers as a CSNN should take about a day on one GPU for Imagenet. Training the CSNN-F is equivalent to 6 epochs of training the deeper Resnet on ImageNet, starting from the trained deep ResNet and trained CSNN."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper301/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper301/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Compact Support Neural Network", "authorids": ["~Adrian_Barbu1", "hm15f@my.fsu.edu"], "authors": ["Adrian Barbu", "Hongyu Mou"], "keywords": ["RBF network", "OOD detection", "overconfident neural networks"], "abstract": " Neural networks are popular and useful in many fields, but they have the problem of giving high confidence responses for examples that are away from the training data.

For their empirical comparisons the authors chose alpha as follows: \u201cBased on these insights, for each dataset we chose the classifier corresponding to the largest a where the test error takes a value comparable to the other methods compared, and reported the AUROC and NZ values in Table 1\u201d. This selection strategy can hardly be transferred to practice \u2014 it would mean training another OOD method first, in order to select a suitable alpha. For the proposed algorithm to be useful in practice, it is central to devise and demonstrate robust schemes of finding the shape hyperparameter that do not rely on running another method. Else, methods that can be more easily used and show comparable performance, such as deep ensembles, may be preferable despite higher training times\n\nWe now added a sentence in page 8 about how to choose the alpha parameter in practice and how it relates to our choice for the evaluation.\n\n- Similar to the UCQ paper, it would be worthwhile to report performance of larger ensemble methods, e.g., ensemble of 10 networks\n\nWe now report results for both the 5 and 10 ensembles.\n\n- No variability in performance metrics is provided in Table 1, runs should be repeated and reported with different seeds and measures of variability (e.g. the standard error of mean) should be reported\n\nWe rerun our experiments and now report results as average of 10 runs, with standard deviation.\n\nAdditional comments\n- My understanding from reading the paper is that neurons with zero outputs are pruned. In figure 9, the amount of neurons with non-zero outputs (NZ curve) seems to quickly go down to 0. Wouldn\u2019t this imply that all neurons in the output layer are pruned, i.e., how can such a network still be used?\n\nThe NZ measures the nonzero outputs for the OOD data, which we would like to be as few as possible. \nIt does not measure the nonzero outputs on the training or test data.\n\n- The curves for train and test error of MNIST in Figure 9 seem to be identical, is there an explanation for this?\n\nThe train and test errors are very small but the test error is slightly higher than the training error, as one could see if the image is enlarged. The difference between them is about 0.005, which is very small compared to the range of the plot, from 0 to 1.\n\n- Reference section should be revised carefully, e.g.: Goodfellow et al. (2014) was published in ICLR 2015, Hendrycks et al.
