In the classifier retraining, the backbone network is fixed while the last FC layer is processed in multiple ways, either retrained or tau-normalized. \n\nTherefore, for \"Class-balanced sampling\", \"Joint\" means the classifier learned during representation learning, while \"cRT\" means the classifier retrained during classifier retraining. So it's possible that the results are slightly different.

We also note that we intend to release all the code, models and training recipes to facilitate reproducible research in long-tailed recognition.\n\nWe noticed that most of the concerns come from tau-normalization. We thank the reviewers for making us look deeper into this strategy; we\u2019d like to clarify the setup and discuss some new findings inspired by the high-quality reviews here. \n\nFirst we would like to clarify *how tau is selected*. In our submission, tau is determined by grid search on a validation dataset. The search grid is [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0]. We use overall top-1 accuracy to find the best tau on validation set and use that value for test set.\n \nThe best tau value should reflect the category imbalance degree of a dataset, thus it is expected that it should not be identical across different datasets. In our experiments, we use tau value 0.7 on ImageNet_LT, 0.8 on Places_LT and 0.3 on iNaturalist. Though tau is dataset-dependent, we find it is very robust to backbone networks, training epochs and other optimization hyper-parameters: we verified that best tau values are identical among those different settings.\n\nThe current tau-normalization strategy does require a validation set to choose tau, which could be a disadvantage depending on the practical scenario. Can we do better?\n\n== Finding tau value on training set==\nAfter reading the reviews, we made an attempt to select tau directly on the *training* dataset. Surprisingly, final performance on testing set is very similar, with tau selected using training set only. \n\nWe achieve this goal by simulating a balanced testing distribution from the training set. We first feed the whole training set through the network to get the top-1 accuracy for each of the classes. Then, we average the class-specific accuracies and use the averaged accuracy as the metric to determine the tau value. In the following table, we compare the tau found on training set and validation set for all three datasets. We can see that both the vale of tau and the overall performances are very close to each other, which demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for tau on training set. This strategy offers a practical way to find tau even when validation set is not available.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDataset             split    learn   tau    |   Many  Medium   Few   All    \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nImageNet_LT   val         N      0.7            59.1     46.9      30.7    49.4\n                           train     N      0.7             59.1     46.9      30.7    49.4\n                           train     Y       0.6968      59.2     46.9      30.6    49.4\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\niNaturalist        val         N      0.3            65.6     65.3      65.9    65.6\n                           train      N      0.2            69.0     65.2      63.6    65.0\n                           train      Y       0.3146     65.1     65.2      66.1    65.6\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlaces_LT          val        N       0.8            37.8     40.7      31.8    37.9\n                           train     N      0.6             41.4     39.3     25.3    37.4\n                           train     Y       0.5246      42.6     38.3     22.7    36.8\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n== Learning tau value on training set==\nWe further investigate if we can automatically learn the tau value instead of grid search. To this end, following cRT, we set tau as a learnable parameter and learn it on the training set with balanced sampling,  while keeping all the other parameters fixed (including both backbone network and classifier). Also, we compare the learned tau value and the corresponding results in the above table (denoted by \u2018learn\u2019 = \u2018Y\u2019). \nThis further reduces the manual effort of searching best tau values and make the strategy more accessible for practical usage.

According to Fig 2, it should be around 0.7 for ImageNet-LT but you should clearly specify the used values for all the datasets. For reproducibility. It is also important to know it as it has an impact on how useful is this approach in practice. Because if the coefficients are very different for all the datasets, then the method requires a validation set to find this hyperparameter.\n* As middle point between NCM and cRT, you could also train a cosine classifier as done in the paper that you cite \"Dynamic few-shot visual learning without forgetting\" by Gidaris et al. There is pytorch code for it online. \n\n\nI am leaning towards acceptance as the method is clear, easy to implement, well studied through the experiments and has good results on standard benchmarks.

They comprehensively study several sampling methods for representation learning and different strategies for classification. They find that instance-balanced sampling gives the best representation, and simply adjusting the classifier will equip the model with long-tailed recognition ability. They achieve start of art on long-tailed data (ImageNet-LT, Places-LT and iNaturalist).\n\nIn general, this is paper is an interesting paper. The author propose that instance-balanced sampling already learns the best and most generalizable representations, which is out of common expectation. They perform extensive experiment to illustrate their points.\n\n--Writing:\nThis paper is well written in English and is well structured. And there are two typos. One is in the second row of page 3, \"\u2026 a more continuous decrease [in in] class labels \u2026\" and the other one is in the first paragraph of section 5.4, \"\u2026 report state-of-art results [on on] three common long-tailed benchmarks \u2026\". \n\n--Introduction and review:\nThe authors do a comprehensive literature review, listing the main directions for solving the long-tailed recognition problem. They emphasis that these methods all jointly learn the representations and classifiers, which \"make it unclear how the long-tailed recognition ability is achieved-is it from learning a better representation or by handling the data imbalance better via shifting classifier decision boundaries\". This motivate them to decouple representation learning and classification.\n\n--Experiment:\nSince this paper decouples the representation learning and classification to \"make it clear\" whether the long-tailed recognition ability is achieved from better representation or more balanced classifier, I recommend that authors show us some visualization of the feature map besides number on performance. Because I am confused and difficult to image what \"better representation\" actually looks like. \n\nThe authors conduct experiment with ResNeXt-{10,50,101,151}, and mainly use ResNeXt-50 for analysis. Will other networks get similar results as that of ResNeXt-50 shown in Figure 1?\n\nWhen showing the results, like Figure 1, 2 and Table 2, it would be better to mention the parameters chosen for \\tau-normalization and other methods.\n\nConclusion:\nI tend to accept this paper since it is interesting and renews our understanding of the long-tailed recognition ability of neural network and sampling strategies. What's more, he experiment is comprehensive and rigorous."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1412/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1412/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["kang@u.nus.edu", "xiesaining@gmail.com", "maroffm@gmail.com", "zhicheng.yan@live.com", "albert.gordo.s@gmail.com", "elefjia@nus.edu.sg", "ykalant@image.ntua.gr"], "title": "Decoupling Representation and Classifier for Long-Tailed Recognition", "authors": ["Bingyi Kang", "Saining Xie", "Marcus Rohrbach", "Zhicheng Yan", "Albert Gordo", "Jiashi Feng", "Yannis Kalantidis"], "pdf": "/pdf/2be5582a3de2661961b882fb82da2c1937c67162.pdf", "abstract": "The long-tail distribution of the visual world poses great challenges for deep learning based classification models on how to handle the class imbalance problem.

Different known and novel sampling schemes during training as well as post-training procedures to restore the class balance after training are studied. The overall best strategy turns out to be naive training on the skewed training set, and post-hoc rebalancing only of the classification stage. The paper presents various ablation studies and comparisons with related methods on the ImageNet-LT, Places-LT, and iNaturalist data sets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.\n\nThe paper is well-written and gives a nice overview on related work and in particular reweighted sampling schemes. The proposed methods and variations appear to be simple, yet very effective, and the insight that decoupling representation and classifier learning performs well on long-tailed classification seems novel. The experiments are mostly thorough and detailed. Here are some more detailed comments:\n\n- My main concern is the selection strategy of \\tau in \\tau-normalized classification. The authors merely specify that they choose it in the interval (0,1). How is this tuned exactly? Per data set or the same for all data sets? On a validation set? It would be great to provide more details and guidelines for practitioners. Also, in Fig. 2 left, what is the \\tau used?\n\n- It would be interesting to see whether the performance can be improved by training a shallow MLP rather than just retraining the weights of the linear classifier W.\n\n- Retraining a linear classifier on a fixed representation can be brittle, at least this can be observed in the context of unsupervised representation learning. The authors should add details about the exact schedules, batch size etc. used for retraining the linear classifier in cRT.\n\nOverall I like the paper, but it is important to add more detail, in particular about the choice of of \\tau.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1412/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1412/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["kang@u.nus.edu", "xiesaining@gmail.com", "maroffm@gmail.com", "zhicheng.yan@live.com", "albert.gordo.s@gmail.com", "elefjia@nus.edu.sg", "ykalant@image.ntua.gr"], "title": "Decoupling Representation and Classifier for Long-Tailed Recognition", "authors": ["Bingyi Kang", "Saining Xie", "Marcus Rohrbach", "Zhicheng Yan", "Albert Gordo", "Jiashi Feng", "Yannis Kalantidis"], "pdf": "/pdf/2be5582a3de2661961b882fb82da2c1937c67162.pdf", "abstract": "The long-tail distribution of the visual world poses great challenges for deep learning based classification models on how to handle the class imbalance problem.
