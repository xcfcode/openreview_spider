We really appreciated it. \n\nThe assumption of \"locally connected neural network\" is indeed important. However we regard this assumption as an important contribution of this paper rather than a restriction. First of all, network with such structures (e.g., CNN) indeed works in practice but how they work remain an open problem. Therefore, a theoretical analysis is important. Furthermore, without such structural assumptions, a general analysis of neural networks won't lead to meaningful conclusion that connects to what we see in practice. Our paper is an attempt to make such connections. \n\nThe assumptions in Theorem 2 are intuitive and are explained right after Theorem 2. For the first assumption, the intuition is: the summarization variable z_\\alpha at the receptive field \\alpha mainly captures the input content x_\\alpha at that receptive field. Given that summarization variable z_\\alpha, others have minor effects. Therefore, we assume that P(x_\\alpha | z_\\alpha, z_{others}) = P(x_\\alpha | z_\\alpha). The second assumption is technical and is true when z_\\alpha splits x_\\alpha well. In reality, we can always turn the two assumptions into bounds and Theorem 2 becomes bounds as well. \n\nWe argue that these assumptions are way more natural than parametric forms (e.g., Gaussian inputs), and serve as one step closer to the real situations.\n\nMarginalized Gradient: At iteration t, we can always treat the current weights as constants and take expectation over the data distribution. In fact, it is a standard practice in many previous theoretical papers [1-4], no matter whether population gradient or stochastic gradient are used. \n\nWe didn't take expectation with respect to the output of the neuron. Do you mean the label $y$? In this case, it is not an issue since y is assumed to be the deterministic function of the input x. Therefore, taking expectation with respect to (x, y) is the same as with respect to x (the input) alone. We already explained it in the paper (Page 4, just before \"Marginalized Gradient\"). \n\nFinally, the notations $g_j(x_k)$, $g_j(x_j)$ and $g_j(x)$ were intentionally overloaded to make the notation cleaner. Otherwise one would need to use different functions for different version of the gradient signal. Alternatively we could use $g_{j\\rightarrow k}(x_k)$, which is a bit heavy in notation (e.g., too many \"k\"). Therefore, this is more or less a subjective thing. \n\nThroughout the paper, it is a convention that node j is the parent of node k. We will mention clearly the role of j and k in Theorem 2 in the next revision. \n\nReferences:\n[1] R. Ge et al.

The main idea seems to be that the network is sparsely connected, so each neuron is not going to have access to the entire input. One can then think about the gradient of this neuron locally while average out over all the randomness in the input locations that are not relevant to this neuron. Using this framework the paper tried to explain several phenomena in neural networks, including batch normalization, overfitting, disentangling, etc.\n\nI feel the paper is poorly written which made it very hard to understand. For example, as the paper states, the model gives a generative model for input (x,y) pairs. However, I could not find a self-contained description of how this generative model works. Some things are described in Section 3.1 about the discrete summarization variables, but the short paragraph did not describe: (a) What is the \"multi-layer\" deterministic function? (b) How are these z_\\alpha's chosen? (c) Given z's how do we generate x? (d) What happens if we have z_\\alpha and z_\\beta and the regions \\alpha and \\beta are not disjoint? What x do we use in the intersection?\n\nIn trying to understand the paper, I was thinking that (a)(b) The multilayer deterministic function is a function which gives a tree structure over the z_\\alpha's, where y is the root. (I have no idea why this should be a deterministic function, intuitively shouldn't y be chosen randomly, and each z_\\alpha chosen randomly conditioned on its parent?)  (c) there is a fixed conditional distribution of P(x_\\alpha|z_\\alpha), and I really could not figure out (d). The paper definitely seems to allow two receptive fields to intersect as in Figure 1(b).\n\nWithout understanding the generative model, it is impossible for me to evaluate the later results. My general comments there is that there are no clear Theorems that summarizes the results (the Theorems in the paper are all just Lemmas that are trying to work towards the final goal of giving some explanations, but the explanations and assumptions are not formally written down). Looking at things separately (as again I couldn't understand the single paragraph describing the generative model), the Assumption in Theorem 3 seems extremely limiting as it is saying that x_j is a discrete distribution (which is probably never true in practice). I wouldn't say \"the model does not impose unrealistic assumptions\" in abstract if you are going to assume this, rather the model just makes a different kind of unrealistic assumptions (Assumptions in Theorem 2 might be much weaker, but it's hard to judge that).\n\n==== After reading the revision\n\nThe revised version is indeed more clear about how the teacher network works, and I have tried to understand the later parts of the paper again. The result of the paper really relies on the two assumptions in Theorem 2. Of the two assumptions, the first one seems to be intuitive (and it is OK although exact conditional independence might be slightly strong). The second assumption is very unclear though as it is not an assumption that is purely about the model/teacher network (which are the x and z variables), it also has to do with the learning algorithm/student network (f's and g's). It is much harder to reason about the behavior of an algorithm on a particular model and directly making an assumption about that in some sense hides the problem. The paper mentioned that the condition is true if z is fine-grained, but this is very vague - it is definitely true if z is super fine-grained to satisfy the assumption in Theorem 3, but that is too extreme.\n\nOverall I still feel the paper is a bit confusing and it would benefit from having a more concrete example.

We are working on a revision, which will be uploaded by Nov. 23. \n\nFor now we first address the main questions raised by the reviewers. \n\n1. [R2] There is no main theorem in this paper. \n\nIt remains a grand challenge for the whole community to come up with a theorem that relates data distribution to the properties of deep and nonlinear network. As the major contribution and a first step, we propose a reformulation that explicitly relates data distribution to the gradient descent optimization procedure. With this reformulation, we now can explicitly study how data distribution affects the property of the network. Along this direction, we put a few initial discussions in the paper. An application of this reformulation towards a major theorem is left to future work. \n\nBesides, we also discover a property of back-propagated gradient of BatchNorm (Sec. 4) and show that this property is preserved in the reformulation. \n\n2. [R1][R2] How teacher is defined.\n\nThe teacher is specified in a bottom-up manner (rather than top-down, as suggested by the reviewer 2). First the lowest layers of summarization is computed, then the second lowest layer of summarization is computed based on the lowest layers (ref. Sec 3.1: z_\\alpha = z_\\alpha(z_\\beta)), until the top-level summarization is computed, which is the class label y. At each stage, we assume that the upwards function be deterministic and typically drop irrelevant information w.r.t the class label. The reason why we want a deterministic function is for the proof of Theorem 2. Note that while top-down graphical model requires nondeterministic function (since new information needs to be added), assuming deterministic function in a bottom-up setting is natural. \n\n3. [R2] How z_\\alpha is picked and how to define P(x_\\alpha|z_\\alpha):\n\nz_\\alpha is picked by the teacher. Since the teacher provides the classification labels for the student, any choice of z_\\alpha would fit to the theory. Intuitively, z_\\alpha is a summarization of the content x_\\alpha within the receptive field \\alpha, which contributes to the final label y.  \n\nDue to a loss of information, there are multiple x_\\alpha that maps to the same z_\\alpha. Therefore, we can define P(x_\\alpha|z_\\alpha). \n\n4. [R2][R3] Is the assumption in Theorem 2 (and 3) realistic? \n\nTypically, z_\\alpha and z_\\beta are overlapping (Fig. 1(b)). In particular, if \\alpha is a parent of \\beta, then the receptive field \\alpha covers \\beta. With this in mind, the two assumptions in Theorem 2: \n\n          P(x_\\alpha|z_\\alpha, z_\\beta) = P(x_\\alpha|z_\\alpha) \n\n                 and \n\n          P(x_\\beta|z_\\alpha, z_\\beta) = P(x_\\beta|z_\\beta) \n\nare natural, since each z is most related to the information of its own receptive field. \n\nTheorem 3 is a limiting case of Theorem 2, which gives an example about when the assumptions of theorem 2 hold exactly. If the assumptions of Theorem 2 are relaxed (e.g., ||P(x_\\alpha|z_\\alpha, z_\\beta) - P(x_\\alpha|z_\\alpha)|| \\le \\epsilon), still we have bounds (instead of equalities) in Theorem 2.  \n\n5. [R1] The data distribution is indirectly characterized by the conditional distribution P(z_\\alpha | z_\\beta), which may not be ideal/questionable. \n\nWe think it is more like a merit rather than a shortcoming. An indirect specification (like what we give in the paper) gives much more flexibility of the distribution x. In contrast, a direct/parametric specification (e.g., the input data is Gaussian) might look mathematically clear but is probably not true in practice. On the other hand, given this indirect specification, we agree that the resulting distribution of input deserves further empirical study (e.g., via sampling x given z). \n\n 6. [R1] Empirical study\nWe will add more empirical studies in the next revision. We already observe the convergence of the reformulations (Theorem 2) under random conditional distribution of summarization variable (P(z_\\alpha|z_\\beta)), and much faster convergence if BatchNorm is used. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1284/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1284/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1284/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A theoretical framework for deep and locally connected ReLU network", "abstract": "Understanding theoretical properties of deep and locally connected nonlinear network, such as deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), is still a hard problem despite its empirical success.

It is not clear why the \"teacher-student setting\" can be called a theoretical framework, even the definitions of the teacher and the student are not clear. It seems that the new framework is just a way to compute the relations of the gradients of neurons based on a few assumptions (Theorem 2).\n\n2. I found it very hard to follow the notations given in this paper. The main reason is that many of the terms appear without a definition, and the reader has to guess what they stand for. For example, in equation (2), w_{jk} seems to be the weight between nodes j and k, where k is a child of j. But this term is not defined. As another example, all the matrices in Theorem 9 are not defined. They just suddenly appear. In addition, S(f) in (11) is not defined. I would suggest the authors to spend one section to carefully define everything. \n\n3. The theorems all depends on some assumptions that are unclear whether will hold in practice or not. For example, in theorem 2, it is hard to see what kind of data distribution satisfy these three conditions. Although in Theorem 3 the author gave a sufficient condition, we still don't know what kind of $X$ satisfies this. For example, does Gaussian distribution satisfy those? This problem also happens to other theorems. It would be much better to make sure that these assumptions are unrealistic.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1284/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A theoretical framework for deep and locally connected ReLU network", "abstract": "Understanding theoretical properties of deep and locally connected nonlinear network, such as deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), is still a hard problem despite its empirical success.

To our best knowledge, this is novel.  By imposing different conditions on the data distribution, there could be many interesting consequences. In our paper, we only barely scratch the surface. \n\nFor mathematical rigorousness: Given the assumptions in the paper are true, to our best knowledge and efforts, all the statements named \"theorems\" in our paper are rigorous. You can check the Appendix for all the detailed proofs. Note that it is totally possible that we might make mistakes.
