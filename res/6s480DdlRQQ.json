The main idea is to generate different backdoor patterns and locations in backdoor attack. The threat model is the attacker has full access to the training data and the model training procedure. Both single-target and multi-target class-conditional triggers were explored. Experimental results on three datasets in the 100% poisoning setting verified the effectiveness of the proposed attack.\n\nStrengths:\n1. This paper investigated an important problem for secure deep learning.\n2. The proposed methods were well motivated.\n3. Empirical results indicate that dynamic backdoor triggers are possible.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. Missing many existing works on backdoor attacks. The related work section only mentioned two backdoor attacks Gu et al., 2017 and Liu et al. 2019b. To my knowledge, there are many existing works in this field.\n2. The discussion of the key properties for backdoor triggers are weak. For example, the injection rate, and the stealthiness of the trigger pattern. Existing works have proposed reflection triggers or even invisible triggers.  Compared to these triggers, the proposed triggers are not stealthy at all. Appearing in different places of the input image even makes the trigger more easily detectable (at least to human checkers).\n3. The proposed methods need to poison at least 30% of the training data, however, many existing methods only poison 10%-20% of the training data. \n4. The 6 training steps described on Page 6 indicate that the proposed methods need to modify the model training process. This is different from a typical backdoor setting where the attacker cannot control the training procedure, which allows the attacker to invade commercial models by only poisoning the data. From this perspective, the setting adopted in this paper is questionable.\n5. The 30% poisoning setting in Section 4.6 is not clear. Was the 30% only used for training the BaN then poisoning 30% data using the BaN model or does it still need the entire training data (but only 30% contain the trigger)? The training process on Page 6 says the BaN and the backdoored model need to be trained simultaneously (step 6).\n6. One more concern, the training of BaN nets needs a certain proportion of the training data. Even 30% is still a lot for large-scale datasets like ImageNet. However, many existing attacks do not need a generator, which makes the attack more applicable and convenient. Can the generators trained on one dataset transferable to other datasets?\n\n---\nComments after the rebuttal:\n\nOverall, the attack settings are still questionable: low stealthiness, high poisoning rate, and intervening the training process. \n\n- The authors clarified that \"Neither our random backdoor technique nor the transferred BaN and c-BaN requires that\", however, in 3.1 Threat Model, it is clearly stated \"The dynamic backdoor attack is a training time attack, i.e., the adversary is the one who trains the backdoored DNN model. To implement our attack, we assume the adversary controls the training of the target model and has access to the training data following previous works (this is actually not true)\", the authors seem misunderstood the different between \"controlling the training of the model\" to data poisoning.\n\nIn terms of the difference to static trigger,\n\n- The authors argued that they are different to static trigger and \"a static trigger cannot be used as a dynamic trigger\", which I don't find it is verified somewhere. Actually the random backdoor proposed in this paper proves that a static trigger when applied to a random location still works very well, even as good as BaN and c-BaN. Whether existing triggers can already achieve a dynamic effect or not is unclear, or verified.\n\nWithout knowing how hard it is to make a static trigger works in a dynamic manner, or where it will completely fail, it is hard to evaluate the contribution and novelty of the proposed attacks. In other words, it seems that a static trigger attached to random locations is good enough to achieve the dynamic purpose, which I don't think is contributive enough.\n\nStealthiness and poisoning rate is another concern, say when you apply the BadNets to random locations, how high the poisoning rate will be to achieve 100% ASR? Higher than 20% or need 100%?\n\nOverall, the lack of thorough comparisons of the trigger properties to existing attacks is the major weekness.\n\nSo my rating will stay the same.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper212/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper212/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dynamic Backdoor Attacks Against Deep Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~Ahmed_Salem2", "rui.wen@cispa.saarland", "~Michael_Backes1", "shiqing.ma@rutgers.edu", "~Yang_Zhang15"], "authors": ["Ahmed Salem", "Rui Wen", "Michael Backes", "Shiqing Ma", "Yang Zhang"], "keywords": ["Backdoor attack", "Deep Neural Networks security"], "abstract": "Current Deep Neural Network (DNN) backdooring attacks rely on adding static triggers (with fixed patterns and locations) on model inputs that are prone to detection.

However, we believe other setups will have similar results and plan to evaluate and include them in the next version of the paper.\n\n-- Intervening the training process: Neither our random backdoor technique nor the transferred BaN and c-BaN requires that. All the adversary needs to do is poisoning the data.\n\n--  High poisoning rate: We empirically found that the transferred attacks and random backdoor only need to poison less than 20% of data.\n\n--  Stealthiness and comparison to static backdoor: To launch our attack, the procedure is similar to the static backdoor, that is adding a trigger to one part of the image. However, the current static backdoor only allows the attacker to add a fixed trigger on a fixed location of the image.  For instance, in the given example, for the static backdoor to work, the angle should be fixed so that the trigger is in the correct position. If the angle changes and the trigger appears in a different position, the backdoor will not be activated. Hence, a static trigger cannot be used as a dynamic trigger. More importantly, static backdoor attacks can be effectively detected by the current defense mechanisms. On the other hand, our attack allows the attacker to find a dynamic pattern trigger and add it to a dynamic position on the image. This makes our dynamic backdoor different from the static backdoor.\n\n-- Transparency: To our knowledge, current backdoor attacks do not use transparent triggers when implementing the attack in the physical world. This is indeed an interesting direction, and we plan to explore it in the future with lab study.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper212/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper212/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dynamic Backdoor Attacks Against Deep Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~Ahmed_Salem2", "rui.wen@cispa.saarland", "~Michael_Backes1", "shiqing.ma@rutgers.edu", "~Yang_Zhang15"], "authors": ["Ahmed Salem", "Rui Wen", "Michael Backes", "Shiqing Ma", "Yang Zhang"], "keywords": ["Backdoor attack", "Deep Neural Networks security"], "abstract": "Current Deep Neural Network (DNN) backdooring attacks rely on adding static triggers (with fixed patterns and locations) on model inputs that are prone to detection.

Backdoor attacks are training-time attacks whereby an adveresary trains a network in such a way that it functions as a classifier on honestly generated images, but it has the added caveat of also being able to misclassify on images corrupted via a \"trigger\" set by an adversary. This is a grave security concern, and as such there is substantial literature that relates to both systematically training backdoored DNNs, and also detecting when a trained DNN has a backdoor. \n\nAs the authors mention, the existing literature on backdoors typically has a static backdoor where a single portion of an image is altered to create a trigger in a deterministic fashion / location. The authors improve the functinoality of backdooring a DNN by creating a training process where triggers can now appear at random locations in the image and can have random contents. The way they do so is by judiciously and simultaneously training a GAN in conjunction to the DNN that will be corrupted. The GAN uses the DNN under training as a discriminator and ultimately produces corrupted images with triggers that are meant to push the DNN towards having a backdoor through typical training procedures. These GAN-based techniques are key to both algorithms the authors present: BaN (random location triggers) and c-BaN (random location and contents to trigger). \n\nFinally, the authors validate how effective their backdoor techniques are by training on MNIST, CelebA and CIFAR-10 datasets. Their backdoored DNN have their performance measured by how well they misclassify on triggered images and on how little they compormise on state of the art accuracy in non-backdoored models. The authors show that their models have a small sacrifice in terms of accuracy (although their model interestingly enough classifies better on CelebA), and furthermore, their backdoors are robust to existing methods used to catch backdoored DNNs\n\n\nPros:\nI was not as familiar with existing literature on backdoored DNNs until reading this paper. I see how this is a valid concern in the community, and I believe that the authors have provided a better attack with respect to the state of the art. Furthermore, their simulations do a good job of providing evidence of this improvement (in terms of both the visual output of the triggers, and also the performance against software used to find backdoored DNNs)\n\nQuestions / Points to address:\n-As someone who is not as conversant with relevant literature on backdoored DNNs, I wonder how much work has been done on the fact that the triggers used are easily identifiable by a human looking at the picture (in termss of a blatant square in a given location). Though I am also no expert, there is a mature field of Steganography that focuses on mathematical methods of concealing information in images (and other media files). Is there significant overlap in what has been studied with this? Can the DNN architecture used be informed by existing theory in this field?\n-I am also curious about the fact that the backdoored classifierse performed better on CelebA vs. other data sets. I see the authors' point about this possibly being a form of regularisation, but it would be interesting to see the performance of this methodology on more complex datasets that may also exhibit this behaviour.

Three techniques which areRandom Backdoor, Backdoor Generating Network (BaN) and conditional BackdoorGenerating Network (c-BaN) are used to implement dynamic backdoor attacks. The results of empirical evaluation show that the proposed attacks are effective as well as difficult to defend by several defense mechanisms.\n\nStrength (significance and novelty):\n1. They propose the first class of dynamic backdoor attacks. And this work is well motivated. Previous backdoor attacks only use a fixed and static backdoor trigger, which is set to the default assumption of several defense mechanisms. Dynamic backdoors chosen from a set of predefined triggers and locations or generated byGAN, can bypass these defense mechanisms.\n2.  In the empirical evaluation, the proposed attack algorithm is effective varying different datasets and is robust to several defense mechanisms.\n3. In addition to single target label and multiple target label attacks, they also propose an auto-encoder based defense against dynamic backdoor attacks.\n4. The techniques in dynamic backdoor attacks are simple yet effective. And the paper is well-written and easy to follow.\n\nWeakness:\n1. This work only considers white-box backdoor attacks, i.e., the attacker controls the target model and has access to the training data. I suggest the authors should refer Refool [1] and study the transferability of BaN and c-BaN to different data distributions and model architectures.\n2. This work aims to improve backdoor robustness to defense mechanisms. However, theSec 4.5 state-of-the-art defenses is too brief. More experiments and illustrations should be added to this part. Here are some suggestions:\n\n3. Since the motivation of this work is to \u201cbreak\u201d the assumption in some model-based defenses, it would be interesting to compare the reversed triggers and the original triggers (sample from the dynamic trigger distribution). In addition to Neural Cleanse and ABS, MESA [2] can also be considered for its superior to Neural Cleanse.\n\n4. Add some visualizations to understand dynamic backdoor attacks, e.g. Grad-CAM,  which is widely adopted in backdoor attacks [1, 3].\n\n5. Add a comparison with traditional static backdoor attacks against different defense mechanisms, which would be more convincing.\n\nReference\n1. Liu, et al.

In this paper, we propose the first class of dynamic backdooring techniques: Random Backdoor, Backdoor Generating Network (BaN), and conditional Backdoor Generating Network (c-BaN). Triggers generated by our techniques have random patterns and locations. In particular, BaN and c-BaN based on a novel generative network are the first two schemes that algorithmically generate triggers.  Moreover, c-BaN is the first conditional backdooring technique that given a target label, it can generate a target-specific trigger.  Both BaN and c-BaN are essentially a general framework which renders the adversary the flexibility for further customizing backdoor attacks. We extensively evaluate our techniques on three benchmark datasets and show that our techniques achieve almost perfect attack performance on backdoored data with a negligible utility loss.
