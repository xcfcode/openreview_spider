The paper focuses on the user-level privacy setting, where the complete contribution of a single user is protected as opposed to protecting a single training example. The algorithm is based on the Federated Averaging and Federated Stochastic gradient framework.\n\nPositive aspects of the paper: The paper is a very strong empirical paper, with experiments comparable to industrial scale. The paper uses the right composition tools like moments accountant to get strong privacy guarantees. The main technical ideas in the paper seem to be i) bounding the sensitivity for weighted average queries, and ii) clipping strategies for the gradient parameters, in order to control the norm. Both these contributions are important in the effectiveness of the overall algorithm.\n\nConcern: The paper seems to be focused on demonstrating the effectiveness of previous approaches to the setting of language models. I did not find strong algorithmic ideas in the paper. I found the paper to be lacking in that respect.

Figure 1: Adding some noise to the updates could be view as some form of regularization, so I have trouble understand why the models with noise are less efficient than the baseline.\n\nIndeed, we were hoping to see some regularization benefit from noise, but there does not appear to be a significant effect, at least for these models. In Figure 3, which isolates the noise addition, we do see a slight improvement with a modest amount of noise early in training (blue line, noise around 0.012), but otherwise the Gaussian noise we add does not appear to help. We did not do training set evaluation on these models, it is possible (and likely based on results from \"Deep learning with differential privacy\", Figs. 3 and 6) that the addition of noise decreases the gap between test and training accuracy. Other work has also observed that adding noise may not work well as a regularizer for LSTMs, see  the \"negative results\" paragraph in Sec 4 of https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rkjZ2Pcxe \n\n2. Clipping is supposed to help with the exploding gradients problem. Do you have an idea why a low threshold hurts the performances? Is it because it reduces the amplitude of the updates (and thus simply slows down the training)?\n\nThis is an important direction for future work, but we have some preliminary thoughts. First, to clarify, note we are clipping each user's update before averaging across users, whereas traditional clipping is applied to a single minibatch update after averaging over examples, and so it is possible that these two types of clipping behave differently. \n\nWe suspect two primary reasons for the drop in performance with over-aggressive clipping: (1) reduction in the amplitude of the updates, as you suggest; and (2) clipping introduces bias into the way updates from different users are weighted, essentially changing the loss function being optimized. Some preliminary subsequent experiments indicate that both effects are significant, and that the effect of (1) can be somewhat offset by rescaling the updates on the server. Nevertheless, we emphasize that our primary result is that despite these effects, it is possible to set the clipping parameter large enough that we can still train high-accuracy models.\n\n3. Is your method compatible with other optimizers, such as RMSprop or ADAM (which are commonly used to train RNNs)?\n\nThere are multiple ways these optimizers could be extended to the federated setting. Either algorithm could be applied locally on each client (that is, inside UserUpdateFedAvg) to compute the update, and our approach would work without modification. Running these algorithms across clients while combining them with the additional local computation done by FederatedAverging (which we found to be important for achieving DP) would essentially mean designing a new optimization procedure --- certainly an interesting direction, but beyond the scope of the current work.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Differentially Private Recurrent Language Models", "abstract": "We demonstrate that it is possible to train large recurrent language models with user-level differential privacy guarantees with only a negligible cost in predictive accuracy.
