The main contribution of this work is not significant enough. The experiments are incomplete and not convincing.\n\nThe background of the problem is not sufficiently introduced. There are only two references in the introduction part (overall only three papers are cited), which are from decades ago. Many more relevant papers should be cited from the recent literature.\n\nThe experiment part is very weak. This paper claims that the time complexity of their algorithm is O(d^k D^k), which is an improvement over standard method O(D^k) by a factor d^k. But in the experiments, when d=1, there is still a large gap (~14s vs. ~90s) between the proposed method and the standard one. The authors explain this as \"likely a language implementation\", which is not convincing. To fairly compare the two methods, of course you need to implement both in the same programming language and run experiments in the same environment. For higher degree feature expansion, there is no empirical experiments to show the advantage of the proposed method.\n\nSome minor problems are listed below.\n1) In Section 2, the notation \"p_i:p_i+1\" is not clearly defined.\n2) In Section 3.1, typo: \"efter\" - \"after\"\n3) All the algorithms in this paper are not titled. The input and output is not clearly listed.\n4) In Figure 1, the meaning of the colored area is not described. Is it standard deviation or some quantile of the running time? How many runs of each algorithm are used to generate the ribbons?
