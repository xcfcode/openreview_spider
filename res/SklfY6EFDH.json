The paper only evaluate robust accuracy on models without robust training.\n\nAdversarial training is specific for robustness against particular attacks and not attacks in general. For example, in Vargas and Kotyan (2019) the authors showed that L\\infty based adversarial training fail to protect against L0 attacks. Therefore, adding an experiment on the adversarial training would lead to more confusion among the readers as different types of adversarial training exist and for each type a different vulnerability will be found.\n \nVargas, D. V., & Kotyan, S. (2019). Model Agnostic Dual Quality Assessment for Adversarial Machine Learning and an Analysis of Current Neural Networks and Defenses. arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.06026.\n\n>2. The evidence in the paper does not support their point. The paper shows that there's link between adversarial robustness and the generalization ability of neural network to extrapolate to unseen classes. But could not support the claim in the abstract, that \n>\"The main idea lies in the fact that some features are present on unknown classes and that unknown classes can be defined as a combination of previous learned features without representation bias (a bias towards representation that maps only current set of input-outputs and their boundary)\" \n>The extrapolation score does not prove this.\n\nTrue, this is an interpretation of the results. It is not the only interpretation and also not proved. Therefore, we removed from the abstract and from the main text, only adding a small section talking about it on the supplementary works and a small mention of the hypothesis in Section 4.3.\n\n> 3. The attack accuracy in Table 1 is not convincing. In [1], the PGD for epsilon=0.3 is 100% for non-robust models and around 55% for robust models, the number in the Table matches non of these.\n\nAfter reading your comment, we re-read the Madry et.al. (2017) for the PGD attacks, however there is a slight misinterpretation of the epsilon for the original paper and our reproduction. \nKindly allow us to explain this misinterpretation.\nIn the original paper, Madry et.al used epsilon=0.3 for the MNIST dataset while epsilon=8 was used for the CIFAR-10 dataset. \nAlso, for the reasoning why we used a different parameter than the original paper is too keep all adversarial attacks comparable to each other. \nAs epsilon is directly related to the degree of freedom an adversarial attack has for the perturbations. \nWe kept the epsilon value as close as possible for all the different attacks we experimented with.\n\nMadry, A., Makelov, A., Schmidt, L., Tsipras, D., & Vladu, A. (2017). Towards deep learning models resistant to adversarial attacks.\u00a0arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.06083.\n\n> 4. The writing of this paper is not clear and has gramma issues. For example, Table 1 and 2 miss information in Caption.\n\nGrammar issues corrected. Added more information in the caption of Table 1 and 2 (now merged in Table 1).\n\n> 5. The author should cite \"Adversarial Examples Are a Natural Consequence of Test Error in Noise\", which also studied the generalization and adversarial robustness.\n\nReference added. We also discussed the reference paper briefly in Section 2 together with the added mathematical formulation.\n\n> 6. This evaluation measurement is not practical, it costs more computation than one evaluates a model directly using attacks. The measurement is also fragile under adversarial attacks, that one can feed in adversarial attacks to fool the score metrics, which is not convincing.\n\nWe understand the concerns but the objective of this paper is not to propose a new/better cost effective evaluation measurement. The aim here is to understand the relation of robustness to the representation of models. We hope that the future architectures, training methodologies and algorithms would benefit from the analysis done here.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper660/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper660/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Representation Quality Explain Adversarial Attacks", "authors": ["Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas", "Shashank Kotyan", "Moe Matsuki"], "authorids": ["vargas@inf.kyushu-u.ac.jp", "shashankkotyan@gmail.com", "matsuki.sousisu@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["Representation Metrics", "Adversarial Machine Learning", "One-Pixel Attack", "DeepFool", "CapsNet"], "abstract": "Neural networks have been shown vulnerable to adversarial samples.

The paper uses the wrong citation format of ICLR (changing from LastName et al. 2019 --> (12) ). The paper maybe 8.5 to 9 pages long if using the original format. If this format violation was accepted, it would be unfair to other submissions and be a bad example this citation violation would be OK.\n\nSorry for the format discrepancy. An error introduced by a missing year in the bibtex compilation caused the issue. Corrected now.\n\n> 1. The paper has many claims (e.g. \"DBI metric matches extremely well\") that were not supported by evidence or clarified.\n\nAll the claims not supported by experiments were removed. We also removed \"extremely\" or \"clearly\" from the claims.\n\n> 2. The paper claims to study classifiers' \"representation quality\". However, all the experiments were conducted on only the 10-class CIFAR-10 dataset and the \"representations\" are taken at the softmax layer as opposed to some mid-CNN feature layer (e.g. the popular fc7 in AlexNet trained on the 1000-class ImageNet). \n\nThe representations could be taken at any portion of the neural network. However, taking the representations at earlier stages such as fc7 in AlexNet would exclude the later portions of the representation from the analysis. Therefore, we opted by the last projection of the input as the representation.  \n\n> 3. The key Definition in Sec. 2 that the paper hinges on has 0 references and is a debatable definition.\n\nSection 2 changed to a mathematical formulation which explains the link between representation and robustness as well as a motivation behind going beyond losses to evaluate the robustness.\nRepresentation bias is a possible hypothesis and therefore we removed from most of the main paper, leaving only a brief mention in Section 4.3. The section about Representation bias was moved to the supplementary works.\n\n> - I'd advise the authors to perform careful literature review to identify where the gap to fill is before conducting the research. There is a ton of work that has been done in the intersection of zero-shot, adversarial examples, deep features, and classifier caliberation. \nFor example, [1] has looked ... (pp. 3801-3505). IEEE.  (original message shortened to keep answer within the maximum allowed length)\n\nThank you for mentioning these related papers. They were cited and discussed in the new version.\n\n> - The word \"representation quality\" here is confusing when it refers to the soft labels, which is more relevant to *caliberation* than quality of deep features as the title implies. And the paper misses this body of work in the related work. See here: https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2019/all-adversarial-example-papers.html\n\nThe representation could be any layer of the neural network. However, we argue that middle layers would lose the last part of the transformation/projection that happens in the last layers which may be relevant to adversarial attacks. This explains our choice of the last layer, i.e., to capture the entire projection of the input. We added this explanation to Section 2. \n\n> - Try to avoid \"extremely\" or \"clearly\" in claims (and in general scientific writing) because they tend to be overclaims and it is hard for readers to interpret those intensifiers. \n\nAll overclaims were removed accordingly.\n\n\n> - I don't see how the rankings by DBI or AM are similar to the original rankings by adversarial measures at all (except for CapsNet). At least, reporting Pearson correlation (or any statistical similarity measure) would be more convincing.\n\nWe added the Pearson correlation for both DBI and Amalgam (for lack of space, Amalgam\u2019s Pearson correlation was added in the supplementary works).\nNotice that L2 and accuracy rankings differ originally. Therefore, it is impossible to be similar at the same time to both L2 and accuracy rankings.\n\n>- Section 2 is highly debatable and has no references for the \"Definition\".\n\nSection 2 was moved to the supplementary works. The definition of the representation bias is mentioned albeit briefly in Section 4.3 as a hypothesis that could explain the results. All other references to representation bias were removed.\n\n> I'd perform this work on ImageNet, at least to follow the intuition in Sec. 2 ...  (message shortened)\n\nGiving the time and space (the paper has already 8 pages with some supplementary works) constraints, we were unable to perform the tests on Imagenet.

We hope the new version of the paper has corrected previous pointed issues as well as improved in representation and experiments.\n\n\n> 1. The writing of this paper contains many mistakes, especially for the issue of using singular and plural. I strongly recommend the authors to polish the paper carefully. Take the first two pages as an example, \u201cresults suggests\u201d in Abstract, \u201cNetworks\u2019s\u201d in Introduction, \u201ca DNNs\u201d, \u201cperturbations causes\u201d in Sec1.1, \u201cmethods\u2026 which uses\u201d in Sec.1.2, etc.\n\nThe paper was polished. The above grammar issues and other typos were removed from the final version. We apologise for any inconvenience caused by it.\n\n> 2. The idea of representations quality on unknown classes determining attack robustness is not reasonable. Since the adversarial attack is defined on the known classes, the reasons for that are in two aspects. The first is the training dataset. If the collected training data cannot represent/fulfil the whole continuous distribution/manifold of the categories or even biased, the models are of course easily fooled by unseen modes during test. The second is the mapping for classification is from high to low, which is naturally many to one. In a word, I think the quality of models on unknown classes is not directly related to the problem of adversarial attack.\n\nWe do not conduct attacks on unknown classes but evaluate the quality of representation on unknown classes. By representation we mean high level features. Therefore, we want to avoid any mapping of input to output and rather investigate to what extent features are still working for different patterns with similar features.\nThe presentation of the paper was not clear enough. To improve the presentation further, Section 2 was added. This section explains the mathematical motivation behind the metrics as well as the motivation behind going beyond losses to evaluate robustness on models.\n\n> 3. This paper only conducts experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset, which is not convincing enough. It would be better to evaluate their method on more challenging benchmarks and also give more validation about their idea. E.g. on ImageNet, if enough number of categories has been seen for models, whether they would become more robust to adversarial attack. Evaluating features of more layers rather than the softmax outputs is also needed. \n\nIndeed, further tests on ImageNet would be able to tell if representation improves. Having said that, the paper has already 8 pages with some supplementary works, increasing the number of tests is not possible given the space and time constraints.   \n\n> 4.

Summary ===\n\nThis paper proposes to evaluate the representation (here, the output of 9 probabilities for 9 classes at the last softmax output layer) of an image taken from an unseen category by two metrics:\n- The first metric (DBI) essentially measures how compact the learned manifold is (i.e. how nearby are the softmax probability vectors of images from an unseen category). \n- The second metric basically measures how close a 9-D probability output vector (\"soft labels\" in the paper) of a classifier trained on the 9 classes is to a \"ground-truth\" which is the same 9-D vector but obtained when the classifier is trained on the full 10 CIFAR-10 classes.  \n\nThe authors computed these \"representation measures\" for a set of 7 networks (6 convnets + CapsuleNet) trained on CIFAR-10.\nThen, a set of white-box adversarial attacks were performed on these 7 networks and the results (both how accurate the classifier is, and the amount of L2 perturbations required to change a label) were used as a \"robustness measures\".\nThe authors then claim that the ranking of the 7 classifiers based on the representation measures match the rankings derived from the robustness measures.\n\nThe paper attempts to find the correlation between the representation quality of a classifier with its adversarial robustness. This general direction is important and worth pursuing!\nHowever, the claimed correlation is very weakly supported by the evidence in the paper.\n\n=== B. Decision ===\n\nReject.\n\nThe aim of connecting the representation quality with adversarial robustness is interesting!\nHowever, this paper has several major issues:\n\n0. The paper uses the wrong citation format of ICLR (changing from LastName et al. 2019 --> (12) ). The paper maybe 8.5 to 9 pages long if using the original format. If this format violation was accepted, it would be unfair to other submissions and be a bad example this citation violation would be OK.\n1. The paper has many claims (e.g. \"DBI metric matches extremely well\") that were not supported by evidence or clarified.\n2. The paper claims to study classifiers' \"representation quality\". However, all the experiments were conducted on only the 10-class CIFAR-10 dataset and the \"representations\" are taken at the softmax layer as opposed to some mid-CNN feature layer (e.g. the popular fc7 in AlexNet trained on the 1000-class ImageNet). \n3. The key Definition in Sec. 2 that the paper hinges on has 0 references and is a debatable definition.\n\n=== C. Suggestions for Improvement ===\n\n- I'd advise the authors to perform careful literature review to identify where the gap to fill is before conducting the research. There is a ton of work that has been done in the intersection of zero-shot, adversarial examples, deep features, and classifier caliberation. \n\nFor example, [1] has looked at how out-of-distribution samples can be represented by the deep features of a classifier:\n[1] Bendale, A., & Boult, T. E. (2016). Towards open set deep networks. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (pp. 1563-1572).\n- This work [2] has shown adding a \"center loss\" to force the deep features to be closer to the feature centroid (i.e. related to your DBI measure) helps improve the adversarial robustness. Indeed, the visualization in Fig. 3 is very interesting and is consistent with the result in [2].\n[2] Agarwal, C., Nguyen, A., & Schonfeld, D. (2019, September). Improving Robustness to Adversarial Examples by Encouraging Discriminative Features. In 2019 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP) (pp. 3801-3505). IEEE.\n\n- The word \"representation quality\" here is confusing when it refers to the soft labels, which is more relevant to *caliberation* than quality of deep features as the title implies. And the paper misses this body of work in the related work. See here: https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2019/all-adversarial-example-papers.html\n- Try to avoid \"extremely\" or \"clearly\" in claims (and in general scientific writing) because they tend to be overclaims and it is hard for readers to interpret those intensifiers. \n- I don't see how the rankings by DBI or AM are similar to the original rankings by adversarial measures at all (except for CapsNet). At least, reporting Pearson correlation (or any statistical similarity measure) would be more convincing.\n- Section 2 is highly debatable and has no references for the \"Definition\".\n- I'd perform this work on ImageNet, at least to follow the intuition in Sec. 2. With only 10 CIFAR-10 classes, it is unrealistic how to semantically represent a \"frog\" using the other 9 classes (truck, airplane, etc).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper660/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper660/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Representation Quality Explain Adversarial Attacks", "authors": ["Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas", "Shashank Kotyan", "Moe Matsuki"], "authorids": ["vargas@inf.kyushu-u.ac.jp", "shashankkotyan@gmail.com", "matsuki.sousisu@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["Representation Metrics", "Adversarial Machine Learning", "One-Pixel Attack", "DeepFool", "CapsNet"], "abstract": "Neural networks have been shown vulnerable to adversarial samples.

To this end, they propose the zero-shot test to investigate the \"quality\" of learned representations for unknown classes. Specifically, they leverage two kinds of quality metrics on data of unknown classes. The first one is based on clustering named Davies-Bouldin Index which measures the compactness of intra-cluster. The second one is based on the difference of soft-label histogram distributions with/without unknown classes during training, which may describe the generalization for unknown classes or bias towards known classes of learned features. Finally, with these two metrics, they rank the quality of different models and compare such ranking results with the attack robustness obtained by different attack techniques on CIFAR-10 dataset.\n\n+Strengths:\n1. This paper shows satisfactory related works about recent advances in adversarial attacks and defenses. \n\n-Weaknesses:\n1. The writing of this paper contains many mistakes, especially for the issue of using singular and plural. I strongly recommend the authors to polish the paper carefully. Take the first two pages as an example, \u201cresults suggests\u201d in Abstract, \u201cNetworks\u2019s\u201d in Introduction, \u201ca DNNs\u201d, \u201cperturbations causes\u201d in Sec1.1, \u201cmethods\u2026 which uses\u201d in Sec.1.2, etc.\n2. The idea of representations quality on unknown classes determining attack robustness is not reasonable. Since the adversarial attack is defined on the known classes, the reasons for that are in two aspects. The first is the training dataset. If the collected training data cannot represent/fulfil the whole continuous distribution/manifold of the categories or even biased, the models are of course easily fooled by unseen modes during test. The second is the mapping for classification is from high to low, which is naturally many to one. In a word, I think the quality of models on unknown classes is not directly related to the problem of adversarial attack.\n3. This paper only conducts experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset, which is not convincing enough. It would be better to evaluate their method on more challenging benchmarks and also give more validation about their idea. E.g. on ImageNet, if enough number of categories has been seen for models, whether they would become more robust to adversarial attack. Evaluating features of more layers rather than the softmax outputs is also needed. \n4. What is amalgam proportion? Please explain it in detail or give a reference paper.

The paper only evaluate robust accuracy on models without robust training.\n\n2. The evidence in the paper does not support their point.

The measurement is also fragile under adversarial attacks, that one can feed in adversarial attacks to fool the score metrics, which is not convincing."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper660/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper660/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Representation Quality Explain Adversarial Attacks", "authors": ["Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas", "Shashank Kotyan", "Moe Matsuki"], "authorids": ["vargas@inf.kyushu-u.ac.jp", "shashankkotyan@gmail.com", "matsuki.sousisu@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["Representation Metrics", "Adversarial Machine Learning", "One-Pixel Attack", "DeepFool", "CapsNet"], "abstract": "Neural networks have been shown vulnerable to adversarial samples.  Slightly perturbed input images are able to change the classification of accurate models, showing that the representation learned is not as good as previously thought. To aid the development of better neural networks, it would be important to evaluate to what extent are current neural networks' representations capturing the existing features. Here we propose a way to evaluate the representation quality of neural networks using a novel type of zero-shot test, entitled Raw Zero-Shot. The main idea lies in the fact that some features are present on unknown classes and that unknown classes can be defined as a combination of previous learned features without representation bias (a bias towards representation that maps only current set of input-outputs and their boundary). To evaluate the soft-labels of unknown classes, two metrics are proposed. One is based on clustering validation techniques (Davies-Bouldin Index) and the other is based on soft-label distance of a given correct soft-label.\nExperiments show that such metrics are in accordance with the robustness to adversarial attacks and might serve as a guidance to build better models as well as be used in loss functions to create new types of neural networks. Interestingly, the results suggests that dynamic routing networks such as CapsNet have better representation while current deeper DNNs are trading off representation quality for accuracy.", "pdf": "/pdf/0243086c701181aeb1367afb513b390272628621.pdf", "paperhash": "vargas|representation_quality_explain_adversarial_attacks", "original_pdf": "/attachment/bf62794b06a2ce20e2c8c82063edb0b2733ed3bb.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nvargas2020representation,\ntitle={Representation Quality Explain Adversarial Attacks},\nauthor={Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas and Shashank Kotyan and Moe Matsuki},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SklfY6EFDH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
