Our method, goal-reaching via recursive reweighting (GR3), is a simple modification to prior goal-conditioned behavior cloning algorithms. Our method incrementally and automatically filters a dataset of random experience into a dataset of near-optimal experience. Our method introduces zero additional hyperparameters. Unlike many offline reinforcement learning methods, our method is stable and can be trained indefinitely without degrading in performance. The simplicity and stability of our approach are particularly important for offline RL because the environment cannot be used for hyperparameter tuning. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of offline, goal-conditioned tasks.", "pdf": "/pdf/b01904da0383ef47c62b954eb220a2159752cd53.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|goal_reaching_via_recursive_reweighting_of_offline_data", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021goal,\ntitle={Goal Reaching via Recursive Reweighting of Offline Data},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to Self-Supervision for Reinforcement Learning Workshop - ICLR 2021},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=vD_8R_0D3Lb},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615310247528, "tmdate": 1615313016556, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
