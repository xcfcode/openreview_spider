This could introduce non-trivial bias. It's easy to imagine that in such case, the first term can go to zero, because assuming finite, diverse enough samples, Q can potentially fit all sample returns. In such cases, it's important not only to report variance as you have estimated, but also bias.

The method relates closely to prior work on action-dependent baselines, but explores in particular on-policy fitting and a few other design choices that empirically improve the performance. \n\nA criticism of the paper is that it does not require Stein\u2019s identity/control functionals literature to derive Eq. 8, since it can be derived similarly to linear control variate and it has also previously been discussed in IPG [Gu et. al., 2017] as reparameterizable control variate. The derivation through Stein\u2019s identity does not seem to provide additional insights/algorithm designs beyond direct derivation through reparameterization trick.\n\nThe empirical results appear promising, and in particular in comparison with Q-Prop, which fits Q-function using off-policy TD learning. However, the discussion on the causes of the difference should be elaborated much more, as it appears there are substantial differences besides on-policy/off-policy fitting of the Q, such as:\n\n-FitLinear fits linear Q (through parameterization based on linearization of Q) using on-policy learning, rather than fitting nonlinear Q and then at application time linearize around the mean action. A closer comparison would be to use same locally linear Q function for off-policy learning in Q-Prop.\n\n-The use of on-policy fitted value baseline within Q-function parameterization during on-policy fitting is nice. Similar comparison should be done with off-policy fitting in Q-Prop.\n\nI wonder if on-policy fitting of Q can be elaborated more. Specifically, on-policy fitting of V seems to require a few design details to have best performance [GAE, Schulman et. al., 2016]: fitting on previous batch instead of current batch to avoid overfitting  (this is expected for your method as well, since by fitting to current batch the control variate then depends nontrivially on samples that are being applied), and possible use of trust-region regularization to prevent V from changing too much across iterations. \n\nThe paper presents promising results with direct on-policy fitting of action-dependent baseline, which is promising since it does not require long training iterations as in off-policy fitting in Q-Prop. As discussed above, it is encouraged to elaborate other potential causes that led to performance differences. The experimental results are presented well for a range of Mujoco tasks. \n\nPros:\n\n-Simple, effective method that appears readily available to be incorporated to any on-policy PG methods without significantly increase in computational time\n\n-Good empirical evaluation\n\nCons:\n\n-The name Stein control variate seems misleading since the algorithm/method does not rely on derivation through Stein\u2019s identity etc. and does not inherit novel insights due to this derivation.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Action-dependent Control Variates for Policy Optimization via Stein Identity", "abstract": "Policy gradient methods have achieved remarkable successes in solving challenging reinforcement learning problems.

The followings are the response to your comments:\n\n* Thanks for pointing out IPG and on-policy vs. off-policy fitting; we will provide a thorough discussion on this. We have been mainly focussing on fitting \\phi with on-policy, because the optimal control variates should theoretically depend on the current policy and hence \"on-policy\" in its nature. However, we did experiment ways to use additional off-policy data to our update and find that using additional off-policy data can in fact further improve our method. We find it is hard to have a fair comparison between on policy vs. off-policy fitting because it largely depends on how we implement each of them. Instead, an interesting future direction for us is to investigate principled ways to combine them to improve beyond what we can achieve now. \n\nWe should point out the difference between IPG and our method is not only the way we fit \\phi, another perhaps more significant difference is that IPG (depending which particular version) also averages over off-policy data when estimating the gradient, while our method always only averages over the on-policy data. \n\n* In our comparison, Q-prop also uses an on-policy fitted value function inside the Q-function. \n\n* Thank you very much for suggesting better ways of on-policy fitting of V. We are interested in testing them for future works. Currently, V is fitted by all the current data which theoretically introduces a (possibly small) bias because the current data is used twice in the gradient estimator, so using the data from the previous iteration may yield improvement.\n\n\n* Regarding the name, although it turned out our result can be derived using reparameterization trick, Stein's identity is what motivated this work originally, and we lean towards keeping it as the motivation since Stein's identity generally provides a principled way to think about control variates (which essentially requires zero-expectation identities mathematically). \n\nStein's identity and reparameterization trick are two orthogonal ways to think about this work, and it is useful to keep both of them to give a more comprehensive view.  It is not true that Stein's identity is not directly useful in our work: By using (the original) Stein's identity on the top of the basic formula, we can derive a different control variate for Gaussian policy that has lower variance (and it is what we used in experiments). It is possible that we can further generalize the result by using Stein's identity in more creative ways. On the other hand, we will emphasize more the role of reparameterization trick in the revision.

Equation (8) from your paper is exactly equivalent to Equation (6) (LAX estimator) of the paper, specifically by setting:\npi(a|theta) = p(b|theta)\nQ(s,a) = f(b)\nphi(s,a) = c_phi(b)\nf(s, eps|theta) = T(eps, theta)\nSimilar to your remark in Equation (13) the other authors just below their Equation (6) mention that taking the \"control\" function equal the original one (if that is differentiable) we recover the path gradient. Additionally, they also suggest optimizing the \"control\" function by minimizing the variance.\n\nRegarding, equation (18) and the Gaussian policy indeed it is an interesting observation that we can apply this a second time and get a potentially lower variance estimator. This in fact I think is a more general result that if the derivatives depend on epsilon you can reapply the procedure, but don't cite me on that. Potentially, investigating/generalizing that might be interesting.

It is highly relevant. Their estimator in the RL setting (their Eq 11) is mathematically equivalent to ours. However, our paper is derived from a different perspective and give more comprehensive results on reinforcement learning specifically.  \n\n1) Our work focuses on RL. By combining with PPO and TRPO, we obtain significant improvement on challenging RL tasks such as Humanoid-v1 and HumanoidStandup-v1. We also proposed and tested different architectures and optimization methods for the control variates, providing guidance on what may work best in practice. We explicitly establish the connection with  Q-prop(Gu et al., 2016b), which can be viewed as our method with linear control variates. \n\n2)  Our work was motivated by Stein\u2019s identity and control functionals (Oates et al. 2017), and hence develops a connection between Stein\u2019s identity and reparameterization trick which can be itself useful. For example, for Gaussian policy, we further derive a different update rule with lower variance by utilizing Stein\u2019s Identity twice."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Action-dependent Control Variates for Policy Optimization via Stein Identity", "abstract": "Policy gradient methods have achieved remarkable successes in solving challenging reinforcement learning problems.
