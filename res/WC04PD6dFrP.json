They studied the model of a piecewise constant value function according to the actions.   The assumption is new, though still somewhat restrictive as it requires the piecewise constant partitions to be the same for all x.  The proposed algorithm estimates the partitions, and then used it to build a doubly robust estimator with stratified importance sampling (fitting an MLP for each partition separately).\n\n\nThe reviewers have mixed views about the paper.  The following is the AC's evaluation based on reading the paper and consolidating the reviewers' comments and the authors' responses.\n\nPros: \n\n- The algorithm is new and it makes sense for the new problem setup  (though computationally intractable)\n- The experimental results outperform the baseline and reinforces the theory. But it's a toy example at best.\n\nCons:\n\n- The method is called \"Q-learning\" but it is somewhat disappointing to see that it actually applies only to the contextual bandit model (without dynamics).  There is quite a bit of branding issues here. I suggest the authors to revise it to reflect the actual problem setup.\n\n-  The estimator is assumed to be arg min, but the objective function is non-convex and cannot be solved efficiently in general, e.g., (3) involves searching over all partitions... and (4) involves solving neural network partitions.  In other words, the result applies to a hypothetical minimizer that the practical solvers may or may not obtain (the authors cited Scikit-Learn for the optimization algorithm and claims that the optimization problem can be solved, which is not the case ...  the SGD algorithm can be applied to solve it, but it does not necessarily find you the solution). \n\n- The theory is completely asymptotic and generic. There is no rate of convergence specified, and no dependence on the number of jumps |D_0| at all in Theorem 1.  \n\n-  Theorem 3 is obnoxiously sloppy. The assumptions are not made explicit (do you need Assumption 1 and 2, what is the choice of \\rho? ) The notion of \"minimax rate\" is not defined at all.   Usually the minimax rate is the property of problem setting,  i.e., Min over all algorithms, and Max over all problems with in a family.  However, in the way the authors described the results in Theorem 3,  it says the \"the minimax convergence rate of kernel-based estimator is Op(n^{\u22121/3}).\"  which seems to be restricting the algorithms instead.  Such non-typical choices require clear definitions and justification.    Based on what is stated, it really appears that the authors are just comparing upper bounds of the two methods.\n\nI looked at the appendix and while there is a \"lower bound analysis\", the bound is not information-theoretical, but rather a fixed example where an unspecified family of algorithms (I think it is a specific kernel smoothing method with a arbitrary choice of the bandwidth parameter h) will fail. \n\nSuggestions to the authors:\n\n-  Instead of a piecewise constant (and uniformly bounded) function, why not consider the total variation class, which is strictly more general and comes with the same rate?\n\n- For formalizing the lower bound, I suggest the authors to look into classical lower bounds for linear smoother, e.g., Donoho, Liu, MacGibbon (1990); which clearly illustrates that kernel smoothing-type methods do not achieve the minimax rates; and that wavelets-based approaches, locally adaptive regression splines, and fused lasso (You can think about the  Haar Wavelets as a basis function of piecewise linear functions ) do. \n\nThe authors can improve the paper by ensuring that the theoretical parts are clearly and rigorously presented; and perhaps to iron out the more useful finite-sample analysis that depends on model parameters of interest."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Jump Q-Evaluation for Offline Policy Evaluation in Continuous Action Space", "authorids": ["~Hengrui_Cai1", "c.shi7@lse.ac.uk", "~Rui_Song2", "wlu4@ncsu.edu"], "authors": ["Hengrui Cai", "Chengchun Shi", "Rui Song", "Wenbin Lu"], "keywords": ["Continuous action space", "Deep learning", "Multi-scale change point detection", "Off-policy evaluation"], "abstract": "We consider off-policy evaluation (OPE) in continuous action domains, such as dynamic pricing and personalized dose finding.

All current Offline-Policy Evaluation (OPE) methods for handling continuous action domains use a kernel function to extend Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) or Doubly Robust (DR) approaches for discrete action domains.  The algorithm proposed in this work adaptively discretizes the action space by combining methods in multi-scale changepoint detection, multi-layer perceptron regression and OPE in discrete action domains.  The finite sample performance of the proposed method, known as Deep-Jump Q-Evaluation (DJQE), is compared to that of two kernel-based methods, one due to Kallus and Zhou (2018) and another due to Colangelo and Lee (2020), on synthetic as well as real-world data.  To generate synthetic data, four scenarios are considered, where in each case the Q-function is continuous in the action domain or is a piecewise function of the action.  In almost all of these cases, DJQE outperforms the two kernel-based methods.  Similarly, when applied to real-world Warfarin data (after calibration), DJQE outperforms the two kernel-based methods with respect to the bias, standard deviation and mean squared error, even when the sample size is small (n=50).  The average runtime of DJQE in each scenario (for synthetic or real-world data) is about 5 minutes. \n\nPlus points:\n- The experimental results seem to demonstrate quite convincingly that DJQE outperforms the two kernel-based methods in almost all cases.   \n- The methodology seems sound. \n- The theoretical results also appear correct and prove the soundness of the method for a fairly wide range of functions - those that are continuous in the feature space and action domain, as well as those that are piecewise constant.\n- The method can model jump discontinuities in the Q-function. \n\nQuestions:\n- Why is it reasonable to assume that the Q-function can be well-approximated using piecewise linear combinations of MLPs?\n- How is the performance of DJQE affected by the choice of the regularization parameter \\gamma?\n\nMinor comments/questions:\n\n- Page 2, line -2: exists -> to exist\n- Page 3, line 4 of Section 2.3: segments -> segment\n- Page 3, line -4: Was there a reason for choosing the logarithm function here?\n- Page 4, lines 12 to 13: Is there a theoretical justification for such a choice of m, or is it based on empirical observations?  Also, to what extent does the performance of DJQE depend on the initial choice of m?\n- Page 5, Equation (4): Could it be justified why the minimizer is unique?\n- Page 5, third line after Equation (4): Should it be Figure 3, Appendix A?

This overcomes the drawbacks of the kernel based method, which cannot be applied to non-smooth Q functions and requires heavy computation to optimize the bandwidth. The proposed method can be applied to discontinuous Q functions like step functions, and achieves smaller bias. This is made possible by the adaptive jump q learning method.\n\n\nPros\n\nWhile the kernel method requires a single bandwidth to control the bias and variance of the value estimator, the proposed method adapts to the shape of the Q function by dividing the action space in an adaptive way, so that the MLP fitted in each interval of the action space approximates well the real Q function. Hence, the intervals can have possibly different lengths according to the shape of the true Q function. A multi-scale change point detection method is used for determining the intervals, which requires only a linear computational cost. \n\nExperiment results are convincing.\n\nCons\n\n1) In Algorithm 1, \u201cCollect cost function step\u201d computes MLP regressor for every possible interval.

The main idea is to first using multi-scale change point detection to discretize the action space and then apply traditional IPW or DR methods to estimate the value. The DJQE method is theoretically analyzed under both the cases that the Q function is either a piecewise function or a continuous function. For continuous function, it is not surprising that as the number of splits m goes to infinity as n, the estimation is consistent, while additional results in Theorem 2 also shows that for limited m, the estimator can also be shown as a uniform approximation of the Q value. Experiments consider both a toy dataset and a real problem in personalized does finding, and the results show that the DJQE method is superior than existing methods for continuous Q evaluation.\n\nThe paper is clearly written and easy to follow. I only have a few comments:\n\n1. In the experiments, since computing the optimal bandwidth is very time consuming for the baseline methods, it would good to provide a detailed computation cost comparison. \n2. As mentioned in the method part, m is initially set to be proportional to n, and the final partition size is much smaller than m. Would the authors shows these detailed numbers in the experiments?\n3. It could be great if more real-world problems can be evaluated in the current experimental section, such as the dynamic pricing example introduced previously.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper313/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper313/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Jump Q-Evaluation for Offline Policy Evaluation in Continuous Action Space", "authorids": ["~Hengrui_Cai1", "c.shi7@lse.ac.uk", "~Rui_Song2", "wlu4@ncsu.edu"], "authors": ["Hengrui Cai", "Chengchun Shi", "Rui Song", "Wenbin Lu"], "keywords": ["Continuous action space", "Deep learning", "Multi-scale change point detection", "Off-policy evaluation"], "abstract": "We consider off-policy evaluation (OPE) in continuous action domains, such as dynamic pricing and personalized dose finding.
