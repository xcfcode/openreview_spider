By first performing this analysis in basic RNNs, we avoid the complications of LSTMs that may make the results less interpretable and position our work as a followup to recent publications that promote orthogonality constraints in simple RNNs (Arjovsky & Shah 2015- arxiv 1511.06464 ; Wisdom 2016 - arxiv 1611.00035 ; Henaff 2016 - arxiv 1602.06662).

I will address your comments in sequence:\n\n(1)\nWe have added extensive experiments to the draft. Among these, we added the adding problem and Penn Treebank character prediction. These experiments are summarized in a general post above.\n\n(2)\nWe find that the copying task becomes extremely difficult when using a tanh or ReLU activation function on the transition matrix, requiring hundreds of thousands of iterations and a soft orthogonality constraint on a short sequence. We have performed a number of experiments with nonlinearities on the copy task and reported the results and discussion in the appendix. We note that in prior work, the copy task was solved either without enforcing tanh or ReLU activation functions. Henaff et al. described a solution mechanism for an RNN without a transition nonlinearity and trained RNNs without a nonlinearity to solve the task. Arjovsky & Shah et al., as well as Wisdom et al., used a nonlinearity (\"modReLU\") that is initialized as an identity function and is effectively learned. Thus, we experimented with a parameteric ReLU for which we chose different slope values or let the slope be learned. We found that the nonlinearity learns to nearly become an identity function and that forcing it to be less so makes the task unsolveable. Finally, we tested a norm-preserving non-linearity (OPLU) which allows us to retrieve the same results as without a non-linearity, on the copy task. We also test this activation function on the MNIST tasks (p. 8).\n\n(3)\nThank you for spotting that \u2013 we've added the numbers now. We used 128 hidden units in all of the originally published experiments. We used 512 hidden units in the PTB experiments, and 128 in the other newly added experiments.\n\n(4)\nWe have added a section into the appendix that evaluates the running time of our method compared to regular SGD for three different model sizes. All times were averaged over 3 runs.\n\n(5)\nOn MNIST the performance of the RNN without a margin was indeed very close to the top performance with a margin. Clearly, the results in Table 1 and Table 2 show that for this task it is detrimental to strongly limit deviation from orthogonality. On the other hand, orthogonal initialization allows an RNN to perform on this task far better than Glorot normal initialization or even identity initialization (it is also orthogonal but not random and with no variance). This supports the notion put forth by Saxe that orthogonal initialization helps optimization by promoting signal flow in the beginning of training. Furthermore, this supports our proposed intuition that restricting weights to be orthogonal could be detrimental for model performance. We have now added an extended discussion on this, considering both MNIST and PTB results, to section 3.1.2.\n\n(6)\nWe describe the figure jointly with the results from tables 1 and 2. It shows that larger margins allow for faster convergence on the MNIST tasks and that RNNs with large margins perform almost identically to an RNN without a margin as long as the transition matrix is initialized as orthogonal. Because the first point has been demonstrated with the copy task experiments and the second point can be shown with the results in the tables, we moved the figure into the appendix, thus removing some redundancy.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On orthogonality and learning recurrent networks with long term dependencies", "abstract": "It is well known that it is challenging to train deep neural networks and recurrent neural networks for tasks that exhibit long term dependencies.

We appreciate your observation that the initialization vs regularization/constraint trade-off could be highlighted more clearly. We address this on page 7 of the updated draft and in the conclusion. We also added new experiments (as summarized in the general post above), including some on new tasks, that should help clarify the analysis.\n\nFollowing your suggestion, we experimented with a gain of 1.05 applied to pre-activations for a model that is constrained to be purely orthogonal. With this configuration, we could nearly match the best scores for both MNIST tasks, even though we were using a model with margin m=0. We did not, however, apply this gain on the copy task. Since we did not observe a consistent shift of the spectral distribution to a mean of 1.05 for that task, there was little motivation to do so. Furthermore, the lack of a nonlinearity on that task meant that the notion that this gain would counterbalance the contraction of nonlinearities inapplicable. We did, however, further support this notion with additional experiments using a norm-preserving non-linearity (OPLU). We find that while other nonlinearities make the copy task extremely difficult to solve, the OPLU allows us to arrive at exactly the same results for all margins as we had when not using a nonlinearity. Furthermore, the OPLU allows the RNN to achieve equally high performance for all margins on both MNIST tasks; training with no nonlinearity works but significantly worse.\n\nWe have updated the draft, adding new experiments, including some on two new tasks: the adding task and PTB character prediction. The PTB results allowed us to slightly expand our discussion on initialization, constraints, and on singular spectrum evolution (p.6-8).

The paper proposes a variety of interesting optimization formulations that enforce orthogonality in the recurrent weight matrix to varying degrees. The experimental results demonstrate several conclusions: enforcing exact orthogonality does not help learning, while enforcing soft orthogonality or initializing to orthogonal weights can substantially improve learning. While some of the optimization methods proposed currently require matrix inversion and are therefore slow in wall clock time, orthogonal initialization and some of the soft orthogonality constraints are relatively inexpensive and may find their way into practical use.\n\nThe experiments are generally done to a high standard and yield a variety of useful insights, and the writing is clear.\n\nThe experimental results are based on using a fixed learning rate for the different regularization strengths. Learning speed might be highly dependent on this, and different strengths may admit different maximal stable learning rates. It would be instructive to optimize the learning rate for each margin separately (maybe on one of the shorter sequence lengths) to see how soft orthogonality impacts the stability of the learning process. Fig. 5, for instance, shows that a sigmoid improves stability\u2014but perhaps slightly reducing the learning rate for the non-sigmoid Gaussian prior RNN would make the learning well-behaved again for weightings less than 1.\n\nFig. 4 shows singular values converging around 1.05 rather than 1. Does initializing to orthogonal matrices multiplied by 1.05 confer any noticeable advantage over standard orthogonal matrices? Especially on the T=10K copy task?\n\n\u201cCuriously, larger margins and even models without sigmoidal constraints on the spectrum (no margin) performed well as long as they were initialized to be orthogonal suggesting that evolution away from orthogonality is not a serious problem on this task.\u201d This is consistent with the analysis given in Saxe et al. 2013, where for deep linear nets, if a singular value is initialized to 1 but dies away during training, this is because it must be zero to implement the desired input-output map. More broadly, an open question has been whether orthogonality is useful as an initialization, as proposed by Saxe et al., where its role is mainly as a preconditioner which makes optimization proceed quickly but doesn\u2019t fundamentally change the optimization problem; or whether it is useful as a regularizer, as proposed by Arjovsky et al. 2015 and Henaff et al. 2015, that is, as an additional constraint in the optimization problem (minimize loss subject to weights being orthogonal). These experiments seem to show that mere initialization to orthogonal weights is enough to reap an optimization speed advantage, and that too much regularization begins to hurt performance\u2014i.e., substantially changing the optimization problem is undesirable. This point is also apparent in Fig. 2: In terms of the training loss on MNIST (Fig. 2), no margin does almost indistinguishably from a margin of 1 or .1. However in terms of accuracy, a margin of .1 is best. This shows that large or nonexistent margins (i.e., orthogonal initializations) enable fast optimization of the training loss, but among models that attain similar training loss, the more nearly orthogonal weights perform better. This starts to separate out the optimization speed advantage conferred by orthogonality from the regularization advantage it confers. It may be useful to more explicitly discuss the initialization vs regularization dimension in the text.\n\nOverall, this paper contributes a variety of techniques and intuitions which are likely to be useful in training RNNs.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On orthogonality and learning recurrent networks with long term dependencies", "abstract": "It is well known that it is challenging to train deep neural networks and recurrent neural networks for tasks that exhibit long term dependencies.

While using orthogonal weights addresses the issue of vanishing/exploding gradients, it is unclear whether anything is lost, either in representational power or in trainability, by enforcing orthogonality. As such, an empirical investigation that examines how these properties are affected by deviation from orthogonality is a useful contribution.\n\nThe paper is clearly written, and the primary formulation for investigating soft orthogonality constraints (representing the weight matrices in their SVD factorized form, which gives explicit control over the singular values) is clean and natural, albeit not necessarily ideal from a practical computational standpoint (as it requires maintaining multiple orthogonal weight matrices each requiring an expensive update step). I am unaware of this approach being investigated previously.\n\nThe experimental side, however, is somewhat lacking. The paper evaluates two tasks: a copy task, using an RNN architecture without transition non-linearities, and sequential/permuted sequential MNIST. These are reasonable choices for an initial evaluation, but are both toy problems and don't shed much light on the practical aspects of the proposed approaches. An evaluation in a more realistic setting would be valuable (e.g., a language modeling task).\n\nFurthermore, while investigating pure RNN's makes sense for evaluating effects of orthogonality, it feels somewhat academic: LSTMs also provide a mechanism to capture longer-term dependencies, and in the tasks where the proposed approach was compared directly to an LSTM, it was significantly outperformed. It would be very interesting to see the effects of the proposed soft orthogonality constraint in additional architectures (e.g., deep feed-forward architectures, or whether there's any benefit when embedded within an LSTM, although this seems doubtful).\n\nOverall, the paper addresses a clear-cut question with a well-motivated approach, and has interesting findings on some toy datasets. As such I think it could provide a valuable contribution.

This setup required a low learning learning rate for stable training; at a learning rate of 0.00001 (RMSprop), accuracy plateaued at ~25% after 5000 epochs. With geodesic gradient descent, the model converged (solving the task) after less than 80 epochs. We also tried Cayley parameterizations for U and V with an identity S matrix and this had similar convergence problems for the copy task.\n\nBarring numerical issues in the theano update calculation, we considered that the worse performance of the direct Cayley parameterization may possibly be explained by regions of high curvature along the Stiefel manifold along which the step size could effectively become negligible.
