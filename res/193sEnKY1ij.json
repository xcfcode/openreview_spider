Their model is a post hoc procedure and is based on the tree structure of WordNet. The model revises the classifier output based on the distance of the labels in the tree. Intuitively, their solution is to pick the candidate label that is located in the region of the tree with a higher accumulated probability mass value. They also experimentally show that the previous evaluation metrics are inconclusive. \n\nPros:\n- The authors provide a different perspective on the evaluation procedure of the previous studies and experimentally show that it was incomplete. This is an important finding.\n- Their experiments are thorough.\n\nCons:\n- The article lacks enough novelty: The problem has been investigated before. The solution is not novel. The WordNet tree structure has been extensively used in the information retrieval community before.\n- The article is not written well: There are informal vocabulary in the paper (e.g., \u201csomething similar\u201d or \u201cgrossly miscalibrated\u201d).

They make two main contributions. \n\nFirst, they claim that the metric used in prior work, average mistake severity, is flawed because it rewards methods that make many \"easy\" mistakes, as opposed to fewer, \"harder\" mistakes. Based on this analysis, they claim that no prior methods actually improve over the simplest baseline of cross-entropy (i.e. doing nothing).\n\nSecond, they introduce their own method, an adaptation of the classical CRM framework. They argue that CRM:\n1) Is the only method to improve over cross-entropy under average mistake severity (the metric from prior work they argue is flawed)\n2) Beats all other metrics under their new, improved metric\n3) Improves on the calibration of the predictions\n\nStrengths:\nThe method is very simple and easy to understand, builds upon existing work, and I could probably implement it from scratch in 30 minutes on top of my existing models. While ML reviewers very frequently about a lack of complexity, I think this is a great strength.\n\nThe methods section is very clearly written, and it was quite easy to quickly understand what the method is doing.\n\nWeaknesses:\nI am very concerned about the experiment sections. \n\n1)\nTo my understanding, Figure 2/Section 4.1 are factually incorrect. In particular, it appears that the soft-labels technique does essentially the same, or better than, CRM, across all fronts. In detail,\na) \nIn Figure 2(a), the leftmost softlabel point is equal to or better than CRM (and cross-entropy)\n\nb) \nFigure 2(b) really concerns me, as it appears that the hyperparameters have been chosen to make a fairly narrow point - that it is possible to have low average hierarchical distance, and high top-1 error. I agree that that indicates a problem with the metric. \n\nHowever, the authors make the fair broader claim that CRM is the only method which beats cross-entropy, which I do not think is justified. Looking at Figure 4 in A.1, it is readily apparent that choosing different hyperparameters for existing methods would yield similar error distributions to CRM. Having these plots in the appendix, combined with claims that the authors chose the best hyperparameters, feels a bit misleading.\n\nc)\nAs in 1), soft labels is essentially on top of CRM and Cross entropy (for iNaturalist19, it looks like a higher beta value would be directly on top, it's unclear why the authors did not extend the curve further)\n\n2)\nThese results, at first blush, seem fairly impressive. For the leftmost plots, I am concerned that the authors are using subpar hyperparameters, similarly to 1)(b) above. Strangely, in this instance the results for other hyperparameters are not included in the appendix. The remaining experiments are fairly convincing, though.\n\nReccomendation\nI do not think this paper can be accepted in its current form. While I suspect that CRM is a good method that I would like to use, some of the core arguments (Figure 2/Section 4.1) in the paper appear to be fatally flawed.\n\nSmaller notes:\n- The paper could use an additional proofread, as there are often odd phrasings.

We also thank the reviewer for finding simplicity as one of the major strengths of our approach (CRM) as it does not require retraining, hyperparameter cross-validation, and can be used with almost no computational overhead. \n\nThe major questions/concerns raised by the reviewer primarily are related to Figure 2, evaluation metric, and hyperparameters. Below we discuss them all in detail and hope to resolve all the concerns. We hope the reviewer makes an additional pass over the experiment section after resolving the confusion for better clarity. \n\nFigure 2\n\nPerformance: Note that the purpose of Figure 2 is to show how current metrics to evaluate mistake severity do not reflect the true nature of the models. We do this by highlighting that the current evaluation of mistake severity, which is evaluated _only_ over the incorrectly classified samples (hence _different_ test sets for different models as the mistakes will be different), will favour models making additional _easy mistakes_ (as it involves division by the number of mistakes) which is undesirable. We propose an easy fix to correct this bias which involves evaluation of mistake severity on a _fixed_ test set (not only on the misclassified ones), and, as expected, this simple fix changes the evaluation significantly and provides a reliable evaluation. \n\nNow, looking at Fig 2(a) (the old way of evaluating only on mistakes), it seems like softlabels with $\\beta = 4$ and HXE with $\\alpha=0.6$ are the best models with the lowest hierarchical distance@1 over mistakes (average mistake severity) as seen on the bottom right. However, as we correct the above said bias, those very models show the highest hierarchical distance@1 (Fig 2(c) top right). And to answer why this is the case, the mistake distribution in Fig 2(b) clearly shows that this model is just making more easy mistakes while *not* improving at all the hierarchical mistakes over the entire test set.\n\nHyperparameters: We *did not* cherry-pick hyperparameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in Fig 2(b). They are the best-performing ones (refer [2]). In fact, we provided a proper analysis to show the impact of hyperparameter on the mistake distribution (Figure 4 in A.1). In the case of softlabels, as $\\beta$ decreases, the model is supposed to become better aligned towards the hierarchy with a tradeoff with top1 accuracy, but in reality, performance simply gets worse. Note, with increasing values of $\\beta$, the softlabel method becomes similar to cross-entropy. Practically, beyond $\\beta=50$ its performance converges, remaining almost the same. To make it more evident, we added four additional points corresponding to $\\beta$ = [50,75,100,200] in Figure 2 for iNaturalist19. As expected, they all converge to a point (refer Table2 in A.4 for exact values).\n\nTherefore, at high values of $\\beta$, softlabel is very similar to cross-entropy; otherwise, it merely adds easy mistakes. Please note, this observation is for hierarchical distance@1. As we have shown in Figure 3, softlabel performs better than cross-entropy for ranking classes measured by distance@k, but still worse than CRM.\n\n> For the leftmost plots (in Fig 3), I am concerned that the authors are using subpar hyperparameters.\n\nRegarding Figure 3, for a fair comparison, we picked the hyperparameters for other models where their best results occurred. We have added results with all other hyperparameters in the appendix (Fig 5&6) to justify this claim: We can observe that the best results mostly occur at $\\beta=4$ and $\\alpha=0.6$. We hope this addresses the reviewer\u2019s concern and shows that our method outperforms existing methods at their optimal parameters (y-axis is in log-scale w.r.t classes) both in terms of ranking classes in Fig 3 (left) and tradeoffs between hierarchical distance@k and accuracy in Fig 3 (centre and right). \n\n> The authors make the fair broader claim that CRM is the only method which beats cross-entropy, which I do not think is justified:\n \nWe have rephrased the suggested line in Section 4.1 to better align with our intended claim (as stated in abstract & introduction)-- the existing methods do not practically improve over the cross-entropy baseline when considering the top-1 hierarchical distance. \n\n> Odd phrasings, missing citations.

Also, the simplicity and intuition are much appreciated.\n\nI myself am not an expert in image classification. However, for text classification, recent studies (e.g., [1]) shows that using binary cross-entropy (i.e., viewing a multi-label classification problem as L binary classification task, where L is the number of classes) can achieve higher performance than multi-label cross-entropy. In this case, it is possible that more than one label can have p(y|x) > 0.5. I wonder whether your approach is still effective for models using binary cross-entropy.

In CRM, you make your best estimate of the posterior probability of a class y given input x P(y|x), and then you make a final decision based on minimizing the expected loss.\n\nThere seems to be a belief that modifying the loss function to be hierarchy-aware is clearly better than doing boring old CRM. But there is not much evidence in favor of that hypothesis. This paper offers negative evidence for that hypothesis, with two experiments:\n\n1.  By comparing hierarchical loss to top-1 loss with modified loss functions, there is a tradeoff, and there does not seem to be an advantage in using the modified loss function.\n2.  For the top-k case, using CRM clearly dominates the proposals for modifying the loss function.\n\nThese support the use of CRM.\n\nI find this paper to be really nice -- I'd far rather have a paper with good experiments with known algorithms, where I can learn something useful; than a paper with a new algorithm with somewhat useless experiments. So I would argue for acceptance.\n\nOne thing for the authors to think about:\n\nWhen they test the calibration of the modified loss functions, they find them to be poorly calibrated. This is not surprising, since the modified loss functions are not proper scoring rules. They attempt to calibrate by using a softmax  with variable T. Wouldn't it make more sense to train exp(alpha_i x + beta_i) / \\sum_{i=1}^N exp(alpha_i x + beta_i) ? that is, a gain and offset for all classes after the first one?\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1873/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1873/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "No Cost Likelihood Manipulation at Test Time for Making Better Mistakes in Deep Networks", "authorids": ["~Shyamgopal_Karthik1", "~Ameya_Prabhu1", "~Puneet_K._Dokania1", "~Vineet_Gandhi2"], "authors": ["Shyamgopal Karthik", "Ameya Prabhu", "Puneet K.

The idea is to exploit the label hierarchy (e.g., the WordNet ontology) and consider graph distances as a proxy for mistake severity. Surprisingly, on examining mistake-severity distributions of the top-1 prediction, we find that current state-of-the-art hierarchy-aware deep classifiers do not always show practical improvement over the standard cross-entropy baseline in making better mistakes. The reason for the reduction in average mistake-severity can be attributed to the increase in low-severity mistakes, which may also explain the noticeable drop in their accuracy. To this end, we use the classical Conditional Risk Minimization (CRM) framework for hierarchy-aware classification. Given a cost matrix and a reliable estimate of likelihoods (obtained from a trained network), CRM simply amends mistakes at inference time; it needs no extra hyperparameters and requires adding just a few lines of code to the standard cross-entropy baseline. It significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art and consistently obtains large reductions in the average hierarchical distance of top-$k$ predictions across datasets, with very little loss in accuracy. CRM, because of its simplicity, can be used with any off-the-shelf trained model that provides reliable likelihood estimates.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "karthik|no_cost_likelihood_manipulation_at_test_time_for_making_better_mistakes_in_deep_networks", "one-sentence_summary": "Conditional risk framework exploiting the label hierarchy outperforms state of the art and makes a strong baseline for future explorations.", "pdf": "/pdf/1a3cb262b1a7bf8a9f26a4734b5d77ea7f544937.pdf", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Poster", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nkarthik2021no,\ntitle={No Cost Likelihood Manipulation at Test Time for Making Better Mistakes in Deep Networks},\nauthor={Shyamgopal Karthik and Ameya Prabhu and Puneet K.
