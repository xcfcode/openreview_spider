We've incorporated changes to the paper and respond to your main points below:\n\n> \u201cWhy didn't you train a WaveNet on the high-resolution instantaneous frequency representations?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an interesting avenue of research to explore. We trained WaveNets on the raw audio waveforms to provide strong and proven baseline models to compare against. Generating spectra with WaveNets is relatively unexplored and complicated by the high dimensionality at each timestep (number of frequencies * 2), each of which would have to be quantized in a traditional autoregressive treatment. It\u2019s quite possible that 2 dimensional convolutions and autoregression could help overcome this, but then the model would most resemble pixelCNN and be far from a proven audio generation method for a strong baseline.\n\n> \u201cI'm still not clear on unrolled phase which is central to this work. If you can, spend more time explaining this in detail, maybe with examples / diagrams? In figure 1,  in unrolled phase, why is time in reverse?\u201d\n\nApologies for the confusion. To help clarify, we\u2019ve renamed the \u201cunrolled\u201d phase as \u201cunwrapped\u201d throughout the paper, which is better alignment to standards in the literature and popular software packages such as Matlab and Numpy (for example https://www.mathworks.com/help/dsp/ref/unwrap.html). We have also added text further describing figure 1 (2nd to last paragraph of introduction) to help explain unwrapping to be the process of adding 2*Pi to the wrapped phase whenever it crosses a phase discontinuity such as to recover the monotonically increasing phase. The time derivative of this unwrapped phase is then the radial instantaneous frequency.\n\n> \u201cFigure 1 & 2: label the x-axis as time. Makes it a lot easier to understand.\n\nThank you for the helpful pointer. We\u2019ve added time axis labels to the figures and have also labeled the interpolation amounts for the interpolation figure.\n\n> \u201csentence before sec 2.2, and other small grammatical mistakes.

The treatment is analogous to image generation with GANs, with the emphasis being the changes to the architecture and representation necessary to make it possible to generate convincing audio that contains an interpretable latent code and is much faster than an autoregressive Wavenet based model (\"Neural Audio Synthesis of Musical Notes with WaveNet AutoEncoders\" - Engel et al (2017)). Like the other two related works (WaveGAN - \"Adversarial Audio Synthesis\" - Donahue et al 2018) and the Wavenet model above, it uses the NSynth dataset for its experiments. \n\nMuch of the discussion is on the representation itself - in that, it is argued that using audio (WaveGAN) and log magnitude/phase spectrograms  (PhaseGAN) produce poorer results as compared with the version with the unrolled phase that they call 'IF' GANs, with high frequency resolution and log scaling to separate scales.  \n\nThe architecture of the network is similar to the recently published paper  (Donahue et al 2018), with convolutions and transpose convolutions adapted for audio. However, there seem to be two important developments. The current paper uses progressive growing of GANs (the current state of the art for producing high resolution images), and pitch conditioning (Odena et al, where labels are used to help training dynamics). \n\nFor validation, the paper presents several metrics, with the recently proposed \"NDB\" metric figuring in the evaluations, which I think is interesting. The IF-Mel + high frequency resolution model seems to outperform the others in most of the evaluations, with good phase coherence and interpolation between latent codes. \n\nMy thoughts: \nOverall, it seems that the paper's contributions are centered around the representation (with \"IF-Mel\" being the best). The architecture itself is not very different from commonly used DCGAN variants - the authors say that using PGGAN is desirable, but not critical, and the use of labels from Odena et al. \n\nMany of my own experiments with GANs were plagued by instability (especially at higher resolution) and mode collapse problems without special treatment (largely documented, such as adding noise, adjusting learning rates and so forth). To this end, what do the authors see as 'high' resolution vis a vis audio signals? \n\nI am curious if we can adapt these ideas for recurrent generators as might appear in TTS problems. \n\nI rate this paper as an accept since this is one of the few existing works that demonstrate successful audio generation from noise using GANs, and  owing to its novelty in exploring representation for audio. \n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1437/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "GANSynth: Adversarial Neural Audio Synthesis", "abstract": "Efficient audio synthesis is an inherently difficult machine learning task, as human perception is sensitive to both global structure and fine-scale waveform coherence.

Through extensive empirical investigations on the NSynth dataset, we demonstrate that GANs are able to outperform strong WaveNet baselines on automated and human evaluation metrics, and efficiently generate audio several orders of magnitude faster than their autoregressive counterparts.\n", "keywords": ["GAN", "Audio", "WaveNet", "NSynth", "Music"], "authorids": ["jesseengel@google.com", "kumarkagrawal@gmail.com", "chenshuo@google.com", "igul222@gmail.com", "christopherdonahue@gmail.com", "adarob@google.com"], "authors": ["Jesse Engel", "Kumar Krishna Agrawal", "Shuo Chen", "Ishaan Gulrajani", "Chris Donahue", "Adam Roberts"], "TL;DR": "High-quality audio synthesis with GANs", "pdf": "/pdf/0f046c130a3228cda053e1f35b7e1efc06e2adf6.pdf", "paperhash": "engel|gansynth_adversarial_neural_audio_synthesis", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nengel2018gansynth,\ntitle={{GANS}ynth: Adversarial Neural Audio Synthesis},\nauthor={Jesse Engel and Kumar Krishna Agrawal and Shuo Chen and Ishaan Gulrajani and Chris Donahue and Adam Roberts},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1xQVn09FX},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1437/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234229827, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "H1xQVn09FX", "replyto": "H1xQVn09FX", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1437/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335946744, "tmdate": 1552335946744, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1437/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 9}
