The authors propose a domain-specific language two types of generators (random and RL-based) together with a ranking function and evaluator. The results are promising, and this research introduces a framework that might enable the community to find new interesting models. However, it's not clear how these framework compare with previous ones (see below). Also, the clarity of the text could be improved.\n\nPros:\n1. An interesting automatic method for generating RNNs is introduced by the authors (but is not entirely clear how does ir compare with previous different approaches)\n2. The approach is tested in a number of tasks: Language modelling (PTB and wikipedia-2) and machine translation (\n3. In these work the authors tested a wide range of different RNNs\n3. It is interesting that some of the best performing architectures (e.g. LSTM, residual nets) are found during the automatic search\n\n\nCons:\n1. It would be nice if the method didn\u2019t rely on defining a specific set of functions and operators upon which the proposed method works.\n2. The text has some typos: for example: \u201cthat were used to optimize the generator each batch\u201d\n3. In section 5, the authors briefly discuss other techniques using RL and neuroevolution, but they never contrast these approaches with theirs. Overall, it would be nice if the authors had made a more direct comparison with other methods for generating RNNs.\n4. The description of the ranking function is not clear. What kind of networks were used? This appears to introduce a ranking-network-specific bias in the search process.\n\nMinor comments:\n1. The authors study the use of subtractive operators. Recently a new model has considered the use of subtractive gates in LSTMs as a more biologically plausible implementation (Cortical microcircuits as gated-recurrent neural networks, NIPS 2017).\n2. Figure 4 missing label on x-axis\n3. End of Related Work period is missing.\n3. The authors state that some of the networks generated do not follow human intuition, but this doesn\u2019t appear to discussed. What exactly do the authors mean?\n4.

To constraint the architecture search space, authors propose a DSL that specifies the RNN recurrent operations. This DSL allows to explore RNN architectures using either random search or a reinforcement-learning strategy. Candidate architectures are ranked using a TreeLSTM that tries to predict the architecture performances. The top-k architectures are then evaluated by fully training them on a given task.\n\nAuthors evaluate their approach on  PTB/Wikitext 2 language modeling and Multi30k/IWSLT'16  machine translation. In both experiments, authors show that their approach obtains competitive results and can sometime outperforms RNN cells such as GRU/LSTM. In the PTB experiment, their architecture however underperforms other LSTM variant in the literatures.\n\n\n- Quality/Clarity\nThe paper is overall well written and pleasant to read.\n\nFew details can be clarified. In particular how did you initialize the weight and bias for both the LSTM/GRU baselines and the found architectures? Is there other works leveraging RNN that report results on the Multi30k/IWSLT datasets?\n\nYou state in paragraph 3.2 that human experts can inject the previous best known architecture when training the ranking networks. Did you use this in the experiments? If yes, what was the impact of this online learning strategy on the final results? \n\n\n- Originality\nThe idea of using DSL + ranking for architecture search seems novel.\n\n\n- Significance\nAutomated architecture search is a promising way to design new networks. However, it is not clear why the proposed approach is not able to outperforms other LSTM-based architectures on the PTB task. Could the problem arise from the DSL that constraint too much the search space ? It would be nice to have other tasks that are commonly used as benchmark for RNN to see where this approach stand.\n\nIn addition, authors propose both a DSL, a random and RL generator and a ranking function. It would be nice to disentangle the contributions of the different components. In particular, did the authors compare the random search vs the RL based generator or the performances of the RL-based generator when the ranking network is not used?\n\nAlthough authors do show that they outperform NAScell in one setting, it would be nice to have an extended evaluation (using character level PTB for instance).", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Flexible Approach to Automated RNN Architecture Generation", "abstract": "The process of designing neural architectures requires expert knowledge and extensive trial and error.\nWhile automated architecture search may simplify these requirements, the recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures generated by existing methods are limited in both flexibility and components.\nWe propose a domain-specific language (DSL) for use in automated architecture search which can produce novel RNNs of arbitrary depth and width.\nThe DSL is flexible enough to define standard architectures such as the Gated Recurrent Unit and Long Short Term Memory and allows the introduction of non-standard RNN components such as trigonometric curves and layer normalization.

While we agree that our work helps generalize previous work in this area we do also agree that it doesn\u2019t resolve all the issues that you\u2019ve note.\n\nIn terms of limited scope, our work does show that a single RNN cell trained on a two layer setup is able to extend to a three layer setup, as seen with our best BC3 cell results being reported on a three layer setup. Our baseline experimental setup involved a two layer cell setup for this very reason, to ensure that discovered RNN cells could be stacked. We believe we show this is indeed true.\n\nThe heuristics introduced for that section were introduced to limit the search space. Whilst it is likely that the architecture generator would learn to avoid models which our heuristics filtered we decided that the computation expended for learning those relatively simple concepts was better spent on the architecture search process itself.\n\nWhilst we kept the number of parameters equal for the language modeling experiment, keeping the number of parameters equal for the translation experiment was more complicated. The RNN cells discovered residual connections and hence prevented easy scaling up or down of the overall hidden size without an additional projection layer.\n\nIn terms of generalization guarantees, like other machine learning models the architecture generator is only informed by the training data it receives. In our instance this is from a single task with limited sized models due to the computational constraints but this could be extended to larger models and across more varied tasks.

Here, we tried to find a trade-off between flexible operators and a reasonably sized search space. In the future, expanding that search space even further will be an interesting avenue to find even more diverse architectures.\n\nThe recent work regarding biologically plausible models that utilize subtractive gates is fascinating - thanks for the reference!\n\nFor the ranking function, all the nodes except for those that are positional dependent are ChildSum TreeLSTM nodes, whilst those nodes requiring positional information are N-ary TreeLSTM nodes (more detail in 3.2). The ranking function hyper parameters and details are described in greater detail in Appendix B2.\n\n\nIn regards to Figure 4, epoch 19k, we are not entirely certain what occurred there. This was a continuous run and there were no explicit changes during that section. In the text, we briefly mention the hypothesis that the generator first learns to build robust architectures and is only then capable of inserting more varied operators without compromising the RNN's overall stability.\n\nFor the initialization, it is the default that was found within PyTorch. As an example, the initializations for the RNNs were all equivalent to PyTorch\u2019s Linear, which performs uniform initialization between +-(1/sqrt(HIDDEN)).\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/b06276994056ccde50a6550f2c9a49ab9458df8f/torch/nn/modules/linear.py#L48"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Flexible Approach to Automated RNN Architecture Generation", "abstract": "The process of designing neural architectures requires expert knowledge and extensive trial and error.\nWhile automated architecture search may simplify these requirements, the recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures generated by existing methods are limited in both flexibility and components.\nWe propose a domain-specific language (DSL) for use in automated architecture search which can produce novel RNNs of arbitrary depth and width.\nThe DSL is flexible enough to define standard architectures such as the Gated Recurrent Unit and Long Short Term Memory and allows the introduction of non-standard RNN components such as trigonometric curves and layer normalization.
