This paper investigates in detail which kind of deep or shallow networks may work well in this framework. One of the main findings is that that very shallow nets, consisting of a single filter bank with random weights, work surprisingly well, and for simple and regular textures may produce results which are visually superior to complex data-adapted filters such as the ones in networks like VGG-19. More broadly, the paper contains an interesting and informative discussion on the strength and limitations on such methods for texture synthesis.\n\nFigure 4 shows that the optimisation of images with respect to shallow filter banks may result in texture images that have a lower VGG-19 loss than optimising the VGG-19 objective directly. This is imputed to the difficulty of optimising the highly non-linear VGG-19 cost function, which is a reasonable explanation. In the new supplementary material, the authors show that better optimisation results can be obtained by initialising the VGG-19-based optimisation with the shallow network optimisation results, which is a useful complement to the original experiments.\n\nThe main limitation of the paper is that it does not systematically compare different methods against a quantifiable objective. It is trivial to define image statistics that would allow to simply generate an exact copy of any reference texture, hence with very good visual quality. Such trivial statistics would also be very shallow. The aim is instead to capture a texture distribution, and measuring how well a method meets this challenge remains an open problem. Hence, while the empirical results seem to confirm the intuition that simple statistics are good enough for texture synthesis both in terms of quality and diversity (when compared to more complex statistics), it is difficult to conclusively confirm that this is the case.\n\nThe authors indicate that diversity could be measured in terms of entropy. This is reasonable, but, as they acknowledge in their answers to questions, difficult to do in practice. Furthermore, this would still not account for the other aspect of the problem, namely visual quality. They also suggest to perform a psychophysical assessment, which may be the only practical way of addressing this problem, but deem that to be material for future work.\n\nOverall, since evaluation of image generation is such an hard problem, I think the paper still has sufficient strengths to warrant publication in ICLR. Still, some form of psychophysical assessment would be useful to confirm the intuitions that, at present, can only be obtained by inspecting the figure sin the paper and in the supplementary material.\n\n\n\n", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "What does it take to generate natural textures?", "abstract": "Natural image generation is currently one of the most actively explored fields in Deep Learning.

At the time of initialization, the loss is typically on the order of the original VGG loss (as shown in Fig. 4). After subsequent optimization with respect to the VGG objective, the loss decreases up to two orders of magnitude and the perceptual quality further increases.

This is hard for optimization-based texture synthesis models. Alternatively, one could ask humans or train a classifier to judge how easily one can tell apart (multiple) samples drawn from the model from (multiple) patches taken from the original texture. Similarly, in a 2AFC task humans could be asked to pick between a patch and an inpainting result from the model.\n\nIn this paper we emphasise the surprising quality of textures synthesised from very simple shallow and random networks, and to this end we employ simple human judgement. We have been doing human psychophysics on texture discrimination before [1,2] and are planning new experiments in this direction, but this goes far beyond the scope of the presented work.\n\n[1] H.

Matching the constraints within some region of radius epsilon > 0 increases the set of preimages and thus likely increases the variability of the samples.

What about e.g. the Fourier filters?\n\nWe picked Fourier filters based on the hypothesis that the failure of some texture models such as ICA is caused by large metric changes. A basis of fourier filters, on the other hand, is  orthogonal (thus metric-preserving) , orientation selective and multi-scale. We tested many other filters based on other specific hypothesis, some of which we have not shown in the paper (e.g. Haar wavelets), but none of them lead to any notable increase in the quality of the synthesised textures (compared to random filters). Of course, this empirical approach does not allow us to draw general conclusions; there might be data-dependent filters that substantially increase synthesis quality.

This paper investigates in detail which kind of deep (or shallow) features may work well in this framework. \n\nOne of the main results is that that very shallow networks, consisting of a number of parallel one-layer filter banks with random weights, work surprisingly well, and for simple and regular textures tend to produce results which are visually better than using very complex data-adapted filters such as the ones in VGG-19.\n\nThe contribution is a nice one, interesting due to its fairly surprising findings, and possibly more interesting due to the caveats that it explicitly and implicitly raises about such methods for texture synthesis.\n\nI have a few questions for the authors. Figure 4 show that direct optimisation of shallow filters results in texture images that have a lower VGG-19 loss. This is imputed to the difficulty of optimising the highly non-linear VGG-19, which is a reasonable explanation. In fact, if by optimising the simpler statistics we can obtain a copy of the input texture, obviously the VGG-19 loss would also be zero. However:\n\n- The optimisation algorithm is local, so it is possible that, by restarting the VGG-19 optimisation, a result with a lower energy could be obtained. Is this possible?\n\n- As discussed in detail in the last section of the paper, a texture method that just copies the reference texture image is useless; the aim is instead to draw \"fair\" samples from the texture intended as an image distribution. Is it possible that by fitting the energy function less, the texture sampling properties are actually better?\n\n- Connected to the latter point, since it is clear that only reproducing an image statistics is meaningless (as the best possible result is the original image), can the authors discuss how this family of texture generation methods should, at least in principle, be tested?\n\n- Several filter types are compared (Fourier, random, etc). However, the differences are not discussed very explicitly. The main conclusion is random filters are, sometimes, just as good as filters trained from data. What about e.g. the Fourier filters?\n\n\n\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "What does it take to generate natural textures?", "abstract": "Natural image generation is currently one of the most actively explored fields in Deep Learning.
