It is interesting to see the sensitivity of DNNs that are trained for the task of object detection to FRIs, like sensitivity of R-CNN to FRIs. In this case augmenting training data with crops of small FRI sizes can be properly done since ground-truth bounding boxes can determine which region is foreground and which region is background.

Still even with those changes deep CNNs still posses more fragile behavior than human vision. One of my criticism is that human vision is kind of different: it makes multiple passes over the same images at multiple scales, so this might contribute significantly to these differences. Still this paper makes a lot of interesting observations and analyses and represents a first methodological study of this phenomenon.\n\nA novelty of this work is that it is the first paper that methodologically analyses FRIs for DNNs a reasearch area which might shed new light on the understanding of how vision systems work and the source of misrecognitions and the limitations of recognition systems.\n\nIn light of the changes of the paper and the clarification on the novelty aspect of this research, I suggest this paper to be accepted as it constitutes novel research in understanding how DNNs recognize image content and its similarities and differences to human vision.\n\n\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1161/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Minimal Images in Deep Neural Networks: Fragile Object Recognition in Natural Images", "abstract": "The human ability to recognize objects is impaired when the object is not shown in full. \"Minimal images\" are the smallest regions of an image that remain recognizable for humans.

[...] One hypothesis here is that fragile recognition may be because the test image resolution does not match the training image resolution. \nAuthors: The results presented in the paper reject this hypothesis:\n1) Matching the training image resolution does not solve FRIs. Fig. 6a shows that augmenting training data with small crops does not solve FRIs. \n2) There are FRIs at any crop size.

We tested FRIs generated by zero-padding (instead of upscaling) in DNNs with different pooling region sizes. The results show that FRIs arise in zero-padding in the same way as upscaling, and larger pooling does not significantly reduce the amount of FRIs the way it reduces lack of invariance. This result further strengthens the conclusion that FRIs are a phenomenon independent of the lack of invariance reported in previous works. Upscaling was chosen for the study instead of zero-padding because upscaling leads to natural images while zero-padding does not. FRIs can be produced by just moving the camera a bit closer or a bit to the side. Studying the failure modes of DNNs in natural images is crucial, as these failures happen without the need of an attacker handcrafting images by adding zero-padding or synthetic perturbations. \n\nReviewer: \u201cThe originality is limited as it is a close extenstion work of Ullman et al. 2016\u201d \nUllman et al. analyses minimal images for human vision, while we analyze minimal images for DNNs (more generally denoted as FRIs).

The smaller the image crops, the more sensitive DNNs become (here, more FRIs)\n3. DNNs and human vision misclassify the image crops differently: (1) DNNs have almost twice more FRI(s) and (2) FRIs of human and DNNs differ in location.\n\nQuestions:\n\n- \"After extracting the region from the image, the region is resized to be of the size required by the network.\"\nWould upscaling say a small 28x28 crop into 224x224 image here naturally negatively impact the DNN predictive performance?\nThat is, because typically image classifiers are trained on one (or a few) fixed resolution(s) of images.\n\nOne hypothesis here is that fragile recognition may be because the test image resolution does not match the training image resolution.\nHuman on the other hands, have been trained on images of variable resolutions.\n\nAn alternative to upscaling here is to zero-pad the crop region. Can you help us understand your choice of upscaling here?\n\n+ Originality\nThe originality is limited as it is a close extenstion work of Ullman et al. 2016\n\n+ Clarity\nThe paper is well written and presented.\n\n+ Significance\nThis work extends our understanding of the differences between DNNs and human vision.\nHowever, given what we learned from the adversarial example research area, the contribution of this work is low because results might not be too surprising.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1161/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Minimal Images in Deep Neural Networks: Fragile Object Recognition in Natural Images", "abstract": "The human ability to recognize objects is impaired when the object is not shown in full. \"Minimal images\" are the smallest regions of an image that remain recognizable for humans. Ullman et al. (2016) show that a slight modification of the location and size of the visible region of the minimal image produces a sharp drop in human recognition accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that such drops in accuracy due to changes of the visible region are a common phenomenon between humans and existing state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs), and are much more prominent in DNNs. We found many cases where DNNs classified one region correctly and the other incorrectly, though they only differed by one row or column of pixels, and were often bigger than the average human minimal image size. We show that this phenomenon is independent from previous works that have reported lack of invariance to minor modifications in object location in DNNs. Our results thus reveal a new failure mode of DNNs that also affects humans to a much lesser degree. They expose how fragile DNN recognition ability is in natural images even without adversarial patterns being introduced. Bringing the robustness of DNNs in natural images to the human level remains an open challenge for the community.
