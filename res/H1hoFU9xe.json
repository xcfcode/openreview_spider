This makes backprop through it quite straightforward. Note, that during training the action matrix of the Stego(...) is effectively random: we use the same pool of payload information for each batch, but within a batch random payload information is embedded in each image.\n\n-------\n We apply GAN approach in the paper purely as a training technique to get an image generator (G) that achieves both realism with respect to a discriminator (D) and security against stegodetector (S), both jointly adversarially trained (eq. 4). This way we get a generator, the images of which have the pixel distribution, specifically tailored to securely concealing images with a particular Stego(...) function. Since we are not using the GAN trained D and S any further and want to use G solely as an image generator, we are therefore free to train it on the whole dataset. This permits us to verify how well the GAN approach works in stego.\n\nThe 90-10 train-test split is related to training/validating the independent stego-detector S^*, used to assess the security of the generated images.\n-------\nIn this paper we have tested our model for the +-1 embedding algorithm only, but in the future we plan to test it for other steganographic algorithms.The key idea of the paper is that SGAN produces a generator the images of which have pixel distributions better \"aligned\" with the distortions introduced by a particular Stego-algorithm, and are sufficiently realistic-looking.

As a result, the generator, not only learn to generate realistic images by fooling the discriminator of the GAN, but also learn to be a secure container by fooling steganalyser discriminator. The method is tested by training an independent steganalyser S* on real images and generated images.\n\nGiven that in the ICLR community, not many people are familiar with the literature of steganography, I think this paper should have provided more context about how exactly this method can be used in practice, what are the related works on setganalysis-secure message embedding and probably a more thorough sets of experiments on more than one dataset.\n\nThe proposed SGAN framework (Figure 2) does make sense to me, and I think it is very general and can have more applications other than the steganography domain.

Do you in fact backprop through the Stego function?\n\n- For the train/test split, why is the SGAN trained on all 200k images? Would it not be cleaner to use the same splits for training SGAN as for \"steganalysis purposes\"? Could this account for the sensitivity to random seed shown in table 2?\n- Sec. 5.3: \"Steganographic Generative Adversarial Networks can potentially be used as a universal tool for generating Steganography containers tuned to deceive any specific steganalysis algorithm.\". This experiment showed that SGAN can fool HUGO, but I do not see how it was \"tuned\" to deceive HUGO, or how it could be tuned in general for a particular steganalyzer.\n\nAlthough S* seems to be fooled by the proposed method, in general for image generation the discriminator D is almost never fooled. I.e. contemporary GANs never converge to actually fooling the discriminator, even if they produce samples that sometimes fool humans. What if I created an additional steganalyzer S**(x) = S*(x) * D(x)?

The authors describe a new model architecture in which a new element, a 'steganalyser' is added a training objective to the GAN model.\n\nMajor Comments:\nThe authors introduce an interesting new direction for applying generative networks. That said, I think the premise of the paper could stand some additional exposition. How exactly would a SGAN method be employed? This is not clear from the paper. Why does the model require a generative model? Steganalysis by itself seems like a classification problem (i.e. a binary decision if there a hidden message?) Would you envision that a user has a message to send and does not care about the image (container) that it is being sent with? Or does the user have an image and the network generates a synthetic version of the image as a container and then hide the message in the container? Or is the SGAN somehow trained as a method for detecting hidden codes performed by any algorithm in an image? Explicitly describing the use-case would help with interpreting the results in the paper.\n\nAdditionally, the experiments and analysis in this paper is quite light as the authors only report a few steganalysis performance numbers in the tables (Table 1,2,3). A more extensive analysis seems warranted to explore the parameter space and provide a quantitative comparison with other methods discussed (e.g. HUGO, WOW, LSB, etc.) When is it appropriate to use this method over the others? Why does the seed effect the quality of results? Does a fixed seed correspond realistic scenario for employing this method?\n\nMinor comments:\n- Is Figure 1 necessary?\n- Why does the seed value effect the quality of the predictive performance of the model?", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Steganography", "abstract": "Steganography is collection of methods to hide secret information (\"payload\") within non-secret information (\"container\").

Experiment results demonstrate that the new model successfully deceives the steganography analyzer, and for this reason, can be used in  steganographic applications.", "pdf": "/pdf/7e9624388de612920ee0f0ee01955649939a2a76.pdf", "TL;DR": "We consider a new type of GAN model and apply it to secure image steganography", "paperhash": "volkhonskiy|generative_adversarial_networks_for_image_steganography", "conflicts": ["hse.ru", "iitp.ru", "skoltech.ru"], "keywords": ["Computer vision", "Deep learning", "Unsupervised Learning", "Applications", "Supervised Learning"], "authors": ["Denis Volkhonskiy", "Boris Borisenko", "Evgeny Burnaev"], "authorids": ["dvolkhonskiy@gmail.com", "bborisenko@hse.ru", "e.burnaev@skoltech.ru"]}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 11, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "duedate": 1475686800000, "tmdate": 1478287705855, "id": "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/submission", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2017/pcs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["~"], "reply": {"forum": null, "replyto": null, "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"pdf": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "Either upload a PDF file or provide a direct link to your PDF on ArXiv (link must begin with http(s) and end with .pdf)", "value-regex": "upload|(http|https):\\/\\/.+\\.pdf"}, "title": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Title of paper.", "value-regex": ".{1,250}"}, "abstract": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Abstract of paper.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}, "authors": {"required": true, "order": 2, "values-regex": "[^;,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*", "description": "Comma separated list of author names, as they appear in the paper."}, "conflicts": {"required": true, "order": 100, "values-regex": "[^;,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*", "description": "Comma separated list of email domains of people who would have a conflict of interest in reviewing this paper, (e.g., cs.umass.edu;google.com, etc.)."}, "keywords": {"order": 6, "description": "Comma separated list of keywords.", "values-dropdown": ["Theory", "Computer vision", "Speech", "Natural language processing", "Deep learning", "Unsupervised Learning", "Supervised Learning", "Semi-Supervised Learning", "Reinforcement Learning", "Transfer Learning", "Multi-modal learning", "Applications", "Optimization", "Structured prediction", "Games"]}, "TL;DR": {"required": false, "order": 3, "description": "\"Too Long; Didn't Read\": a short sentence describing your paper", "value-regex": "[^\\n]{0,250}"}, "authorids": {"required": true, "order": 3, "values-regex": "[^;,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*", "description": "Comma separated list of author email addresses, in the same order as above."}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "expdate": 1483462800000, "cdate": 1478287705855}}}], "count": 12}
