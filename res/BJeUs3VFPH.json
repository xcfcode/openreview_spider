Please find our statements subsequently to the various points mentioned in your review. We do not expect that this comment will substantially\nchange your opinion but believe that some clarifications are required which should\nbe in your interest and also in the interest of the area chair or respectively the\nhonored organizers of this ICLR 2020 conference.\n\n>>  This paper should be rejected because [...]\n\n(1) the paper lacks important latest references on domain adaptation, \n>In your opinion, we miss just two papers: MEDA and JGSA. The rest of the related work is partly very recent.  \nWe define related work as related to our work, which in this case are subspace approaches\nfor transfer learning in traditional learning models, where only a moderate amount of data may be available. Deep learning approaches for transfer learning are competitive approaches\nto the considered methods but are not in particular focus of our approach nor the other\nvery recent high ranked work we compared within the paper. \nThe methods MEDA and JGSA have been published -- very -- recently. \n\n(2) the paper misuses the notations that makes the paper is not easy to follow,\n>We are using a standard domain adaptation notation. But for two domain matrices with singular value decompositions with their low-rank versions, we got 14 different matrices. We are sorry that it requires a variety of notations. \nYou claim that \"In line 2 of page 5, the authors claim that BT assumes S_Z ~ S_X, which is not true.\"\n> This is mentioned in the paper, and we invalidated this by ourselves for some cases. Take a look at the pseudo-code and figure 2. How can we get a reject for something we claim by ourselves and provide a possible solution for it?\nFurther, the critiques on wrong equations or claims (3,4,6,8) are very detailed before or after the equations, respectively. Finally, we call it low-rank approach because we are using approximated low-rank matrices via Nystr\u00f6m. \n\n\n(3.1) the algorithm is not well justified either by theory\n>The theory of this approach is based on the singular value decomposition, eigenvalue decomposition, and the orthogonal Procrustes problem. These techniques and problems are well known and studied for decades. We do not change the mechanics of the approaches but interpreted the results for domain adaptation techniques, and therefore, the theory is also valid. Your current complains about the theory in the paper are too vague to help us in improving the paper. You mentioned that the bound is not very meaningful but actually shows that matrices are very similar after NBT resulting in similar distributions and is perfectly fine for our case. \n\n(3.2) or experiments\n>The deep adaptation techniques are missing, mainly because we proposed a non-deep learning approach. As you can easily check, we have evaluated our approach on the variety of typically\nused benchmark data. There are additional very good reasons not to focus on deep learning approaches alone. Deep learning requires a huge amount of reliable (labeled) training data which is not applicable in many real life problems (e.g. manufacturing domains, for small to medium scale companies a.s.o). In those settings, we may have rather a few 100 to thousands of data but not at the scale of deep learning. This is a particular motivation why non-deep learning methods are also extended to transfer learning. Otherwise, we could completely abandon everything aside of deep learning. This paper was not around deep learning - on purpose - and due to the aforementioned reasons. \nWe will integrate MEDA into the revision of the paper, but this will not change the overall picture. We did not do any cherry-picking. \n\n>The reviewer misses the essential part of this paper. We do not learn or find a new projections matrix. We interpret the solutions of the orthogonal Procrustes problem to give a subspace transformation. This paper shows that for effective domain adaptation, the learning of complicated functions is not necessarily required. \n\n\n>Note, we subsequently will provide the experimental results for MEDA, which seems to be an important requirement for acceptance. Parts are already included right now. \n\n(4) Thank you for the feedback. We fixed the issues mentioned in point 9. \n \n\nThank you for reading.

More specifically, the feature dimensionality is reduced by using only s biggest eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and the sample size is coordinated through Nystrom approximation. Class-wise sampling is used for the source, and uniform sampling is used for the target. Experimental studies on three datasets have been done.\n\nThis paper should be rejected because (1) the paper lacks important latest references on domain adaptation, (2) the paper misuses the notations that makes the paper is not easy to follow, (3) the algorithm is not well justified either by theory or experiments, and (4) the presentation should be further polished. Here are some detailed comments:\n\n(1)\tA lot of recent deep domain adaptation methods are missing. These deep works achieve the state-of-the-art results on many transfer benchmark tasks. Without comparison with them (the paper does not mention any deep works), it is very unconvincing to conclude the paper makes new contributions to the transfer community. \n(2)\tIn line 2 of page 5, the authors claim that BT assumes S_Z ~ S_X, which is not true. The key idea of BT is to construct new source data using target basis and source eigenvalues. Similarly, the authors make the same claim in section 4.1 for NBT, which is also not valid. \n(3)\tThe notations in eq. (12) and (13) are very misleading. Eq. (12) follows the notations of the first line in page 5, but in the first line below eq. (12), why R_X \\in R^{d \\times s}, S_X^2 \\in R^{s \\times s}? I understand that X_s is the low dimensional X, then X_s = XR_s with R_s is the dimensionality reduction matrix whose size is d \\times s (using biggest s eigenvectors is fine). With this, eq. (13) is incorrect as X should be L_X*S_X*R_X^T, but not L_s*S_s*R_s^T. Moreover, it is also unclear why X is decomposed into product of two matrices in this work, is there any benefit of doing so for transfer purpose? \n(4)\tIn section 4.1, A_Z and A_X have exactly same form with X and Z, i.e., L_Z*S_Z*R_Z^T and L_X*S_X*R_X^T, please clarify. How eq. (14) X_s = \\tide{L_X}*S_X come from? Is it the same as eq. (13)? \n(5)\tThe title highlights low-rank, but it is not very clear how low-rank matters in the proposed method. I do not find contents stating the low-rank property of the proposed algorithm in the main technical sections.  \n(6)\tRegarding section 4.2, what is the benefit of using class-wise sampling for the source? Have you tried to use uniform sampling for both the source and target domains?\n(7)\tThe bound in eq.(16) is not very meaningful as s << n, m, d. Moreover, I am also not convinced by the claim this reduces the distribution differences, please give more theoretical justifications.\n(8)\tRegarding the experimental studies, why not use accuracy as many existing works do? The baselines are all subspace-based papers, and are out-of-the-date. The latest subspace papers, e.g., JGSA and MEDA, should be included. Moreover, deep methods are completely missing, which makes the empirical evaluation much less convincing. The improvements of NBT to BT are very marginal, 0.6. \n(9)\tSome typos and unclear points (please further polish the paper): \n(a)\tThe last sentence of para 2, X and Z should be data, not features/\n(b)\tPara 3, it is unclear what are the implicit alignment and explicit alignment of domain distributions.\n(c)\tThe first sentence in section 2, it should be homogeneous. \n(d)\tPage 5 above eq. (15), it should be S_Z ~ S_X.\n(e)\tSection 4.2 the second line, it should be \u201cin the data matrix\u201d\n(f)\tThe second last line of page 6, it should be inequality (16).\n(g)\tSome references miss page information.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper152/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper152/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Domain Adaptation via Low-Rank Basis Approximation", "authors": ["Christoph Raab", "Frank-Michael Schleif"], "authorids": ["christoph.raab@fhws.de", "frank-michael.schleif@fhws.de"], "keywords": ["Domain Adaptation", "Basis Transfer", "Transfer Learning", "Low Rank Approximation", "Nystr\u00f6m Approximation"], "TL;DR": "The paper describes a low-rank basis transfer algorithm using only a subset from the domains with outstanding results.", "abstract": "Domain adaptation focuses on the reuse of supervised learning models in a new context.
