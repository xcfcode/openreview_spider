An only discrete-time dynamic hypergraph is considered.\n\nA1. In the introduction, we introduced the discrete-time and continuous models as two feasible solutions to dynamic hypergraph and defined the formulation to compare the difference between the two models. Due to a static hypergraph model can be extended to dynamic hypergraphs by applying it on each snapshot and then aggregating the results of the model, and the distinction between an evolving and a temporal network is less important, so we adapt discrete-time formulation in our work. Also, in section 3.1, we deleted the expression about continuous-time models, and focus on the discrete-time models throughout the manuscript. \n\nA2. The attention model and the modeling of the evolution of the centroid nodes are not particularly novel.\n\nQ2. We agree that the key idea of our work is based on the attention model, which has been used in a graph-based model for modeling feature interactions. However, we use it to model the interaction between nodes and hyperedges in the dynamic hypergraph, which is a rather different scenario and has not studied by previous work. In our opinion, appropriately adapting an existing technique to solve a different problem should also be treated as a significant contribution. In fact, there have been many in\ufb02uential papers that adapt/introduce an existing technique to better solve another problem. For example, the neural attention mechanism is \ufb01rst developed in computer vision [1] and then adapted to machine translation by [2] and to GNN by [3].

The number of testing days is also very small, to be able to draw meaningful results, especially for a portfolio of 91 instruments.\n\nA2. We split the dataset into training, validation, and testing set according to the ratio of 7:2:1. Comparing DyHCN with other baselines under the same dataset split, and DyHCN works best, indicating that DyHCN is more suitable to solve the dynamic hypergraph problem. The length of the testing set is not the most important factor in evaluating the effectiveness of the model. Besides, we need to construct a hypergraph on each trading day and calculate the static embedding of nodes on each hypergraph, the training time will be greatly increased if a large number of data set is added.\n\nQ3. Performance metrics problem.\n\nA3. We backtested the experimental results, the initial capital is set to 10000, and the transaction fee and slippage are set to 0.008, which is an appropriate threshold. When the predicted price on the second day is higher than the current price, we buy the stock, and vice versa. We report the PnL and Sharpe for Tiingo and Stocktwits datasets, and the result shows that in Stocktwits, the annual PnL reached 43.89% and Sharpe reached 5.53. In Tiingo, the annual PnL reached 33.4% and Sharpe reached 3.87. However, our model is just a prototype for stock market strategies, and in real trading, we need to consider more details to make the strategy better.\n\nQ4. Some of the notation could be better explained.\n\nA4. We modified the description of experiment settings at Section 5.1. In the price prediction task, the input is the time series normalized open, high, low, close price and volume data denoted \nas $p_o^{0:T},p_h^{0:T},p_l^{0:T},p_c^{0:T},p_v^{0:T}$ of total $T$ trading days, and output $\\textbf{Y}^{t+1}$ is the close price of the $T+1$th day.\nFor a specific trading day $i$, the hypergraph $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{G}}^i=(\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{V}}^i,\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}}^i)$ is constructed\nas mentioned above, and the initial features of nodes $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{V}}^i$ are extracted by LSTM with \nthe input of normalized price and volume of past ten days, \n\\eg $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{V}}^i=LSTM(p_o^{i-10:i},p_h^{i-10:i},p_l^{i-10:i},p_c^{i-10:i},p_v^{i-10:i})$, and \nwe set the embedding size of LSTM to 128. Also, we set the initial features of \n$\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}}^i=\\{\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}}^{i}_0,\\cdots,\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}}^{i}_m\\}$ with \nthe embeddings of news/comment on day $i$, \\eg for each hyperedge $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}}^{i}_k(k\\in{[0,\\cdots,m]})$,\nthe embeddings are initialized by GloVe \\cite{pennington-etal-2014-glove} with the $k$th news/comment, and the embedding size\nis set to 128. With the construction of \n$\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{G}}=\\{\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{G}}^{0},\\cdots,\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{G}}^{i},\\cdots,\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{G}}^{T}\\}$,\nwe use the past 10 trading days normalized price, volume and hypergraphs, \n\\eg $p_o^{t-10:t},p_h^{t-10:t},p_l^{t-10:t},p_c^{t-10:t},p_v^{t-10:t}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{G}}^{t-10:t}$, to predict the normalized close\nprice on 11th trading day $y^{t+1}$. We set z-score normalization as the default normalization method in our experiments.\n The model uses a stacked-layer HC with TE module for price prediction, and add a dropout layer with the dropout rate of 0.5 before the TE module. DyHCN is trained with Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.005,\n the embedding size of the TE module is set to 128.

The reason for sigmoid in Eqn(3) is not clear\n\nA1. In Eqn(3), we map the embedding of hyperedge $D_u^t$ into a one-dimensional vector, so the sigmoid activate function here is not necessary, and we change the formulation to $r_u^t=D_u^tw_u+b_u$. \n\nQ2. How the initial node/hyperedge features are generated is not very clear.\n\nA2. We modified the description of experiment settings in Section 5.1. \n\nThe Tiingo and Stocktwits datasets contain similar fields, and we use the same method to construct hypergraphs.\nThere are three main fields in these datasets: released time, news/comment content, and stocks contained in news/comment.\nWe set news/comment as hyperedges, and the stocks contained as nodes in hyperedges. The procedure is as follows:\n\n  1.  We aggregate news/comment on a daily basis and exclude holidays.\n\n  2.  We select news/comment that contains more than 2 stocks and less than 5 stocks on each trading day. More than 2 stocks can ensure the construction of a hyperedge, while less than 5 stocks can prevent some introductory news, which will not have much influence on the price prediction.\n\n  3.  On each trading day, we use the filtered news/comment as hyperedges and the stocks in the news/comment as the nodes of the \n  corresponding hyperedges.\n  \nThe constructed hypergraphs is denoted as $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{G}}=\\{\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{G}}^{0},\\cdots,\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{G}}^{T}\\}$ according to the order of \ntrading days, where $T$ is the total trading days.\nIn each hypergraph $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{G}}^i=(\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{V}}^i,\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}}^i)(i\\in{[0,\\cdots,T]})$, \n$\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{V}}^i=\\{\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{V}}^i_0,\\cdots,\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{V}}^i_{91}\\}$\ndenotes the selected 91 stocks on the $i$th day.\nThe hyperedges $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}}^i=\\{\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}}^{i}_0,\\cdots,\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}}^{i}_m\\}$ are \nconstructed with each news/comment on corresponding day, where $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}}^i_k(k\\in{[0,\\cdots,m]})$ denotes the $k$th news/comment\non day $i$, and $m$ is the number of hyperedges on day $i$. We use $\\boldsymbol{u}_l^i\\in{\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{V}}^{i}}(l\\in[0,\\cdots,n])$ \ndenote the nodes contained in the hyperedge $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}}^i_k(k\\in{[0,\\cdots,m]})$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the hyperedge.\n\nIn the price prediction task, the input is the time series normalized open, high, low, close price and volume data denoted \nas $p_o^{0:T},p_h^{0:T},p_l^{0:T},p_c^{0:T},p_v^{0:T}$ of total $T$ trading days, and output $\\textbf{Y}^{t+1}$ is the close price of the $T+1$th day.\nFor a specific trading day $i$, the hypergraph $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{G}}^i=(\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{V}}^i,\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}}^i)$ is constructed\nas mentioned above, and the initial features of nodes $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{V}}^i$ are extracted by LSTM with \nthe input of normalized price and volume of past ten days, \n\\eg $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{V}}^i=LSTM(p_o^{i-10:i},p_h^{i-10:i},p_l^{i-10:i},p_c^{i-10:i},p_v^{i-10:i})$, and \nwe set the embedding size of LSTM to 128. Also, we set the initial features of \n$\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}}^i=\\{\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}}^{i}_0,\\cdots,\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}}^{i}_m\\}$ with \nthe embeddings of news/comment on day $i$, \\eg for each hyperedge $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}}^{i}_k(k\\in{[0,\\cdots,m]})$,\nthe embeddings are initialized by GloVe \\cite{pennington-etal-2014-glove} with the $k$th news/comment, and the embedding size\nis set to 128. With the construction of \n$\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{G}}=\\{\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{G}}^{0},\\cdots,\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{G}}^{i},\\cdots,\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{G}}^{T}\\}$,\nwe use the past 10 trading days normalized price, volume and hypergraphs, \n\\eg $p_o^{t-10:t},p_h^{t-10:t},p_l^{t-10:t},p_c^{t-10:t},p_v^{t-10:t}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{G}}^{t-10:t}$, to predict the normalized close\nprice on 11th trading day $y^{t+1}$. We set z-score normalization as the default normalization method in our experiments.\n The model use stacked-layer HC with TE module for price prediction, and adds a dropout layer with the dropout rate of 0.5 before the TE module. DyHCN is trained with Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.005,\n the embedding size of the TE module is set to 128.

The introduction could be improved. The description of the \"two challenging toughs\" is not convincing enough; the description of the DyHCN system is unclear\n\nA1. In the introduction, we introduced the discrete-time and continuous models as two feasible solutions to dynamic hypergraph and defined the formulation to compare the difference between the two models. Due to a static hypergraph model can be extended to dynamic hypergraphs by applying it on each snapshot and then aggregating the results of the model, and the distinction between an evolving and a temporal network is less important, so we adapt discrete-time formulation in our work. Also, in section 3.1, we deleted the expression about continuous-time models, and focus on the discrete-time models throughout the manuscript.\n\nIn terms of the two challenging toughs, the question we considered is dynamic hypergraph, the hypergraph various over time, which means the neighborhoods of specific node changes along time. For example, in the price prediction task, we can construct a hypergraph based on news on each trading day, and each hyperedge is constructed with the nodes contained in corresponding news. While, the number of nodes various from different news, and the number of news also vary from each day. So, in our work, the first challenging is how to design a proper solution to extract node embeddings from the various nodes in hyperedge and the different numbers of hyperedges connected to the node. Besides, the node embeddings extracted from the hypergraph are the representations on each snapshot, while with the new message comes, new hypergraph generated, and the node embeddings also updated with the newly hypergraph. So, the node embeddings on each snapshot are related to previous information, and the second challenge in our work is how to extract the temporal dependency features into node embeddings for price prediction.\n\nWe have modified the description of the DyHCN, and explained the ambiguity of the model, for instance, the definition of node-hyperedge, \u2018Firstly, inner attention transform node features in hyperedge into the node-hyperedge feature which indicates the aggregated features from node to hyperedge\u2019 etc., so that the manuscript can be read more clearly.\n\nQ2. Section 2. the definition of GCN\n\nA2. We updated the formulation and expression of GCN in section 2. We introduced two typical models of GCN in the spatial domain. In the following research, most models are improved based on these two models, so we introduced these two models in the Preliminary section.\n\nQ3. Section 2. the definition of HCN\n\nA3.  We updated the formulation and expression of HCN in section 2. In terms of model selection, we introduced the latest two solutions that are widely used on hypergraphs. The definition of a hypergraph in section 2 is the preliminary of a static hypergraph, and in section 3.1 the definition is about discrete-time dynamic hypergraph which is the problem we focus on in this manuscript.\n\nQ4. Section 3.1. It is already presented in the introduction\n\nA4.  We modified the part of the introduction and analyzed the pros and cons, and decided to focus on the discrete-time dynamic hypergraph in our work, so we delete this part of the statement.\n\nContinued on the next section."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper760/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper760/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DyHCN: Dynamic Hypergraph Convolutional Networks", "authorids": ["~Nan_Yin1", "zgluo@nudt.edu.cn", "wenjiewang96@gmail.com", "~Fuli_Feng1", "~Xiang_Zhang7"], "authors": ["Nan Yin", "zhigang luo", "wenjie wang", "Fuli Feng", "Xiang Zhang"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Hypergraph Convolutional Network (HCN) has become a default choice for capturing high-order relations among nodes, \\emph{i.e., } encoding the structure of a hypergraph.

The main part of the paper is the description of the proposed system. It is composed of a HCN for computing node embeddings at each time step and a LSTM as the temporal module. Experimental results are provided for dynamic prediction tasks over stock datasets.\n\nThe proposed system seems to be a reasonable choice for solving prediction tasks on dynamic hypergraphs. But, in my opinion, some choices could have been justified and variations of the system could have been compared. The only considered system variation is the aggregation method and the best one is the only one using trainable parameters. Thus I think that there is room for improvement. Also the current version is difficult to read due to many typos, mispellings, repetitions, ... Therefore, in my opinion, the paper is not ready for publication.\n\nDetailed comments.\n\n* Too many typos, mispellings, ... to be given in this review\n\n* Introduction. It could be improved. Formal definitions are not necessary. I am not convinced that the two formulations for the evolution are useful and they are repeated in Section 3.1. The presentation of the system could be improved: the description of the \"two challenging toughs\" is not convincing enough; the description of the DyHCN system is unclear (for instance what is a node-hyperedge ?).\n\n* Section 2. \u00a7GCN. There is a huge recent literature on GNNs. Please give useful links and please explain why you choose to only present some GCNs. The definition is not easy to read.\n\n* Section 2. \u00a7HCN. Also many HNNs models have been proposed. Please justify your choice. The definition is not easy to read. Also definitions of hypergraphs should be coherent (definition in Section 2 wrt definition in section 3.1).\n\n* Section 3.1. It is already presented in the introduction. I am not convinced that the continuous-time presentation is useful because it is not used.\n\n* Section 3. Please introduce what is the meaning of a \"centroid node\"\n\n* Section 4. \u00a7GCN should be updated with recent references.\n\n* Section 5.1. I would like to know why it is useful to model the task with hypergraphs. Why is it important to know for a stock event in which news or which comment it appears?\n\n* Section 5.

Extensive experiments on the Tiigo and Stocktwits datasets show that DyHCN achieves superior performance over existing methods, which implies the effectiveness of capturing the property of dynamic hypergraphs by HC and TE modules.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "yin|dyhcn_dynamic_hypergraph_convolutional_networks", "pdf": "/pdf/23f3e220feb3f887e55275c922b6b84bd8055c70.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=ZHaeYTpStV", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nyin2021dyhcn,\ntitle={Dy{\\{}HCN{\\}}: Dynamic Hypergraph Convolutional Networks},\nauthor={Nan Yin and zhigang luo and wenjie wang and Fuli Feng and Xiang Zhang},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bx05YH2W8bE}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
