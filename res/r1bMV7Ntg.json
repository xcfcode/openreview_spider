Notice that before we cited their NIPS 2016 workshop contribution, which was a poster that essentially covers the contents of their new arxiv submission. Gal et al. 2017 showed that the max entropy acquisition function yields results comparable to more complex acquisition functions. For that reason (and since the Gal et al. NIPS workshop poster was known to us), we selected the max entropy function for the experiments conducted in this paper. \n\nWe furthermore updated the submission to include the random selection baseline as requested: Fig. 1 (right) now shows the performance of a network trained on 74% randomly selected images from the training dataset as a baseline. We show the averaged performance from 10 independent runs (as for all other experiments).\n\nWe hope these revisions make the paper a more valuable contribution."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Episode-Based Active Learning with Bayesian Neural Networks", "abstract": "We investigate different strategies for active learning with Bayesian deep neural networks.

the theme of sequentially retrieving labels is common to most active learning and experimental design papers; performance is typically plotted over the number of samples.\n- no baselines are computed - only the 5 strategies the authors came up with \n- no prior strategies were drawn from the related work\n\nthe authors make a point in the conclusion that their setting doesn't allow to re-observe  samples. but from reading the setup, it seems this is only true for the active learning scheme that is only allowed to pick from the current batch/pool (training is still performed on all selected samples by some strategies). but if this is an important point - the submission fails to highlight it's importance in the experiments. a baseline should be shown - where the active learning is picking from all the whole set. but the suspicion remains that there is not too much of a difference. therefore i would be important to show those numbers.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Episode-Based Active Learning with Bayesian Neural Networks", "abstract": "We investigate different strategies for active learning with Bayesian deep neural networks.
