The proposed model can generate sentences with better likelihood and BLEU on one synthetic and two real datasets.\n\n**Contributions:**\n\nThis work introduces an novel and interesting idea of Feature Statistics Alignment in training GANs. \n\nThe authors follow the convention in this domain, and evaluate the model on three datasets.\n\nThe experiment results show that the proposed model outperforms existing models. However, the authors need to clarify some details to make the results trustworthy (see weakness). \n\n\n**Strong points:**\n\nThe idea is novel and interesting. \n\nThe model and training procedure is clearly explained. Related works are cited well. \n\n\n**Weak points:**\n\nIn Table 2: \n\n- The LSTM model gets NLL lower than the real data. This is a clear evidence of overfitting. \n- In SAL (Zhou et. al, 2020), NLL_{gen} is used to evaluate the diversity of the generator. But this metric is missing here without explanation. \n\nIn Table 3:\n\n- The BLEU metric in this paper is the BLEU(F) metric in SAL (Zhou et. al, 2020). This metric evaluates the generated sentences using the test set as a reference. Thus the BLEU(F) metric cannot show the diversity of examples. \n- The BLEU(B) (Zhou et. al, 2020) metric is missing. BLEU (B) metric evaluates the test set using the generated sentences as a reference, so it can detect mode collapse of a generative model. \n\nIn section 4, although authors clearly cite previous works for experiment settings, I think it\u2019s worthwhile to repeat the definition of each metric, and some other key points in the paper, so that readers can easily understand the notations and jargons in this section. \n\n**Recommendation:**\nReject. \n\nThere\u2019s a major flaw in the evaluation metrics. On both synthetic and real datasets, the evaluation metrics prefers overfitted models, i.e. if the model can remember one example from the training set, and repeat that sentence, it can get a very high score. \n\nI will reconsider my recommendation if (1) I miss interpret the metrics or (2) the authors provide more evidence on the diversity of the generated sentences, for example showing the NLL_{gen} metric on the synthetic dataset, and BLEU(B) metric on real datasets. \n\n**Questions:**\n\nHow is NLL_gen computed?\n\n**After Rebuttal**\nThe author's reply partially resolved my concerns, although the diversity of models has not improved, nor has it significantly decreased. Thus I have increased my score from 3 to 4.

Experimental evaluations on synthetic and real datasets show the effectiveness of the method. ", "review": "\nSummary:\n \nThe paper proposes an improvement to sequence generative adversarial networks (GAN) to cope with the common training issues of GANs. For the sake, the paper combines Gumbel-Softmax based GAN, relativistic discrimination  function with  the matching of mean representations of true and generated samples in a latent feature space. This feature statistics alignment allows to leak information from the discriminator to the generator as the used features are extracted from the discriminator network. Experimental evaluations on synthetic and real datasets show the improvement achieved by the proposed method over existing sequence generation networks.\n\n\n\nReasons for score: \n \nThe paper straightforwardly combines existing procedures (relativistic discriminator, Gumbel-Softmax approximation for categorical distribution, features matching) to improved upon vanilla sequence generation networks and somehow lacks novelty. Although the ablation study is interesting and shows the improvement brought by each module, examples of lengthy generated sequences illustrate that the sentences produced by the GAN are not semantically meaningful. \n \n\nPros:\n- Overall, the paper is well written. In particular, the rationale behind the proposed method is justified. Empirical evaluations support these intuitions and show how they contribute to the observed quality of the generated sequences.  \n- The paper aims at addressing a major issue in training GAN for sequence generation: how to strengthen the learning of the generator compared to the discrimination network which is easier to train? The approach promoted in the paper consists to align the mean statistics of true sequences and fake ones. Specifically, the statistics are computed over features extracted from discrimination network. The objective function of the generator is therefore composed of the usual GAN loss term and the distance between those mean representations. As such, this idea of guiding the generation network with information from the discriminator is interesting and plays a key role in the performances improvement. \n- In the same vein, the use of Gumbel-Softmax distribution (instead of the discrete distribution) and of the relativistic discrimination function (instead of the classical classification function) helps to learn a better generation model. However these ideas are not novel and were investigated separately in previous research works. \n- Experimental evaluations, including both qualitative analysis and quantitative results, are provided in the paper and in the supplementary to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The newly proposed GAN achieve superior performances. The comprehensive ablation study is interesting and helps to understand how each module (feature alignment, Gumbel-Softmax, batch size) contributes to the enhanced performances.\n \nCons: \n- Although the proposed method, according to the empirical results, show improved performances, it lacks novelty as features matching, relativistic discrimination or Gumbel-Softmax are not new ideas. The main contribution resides in the better quantitative results compared to existing sequence generation networks. However when one examines the generated sentences, it appears that they lack semantic meaningfulness especially for long sentences (see for instance Table 8). This shows that the proposed GAN (as well as the competitors) is not effective yet.  \n- Features distribution alignment is an interesting way to measure how close are the marginal distributions of the real and fake sequences. The paper considers the Mean Distance Alignment (MDA) and the Mean Square alignment (MSA) which are respectively the distance and the squared distance between the mean latent representations of the real and generated sequences. Several comments can be made as hereafter.\n     * MSA and MDA encode the same matching up  to a power 2. It\u2019s unclear why they lead to different empirical results.\n     * Instead of matching only the mean statistics, the overall distributions of the latent representations can be aligned by considering metrics such as MMD or Wasserstein distance. How would the results look like in that setting?\n     * It should be clarified earlier in the paper that the used features are extracted from the discrimination network (as the weights between the discriminator and feature extractor are shared). Also the paper should make explicit from which layer of the discrimination network the features are extracted. \n- The findings of human evaluation (see Table 5) are not unequivocal. MSA and MDA achieve higher scores than the real sentences. The best model, the one with MSA, is not preferred because of a lack of diversity and quality. This raises the question of how reliable is the human evaluation score.\n \nOther comments: \n- Page 3, definition of MSA: in the sentence \u201cmean squared difference between the centroids...\u201d, the term mean is over-used as Eq. (2) or (3) represents only the squared distance between centroids.\n- Page 4: in \u201cThe FSA term on the RHS can also be regarded as a dynamic regularizer for the sequence generator\u201d the notion of dynamic regularizer is unclear. In which sense FSA induces a dynamic regularization?\n- In Equation (10) the function \u201cone_hot\u201d should be defined. Also in (10), I think $y_i$ should read the $|V|$-dimensional vector $y$.\n- Equation (11) is to be checked carefully as the parameter $\\tau$ simplifies in numerator and denominator. \n- Algorithm 1: the update of the generator $G_\\theta$ requires a minibatch from real dataset in order to minimize $L_{RG}$ + $L_{FSA}$ as $L_{FSA}$ relies on the mean of real data latent representation.\n\nAfter rebuttal\n-  I read the response of the authors. The spotted typos are fixed in the revision. Some  questions/concerns  have been tentatively. However the novelty in the paper is still not blatant or how the use of distance such as MMD or Wasserstein to match the features is under-explored.

We address your specific questions and comments below:\n\n**Questions**\n\n1.\"The LSTM model gets NLL lower than the real data. This is a clear evidence of overfitting.\"\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the \"real data\" in Table 2 are also generated by an LSTM model as the oracle. We were also surprised that the vanilla LSTM could achieve the lowest NLL score when the generated sentence length is 20. However, it performed not as well as the RMC when generating long sentences (with a length of 40). We guess this is due to the fact that the oracle model of synthetic data is a single layer LSTM, which could result in the **LSTM-biased** phenomenon for short text generation (length 20). As for long sentence generation, since the vanilla LSTM could forget some information with a long-term span, which could lead to the performance drop as reported in Table 2. We show that the RMC performs better than LSTM for generating long sequences.\n\n2.\"NLL_{gen} is missing.\"\n\nYes, NLL_{gen} could be used to measure the diversity of generated sequences. In our experiments, we just use the synthetic data to validate the effectiveness of our method and do not report the NLL_{gen} metric in the submitted version (following SeqGAN, RankGAN, LeakGAN). Instead, we use NLL_{gen} to measure the generation diversity on real datasets, as shown in Table 3. \n For clarity, we have reported the NLL_{gen} scores in Appendix C.1 of the revised version. The NLL_{gen} score of our model is similar to that of baseline models.\n\n3.\"BLEU(F) metric cannot show the diversity of examples\" and \"BLEU(B) (Zhou et. al, 2020) metric is missing\"\n\nYes, BLEU(F) is used to reflect the **quality** of samples, whereas NLL_{gen} is applied to indicate the **diversity** of generated sentences. The adoption of BLEU(F) and NLL_{gen} follows the previous work, such as Texygen(Zhu et al., 2018) and RelGAN (Nie et al., 2019). To answer Reviewer4's question, we report the BLEU(B) as the following table. We found that the proposed method achieves similar results in terms of the diversity compared with SAL (Zhou et al., 2020): on the MS COCO dataset, the BLEU(F) score of our method is a bit lower but got better NLL_{gen}; on EMNLP2017 WMT News dataset, our method achieves slightly better than SAL, but a bit worse on NLL_{gen}. But our method achieves a significant improvement on BLEU(F) metrics.\n\nOn the MS COCO dataset:\n\n|             |   Bleu-2 (B) |   Bleu-3 (B) |   Bleu-4 (B) |   Bleu-5 (B) |  NLL_{gen} |   Bleu-2 (F) |   Bleu-3 (F) |   Bleu-4 (F) |   Bleu-5 (F) |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|  SAL        |  **0.724**       |  **0.503**       |  **0.313**      |  **0.198**       |  0.873     |  0.785       |  0.581       |  0.362       |  0.227       |\n|  Ours (MSA) |  0.700       |  0.404       |  0.206       |  0.123       |  0.760     |  **0.959**       |  **0.866**      |  **0.759**       |  **0.630**       |\n|  Ours (MDA) |  0.712       |  0.413       |  0.209       |  0.121       |  **0.717**    |  0.938       |  0.863       |  0.731       |  0.582       |\n\nOn the EMNLP2017 WMT News dataset:\n\n|             |   Bleu-2 (B) |   Bleu-3 (B) |   Bleu-4 (B) |   Bleu-5 (B) |  NLL_{gen} |   Bleu-2 (F) |   Bleu-3 (F) |   Bleu-4 (F) |   Bleu-5 (F) |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|  SAL        |  0.726       |  0.431       |  0.232       |  0.123       |  **2.578**     |  0.788       |  0.523       |  0.281       |  0.149       |\n|  Ours (MSA) |  0.742       |  **0.480**       |  **0.252**       |  **0.138**       |  3.999     |  **0.932**       |  **0.798**       |  0.585       |  **0.404**      |\n|  Ours (MDA) |  **0.744**       |  0.474       |  **0.252**       |  0.137       |  2.732     |  0.916       |  0.784       |  **0.592**       |  0.386       |\n\n4.\"How is NLL_gen computed?\"\n\nNLL_{gen} computes the neg-log likelihood of reference samples in the test set by the generator, which is adopted by SAL (Zhou et. al. 2020) and RelGAN (Nie et. al. 2019) to measure the diversity of generated samples.

We address your specific questions and comments below:\n\nQuestions:\n\n1.About novelty:\n\n**A short answer**: Different motivation and usage. Our paper aims to mitigate the difficulty of the generator training by providing **additional signals** from the discriminator, whereas conventional feature matching serves as the training objective for both the generator and discriminator in language GANs. The FSA technique empirically achieves superior performance on Gumbel-Softmax GANs without introducing extra training parameters.\n\n**Detailed answer**:\nThe paper proposed an FSA mechanism to improve the Gumbel-Softmax-based GAN's training, and achieves the superior performance compared with previous works. It is indeed that the FSA is a form of feature matching. However, previous language GANs using feature matching directly optimize the feature matching metrics, such as TextGANs, FM-GANs, etc. Instead of directly optimizing the feature matching loss for both the generator and discriminator, we use FSA to align the feature distribution and assist the training of only the generator. Besides, the proposed FSA is used to provide fine-grained learning signals for the generator besides the original (coarse) learning signals of language GANs. The idea of FSA could also be regarded as a resemblance to feature leakage in LeakGAN (Guo et. al. 2018), which leaks the features from the discriminator to the generator. \n\n2.Thank you for pointing out the mistake, it should be \"the lower \u03c4 could discourage exploration and tend to **exploit** during training\".\n\n3.Due to the page limit, we do not include the comparison between generated samples and the proposed method.

We address your specific questions and comments below:\n## Question #1\nWe agree that there are several works in language GANs that employ the temperature annealing in the generator. However, there are only few works, such as RelGAN (Nie et.al. 2019), that leverage Gumbel-Softmax tricks in language GANs on real datasets. By saying \"it is under-explored\", we mean that there remains an open problem on its improvement. Thank you for pointing out this, we have clarified it in the revised paper.\n## Question #2\nThank you for giving the related work of language GANs on dialogue generation. We have added these works on the paper.\n## Question #3\nGood question! Indeed, the Texygen benchmark (Zhu et al., 2018) we followed used Self-Bleu to measure the diversity of generated real sentences. However, it is not feasible to use it as the evaluation metric.\n\n**A short answer**:\n\nThere is a problem when using the official implementation of Self-Bleu, which has been pointed out in previous work (Nie et. al. 2019; Zhou et. al. 2020).\n\n**Detailed answer**:\n\nPrevious work did not use it since there is an issue in the official implementation (https://github.com/geek-ai/Texygen/blob/master/utils/metrics/SelfBleu.py): the generated sentences changed but the reference remained the same during the evaluation process. It is discussed in the appendix of SAL(Zhou et. al. 2020) and the openreivew of RelGAN paper (Nie et. al. 2019). As reported in SAL and RelGAN, our self-BLEU (2-5) scores are also always 1. Thus we do not use the Self-BLEU metric.\n\nFor reference, we copy it here:\n\n'''Note that many previous works use self-BLEU Zhu et al. (2018) as a diversity metric. However, we find that there exists a problem in the official implementation of the self-BLEU metric: Only in the first time of evaluation that the reference and hypothesis come from the same \u201ctest data\u201d (i.e. the set of generated sentences). After that, the hypothesis keeps updated but the reference remains unchanged (due to \u201cis-first=False\u201d), which means hypothesis and reference are not from the same \u201ctest data\u201d anymore, and thus the scores obtained under this implementation are not self-BLEU scores. To this end, we modified the implementation to make sure that the hypothesis and reference are always from the same \u201ctest data\u201d (by simply removing the variables \"self.reference\" and \"self.is-first\") and found that the self-BLEU (2-5) scores are always 1 when evaluating all the models.

We address your specific questions and comments below:\n\nQuestions:\n\n1.\"It lacks novelty as features matching, relativistic discrimination or Gumbel-Softmax are not new ideas.\"\n\n**A short answer**: Different motivation and usage. Our paper aims to mitigate the difficulty of the generator training by providing **additional signals** from the discriminator, whereas conventional feature matching serves as the training objective for both the generator and discriminator in language GANs. The FSA technique empirically achieves superior performance on Gumbel-Softmax GANs without introducing extra training parameters.\n\n**Detailed answer**:\nThe paper proposes the FSA mechanism to improve the Gumbel-Softmax-based GAN's training and achieves superior performance compared with previous works. It is indeed that the FSA is a form of feature matching. However, previous language GANs using feature matching directly optimize the feature matching metrics, such as TextGANs, FM-GANs, etc. Instead of directly optimizing the feature matching loss for both the generator and discriminator, we use FSA to align the feature distribution and assist the training of only the generator. Besides, the proposed FSA is used to provide fine-grained learning signals for the generator besides the original (coarse) learning signals of language GANs. The idea of FSA could also be regarded as a resemblance to feature leakage in LeakGAN (Guo et. al. 2018), which leaks the features from the discriminator to the generator. \n\n2.\" it appears that they lack semantic meaningfulness especially for long sentences (see for instance Table 8)\"\n\nYes, there may be some unmeaningful sentences in the randomly generated samples, which is common in most language GANs because it is difficult for generating long sentenced. We resampled the generated samples with the model of the best quality. Please see Table 10 in Appendix E.2.\n\n3.\"MSA and MDA encode the same matching up to a power 2. It\u2019s unclear why they lead to different empirical results.\"\n\nWe empirically find that MSA prefers to generate longer sentences but may fall into the mode dropping. We guess this is because of the gradient difference between MDA and MSA. For MDA, the gradient of an absolute value is $\\pm 1$, which is a bit difficult to converge to the local optimum. In contrast, the gradient of MSA has a more flexible range of values: it gets smaller when the predicted loss becomes smaller, pushing it faster to converge to the local minimum. As a result, the convergence on the local minimum may not perform very well on diversity.\n\n4.\"Using MMD or Wasserstein distance\"\n\nGood point! It is a great idea to investigate whether feature matching metrics can be beneficial when substituting FSA. Our initial idea is to align the lower-degree statistics of feature representations. The exploration of unified feature matching methods can be left for future work.\n\n5.\"It should be clarified earlier in the paper that the used features are extracted from the discrimination network (as the weights between the discriminator and feature extractor are shared)\"\n\nWe moved this part to Sec. 3.1.\n\n6.\"Which layer of the discrimination network the features are extracted\"\nAs in Sec. 3.2, we denote H(.) as the non-transformed layer before the non-linearity. Thus the feature extractor H(.) is the last layer before the activation function. We have made it more clear in Sec. 3.2,\n\n7.\"Question of how reliable is the human evaluation score\"\n\nHuman evaluation is used to measure the quality (i.e., acceptance, grammaticality) rather than the diversity. We perturbed the sentences and anonymized the model's identity before the evaluation. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3452/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3452/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving Sequence Generative Adversarial Networks with Feature Statistics Alignment", "authorids": ["~Yekun_Chai1", "~Qiyue_Yin1", "~Junge_Zhang1"], "authors": ["Yekun Chai", "Qiyue Yin", "Junge Zhang"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are facing great challenges in synthesizing sequences of discrete elements, such as mode dropping and unstable training.

It is evaluated on synthetic and real datasets, and it significantly outperforms the baselines. It also outperforms baselines on human evaluation based on the acceptance, grammaticality, and meaningfulness of the generated sentences. \n\nStrengths:\n\nThe proposed approach is very effective, as demonstrated by significant performance improvements in the experiments across synthetic and real datasets. Also, it can generate better sentences compared to the baselines, as shown by human evaluation.\n\nWeakness:\n\nAlthough the proposed model is thoroughly evaluated and empirically effective, it is not very different from existing methods, except for FSA. The application of FSA in this context might be novel; however, the proposed approach seems to be a simple combination of two existing approaches.

The binary classifier in the discriminator may limit the capacity of learning signals and thus hinder the advance of adversarial training. To address such issues, apart from the binary classification feedback, we harness a Feature Statistics Alignment (FSA) paradigm to deliver fine-grained signals in the latent high-dimensional representation space. Specifically, FSA forces the mean statistics of the fake data distribution to approach that of real data as close as possible in a finite-dimensional feature space. Experiments on synthetic and real benchmark datasets show the superior performance in quantitative evaluation and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to discrete sequence generation. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed architecture is the first that employs feature alignment regularization in the Gumbel-Softmax based GAN framework for sequence generation.
