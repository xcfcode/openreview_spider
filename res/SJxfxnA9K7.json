At the moment, the paper simply recommends to incrementally fuse the generator's features into the conditional discriminator, instead of concatenating output & condition at the front.

The standard setup would simply concatenate the \"condition\" image with the \"output\" image (i.e., the real image, or the generator's output corresponding to the condition). The setup here is to feed these two images to two separate encoders, and gradually fuse the features produced by the two. The experiments show that this delivers superior performance to concatenation, on three image-to-image translation tasks.\n\nI think this is a good idea, but it's a very small contribution. The entire technical approach can be summarized in 2-3 sentences, and it is not particularly novel. Two-stream models and skip connections have been discussed and explored in hundreds of papers. Applying these insights to a discriminator is not a significant leap. \n\nThe theoretical \"motivation\" equations in Sec. 3.1 are obvious and could be skipped entirely. \n\nIn summary, the paper makes sense, but it does not present substantively new ideas.

Different to the conventional approach of concatenating the conditioning information to the input, the authors propose to process them separately with two distinct convolutional networks fusing (by element-wise addition) intermediate features of the conditioning branch into the input branch at each layer.\n\nPros:\n+ The writing is mostly clear and easy to follow.\n+ I feel that exploring better conditioning strategies is an important direction. Quite often the discriminator discards additional inputs if no special measures against this behaviour are taken.\n+ The proposed method seem to outperform the baselines\n\nCons:\n- I\u2019m generally not excited about the architecture as it seems a slight variation of the existing methods. See, for example, the PixelCNN paper [van den Oord et al., 2016] and FiLM [Perez et al., 2017].\n- Theoretical justification of the approach is quite weak. The paper shows that the proposed fusion method may result in higher activation values (in case of the ReLU non-linearity, other cases are not considered at all) but this is not linked properly to the performance of the entire system. Paragraph 3 of section 3.1 (sentence 3 and onward) seems to contain a theoretical claim which is never proved.\n- It seems that the authors never compare their results with the state-of-the-art. The narrative would be much more convincing if the proposed way of conditioning yielded superior performance compared to the existing systems. From the paper it\u2019s not clear how bad/good the baselines are.\n\nNotes/questions:\n* Section 3.1, paragraph 1: Needs to be rephrased. It\u2019s not totally clear what the authors mean here.\n* Section 3.1, paragraph 4: \u201cWe observed that the fusion \u2026\u201d -  Could you elaborate on this? I think you should give a more detailed explanation with examples because it\u2019s hard to guess what those \u201cimportant features\u201d are by looking at the figure.\n* Figure 4: I would really want to see the result of the projection discriminator as it seems to be quite strong according to the tables. The second row of last column (which is the result of the proposed system) suspiciously resembles the ground-truth - is it a mistake?\n* Figure 5: It seems that all the experiments have not been run until convergence. I\u2019m wondering if the difference in performance is going to be as significant when the model are trained fully.\n\nIn my opinion, the proposed method is neither sufficiently novel nor justified properly. On top of that, the experimental section is not particularly convincing. Therefore, I would not recommend the paper in its present form for acceptance.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1057/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Structured Prediction using cGANs with Fusion Discriminator", "abstract": "We propose a novel method for incorporating conditional information into a generative adversarial network (GAN) for structured prediction tasks.
