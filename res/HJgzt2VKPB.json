CATER videos are rendered at 320x240px (updated in the paper) to be comparable to existing benchmarks, so standard baselines can be applied directly without significant redesign. 64 frames were the maximum we were able to fit in the GPU memory (at the extreme batch size of 1 per 12GB GPU), so scaling the number of frames beyond that was not possible given our current GPU resources. While reducing the frame size to fit all 300 frames might be possible, it would require redesigning and tuning the network architectures for the baselines since many hyper-parameters (kernel sizes, number of layers etc) would change for the super low resolution videos. Perhaps more importantly,  we believe our analysis suggests that in order to enable truly long-term temporal reasoning, one should rely on representations that more efficiently maintain stateful memory, such as recurrent networks / LSTMs.  \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper69/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper69/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CATER: A diagnostic dataset for Compositional Actions & TEmporal Reasoning", "authors": ["Rohit Girdhar", "Deva Ramanan"], "authorids": ["rgirdhar@cs.cmu.edu", "deva@cs.cmu.edu"], "keywords": ["Video Understanding", "Temporal Reasoning"], "TL;DR": "We propose a new video understanding benchmark, with tasks that by-design require temporal reasoning to be solved, unlike most existing video datasets.", "abstract": "Computer vision has undergone a dramatic revolution in performance, driven in large part through deep features trained on large-scale supervised datasets.

While the motivation for such datasets is also long-term spatiotemporal reasoning, it is typically hard to implement them in an unbiased manner. As a recent study from ICCV\u201919 showed (https://bhavanj.github.io/MovieQAWithoutMovies/), it is possible to outperform all previous video QA methods on the MovieQA benchmark without actually looking at the videos (simply by looking at the question and answer choices). One reason for this is that a language/QA interface adds additional complexity and opportunities for linguistic biases to creep into the task. While SVQA takes an important step towards controlling these biases through synthetic videos, our goal with CATER is to primarily focus on the video understanding problem, and hence we design it with a simple classification task. That being said, CATER provides the full ground truth state of the world at each time instant, and so can be used to generate QA pairs either automatically (akin to CLEVR or SVQA) or by humans. Such a QA interface will also enable testing of video-QA baselines as suggested, since those are typically designed for jointly modeling linguistic and visual elements. We leave a full exploration of such a QA interface to future work, however we have added these datasets and comparison to Table 1 in the revised paper.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper69/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper69/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CATER: A diagnostic dataset for Compositional Actions & TEmporal Reasoning", "authors": ["Rohit Girdhar", "Deva Ramanan"], "authorids": ["rgirdhar@cs.cmu.edu", "deva@cs.cmu.edu"], "keywords": ["Video Understanding", "Temporal Reasoning"], "TL;DR": "We propose a new video understanding benchmark, with tasks that by-design require temporal reasoning to be solved, unlike most existing video datasets.", "abstract": "Computer vision has undergone a dramatic revolution in performance, driven in large part through deep features trained on large-scale supervised datasets.

The new dataset is the first to account for all of the following fundamental aspect of videos: temporal ordering, short- and long term reasoning, and control for scene biases. Due to the inherent biases in available action recognition datasets, models that simply averages video frames do nearly as well as models that take temporal dependencies into account. In contrast, the authors show that with the proposed dataset, models without spatiotemporal reasoning largely fail.\n\nThe paper should be accepted as it addresses a major shortcoming of all existing video understanding datasets. It does a good job at summarizing the deficiencies in existing datasets, clearly motivating the need for a new dataset. The claims are backed up with solid experiments, ablating models and data parameters adequately. It is mostly well-written (except for section 4 which would benefit from extensive proofreading) and does a good job at covering relevant work. One drawback is of course the synthetic nature and limited domain of objects and actions. On the other hand, this makes the setup highly controllable and reliable. I like the fact that each task comes both with both static and moving camera.\n\nImprovements and Questions:\nSome relevant datasets are missing. For example, the Moving MNIST and Robot Pushing datasets could be added to Table 1.\n\nI suggest having a train / validation / test split (like CLEVR), rather than just a train and validation split.\n\nIn particular for Task 3 more frames seem to give dramatic improvement. Why did you not run with more than 64 frames? \n\nDid you consider downsampling the videos to allow running on all the frames?\n\nI\u2019m missing details on the resolution of the generated videos?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper69/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper69/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CATER: A diagnostic dataset for Compositional Actions & TEmporal Reasoning", "authors": ["Rohit Girdhar", "Deva Ramanan"], "authorids": ["rgirdhar@cs.cmu.edu", "deva@cs.cmu.edu"], "keywords": ["Video Understanding", "Temporal Reasoning"], "TL;DR": "We propose a new video understanding benchmark, with tasks that by-design require temporal reasoning to be solved, unlike most existing video datasets.", "abstract": "Computer vision has undergone a dramatic revolution in performance, driven in large part through deep features trained on large-scale supervised datasets.

The dataset is an extension of CLEVR using simple motions of primitive 3D objects to produce videos of primitive actions (e.g. pick and place a cube), compositional actions (e.g. \"cone is rotated during the sliding of the sphere\"), and finally a 3D object localization tasks (i.e. where is the \"snitch\" object at the end of the video).  The construction of the dataset focuses on demonstrating that compositional action classification and long-term temporal reasoning for action understanding and localization in videos are largely unsolved problems, and that frame aggregation-based methods on real video data in prior work datasets, have found relative success not because the tasks are easy but because of dataset bias issues.\n\nA variety of models from recent work are evaluated on the three proposed tasks, demonstrating the validity of the above motivation for the construction of the dataset.  The primitive action classification task is \"solved\" by nearly all methods and only serves for debugging purposes.  The compositional action classification task is harder and shows that incorporating LSTMs for temporal reasoning leads to non-trivial performance improvements over frame averaging.  Finally, the localization task is challenging, especially when camera motion is introduced, with much space for improvement left for future work.\n\nI am positive with respect to acceptance of this paper.  It is a well-argued, thoughtful dataset contribution that sets up a reasonable video understanding dataset.  The authors recognize that since the dataset is synthetically generated it is not necessarily predictive of how methods would perform with real-world data, but still it can serve a useful and complementary role similar to the one CLEVR has served in image understanding.\n\nI have a few minor comments / questions / editing notes that would be good to address:\n- The random baseline isn't described in the main text, it would be good to briefly mention it (this will also help to clarify why the value is particularly high for tasks 1 and 2)\n- The grid resolution ablation results presented in the supplement are actually quite important -- they demonstrate that with a small increase in granularity of the grid the traditional tracking methods begin to be the best performers.

The authors argue that since current video datasets are heavily biased over static scenes and object structures, it is unclear whether modern spatial-temporal video models can learn to reason over temporal dimension. In order to address this problem, they design this fully observable synthetic dataset which is built upon CLEVER, along with three tasks that are customized for temporal understanding. They further conduct a variety of experiments to benchmark state-of-the-art video understanding models and show how those models more or less struggle on temporal reasoning. \n\nOverall this paper is well-written and easy to follow. The problem is well-motivated, and the claims are mostly supported. The diagnosis in this paper provides useful insights that could be contributive to both vision and learning communities. \n\nMy primary concern is to what extent can the new dataset (CATER) add to existing video datasets that are also explicitly designed for long term spatial-temporal reasoning, such as video VQA datasets TGIF-QA[1]/SVQA[2]. In addition to the comparison between CATER and three action recognition datasets (Kinetics/UCF101/HMDB51) as presented in Table 3., it would be more interesting to see how video understanding models that are specifically designed for those video VQA datasets will perform on CATER. \n\n[1] Yunseok Jang, Yale Song, Youngjae Yu, Youngjin Kim, and Gunhee Kim.

However, much of these improvements have focused on static image analysis; video understanding has seen rather modest improvements. Even though new datasets and spatiotemporal models have been proposed, simple frame-by-frame classification methods often still remain competitive. We posit that current video datasets are plagued with implicit biases over scene and object structure that can dwarf variations in temporal structure. In this work, we build a video dataset with fully observable and controllable object and scene bias, and which truly requires spatiotemporal understanding in order to be solved. Our dataset, named CATER, is rendered synthetically using a library of standard 3D objects, and tests the ability to recognize compositions of object movements that require long-term reasoning. In addition to being a challenging dataset, CATER also provides a plethora of diagnostic tools to analyze modern spatiotemporal video architectures by being completely observable and controllable. Using CATER, we provide insights into some of the most recent state of the art deep video architectures.", "pdf": "/pdf/e7991931c9ae42f5da1f8359a26e59c14a195139.pdf", "paperhash": "girdhar|cater_a_diagnostic_dataset_for_compositional_actions_temporal_reasoning", "code": "http://rohitgirdhar.github.io/CATER", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nGirdhar2020CATER:,\ntitle={CATER: A diagnostic dataset for Compositional Actions & TEmporal Reasoning},\nauthor={Rohit Girdhar and Deva Ramanan},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgzt2VKPB}\n}", "full_presentation_video": "", "original_pdf": "/attachment/19c5eea3b77d255aa5312e5e3923074f8e7bafc7.pdf", "appendix": "", "poster": "", "spotlight_video": "", "slides": ""}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
