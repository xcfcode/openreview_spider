Is it somehow derived from this Runge-Kutta method (I'm not familiar with it)? \n\t- I don't understand what this t^th order time-derivative amounts to in practice. A major claim (in Table 4) is that LSTMs are time-order 2 whereas QUNNs are time-order L and the implication is that this means LSTMs are worse at modeling long term structure than QUNNs ; but how does that actually relate to practical ability to model long-term dependencies? It certainly doesn't seem correct to me to say that LSTMs can only memorize sequences of length 2, so I don't know why we should care about this time-derivative order.\n\t- I thought this section was poorly written. The notation was poorly chosen at times, e.g. the t_k notation and the fact that some $l$ have subscripts and some don't. There were also some severe typos, e.g. I think Claim 1 should be \"L-2-ORNN\". Furthermore, there were crucially omitted definitions: what is reversibility and why should we care? Relatedly, the \"proofs\" are extremely hand-wavy and just cite unexplained methods with no further information.\n\nQUNNs\n\t- The practical difference between QUNNs and LSTMs seems to be that the weights of the QUNN are dynamic within a single forward prop of the network, whereas LSTM weights are fixed given a single run (although the author does admit that the forget gates adds some element of dynamism, but there's no concrete evidence to draw conclusions about differences in practice).\n\t- I don't understand the repeated claim that LSTMs don't depend on the data; aren't the weights learned from data?\n\t\nThere may be something interesting in this paper, but it's not clear to me in its current incarnation and I'm not convinced that an eight-page conference paper is the right venue for such a work. There's a substantial of amount of exposition that needs to be there and is currently missing. I suspect the author knows this, but due to space constraints had to omit a lot of definitions and explanations.\n\nI don't think all papers need experiments, but this paper I think would have greatly benefited from one. Community knowledge of LSTMs has reached a point where they are in practice easy to train and fairly stable (though admittedly with a lot of tricks). It would have been much more convincing to have simple examples where LSTMs fail due to instability and QUNNs succeed. Similarly, regarding long-term dependencies, my sense is that LSTMs are able to model some long-term dependencies. Experimental evidence of the gains offered by QUNNs would have also been very convincing.\n\nNote: It looks like there's some funkiness in the tables on page 8 to fit into the page limit.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper825/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unification of  Recurrent   Neural Network Architectures and Quantum Inspired Stable Design ", "abstract": "Various architectural advancements in the design of recurrent neural networks~(RNN) have been focusing on improving the empirical stability and representability by sacrificing the complexity of the architecture.

They show that typical RNN architectures can be described as members of the ORNN family. They then make the connection that quantum mechanical systems can be described as following the Schrodinger equation which can be cast as a series of coupled 1st order ODEs of the evolution of wavefunctions under an influencing Hamiltonian. They then claim that these discretized equations can be represented by a RNN similar to a unitary RNN. They go on to outline a RNN structure inspired by this insight that has time-dependent activations to increase the scale of temporal dependence. \n\nThe main challenge of this paper is that it does not present or support its arguments in a clear fashion, making it difficult to judge the merit of the claims. Given the nuance required for their arguments, a more robust Background section in the front that contextualizes the current work in terms of machine learning nomenclature and prior work could dramatically improve reader comprehension. Also, while the parallels to quantum mechanics are intriguing, given that the paper is arguing for their relevance to machine learning, using standard linear algebra notation would improve over the unnecessary obfuscation of Dirac notation for this audience. While I'm not an expert in quantum mechanics, I am somewhat proficient with it and very familiar with RNNs, and despite this, I found the arguments in this paper very hard to decipher. I don't think this is a necessity of the material, as the URNN paper (http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/arjovsky16.pdf) describes very similar concepts with a much clearer presentation and background. \n\nFurther, despite claims of practical benefits of their proposed RNN structure, (reduced parameter counts required to achieve a given temporal correlation), no investigations or analyses (even basic ones) are performed to try and support the claim. For example, the proposed scheme requires a time varying weight matrix, which naively implemented would dramatically grow the parameter count over a standard LSTM. I can understand if the authors prefer to keep the paper strictly a theory paper, but even the main proof in Theorem 4 is not developed in detail and is simply stated with reference to the URNN paper. \n\nThere are some minor mistakes as well including a reference to a missing Appendix A in Theorem 3, \"Update rule of Eq. (15)-(15)\", \"stble regime\". Finally, as a nit, the claim of \"Universal computing\" in the name, while technically true like other neural networks asymptotically, does not seem particularly unique to the proposed RNN over others, and doesn't provide much information about the actual proposed network structure, vs. say \"Quantum inspired Time-dependent RNN\".", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper825/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unification of  Recurrent   Neural Network Architectures and Quantum Inspired Stable Design ", "abstract": "Various architectural advancements in the design of recurrent neural networks~(RNN) have been focusing on improving the empirical stability and representability by sacrificing the complexity of the architecture.

First, we define a family of  deep recurrent neural networks,  $n$-$t$-ORNN, according to the order of nonlinearity $n$ and the range of temporal memory scale $t$ in their underlying dynamics embodied in the form of discretized ordinary differential equations.
