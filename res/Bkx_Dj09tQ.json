Here we would like to comment on your concerns.\n\n- it's a stretch to generalize this to conclusions concerning functional importance in neuroscience.\n\nResponse: we stated the 2nd argument by regarding DNN as a model of the visual cortex in terms of the hierarchical feature representations (as we said in the introduction part). Although DNN and the visual cortex are of course not the same, the feasibility of this modelling is supported by the following points:\n1. Both DNN and the visual cortex can recognize objects (of course, the performance is different, but the essential function is basically similar)\n2. DNN and the visual cortex have similar hierarchical representations at \u00b5m~mm resolution (Yamins et al., 2014; Khaligh-Razavi & Kriegeskorte, 2014; Cadieu et al., 2014; Guclu & van Gerven, 2015; Horikawa & Kamitani, 2017).\n\n\n- it would be surprising if there were vestigial features in the network that are learned but play no important role - especially among early layers. \n\nResponse: we agree with you that those features that are learned but are not important are interesting per se. However, our main interest here is on how DNN can recognize objects (e.g., what feature representations are necessary for the high performance?). To answer this question scientifically, we should investigate the functionally important features, rather than the unimportant features.

This is a positive. In general comments, the authors state as important contributions: \n\n\"1) to the debate on the harmfulness/importance of selectively activated units in DNNs [1-3] by presenting concrete examples where selectivity is important for generalization, and 2) to the neuroscience community, where, although orientation selectivity has been extensively analyzed for these 60 years since [4], its functional importance in a natural environment has remained unanswered.\"\n\nOn point 2, while this provides an example of an artificial network where orientation plays an important role, it's a stretch to generalize this to conclusions concerning functional importance in neuroscience.\n\nOne point 1, I agree that this paper takes steps in the right direction, but ultimately the overall conclusions still feel as though they are a natural and implied consequence of limiting orientation selectivity. It is noted that  orientation selectivity is \"not just a superficial byproduct of object recognition, but is causally indispensable for object recognition\". The idea that selectivity for oriented edges is indispensible for object recognition again is a conclusion that feels as though it would be shocking if this were not true. The notion of it being a superficial byproduct of object recognition presupposes that the purpose of the system is to recognize objects. Again, it would be surprising if there were vestigial features in the network that are learned, but play no important role - especially among early layers. \n\nI think the paper might be strengthened by re-working this second point to more strongly establish the causality the authors claim. \n\nORIGINAL COMMENTS:\nThis paper presents interesting analysis and an ablation study on orientation selectivity in neural networks. This is analyzed with respect to generalization performance in decisions made. Overall, the paper is well written and interesting. However, I have a number of comments / concerns as described below:\n\nPositives:\n- The paper presents an in depth analysis of the role of orientation selectivity in neural hierarchies. This style of analysis is sorely lacking and fits the theme of learning representations\n- The paper itself is well written and quite polished\n- The authors have taken great care to rule out any possible confounds through experiments that are not identical to the main claims or objective (specifically the study of section 3.3)\n\nTo address:\n- The only concern I have (and it is somewhat significant), is the notion of \"generalization\". This is a rather loaded term, and it is not clear on cursory inspection where this generalization comes from. Is it a function of invariance among higher layers to scene geometry? What are the fundamental underpinnings of these observations outside of correlation to orientation selectivity.\n- It seems almost a tautology that removing orientation selectivity would impair performance. I would be more satisfied, and render a higher rating if I felt there was a \"smoking gun\" with respect to evidence. The conclusion is convincing, but the reasoning comes across as somewhat vague. With that said, it is also understood that this is a non-trivial matter to address and perhaps this paper is an important first step.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper276/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Causal importance of orientation selectivity for generalization in image recognition", "abstract": "Although both our brain and deep neural networks (DNNs) can perform high-level sensory-perception tasks such as image or speech recognition, the inner mechanism of these hierarchical information-processing systems is poorly understood in both neuroscience and machine learning.

The authors failed to address my clearly articulated request for a more thorough analysis of additional networks trained on ImageNet (e.g. ResNet), which I don't think is asking for too much given a discussion period of three weeks.\n\n\nSummary:\nThe authors find that (1) DNNs exhibit orientation selectivity in many of their hidden layers' units, (2) in the intermediate layers this selectivity emerges during training, concurrently with the network's ability to generalize, and (3) ablating orientation-selective units in the early layers impairs a network's generalization performance. \n\nStrengths:\n+ Very straightforward and easy to follow \n+ Technically sound\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Feels trivial\n- The claims seem to be too general\n\nConclusion:\nI'm torn on the paper. On the one hand, it reports some potentially interesting observations (e.g. trajectory of emergence of orientation selectivity over training). On the other hand, I'm not really sure what we learn from the paper.\n\n\nSpecific comments:\n\n- The result seems trivial. How should a network be able to recognize objects without detecting edges of certain orientation (which implies orientation selectivity)?\n\n- Related to the previous point, pretty much every single (supervised or unsupervised) learning objective investigated so far has produced orientation selectivity, so it seems pretty well established that orientation selectivity is somehow useful. The interesting question is what needs to be done on top of it in order to get a representation useful for object recognition, but in this respect the paper does not contribute anything.\n\n- The results are mostly on CIFAR-10 and only one network (VGG-16) trained on ImageNet is considered. Given the generality of the claims (\"orientation selectivity [plays] a causally important role in object recognition\" \u2013 abstract), the authors would have to show that their results also hold for other high-performing networks on ImageNet, and not just VGG-16 (sort of, see next point). Otherwise, an appropriate conclusion would be that orientation selectivity plays a causal role in the functioning of VGG-16 and some networks trained on CIFAR-10.\n\n- The analysis meant to establish causality (section 3.4) produces pretty mixed results on VGG-16 (Fig. A6b), where ablating the top 50% orientation-selective units in some layers has a *smaller* effect than ablating the rest.

This is a rather loaded term, and it is not clear on cursory inspection where this generalization comes from. Is it a function of invariance among higher layers to scene geometry? What are the fundamental underpinnings of these observations outside of correlation to orientation selectivity.\n- It seems almost a tautology that removing orientation selectivity would impair performance. I would be more satisfied, and render a higher rating if I felt there was a \"smoking gun\" with respect to evidence. The conclusion is convincing, but the reasoning comes across as somewhat vague. With that said, it is also understood that this is a non-trivial matter to address and perhaps this paper is an important first step.\n\nResponse: First, we would like to reconfirm our new findings (these are inserted in the first paragraph of the discussion section):\n1) Orientation selectivity is not just a superficial byproduct of object recognition, but is causally indispensable for object recognition.\n2) Orientation selectivity is not necessary for the memorization (see also Fig. 4c), but is important for the generalization of the image-class relationships, at least by introducing shift-invariance of the fully connected layer.\n\nWe totally agree with the reviewer in that \u201corientation selectivity in the lower layers\u201d and \u201cthe overall generalization\u201d are distant phenomena. We thus performed an additional analysis to connect these two concepts more closely in the new section 3.5, which is based on the reviewer\u2019s question on the invariance in the higher layers. In summary, we compared the shift-invariance of the higher layers between an ordinary network and a network where orientation-selective units of Conv 2 or Conv 3 were ablated, finding that \u201cunits in the fully connected layer of the ablated network had significantly higher (shift-)variances than those of the vanilla network\u201d (Fig. 6).

How should a network be able to recognize objects without detecting edges of certain orientation (which implies orientation selectivity)?\n - Related to the previous point, pretty much every single (supervised or unsupervised) learning objective investigated so far has produced orientation selectivity, so it seems pretty well established that orientation selectivity is somehow useful. The interesting question is what needs to be done on top of it in order to get a representation useful for object recognition, but in this respect the paper does not contribute anything.\n\nResponse: Indeed, some papers have already revealed the existence of Gabor feature representations in the early layers of DNNs [1-2]. However, ours is the first study that quantitatively compares the orientation selectivity among different layers and shows that orientation selectivity is a correlate and a cause of the generalization performance, which, we believe, elicited positive comments like \u201cThis paper presents interesting analysis\u201d (reviewer #2) and \u201cThe authors tackle a very interesting problem that seems to have not received yet enough attention\u201d (reviewer #3) from other reviewers.\n\nIn addition, we are confident that the framework we used (investigation of the correlation between the unit selectivity and generalization and the causality by ablation experiments) will generally be useful for analyzing the higher feature representations in future studies. \n\n- The results are mostly on CIFAR-10 and only one network (VGG-16) trained on ImageNet is considered. Given the generality of the claims (\"orientation selectivity [plays] a causally important role in object recognition\" \u2013 abstract), the authors would have to show that their results also hold for other high-performing networks on ImageNet, and not just VGG-16 (sort of, see next point). Otherwise, an appropriate conclusion would be that orientation selectivity plays a causal role in the functioning of VGG-16 and some networks trained on CIFAR-10.\n\nResponse: In this study we analyzed networks that were trained with different initializations or different training datasets, which, on the other hand, reviewer #3 appreciated as \u201creproducibility.\u201d Considering other empirical papers in ICLR (e.g. [3-4]), comparing three networks with different initializations or different training datasets to check the generality of the findings is sufficient.\n\n- The analysis meant to establish causality (section 3.4) produces pretty mixed results on VGG-16 (Fig. A6b), where ablating the top 50% orientation-selective units in some layers has a *smaller* effect than ablating the rest. How do the authors explain this result?\n\nResponse: In section 3.4, we showed that ablating orientation-selective units in the several early layers of VGG-16 (block1_conv2, block1_pool, and block2_conv1) significantly dropped the performance, which is consistent with the CIFAR-10 cases. In higher layers of VGG-16 (e.g., block2_conv2) where ablating units with the top 50% gOSI had a smaller impact than ablating units with the bottom 50% gOSI, the represented features critical for the generalization should not be orientations but something else. Thus, when we ablate units with the bottom 50% gOSI in these layers, we might disrupt those features, causing performance impairment.\n\n\n[1] Dumitru Erhan, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville, and Pascal Vincent.
