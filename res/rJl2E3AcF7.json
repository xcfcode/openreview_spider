We have revised our article based on reviewers' suggestions. \nWe want to summarize the key points of this work as follows:\n\n* Our work focuses on speeding up softmax inference given large output dimension and achieved good empirical results on both synthetic and real dataset. For top-k language modeling task on Wiki-2, we can achieve more than 23x without any loss of performance.\n\n* Our method is novel in terms of constructing the two-level overlapping hierarchy of output classes. The hierarchy is captured through the mixture model and group lasso technique. The inference speedup is achieved by such a hierarchy. \n\n* The key difference between our work and existing methods is that our speedup is achieved by learning a new output embedding while most existing methods relied on approximating the trained/fixed embedding. This means our method is orthogonal with them in principle. One key advantage of our method is speedup without any loss while approximation based methods usually suffer the loss of performance.

We have revised our writing in the revision, and will further improve its clarity. Please find our response as follows.\n\n- Algorithm 1 does not include mitosis, which may have an effect on the resulting approximation. \n\nMitosis training can be considered as executing Algorithm 1 for multiple times with an increasing number of experts and inherited initialization from last round by changing W^e and W^g. Also, training with mitosis achieves similar performance as training without it shown in Appendix B, Figure (a). \n\n- How are the lambda and threshold parameters tuned? The authors mention a validation set, are they just exhaustively explored on a 3D grid on the validation set? \n\nThe hyper-parameters related to DS-softmax (such as lambda) are tuned according to the performance on a validation dataset. Also, as we mentioned in the paper, only one hyper-parameter (group lasso lambda) needs to be tuned. The heuristic we use to tune group lasso lambda is to increase lambda, starting from a small value, until it hurts the performance. Also threshold and balancing lambda variables are kept fixed as (0.01 and 10). \n\n- Why would it be expected to be faster than all the other alternatives? Wouldn't similar alternatives like the sparsely gated MoE, D-softmax and adaptive-softmax have chances of being faster? \n\nIn terms of baselines, SVD-softmax (NIPS\u201917) was chosen since it is a recent method that provides a significant inference speedup for softmax. Other alternatives, such as D-softmax and adaptive-softmax, focus on training instead of inference speedup. Furthermore, as claimed in their papers, they achieve limited speedup (around 5x) in language modeling, which is much worse than ours. With regards to Sparsely Gated MoE, it cannot speed up inference, since they select expert with full softmax.\n\nWe would like to emphasize that most existing methods for inference speedup focus on approximating trained softmax layer, which usually suffers a loss on performance. Our model allows the adaptive adjustment of the softmax layer, achieves speedup through capturing the two-level overlapped hierarchy during training, which is novel and does not suffer from the performance loss.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1485/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1485/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1485/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Doubly Sparse: Sparse Mixture of Sparse Experts for Efficient Softmax Inference", "abstract": "Computations for the softmax function in neural network models are expensive when the number of output classes is large.

We have addressed typos in the revision accordingly.  And please find our response as follows.\n\n-  Can you be more specific about the gains in training versus inference time?\n\nWe would like to emphasize that the our goal is to speed up the inference time for softmax, so we do not include any comparisons in terms of training time. According to our experiments, most speedup can be achieved in few epochs (given all other layers are pre-trained) so that the training time increase is not significant compared to the original one.\n\n- You motivate some of the work by the fact that the experts have overlapping outputs. Maybe in section 3.7 you can address how often that occurs as well? \n\nThanks for the suggestion. We demonstrate that ambiguous words are often overlapped between clusters as illustrated in Figure 3(b). We added one more Figure in Appendix B, Figure (b), to demonstrate the distribution of overlapping. \n\n- It wasn't clear how the sparsity percentage on page 3 was defined? \n\nSorry for the possible confusion. The sparsity in page 3 means the percentage of pruned words. We have added more clarifications in the revised version. \n\n- Can you motivate why you are not using perplexity in section 3.2?\n\nWe use top-k accuracy, instead of perplexity, because approximating top-k is required for most inference tasks in practice (see [1]). Perplexity captures the normalized log-likelihood of all possible words, while top-k accuracy is a better measure for inference speedup for top-k retrieval. For example, in some extreme cases, if a word only has a very small probability which makes it unpredictable at all (i.e. couldn\u2019t be retrieved by top-k for any reasonably small k), it could still have a huge impact in terms of perplexity, but has a much smaller impact on top-k accuracy, which seems more reasonable given the goal of top-k retrieval.\n\n[1] Asymmetric LSH (ALSH) for Sublinear Time Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS), NIPS 2014"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1485/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1485/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1485/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Doubly Sparse: Sparse Mixture of Sparse Experts for Efficient Softmax Inference", "abstract": "Computations for the softmax function in neural network models are expensive when the number of output classes is large.

It was designed to increase the model expressiveness. It cannot achieve speedup because each expert still contains full softmax space as we mentioned in the background section (page 2 line 21st) and method section (page 2 last 4th line). And since it is slower than the standard softmax by definition, we chose not to compare with it in the paper.\n\nOur algorithm addresses speed up in softmax inference. This is fundamentally different from Sparse-gated MoE. We divide the output space into multiple overlapped subsets. To find top-k predictions, we only search a few subsets. While in full softmax or MoE, the complexity is linear with output dimension. Therefore, we did not include a comparison with Sparsely-Gated MoE in our article and only compare with full softmax. \n\nJust for additional reference, we tested Sparsely-Gated MoE with different experts in PTB dataset; we compared the results to DS-Softmax. As expected, the Sparsely-Gated MoE does not achieve speedup in terms of softmax inference. \n\n______________________________________________\nMethod | Top 1 | Top 5 |Top 10| FLOPs| \nDS-8       | 0.257 | 0.448 | 0.530 | 2.84x |\nMoE-8    | 0.258 | 0.448 | 0.530 |  1x      |\nDS-16     | 0.258 | 0.450 | 0.529 | 5.13x |\nMoE-16  | 0.258 | 0.449 | 0.530 | 1x       |\nDS-32     | 0.259 | 0.449 | 0.529 | 9.43x |\nMoE-32  | 0.259 | 0.450 | 0.531 | 1x       |\nDS-64     | 0.258 | 0.450 | 0.529 |15.99x|\nMoE-64  | 0.260 | 0.451 | 0.531 | 1x       |\n______________________________________________\n\n* FLOPs means FLOPs reduction (i.e. baseline's FLOPs / target method's FLOPs)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1485/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1485/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1485/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Doubly Sparse: Sparse Mixture of Sparse Experts for Efficient Softmax Inference", "abstract": "Computations for the softmax function in neural network models are expensive when the number of output classes is large.
