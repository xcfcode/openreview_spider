Rather, it is other system design choices that are not novel research contributions that make up all but 1% of this difference (primarily, using a voxel grid predictor to get the initial mesh, as opposed to an initial ellipsoid mesh).\n\nIt might be possible for the authors to write a systems paper supporting these design decisions and showing how they lead to better results. However, this is not the paper the authors have written (the majority of the technical detail in the paper is focused on method components that make minimal impact). I would also argue that this hypothetical paper would not necessarily be appropriate for ICLR, since it does not focus on any new representations.

We will revise the typos in the updated version.\n\n**Q1: Why the best qualitative mode was not the same as the best quantitative model?**\n\nA: Yes, Mesh R-CNN and Pixel2Mesh also observe that the metrics for shape reconstruction do not always correlate well with the shapes' visual quality. It is mainly because training without shape regularizers give meshes that are preferred by metrics despite being highly degenerate, with irregularly-sized faces and many self-intersections.\n\n**Q2: Why you changed the MVSNet loss function to use BerHu instead of L1 used in the original paper? What are x and c? It would also be good to shed some intuition on why this criterion is the right one**\n\nA: We found our modified MVS-Net converges to a better accuracy with BerHu loss than with L1 loss.\nIn the BerHu criterion $\\mathcal{L} = |x|, if |x| \\le c,\\text{ otherwise }\\frac{x^2 + c^2}{2c}$, x is the depth error of a pixel and $c$ is a constant threshold that is set to $0.2$ in our implementation.\n\nIntuitively, BerHu criterion acts as L1 loss for smaller errors and L2 loss for larger ones. The constant $c$ determines where the switch happens. BerHu criterion weights larger residuals more heavily while at the same time having higher gradient for the smaller residuals. This has been shown to work better for predicting depth values which usually follow a heavy-tailed distribution.\n\nBA-Net and ``Deeper Depth Prediction with Fully Convolutional Residual Networks'' also use BerHu loss for depth prediction for this reason.\n\n**Q3: The mixing constants in your loss function ($\\lambda$) vary across several orders of magnitude. How were those selected?**\n\nA: The constants for the loss terms chamfer loss, normal loss, edge loss and voxel loss are from Mesh R-CNN. The constants for the remaining loss terms, viz., contrastive and predicted depth losses were obtained by hyperparameter tuning.\n\n**Q4: I would like to see the qualitative results for the Best model as opposed to just the Pretty mode.**\n\nA: Of course, we will provide these qualitative results in the Appendix B of our revised manuscript."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper319/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper319/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper319/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper319/Authors"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper319/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "MeshMVS: Multi-view Stereo Guided Mesh Reconstruction", "authorids": ["~Rakesh_Shrestha1", "~Zhiwen_Fan1", "~Siyu_Zhu1", "~Zuozhuo_Dai1", "~Qingkun_Su1", "~Ping_Tan2"], "authors": ["Rakesh Shrestha", "Zhiwen Fan", "Siyu Zhu", "Zuozhuo Dai", "Qingkun Su", "Ping Tan"], "keywords": ["Mesh Reconstruction", "Multi-view Stereo", "Deep Learning"], "abstract": "Deep learning based 3D shape generation methods generally utilize latent features extracted from color images to encode the objects' semantics and guide the shape generation process.

How is interpolation handled when merging to a single 32x32x32 grid?**\n\nA: As for the coordinate system, we have explained it in the section \"Probabilistic Occupancy Grid Merging\" of our appendix, we first predict the voxel grids in their respective local coordinate frames, they are then transformed to the coordinate frame of the first view for merging.\nTo handle the interpolation, we apply bilinear interpolation on the closest matches in the equivalent global grid from the local grids occupancy values for merging.\n\n**Q3: How would this method recover if the cubified mesh is of wrong topology?**\n\nA: Same as other methods (e.g. Pixel2Mesh, Pixel2Mesh++ and Mesh R-CNN), we can hardly handle the initial mesh with wrong topology. As is shown in Table 1 and Figure 3, our model achieves better quantitative and qualitative results than Pixel2Mesh++. We are happy to regard it as a promising future work.\n\n**Q4: One can simply reconstruct from the depths, or run differentiable render for optimizing the mesh geometry directly. Why would we need contrastive depth feature extraction?**\n\nA: Contrastive depth feature extraction is used to allow the network to reason about required deformation better by contrasting the rendered depths of the current mesh against the predicted depths at different views. As is shown is Table 2, contrastive depth feature extraction increases F1-tau from 79.40% to 80.80% (Row 1), which is a 1.40\\% improvement from using only the predicted depth features.\n\n**Q5: The authors did not provide more qualitative results in supplementals.**\n\nA: Sure, we will add more qualitative results in the Appendix B of our revised manuscript."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper319/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper319/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper319/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper319/Authors"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper319/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "MeshMVS: Multi-view Stereo Guided Mesh Reconstruction", "authorids": ["~Rakesh_Shrestha1", "~Zhiwen_Fan1", "~Siyu_Zhu1", "~Zuozhuo_Dai1", "~Qingkun_Su1", "~Ping_Tan2"], "authors": ["Rakesh Shrestha", "Zhiwen Fan", "Siyu Zhu", "Zuozhuo Dai", "Qingkun Su", "Ping Tan"], "keywords": ["Mesh Reconstruction", "Multi-view Stereo", "Deep Learning"], "abstract": "Deep learning based 3D shape generation methods generally utilize latent features extracted from color images to encode the objects' semantics and guide the shape generation process.

The first part generates a coarse shape, where we extend the \u2018Voxel Branch\u2019 in Mesh R-CNN from a single view to multiple views. The second part refines the coarse shape, where we extend the \u2018Mesh Refinement Branch\u2019 to multi-view and apply depth images from MVS-Net for better refinement.\nOur losses are similar to Mesh R-CNN for most part. The only new loss term used for 3D reconstruction is the contrastive depth loss. The depth prediction loss is only used to pre-train the depth prediction network (MVS-Net).\nWe will improve the writing to make these points clearer.\n\n**Q2: The ablation studies (Table 2 and 3) show clearly that the most complex parts of the pipeline only provides very minor improvements (~1%). It is completely unclear how the proposed approach can lead to a ~14% improvement over Pixel2Mesh++.**\n\nA: We clarify how this 14% improvement is achieved here\n1. We replace the initial ellipsoid mesh in Pixel2Mesh++ with our coarse shape obtained from single-view voxel prediction. In this way, the F1-tau increases from 66.48\\% to 72.74\\% (Row 9 in Table 3), which is a 6.26% improvement.\n2. We replace the single-view voxel prediction with our multi-view voxel prediction. The F1-tau increases from 72.74% to 76.97% (Row 10 in Table 3), which is a 4.23% improvement.\n3. We replace the multi-view feature pooling with our contrastive depth feature pooling for mesh refinement. The F1-tau increases from 76.97% to 79.63% (Row 5 in Table 3), which is a 2.7% improvement.\n4. We replace the statistical feature pooling in Pixel2Mesh++ with our proposed multi-head attention feature pooling. The F1-tau increases from 79.63% to 79.82% (Row 1 in Table 3), which is a 0.19% improvement.\n5. We further apply contrastive depth loss. The F1-tau increase from 79.82% to 80.80% (Row 2 in Table 3), which is a 0.98% improvement.\n\nFrom the above break down, we can see the reviewer is right that the 4) multi-head attention and 5) contrastive depth loss bring around 1% improvement. The most significant improvements are from 1) using better initial mesh, 2) multi-view voxel prediction, and 3) contrastive depth feature pooling for mesh refinement. All these three components are novel in this method. We will discuss possible simplification of discarding 4) and 5) for a more compact network design and 1% degradation in performance.\n\n**Q3: DeepMVS could give excellent results on synthetic data because it is too simple - note I realize that Table 3 shows it is not perfect.**\n\nA: The quality of predicted depth is not unrealistically good. In fact, the baseline between our input images are arbitrary which is quite challenge for MVS-Net. Furthermore, we do not include the depth refinement component in the original MVS-Net. This is perhaps why the GT depth can further bring a 3.5% improvement. Our source code is attached for verification.\n\n**Q4: Related work is lacking discussion of important references. Section 3.2 needs re-ordering.**\n\nA: Thank you for pointing out those missing references. We will include these point-based SfM papers, implicit volumetric works, and classical deep depth prediction works in the next version and re-arrange Section 3.2 in the revised manuscript."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper319/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper319/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper319/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper319/Authors"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper319/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "MeshMVS: Multi-view Stereo Guided Mesh Reconstruction", "authorids": ["~Rakesh_Shrestha1", "~Zhiwen_Fan1", "~Siyu_Zhu1", "~Zuozhuo_Dai1", "~Qingkun_Su1", "~Ping_Tan2"], "authors": ["Rakesh Shrestha", "Zhiwen Fan", "Siyu Zhu", "Zuozhuo Dai", "Qingkun Su", "Ping Tan"], "keywords": ["Mesh Reconstruction", "Multi-view Stereo", "Deep Learning"], "abstract": "Deep learning based 3D shape generation methods generally utilize latent features extracted from color images to encode the objects' semantics and guide the shape generation process.

The system consists of a single-view voxel generation network, a multi-view voxel fusion mechanism, a multi-view depth estimation network, and a refinement network aggregating multi-view depth features. \nThe major contribution is in the refinement stage upon the coarse reconstruction obtained from voxel predictions, typically for the introduction of the Attention-based Multi-View Feature Pooling.\n\nMethod Novelty \nAccording to the paper and the attached code, it seems like the authors mostly utilized existing networks to build a system. The author introduces their Attention-based Multi-View Feature Pooling mechanism which is new. Despite the results, the system is rather bulky and ad-hoc. For the use of GCN in refinement, see Question 2.\n\nResults\nThe paper achieves plausible state-of-the-arts quantitate results on standard evaluation sets and metrics.\nThe visual quality is reasonable, however from Figure 3 it seems like reconstructed local surface suffers from noises. Their results struggles to getting clean surface especially when compared to implicit-based methods, such as DeepSDF. The authors did not provide more qualitative results in supplementals.\n\nClarity\nThis paper is well written and easy to understand. The attached code is well documented and can be deployed.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, this is a well written paper with plausible outcomes. The reviewer believes this paper carries out reasonable efforts and insights into this topic. The reviewer is marginally positive towards its acceptance due to the pleasing results, but is holding a conservative attitude towards its contribution significances. The reviewer would like to see the questions addressed in the rebuttal period, while also refer to other's reviews. \n\nQuestions:\n1. For each single-view voxel prediction, the paper did not clarify which coordinate system those voxel are in. When aggregating multi-view voxel grid, how is the coordinate transformation handled between different viewpoints? If voxel from different coordinate systems should undertake transformation, how is interpolation handled when merging to a single 32x32x32 grid? \n2. Use of GCN. As GCN only optimizes the current mesh, it cannot correct the topology error occurring after the coarse reconstruction. How would this method overcome this, especially when the cubified mesh is in wrong topology?\n3. Use of depth. From multi-view predicted depth, one can simply reconstruct from the depths, or run differentiable render for optimizing the mesh geometry directly.

Then, it translate it into a mesh and refine it using deepMVS predictions (using each view in turn as a reference view), and a GCN architecture on the mesh.\n\nOn the positive side:\n- I like the idea of using MVS-Net, but why not use it from the start (before the single view voxel prediction). \n- I think this paper is going toward a render-and-compare approach for 3D shape prediction, which I think is a good idea.\n- the boost in the results seems impressive compared to P2M++\n\nThere are however several things I don't like or that worry me about this paper:\n- the pipeline presented in this paper is extremely complicated, and has many different parts. After reading it, I have no idea what really makes the improvement compared to P2M++. It uses voxels, mesh and depth maps, Graph convolution networks, attention-based architecture, SVR and deepMVS, the training loss has 5 balancing hyperparameters, between things as different as cross-entropy and chamfer distance.\n- To me, the ablation studies (Table 2 and 3) show clearly that the most complex parts of the pipeline (3.2, contrastive depth and attention based aggregation) only provides very minor improvements (~1%). Given their complexity and number of hyper parameters, I do not think these can be considered as significative. Given these results, it is completely unclear to me how the proposed approach can lead to a ~14% improvement over pixel2Mesh. I thus think the approach should be strongly simplified (maybe loosing 1% in final performance), but the paper should provide a clear ablation that actually explain why their framework is so much better than P2M++ and this is interesting. Right now, I believe it could be for a bad reason (for example DeepMVS could give excellent results on synthetic data because it is too simple - note I realize that Table 3 shows it is not perfect since there is a further 3.5% boost using GT depth, but it could still be unrealistically good for synthetic data)\n- Related work is lacking discussion of important references, namely all classical references for point-based SfM in 2.1 , foldingNet and AtlasNet for mesh generation in 2.2, all implicit volumetric works also in 2,2 (deepSDF, OccupancyNetworks\u2026), the most classical deep depth prediction works in 2.3 (Eigen and Fergus\u2026)\n\nTo summarise, despite its impressive numbers, I think this paper cannot be accepted as is, mainly because of its complexity, lack of clear explanation for its huge performance boost, and the only marginal/not significative boosts given by the most complexe parts of the pipeline.\n\nSome additional notes on presentation:  \n- I am not sure \u201ccontrastive depth\u201d is a good choice of name since contrastive feature learning is a popular but unrelated research direction.\n- I found 3.2 very hard to parse/re-order. I could only do it with the help of fig. 1 which is itself hard to parse and does not represent e.g. how the attention-based pooling happens\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper319/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper319/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "MeshMVS: Multi-view Stereo Guided Mesh Reconstruction", "authorids": ["~Rakesh_Shrestha1", "~Zhiwen_Fan1", "~Siyu_Zhu1", "~Zuozhuo_Dai1", "~Qingkun_Su1", "~Ping_Tan2"], "authors": ["Rakesh Shrestha", "Zhiwen Fan", "Siyu Zhu", "Zuozhuo Dai", "Qingkun Su", "Ping Tan"], "keywords": ["Mesh Reconstruction", "Multi-view Stereo", "Deep Learning"], "abstract": "Deep learning based 3D shape generation methods generally utilize latent features extracted from color images to encode the objects' semantics and guide the shape generation process. These color image semantics only implicitly encode 3D information, potentially limiting the accuracy of the generated shapes. In this paper we propose a multi-view mesh generation method which incorporates geometry information in the color images explicitly by using the features from intermediate 2.5D depth representations of the input images and regularizing the 3D shapes against these depth images. Our system first predicts a coarse 3D volume from the color images by probabilistically merging voxel occupancy grids from individual views. Depth images corresponding to the multi-view color images are predicted which along with the rendered depth images of the coarse shape are used as a contrastive input whose features guide the refinement of the coarse shape through a series of graph convolution networks. Attention-based multi-view feature pooling is proposed to fuse the contrastive depth features from different viewpoints which are fed to the graph convolution networks.\nWe validate the proposed multi-view mesh generation method on ShapeNet, where we obtain a significant improvement with 34% decrease in chamfer distance to ground truth and 14% increase in the F1-score compared with the state-of-the-art multi-view shape generation method.", "one-sentence_summary": "We propose multi-view stereo guided mesh reconstruction method which incorporates geometry information from depth images, along with the rendered depth images to refine the mesh in a coarse-to-fine manner.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "shrestha|meshmvs_multiview_stereo_guided_mesh_reconstruction", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/dc24f517485e3fae166f86acb953e7454ae7a7c6.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/5e315370b38e5e99cebd9f21f5a4c5b158f64aba.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=9EA_E7zsn", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nshrestha2021meshmvs,\ntitle={Mesh{\\{}MVS{\\}}: Multi-view Stereo Guided Mesh Reconstruction},\nauthor={Rakesh Shrestha and Zhiwen Fan and Siyu Zhu and Zuozhuo Dai and Qingkun Su and Ping Tan},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=pULTvw9X313}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
