While R1 (the low score) still has a remaining issue with evaluation, particularly hyperparameter evaluation, they are also ok with acceptance. The AC is of the opinion that hyperparameter tuning is of course an important issue, but does not see it as the key issue for this particular paper. \nThe AC is of the opinion that the key issue is issue (i), raised by R3. In the discussion, the authors reconcile the inherent contradiction in (i) based on the need of additional downstream tasks that can then benefit from the actionable representation, and as demonstrated in a number of the evaluation examples (at least in the revised version). The AC believes in this logic, but believes that this should be stated more clearly in the final paper.

But learning the goal-conditioned policy from the raw input representation in the first place might be the most difficult task. In that respect, wouldn't it be possible to *simultaneously* learn a goal-conditioned policy and the representation it is based on? This is partly suggested when the authors mention that the representation could be learned from only a partial goal-conditioned policy, but this idea definitely needs to be investigated further.\n\nA second point is about unsufficiently clear thoughts about the way to intuitively advocate for the approach. The authors first claim that two states are functionally different if they are reached from different actions. Thinking further about what \"functionally\" means, I would rather have said that two states are functionally different if different goals can be reached from them. But when looking at the framework, this is close to what the authors do in practice: they use a distance between two *goal*-conditioned policies, not *state*-conditioned policies. To me, the authors have established their framework thinking of the case where the state space and the goal space are identical (as they can condition the goal-conditioned policy by any state=goal). But thinking further to the case where goals and states are different (or at least goals are only a subset of states), probably they would end-up with a different intuitive presentation of their framework. Shouldn't finally D_{act} be a distance between goals rather than between states?\n\nSection 4 lists the properties that can be expected from the framework. To me, the last paragraph of Section 4 should be a subsection 4.4 with a title such as \"state abstraction (or clustering?) from actionable representation\". And the corresponding properties should come with their own questions and subsection in the experimental study (more about this below).\n\nAbout the related work, a few remarks:\n- The authors do not refer to papers about using auxiliary tasks. Though the purpose of these works is often to supply for additional reward signals in the sparse reward context, then are often concerned with learning efficient representations such as predictive ones.\n- The authors refer to Pathak et al. (2017), but not to the more recent Burda et al. (2018) (Large-scale study of curiosity-driven learning) which insists on the idea of inverse dynamical features which is exactly the approach the authors may want to contrast theirs with. To me, they must read it.\n- The authors should also read Laversanne-Finot et al. (2018, CoRL) who learn goal space representations and show an ability to extract independently controllable features from that.\n\nA positive side of the experimental study is that the 6 simulated environments are well-chosen, as they illustrate various aspects of what it means to learn an adequate representation. Also, the results described in Fig. 5 are interesting. A side note is that the authors address in this Figure a problem pointed in Penedones et al (2018) about \"The Leakage Propagation problem\" and that their solution seems more convincing than in the original paper, maybe they should have a look.\nBut there are also several weaknesses:\n- for all experiments, the way to obtain a goal-conditioned policy in the first place is not described. This definitely hampers reproducibility of the work. A study of the effect of various optimization effort on these goal-conditioned policies might also be of interest.\n- most importantly, in Section 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6, much too few details are given. Particularly in 6.6, the task is hardly described with a few words. The message a reader can get from this section is not much more than \"we are doing something that works, believe us!\". So the authors should choose between two options:\n* either giving less experimental results, but describing them accurately enough so that other people can try to reproduce them, and analyzing them so that people can extract something more interesting than \"with their tuning (which is not described), the framework of the authors outperforms other systems whose tuning is not described either\".\n* or add a huge appendix with all the missing details.\nI'm clearly in favor of the first option.\n\nSome more detailed points or questions about the experimental section:\n- not so important, Section 6.2 could be grouped with Section 6.1, or the various competing methods could be described directly in the sections where they are used.\n- in Fig. 5, in the four room environment, ARC gets 4 separated clusters. How can the system know that transitions between these clusters are possible?\n- in Section 6.3, about the pushing experiment, I would like to argue against the fact that the block position is the important factor and the end-effector position is secundary. Indeed, the end-effector must be correctly positioned so that the block can move. Does ARC capture this important constraint?\n- Globally, although it is interesting, Fig.6 only conveys a quite indirect message about the quality of the learned representation.\n- Still in Fig. 6, what is described as \"blue\" appears as violet in the figures and pink in the caption, this does not help when reading for the first time.\n- In Section 6.4, Fig.7 a, ARC happens to do better than the oracle. The authors should describe the oracle in more details and discuss why it does not provide a \"perfect\" representation.\n- Still in Section 6.4, the authors insist that ARC outperforms VIME, but from Fig.7, VIME is not among the best performing methods. Why insist on this one? And a deeper discussion of the performance of each method would be much more valuable than just showing these curves.\n- Section 6.5 is so short that I do not find it useful at all.\n- Section 6.6 should be split into the HRL question and the clustering question, as mentioned above. But this only makes sense if the experiments are properly described, as is it is not useful.\n\nFinally, the discussion is rather empty, and would be much more interesting if the experiments had been analyzed in more details.\n\ntypos:\n\np1: that can knows => know\np7: euclidean => Euclidean\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1099/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Actionable Representations with Goal Conditioned Policies", "abstract": "Representation learning is a central challenge across a range of machine learning areas.

The idea is novel (to the best of my knowledge), interesting and the experiments seem promising. The two main flaws in the paper are the lack of details and missing important experimental comparisons.\n\nMajor remarks:\n\n- The author state they add experimental details and videos via a link to a website. I think doing so is very problematic, as the website can be changed after the deadline but there was no real information on the website so it wasn\u2019t a problem this time.\n\n- While the idea seems very interesting, it is only presented in very high-level. I am very skeptical someone will be able to reproduce these results based only on the given details. For example - in eq.1 what is the distribution over s? How is the distance approximated? How is the goal-conditional policy trained? How many clusters and what clustering algorithm?\n\n- Main missing details is about how the goal reaching policy is trained. The authors admit that having one is \u201ca significant assumption\u201d and state that they will discuss why it is reasonable assumption but I didn\u2019t find any such discussion  (only a sentence in 6.4).  \n\n- While the algorithm compare to a variety of representation learning alternatives, it seems like the more natural comparison are model-based Rl algorithms, e.g. \u201cNeural Network Dynamics for Model-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning with Model-Free Fine-Tuning\u201d.

The question you raise about the necessity of something beyond a goal-conditioned policy is a valuable one, and we answer it below. We have updated the discussion in Section 4 to reflect the same. We have also added an additional comparison to directly using goal conditioned policies in Section 6.6. \n\nAlthough GCPs trained to reach one state from another are feasible to learn, they possess some fundamental limitations (added discussion in Section 4): they do not generalize very well to new states, and they are limited to solving tasks expressible as just reaching a particular goal.  The unifying explanation for why ARCs are useful over just a GCP is that the learned representation generalizes better than the GCP - to new tasks and to new regions of the environment. In our experimental evaluation, we show that ARCs can help solve tasks that cannot be expressed as goal reaching (Section 6.6, 6.7) and they enable learning policies on larger regions to which GCPs do not generalize (Section 6.5).\n\nAs the GCP is trained with a sparse reaching reward, it is unaware of possible reward structures in the environment, making it hard to adapt to tasks which are not simple goal reaching, such as the \u201creach-while-avoid\u201d task in Section 6.6. For this task, following the GCP directly would cause the ant to walk through the red region and incur a large negative reward; a comparison we now explicitly add to Section 6.6. Tasks which cannot be expressed as simply reaching a goal are abundant in real life scenarios such as navigation with preferences or manipulation with costs on quality of motion, and fast learning on such tasks (as ARC does) is quite beneficial. We have explicitly emphasized this discussion in Section 4.1, and made the limitations of simple goal reaching clear at the start of Section 4. \n\nIn the tasks for Section 6.5, the GCP trained on the 2m region (in green) does not achieve high performance on the larger region of 8m, even when finetuned on the environment using the provided reward (Fig 8). However, shaping the reward function using ARCs enables learning beyond the the original GCP, showing that ARCs generalize better to this new region, and potentially can lead to learning progressively harder GCPs via bootstrapping. \n\nWe agree that the discussion would greatly benefit from an introductory paragraph putting things into context, we have added this discussion at the beginning of Section 4. Please let us know if this resolves the issues you brought up. If not, we\u2019re happy to address any other concerns you might have. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1099/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1099/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1099/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Actionable Representations with Goal Conditioned Policies", "abstract": "Representation learning is a central challenge across a range of machine learning areas.

We are not sure we fully understand your concern about hyperparameter tuning, and were hoping for some additional clarifications regarding this. We have added additional details to the paper regarding hyperparameter tuning in Appendix D. We do not have many hyperparameters to tune for ARCs - the only free parameter is the size of the latent dimension, and for the downstream tasks, we tune the weight of the shaping term for reward shaping and the number of clusters for HRL for each comparison method on each task. \n\nThe size of the latent dimension is selected by performing a sweep on the downstream reward-shaping task for each domain and method. For the reward-shaping task, for each domain and comparison method, the parameter controlling the relative scaling of the shaped reward is selected according to a coarse hyperparameter sweep. The number of clusters for k-means for the hierarchy experiments is similarly selected for each domain and comparison method, although we found that all tasks and methods worked well with the same number of clusters. As you note, this is standard in deep reinforcement learning research, and we are simply following standard practice. Importantly, we give all methods a fair chance by tuning each comparison method separately.

If you take the title of Sections 4.1 and 6.6, why \"leveraging actionable representation as feature for learning policies\" if you already learned policies ? The last paragraph suggests that policies learned in ARC space will generalize \"beyond GCPs\". Since GCPs limitations have not been made clear, this point is still vague.\n\nIn Section 4, the authors suggest three other valuable answers to this question: reward shaping, doing HRL, or clustering in ARC space (by the way, the latter could be used to help the former). My feeling is that treating those three points in addition to the one above is somewhat dispersive, the paper is trying to make to many points, at least a unifying perspective is missing.\n\nTo me, the paper lacks between Section 4 and Section 4.1 an introductiory text which should contain the last paragraph of Section 3 and would motivate the work more clearly with respect to the above issue.\n\nIf the paper does not get finally accepted at ICLR, I would suggest the authors to reconsider their positionning with respect to the perspective above and put forward a clearer message about what actionable representations really bring in a context where you already have \"good enough\" GCPs.\n\nFinally, the perspective mentioned in the discussion of interleaving ARC learning and GCP learning would of course change the picture about the above issue, I appreciate that the authors kept that for their last sentence.\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1099/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1099/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1099/AnonReviewer3", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Actionable Representations with Goal Conditioned Policies", "abstract": "Representation learning is a central challenge across a range of machine learning areas.

For our experiments, the GCP was trained with TRPO using a sparse reward (see Section 6.2 and Appendix A.1) -- obtaining such a policy is not especially difficult, and existing methods are quite capable of doing so [1,2,3].  We therefore believe that this assumption is reasonable. \n\nTo ensure the comparisons are fair, every representation learning method that we compare to is trained using the same data (Section 6.2, 6.3). All representations are trained on a dataset of trajectories collected from the goal-conditioned policy, and we have updated the paper with full details of the training scheme (Section 6.3, Appendix A.2, B).\n\nWe also ensure that our experiments fairly account for the data required to train the GCP.\n- In the generalization experiment (Section 6.4), all methods initialize behaviour from the GCP, as policies trained from scratch fail, a new comparison we have added to Figure 7. \n- In the hierarchy experiment (Section 6.7), all representations use the GCP as a low-level controller, so ARC incurs no additional sample cost. Two comparisons (TRPO, Option Critic) which do not use the GCP make zero progress, even with substantially more samples.\n- In the experiment for learning non goal-reaching tasks (Section 6.6), the ARC representation can be re-used across many different tasks without retraining the GCP, amortizing the cost of learning the GCP.  We plan to add an experimental comparison on a family of 100 tasks to demonstrate this amortization, and will update the paper with results. \n\n[1] Nair, Pong, Dalal, Bahl, Lin, and Levine.

We would appreciate it if the reviewer could take another look at our changes and additional results, and let us know if they would like to revise their score or request additional changes that would alleviate their concerns.\n\nNew comparisons: \nWe have added two more comparisons as suggested - with model based RL methods ([5] Nagabandi et al) and learning representations via inverse dynamics models ([4] Burda et al). These have been described in Section 6.3 and added to plots in Fig 7, 8, 10. We have also added a new comparison to learning from scratch for the reward shaping experiment (Section 6.5, Fig 7). \n\nLack of details: \nWe apologize for the lack of clarity in the submission! We have updated the main text and added an appendix with additional details of the ARC representation and the experimental setup: how a goal-conditioned policy is trained (Sec 6.2, Appendix A.1), how the ARC representation is learned (Sec 6.2, Appendix A.2) , and how the methods are evaluated on downstream applications (Sec 6.5-7, Appendix A.3-6). We increased analysis of the performance of ARC and comparison methods for all the downstream applications (Sec 6.5-6.7), and added a discussion of how all methods are trained (Sec 6.3, Appendix A.2, B)\n\nRequirement for goal-conditioned policy:\nThe ARC representation is extracted from a goal-conditioned policy (GCP), requiring us to assume that we can train such a GCP. This assumption was explicit in our submission, but we have emphasized it more now by editing Section 1 and Section 3. For our experiments, the GCP was trained with existing RL methods using a sparse task-agnostic reward (Section 6.2, Appendix A.1) -- obtaining such a policy is not especially difficult, and existing methods are quite capable of doing so [1,2,3].  We therefore believe that this assumption is reasonable.

We additionally added comparison (Fig 7,8,10) to using inverse dynamics models and model-based RL methods, as discussed above. \n\n\u201cShouldn't finally D_{act} be a distance between goals rather than between states?\u201d\n> D_{act} is indeed the actionable distance between goals, but given that the goal and the state space are the same the learned representation can be effectively used as a state representation as seen in Section 6.6.\n\n\u201cin Fig. 5, in the four room environment, ARC gets 4 separated clusters. How can the system know that transitions between these clusters are possible?\u201d\n->  We have added a discussion in Section 6.6 to clarify this. We use model free RL to train the high level policy which directly outputs clusters as described in Section 4.4. This high level policy does not need to explicitly model the transitions between clusters, that is handled by the low level goal reaching policy, and the high-level policy is trained model-free. \n\n\u201cIndeed, the end-effector must be correctly positioned so that the block can move. Does ARC capture this important constraint?\u201d\n-> ARC does not completely ignore the end effector position, this is evidenced from the fact that the blue region in Fig 6 is not a point but is an entire area. What ARC captures is that moving the block induces a greater difference in actions than inducing the arm. Moving the block to different positions requires the arm to move to touch the block and push it to the goal, while moving the arm to different positions can be done by directly moving it to the desired position. While both things are captured, the block is emphasized over the end-effector.\n\n\u201cIn Section 6.4, Fig.7 a, ARC happens to do better than the oracle. why?\u201d\n-> The oracle comparison is a hand-specified reward shaping - we have updated Section 6.5 and Figure 7 to make this point clear. It is likely that the ARC representation is able to find an even better reward shaping, although the difference is fairly small. \n\n\u201cfrom Fig.7, VIME is not among the best performing methods. Why insist on this one?\u201d\n-> We intended to emphasize that ARC is able to outperform a method that is purely designed for better exploration, not just other methods for representation learning. The discussion in Section 6.5 has been appropriately altered.\n\n[1] Nair, Pong, Dalal, Bahl, Lin, and Levine.

We have made many changes based on the comments provided by reviewers, which are summarized below. We would appreciate it if the reviewer could take another look at our changes and additional results, and let us know if they would like to request additional changes that would alleviate their concerns.\n\nNew comparisons: We have added a model-based RL algorithm planning with MPC (Nagabandi et al.), as a comparison to learning features. On the \u201creach-while-avoid\u201d task (Fig 8), model-based RL struggles compared to a model-free policy with ARC because of challenges such as model-bias, limited exploration and short-horizon planning. The updated plot and corresponding discussion have been added to Section 6.6. We have also added a comparison to representations from inverse dynamics models (Burda et al), described in Section 6.3.\n\nLack of details: We apologize for the lack of clarity in the submission! We have updated the main text and added an appendix with additional details of the ARC representation and the experimental setup: how a goal-conditioned policy is trained (Sec 6.2, Appendix A.1), how the ARC representation is learned (Sec 6.2, Appendix A.2) , and how the methods are evaluated on downstream applications (Sec 6.5-7, Appendix A.3-6). We have added a discussion of how all comparisons are trained, and measures taken to ensure fairness (Sec 6.3, Appendix A.2, B)\n\nRequirement for goal-conditioned policy: The ARC representation is extracted from a goal-conditioned policy (GCP), requiring us to assume that we can train such a GCP. This assumption was explicit in our submission, but we have emphasized it more now by editing Section 1 and Section 3. For our experiments, the GCP was trained with existing RL methods using a sparse task-agnostic reward (Section 6.2, Appendix A.1) -- obtaining such a policy is not especially difficult, and existing methods are quite capable of doing so [1,2,3].  We therefore believe that this assumption is reasonable, and have added this to the paper in Section 3.  \n\nWe also ensure that our experiments fairly account for the data required to train the GCP.\n- In the generalization experiment (Section 6.4), all methods initialize behaviour from the GCP, as policies trained from scratch fail, a new comparison we have added to Figure 7. \n- In the hierarchy experiment (Section 6.7), all representations use the GCP as a low-level controller, so ARC incurs no additional sample cost in comparison. Two comparisons (TRPO, Option Critic) which do not use the GCP make zero progress, even when provided with substantially more samples.\n- In the experiment for learning non goal-reaching tasks (Section 6.6), the ARC representation can be re-used across many different tasks without retraining the GCP, amortizing the cost of learning the GCP.  We plan to add an experimental comparison on a family of 100 tasks to demonstrate this amortization, and will update the paper with results.

We have updated the paper to include full details of the training scheme for all methods (Section 6.3, Appendix A.2, B).\n\nWe also ensure that our experiments fairly account for the data required to train the GCP.\n- In the generalization experiment (Section 6.4), all methods initialize behaviour from the GCP, as policies trained from scratch fail, a new comparison we have added to Figure 7. \n- In the hierarchy experiment (Section 6.7), all representations use the GCP as a low-level controller, so ARC incurs no additional sample cost. Two comparisons (TRPO, Option Critic) which do not use the GCP make zero progress, even with substantially more samples.\n- In the experiment for learning non goal-reaching tasks (Section 6.6), the ARC representation can be re-used across many different tasks without retraining the GCP, amortizing the cost of learning the GCP.  We plan to add an experimental comparison on a family of 100 tasks to demonstrate this amortization, and will update the paper with results. \n\nFind responses to particular questions and comments below: \n\n\u201cHow is the data collected to obtain the goal-directed policies in the first place?\u201d\n-> We train a goal-conditioned policy with TRPO using a task-agnostic sparse reward function. We have updated the paper to reflect this (Section 6.2, Appendix A.1).\n\n\u201cwhy is this particular metric used to link the feature representation to policy similarity?\u201d\n-> We add an explicit discussion of this in Section 3. We link feature representation to policy similarity by this metric, because it directly captures the notion that features should represent elements of the state which directly affect the actions. The KL divergence between policy distributions allows us to embed goal states which induce similar actions similarly into feature space. \n\n\n[1] Nagabandi, Kahn, Fearing and Levine.
