Nonetheless, there is general consensus that the current submission suffers from a number of shortcomings that make it unsuitable for acceptance.\n\nFollowing the detailed comments provided by the reviewers, I strongly encourage the authors to focus on the following dimensions to improve the paper:\n1- The current experiments indeed provide a first illustration of how the proposed algorithm works, but they need significant improvement in variety and scope: As pointed out by the reviewers, the current experiments do not cover single-reward challenging exploration benchmarks (such as Montezuma). I agree with the authors that the inductive bias implemented in their algorithm is designed with diversity of goals in mind, but if the main point is to improve exploration, it is natural to expect results in that respect. Alternatively, the authors should state more explicitly the type of problems their method is intended to solve from the very beginning of the paper and design experiments accordingly.\n2- The initial mutual information objective is simplified across multiple steps and it is unclear how much the approximations impact the original \"semantic\" of the objective.\n3- A more thorough comparison with mutual-information-based methods such as DIAYN or VIC is needed. Also, I wonder what is the connection with more goal-based exploration approaches such as GoExplore or SkewFit."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Diverse Exploration via InfoMax Options", "authorids": ["~Yuji_Kanagawa1", "~Tomoyuki_Kaneko1"], "authors": ["Yuji Kanagawa", "Tomoyuki Kaneko"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Hierachical Reinforcement Learning", "Exploration"], "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of autonomously discovering temporally abstracted actions, or options, for exploration in reinforcement learning.

It would benefit from an analysis of the behaviour of the algorithm in a broader range of problems.", "review": "The authors propose a modification of the option-critic algorithm for hierarchical reinforcement learning. The proposed algorithm modifies how the termination conditions of the options are improved by experience. Specifically, the algorithm aims to maximize the mutual information between the options and their termination states. The authors develop an optimization scheme for achieving this objective and provide empirical results in a number of domains\n\nThe empirical results help understand the scalability of the approach but they are less useful in evaluating how useful the proposed algorithm is in general. The experimental domains used in the paper are not as diverse as one would wish to see. In addition, across domains, the general structure of the task is the same: there are multiple goal regions offering different amounts of reward; the challenge for the agent is to not get distracted by the lower offerings. So it would be informative to see the algorithm analysed in a more varied set of problems, including problems with a single goal region. Also informative would be to execute the algorithm with varying numbers of options and examine the effect. \n\nThe logic behind using uncertainty-aware option selection is not clear. Further discussion and exploration of it in the paper would be useful. \n\nBottom of page 4: \u201cBy adding the uncertainty bonus, this strategy encourages selecting lesser-known options.\u201d Given  that $\\mu(o, s_t)$ is the probability of choosing option $o$ in state $s_t$, which is not directly related to how well known an option is, it is not clear to me how Equation 12 encourages selecting \u201clesser-known\u201d options. \n\nBottom of page 5: \u201cThus, an agent is required to switch its behavior around a suboptimal goal (e.g., from \u201cgoing down\u201d to \u201cgoing right\u201d), which options can help.\u201d This needs clarification. How do options help with this? And why is that not achievable with primitive actions?\n\nIn Figure 2, OurAOC lags behind AOC. This could be noted in the paper and the reasons can be discussed. \n\nFigures 2 and 6 are very useful.\n\nSection 2.3,  perfoms --> performs\nSection 2.3,  terminatio --> termination\n\nAuthor feedback: The behaviour and performance of the algorithm in single-goal environments should be part of the paper. The paper should show not only where the algorithm succeeds but also where it fails. I appreciated the author's efforts to add diversity to the domains evaluated but they do not go far enough to change my score.

I found that the analysis of the method in the revision is informative. However, the comparison with the baselines is still lacking, and the experiments are only performed in simple environments. For these reasons, I keep my rating unchanged after the rebuttal.\n\n=============\n\nSummary:\nThis paper studies the problem of discovering options for exploration in reinforcement learning. To this end, they propose infomax criteria that maximize the information between options and option-terminating states conditioned on the option-starting states. The paper derives update rules for the infomax criteria and applies the gradient descent algorithm to optimize options. The proposed method is evaluated at Gridworld/Mujoco four rooms tasks and Point Billiard environment, and the authors show that the resulting options are diverse.\n\n\nPros:\n- The information maximization criteria for diverse option-terminating states is novel.\n- The paper does a nice job describing the required background materials in great detail. \n- The paper clearly describes the objective and the corresponding update rule with implementation details. \n\n\nCons:\n- The experimental results are too weak to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. In detail, the paper's experiment tasks are too simple, e.g., all tasks' goals are to reach one of the four points in a simple square room. Moreover, from Figure 3-(b), it doesn't seem that the proposed method (PPIMOC) outperforms the baselines. \n- The performance comparison with important baselines such as termination critic (TC) is absent in the experiments. \n- The paper suggests some techniques such as uncertainty-aware option selection or upgoing option-advantage estimation, but the paper lacks ablation studies.\n- It is not clear that maximizing the mutual information in Equation (7) leads to diverse options. The paper should provide theoretical results or more experimental analysis to make the case.\n\n\nComments:\n- Experiments on more challenging tasks, such as Montezuma's revenge from Atari games, could improve the claim of the paper. \n- I recommend performing an ablation study of the proposed algorithms (in Section 4) to isolate the effect of each technique.\n- I am not fully convinced that information maximization leads to diverse options. Aren't there any problems associated with the collapse of options or terminating states? \n\n(minor)\nThere are some typos.\n- End of Section 2.1: \"with and o and not\"\n- Equation (4) and the following sentence: Q_O(x) -> Q_O(x,o)\n- Last paragraph of Section 2.3: \"Contrary to the terminatio\"\n\n\nIn summary, the paper suggests a new perspective on diverse options via infomax criteria, but the experimental results are too weak, and the analysis of the method is lacking.

As we describe below, Gridwolrd is stochastic. We are happy to add experiments in some more interesting stochastic environments, though. Also, we share the concern with stochasticity since $\\hat{p}$ depends on both policy and environmental dynamics. Some empirical analysis would be interesting.\n\n2. The main contribution of this paper is the method for learning diverse termination conditions. We agree that the policy regularization via maximizing $I(A;O|X_s)$ is a relatively coarse approximation of the targeting MI $I(X_f; O|X_s)$. However, we need pseudo rewards to maximize the MI via the policy parameters. Thus, to keep the paper simple, we used this rough but simple regularization.\n3. We had described the training details in Appendix B.2. We are happy to add some more explanations.\n\nHere are our answer to the questions:\n\n1. $X_s$ denotes a starting state of an option. $\\Pr(X_s = x)$ is the probability that an agent starts to use a new option at a state $x$. Thus, $X_f|X_s$ is the random variable denoting a state transition accompanied by an option. We will make the context clear in the revised paper.\n2. We had described how we estimated the $\\hat{p}$ in Appendix B.1. Also, we are preparing a further analysis for $\\hat{p}$.\n3. We found that it was our mistake. Thank you for pointing it out. An agent chooses the same option when $b_t = 0$.\n4. $k$ is not a constant but depends on the sampled termination variables $b_t, b_{t + 1}, \u2026$, collected along the $N$-step rollout. Precisely, we define the $k$ so that $b_t = b_{t + 1} = \u2026 = b_{t + k - 1} = 0$ and $b_{t + k} = 1$ hold. We will clarify this in the revised version.\n5. We agree that this is a rough approximation. Since our main contribution is in training $\\beta$, we used this regularization for simplicity.\n6. We agree that the gain looks marginal. IMOC is somehow unstable when evaluating and occasionally fails (= got no positive reward). We still don't have a remedy for this instability.\n7. Yes, all algorithms used four options.\n8. Yes. As we had noted in Appendix C.3., the Four Rooms Gridworld is stochastic in that each action can fail with the probability of 0.1, resulting in a uniformly random transition. We will note this more clearly.\n9. Four options are used in MuJoCo experiments as well as other experiments.\n10. The sample indicators mean that the corresponding terms are replaced by expectations in equations 17 and 18. We will improve our paper to be more clear. These indicators are actually borrowed from Harutyunyan et al. (2019) to help understand the equations.\n11. Figure 8 is for MuJoCo experiments. We are happy to add similar figures for Gridworld or Billiard experiments.\n\nAlso, thank you for pointing out lots of minor issues.\n\n> Given that you're dealing in episodic tasks, below equation (1), shouldn't the $Q^{\\pi}$ values be indexed by timestep?\n\n> In the definition of $V_{\\mathcal{O}}(x)$, it should be indexed by $\\mu$.\n\nWe agree that indexing makes the notations clearer. However, to keep them compatible with Bacon et al. (2017), we are to leave them as are.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper574/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper574/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Diverse Exploration via InfoMax Options", "authorids": ["~Yuji_Kanagawa1", "~Tomoyuki_Kaneko1"], "authors": ["Yuji Kanagawa", "Tomoyuki Kaneko"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Hierachical Reinforcement Learning", "Exploration"], "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of autonomously discovering temporally abstracted actions, or options, for exploration in reinforcement learning.

The paper is well written and mostly clear (with a few points below):\n\nOverall I think the idea has merit, but I think the experiments fall short of demonstrating its performance. What seems to be lacking to me is:\n1. Demonstrating performance with stochastic transitions (I believe all experiments are with deterministic transitions).\n2. Overcoming the coarse approximation for the infomax objective (7) (see point 5 below).\n3. Clarifying the details of the classification model, which seems central to the algorithm (see point 2 below).\n\nSome questions for the authros:\n1. What is the law of $X_S$ in equation (7)? In particular, if $X_f|X_s$ is the random variable denoting a state transition, wouldn't this just be the stationary distribution of the current policy? Further, in Proposition 1, the first state $x_s$ isn't sampled (at least not by $\\pi^o$ nor $\\beta^o$), so it's not clear what the random variable $X_S$ represents.\n2. Right before section 4, the authors write \"learning a classification model over options $\\hat{p}(o|x_s, x_f)$ from sampled option transitions\". This seems central to the algorithmic performance, but it's not clear how it gets used.\n3. In equation (12), in the condition for $b_t = 1$, it seems it's saying the same option ($o_t$) should be picked again. Is this the case?\n4. Above equation (13), the authors write \"Supposing that the current option ot terminates at the $t + k$ step\". How is this calculated? This seems especially problematic with stochastic transitions.\n5. In page 5 the authors write \"[$I(A; O | X_S)$] can be interpreted as a local approximation of the infomax objective (7), assuming that each action leads to different terminating regions.\" This seems like a rather rough approximation; in particular, doesn't this simply encourage diversity of one-step action transitions as opposed to option termination?\n6. In Figure 1b the difference between A2IMOC and A2C does not appear to be statistically significant (there is major overlap of the confidence regions). Does this not suggest merely marginal gains?\n7. In Figure 2, were all algorithms using 4 options?\n8. Were any of the environments evaluated with stochastic transitions?\n9. How many options were used in the MuJoCo environments?\n10. What do the \"sample\" indicators mean in your proof of Lemma 1? This suggests the proof is mostly a modification of the proof in Harutyunyan et al. (2019).\n11. Do you have a similar plot as Figure 8, but for the MuJoCo experiments?\n\nMinor issues:\n1. Given that you're dealing in episodic tasks, below equation (1), shouldn't the $Q^{\\pi}$ values be indexed by timestep?\n2. In the definition of $V_{\\mathcal{O}}(x)$, it should be indexed by $\\mu$.\n3. Right above section 2.2, remove the extraneous \"and\".\n4. In equation (4), $Q_{\\mathcal{O}}$ is missing the second parameter.\n5. You should state equation (6) as a proper theorem.\n6. Equation (10) is over the margins.\n7. In the first sentence of the paragraph above equation (14), remove the extraneous \"common\"\n8. In the section titled **MuJoCo Point Four Rooms** there is a typo, it says \"Figure 3b\" but it should say \"Figure 3a\".\n9.

This is an appealing idea, and the approaches to\nempowerment (such as for DIAYN) are a great fit for the limitations of\nthe Harutyunyan work.\n\nHowever, there were a number of issues I found with the paper which\ncurrently leaves me leaning more towards rejecting in the current\nform. Again, solid idea, but both the paper itself and the\nexperimental results (thus the method) need further work.\n\nComments/Questions:\n\n- Just above Prop 2: The use of the discriminator / classification\nmodel here should be attributed to related work.\n\n- Uncertainty-aware option selection: How is this like UCB? This is\nnot 'uncertainty', it is the stochasticity of the policy, so this\nactually just looks more like entropy regularization as it is\nfrequently used. Am I missing something?\n\n- Section 5, Gridworld:  Do episodes end as soon as the first non-zero\nreward is found? I don't think that this is a particularly good choice\nof domain for studying exploration.\n\n- \"A2IMOC performed the best and found the optimal goal in most trials.\"\nI don't see any evidence for either part of this statement. Judging by\nFigure 1, none of the methods are reliably achieving the 2.0 goal. And\njudging by the error bars, it is difficult to say that A2IMOC is\nbetter than AOC. I'd add that looking at Figure2, the policies learned\nby the different options for A2IMOC look to terminate in different\nstates, but appear to have essentially the same behavior policy. This\nlooks like one of the common failure cases of OC, where the options\neither learn the primitive actions (e.g. Figure 2, AOC) or all learn\nidentical policies (e.g. Figure 2, A2IMOC).\n\nAs with Figure 1, the learning curves in Figure 2 do not allow us to\ndraw any real conclusions about PPIMOC being an improvement over PPO.\nThough, Figure 3, does seem to show some significant improvement in\nthis non-stationary task setting. But this is perhaps the only\npositive empirical result, and thus is a lot to hang the paper on.\n\n- Appendix: epsilon-greedy ablation looks to be actually performing\nthe best, why not use this instead of the UAOS?\n\nPros:\n\nInteresting idea, very appealing intuitively\nSmall, but highly relevant, theoretical contributions\n\nCons:\n\nExperimental results are wholly unconvincing\nUncertainy-aware option selection needs to be reframed\nWriting could use some work, especially around putting this in the\nproper context of existing work.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper574/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper574/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Diverse Exploration via InfoMax Options", "authorids": ["~Yuji_Kanagawa1", "~Tomoyuki_Kaneko1"], "authors": ["Yuji Kanagawa", "Tomoyuki Kaneko"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Hierachical Reinforcement Learning", "Exploration"], "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of autonomously discovering temporally abstracted actions, or options, for exploration in reinforcement learning.
