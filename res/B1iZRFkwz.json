Previous neural program approaches either perform syntactic repairs or use constraint-based techniques for semantic repairs. It was great to see an end-to-end neural approach also aiming to tackle semantic program repair with test-cases.\n\nThe problem formulation of using an end-to-end neural approach to repair programs with test-cases (i/o examples) is novel. This approach also has the potential to improve program synthesis techniques. The results presented generally show the benefits of access to candidate programs (although the case with m=3 is interesting where it performs slightly worse than the baseline).\n\nGiven the shorter page limit, it might be difficult to present all the information. But it might be good to provide a bit more information about how different types of mutations effect the final results (e.g. does modifying control flow statements result in different performance than modifying action statements?). Also, it wasn't clear if the mutations involved dropping control flow statements such as if, while etc. It would be nice to quantify the space of possible mutations to make it clear than simple search methods for mutations won't scale to this problem.\n\nAre there some intuitions why the edit-model performed worse than the LSTM generative model? It seems the edit-model needs to perform lesser (easier) work. It might also be interesting to investigate why training on m=1,2,3 results in better performance on m=1 test set compared to training on m=1 training set.\n\nMinor corrections\n\npage 3: distribution over over possible --> distribution over possible\npage 3: computation each step is --> computation at each step is\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Towards Specification-Directed Program Repair", "abstract": "Several recent papers have developed neural network program synthesizers by using supervised learning over large sets of randomly generated programs and specifications.\nIn this paper, we investigate the feasibility of this approach for program repair: given a specification and a candidate program assumed similar to a correct program for the specification, synthesize a program which meets the specification.  \nWorking in the Karel domain with a dataset of synthetically generated candidates, we develop models that can make effective use of the extra information in candidate programs, achieving 40% error reduction compared to a baseline program synthesis model that only receives the specification and not a candidate program.\n", "paperhash": "shin|towards_specificationdirected_program_repair", "_bibtex": "@misc{\n  shin2018towards,\n  title={Towards Specification-Directed Program Repair},\n  author={Richard Shin and Illia Polosukhin and Dawn Song},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1iZRFkwz}\n}", "authorids": ["shin.richard@gmail.com", "ilblackdragon@gmail.com", "dawnsong.travel@gmail.com"], "authors": ["Richard Shin", "Illia Polosukhin", "Dawn Song"], "keywords": [], "pdf": "/pdf/8487da9ea9202bc1baeccf8d234520c89f4b45dc.pdf"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "duedate": 1520657999000, "tmdate": 1521582808472, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/-/Paper339/Official_Review", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper339/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper339/AnonReviewer3", "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper339/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper339/AnonReviewer2"], "reply": {"forum": "B1iZRFkwz", "replyto": "B1iZRFkwz", "writers": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper339/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper339/AnonReviewer[0-9]+", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "review": {"required": true, "order": 2, "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}"}, "rating": {"required": true, "order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"]}, "confidence": {"required": true, "order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"]}}}, "nonreaders": [], "expdate": 1528433999000, "cdate": 1521582808472}}}, {"tddate": null, "ddate": null, "original": null, "tmdate": 1521582613481, "tcdate": 1520877201236, "number": 3, "cdate": 1520877201236, "id": "Sytc044Kz", "invitation": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/-/Paper339/Official_Review", "forum": "B1iZRFkwz", "replyto": "B1iZRFkwz", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper339/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Paper339/AnonReviewer2"], "content": {"title": ".", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "review": "This paper solves program repair which is defined as follows: given input/output pairs of a true program pi, and a candidate program pi_cand, get back pi.
