How can we discover such reusable skills for artificial agents when given a large dataset of prior experience? Past works leverage extensive human supervision to define skills or use simple skill heuristics that limit their expressiveness. In contrast, we propose a principled, unsupervised objective for skill discovery from large, offline datasets based on the Minimum Description Length principle: we show that a \"code book\" of skills that can maximally compress the training data can be reused to efficiently learn new tasks. By minimizing description length we strike an optimal balance between the number of extracted skills and their complexity. We show that our approach outperforms alternative approaches that heuristically define skills on a complex, long-horizon maze navigation task.", "pdf": "/pdf/346173f9d55ac8059c060d8aa7f53fe027c5979d.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|minimum_description_length_skills_for_accelerated_reinforcement_learning", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021minimum,\ntitle={Minimum Description Length Skills for Accelerated Reinforcement Learning},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to Self-Supervision for Reinforcement Learning Workshop - ICLR 2021},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=r4XxtrIo1m9},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615310247528, "tmdate": 1615313016556, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
