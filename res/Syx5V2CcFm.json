The idea is to use  standard convex solvers to iteratively optimize a regularized objective with penalty centered at previous iterates - which is standard in many proximal methods.

The main weakness is that the results only holds for \\mu weekly convex functions and the algorithm depends on the knowledge of \\mu.

In function (3), for any x in R^d, if \\hat x  = prox_\\gamma f (x), then f(\\hat x ) <= f(x). This inequality looks not correct to me. If x = argmin_x f(x), the above inequality is obviously wrong.  It looks like that function (3) is a very important basis for the whole paper.\n \n2. By using the weakly convex assumption and solving f_s, the authors transform a nonconvex nonsmooth problem to a convex problem. However, the paper didn't mention how to select \\gamma in the algorithm. This parameter is nontrivial, if you set a small value, the problem is not convex and the analysis does not hold. In the experiment, the authors tune \\gamma from 1 to 2000, which means that u < 1 or u < 1/2000.  Given neural network is a u-weakly convex problem or u-smooth problem, the theory does not match the experiment. \n\n3.

We agree that both papers use the idea of adding a strongly convex regularizer to the objective function. However, this is a commonly used technique. It dates back to the proximal point method proposed in 1970s (e.g., Rockafellar (1970)). The recent works that use this idea for non-convex optimization include Carmon et al. (2016), Allen-Zhu (2017), Lan & Yang (2018) for smooth problems, and Davis & Grimmer (2017) for non-smooth problems. We have discussed the later work in the original submission. In the revision, we add the discussion about other works that add strongly convex regularizer to the objective. The key differences between our paper and the Natasha paper of Allen-Zhu is summarized below: \na.\tFirst, Allen-Zhu considers finite-sum problems, and assume the objective function has a smooth component. In contrast, we consider more general stochastic problems without assuming the function is smooth. Please check the Ex. 2 on page 5 for an example of non-smooth and non-convex functions, for which our algorithm is applicable but Natasha is not applicable. \nb.\tDue to the strong condition (i.e., finite-sum structure and smoothness) made in the Natasha paper, they are able to get better complexity in terms of epsilon. However, in this paper we focus on how to explain the success of heuristic used in practice for solving deep learning problems, including stagewise step size, averaging and adaptive step size. Our theory covers most commonly used stochastic algorithms used in practice. \n\nRockafellar, R. T. (1970). Convex analysis. Princeton: Princeton University Press.\nYair Carmon, John C.

Accelerated stochastic algorithms for nonconvex finite-sum and multi-block optimization. CoRR, abs/1805.05411, 2018.\n\n\nQ2:   About the choice of the convergence measure.\nA. First,  please note that when the objective function is non-smooth (that is considered in this paper), it is challenging for an iterative algorithm to find a solution x_t such that dist(0, \\partial f(x_t))\\leq \\epsilon. We have given one example in the paper (see the paragraph after eq. (3)). Consider min |x|, for an iterative algorithm that produces a non-optimal solution x_t (that is not zero), then  dist(0, \\partial f(x_t)) is always 1. Indeed, this observation has been reported in several previous papers for non-smooth and non-convex optimization (Davis & Drusvyatskiy, 2018a; Drusvyatskiy & Paquette, 2018; Davis & Grimmer, 2017).  To address this issue, the convergence measure based on the Moreau envelope\u2019s gradient is used following these papers, which ensures that the found solution x_t is very close to a solution that is epsilon stationary. \n\nSecond, the good news. Actually, when the objective function is smooth, the upper bound of the the Moreau envelope\u2019s gradient\u2019s norm can be translated to an upper bound of the (projected) gradient\u2019 norm that is commonly used as a convergence for smooth functions. Please see eqn. (4) and (5) and texts around them in the revision. It means that in the smooth case (which is a special case of weakly convex), the convergence of the |\\nabla f_\\gamma(x_\\tau)| indeed transfers to a convergence of |\\nabla f(x_\\tau)|. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1475/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1475/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1475/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Universal  Stagewise Learning for Non-Convex Problems with  Convergence on  Averaged Solutions", "abstract": "Although stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method and its variants (e.g., stochastic momentum methods, AdaGrad) are algorithms of choice for solving non-convex problems (especially deep learning),  big gaps still remain between the theory and the practice with many questions unresolved.

In particular, the Natasha paper also developed a multi-stage algorithm for bounded non-convexity optimization problems by adding strongly-convex regularizers centered at iterates of previous stages. The authors should discuss more extensively the related work to clarify their novelty.\n\n(2) The convergence rate is measured by $\\nabla\\phi_\\gamma(x_\\tau)$. However, according to (3) , this only guarantees an upper bound on $\\text{dist}(0,\\partial\\phi_\\gamma(\\text{prox}_{\\gamma\\phi_\\gamma}(x_\\tau)))$. The output of the algorithm is $x_\\tau$ instead of $\\text{prox}_{\\gamma\\phi_\\gamma}(x_\\tau)$.

For example, there is still a lack of theories of convergence for SGD and its variants that use stagewise step size and return an averaged solution in practice. In addition, theoretical insights of why adaptive step size of AdaGrad could improve non-adaptive step size of SGD is still missing for non-convex optimization.   This paper aims to address these questions and fill the gap between theory and practice. We propose a universal stagewise optimization framework for a broad family of non-smooth non-convex problems with the following key features: (i) at each stage any suitable stochastic convex optimization algorithms (e.g., SGD  or AdaGrad)  that return an averaged solution can be employed for minimizing a regularized convex problem; (ii) the step size is decreased in  a stagewise manner; (iii)  an averaged solution  is returned as the final solution. % that is selected from all stagewise averaged solutions with sampling probabilities  increasing as the stage number. \nOur theoretical results of stagewise {\\ada}  exhibit its adaptive convergence, therefore shed insights on its faster convergence than stagewise SGD  for problems with slowly growing cumulative stochastic gradients. To the best of our knowledge, these new results are the first of their kind for addressing the unresolved issues of existing theories  mentioned earlier. Besides theoretical contributions, our empirical studies show that our stagewise variants of SGD, AdaGrad  improve the generalization performance of existing variants/implementations of SGD and AdaGrad.
