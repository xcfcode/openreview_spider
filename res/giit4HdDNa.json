The paper has two parts - supervised classification, and unsupervised image reconstruction and generation. In the supervised part, has good visualizations of the decision boundaries induced. The unsupervised part shows good comparisons with previous methods, and good visualizations of the reconstructed and generated images.\n\nStrengths\n\nThe paper is well organized. The images and figures are explained well. The graphs showing the trajectories of the Neural CODE are great for visualization. The paper provides enough details about training its networks.\n\nComments\n\nThe paper is split into two parts - supervised classification, and unsupervised modeling. The supervised classification part is highly related to the \u201cData Controlled Neural ODEs\u201d section in Massaroli et al (2020b), a paper that has been cited in the related work section but not addressed in the main content. In fact, the problems tackled (-x, concentric annuli) and the results are highly related to those of Massaroli et al (2020b). This issue needs to be addressed sufficiently.\n\nThe unsupervised section needs a lot more work. The experiments and tables can be described more effectively. For example, it would be preferable to clearly explain which row section 5.3 refers to in Figure 7, and which row corresponds to section 5.4.\n\nThe fact that the replacement of a linear layer with a Neural CODE improves image reconstruction quality should mean that all layers in the encoder can be replaced to give better encoding, taking care of dimensionality (such as in Normalizing Flows). In fact, generative modelling papers such as FFJORD, or Normalizing Flows, do replace all layers with a Neural ODE and map to a latent space of noise. However, this paper uses a typical neural network for image reconstruction and generation. This perhaps means that the majority of heavy-lifting is done by the decoder, hence the Neural CODE is more amenable to warping the latent space suitable for the decoder. For image generation as well, the latent space has been designed so that the decoder can produce nice images, this is not necessarily a win for the Neural CODE.\n\nTo make the case for Neural CODE, especially for images, higher resolution images need to be tackled, since it is in higher dimensions that the success of the advancements in the methods listed in Figure 7 lies.\n\nMassaroli et al.

Instead of directly learning the weights of the neural network parameterizing the vector field f of the ODE, the paper instead proposes to learn a controller that takes as input the initial state and outputs the initial weights of f and optionally also updates the weights of f as the ODE is solved. This allows the model to parameterize a family of (potentially time varying) vector fields instead of a single vector field. The authors go on to show that their model can be trained using an augmented adjoint method (similar to the adjoint method used in the original neural ODE paper).\n\nThe authors test the performance of the proposed model across a variety of tasks. First, they test their model on some of the toy problems proposed in the augmented neural ODEs paper. They show that their model can successfully learn mappings to represent the 1D reflection and 2D concentric annuli functions. For example, in the case where the model only learns a controller for the initial state, the model learns to map +1 and -1 to different vector fields, effectively allowing the model trajectories to cross. Similarly, in the case where the vector field is additionally controlled as time evolves, the model also allows states to cross and represent both functions. Second, the authors evaluate their model on a supervised learning task, showing that the proposed method improves performance on both MNIST and CIFAR10.\n\nFinally, the authors build an interesting new form of autoencoder based on their method. The autoencoder takes as input an image and outputs the initial weights of the vector field parameterizing an ODE. The authors then allow a fixed initial state to evolve in this vector field. The final state is then used to decode the model into the reconstructed image. Therefore, the latent information about the image is contained in the weights of the vector field as opposed to a latent vector as is usually the case. The authors evaluate their method on both CIFAR10 and CelebA using the methods from the deterministic autoencoder paper to endow their model with a latent space they can sample from. The results on both datasets are generally good.\n\n\n**Positives**\n- The paper is clearly written and the model is well explained. The figures are also nice.\n- The autoencoder experiments are interesting and novel.\n- The model performs well across a wide variety of tasks from toy problems to image classification and autoencoder like unsupervised learning.\n- The motivation for the paper is clear and fairly important: alleviating some of the representational weaknesses of neural ODEs and generally improving and extending neural ODE models by using time varying weights.\n\n**Negatives**\n- The paper is closely related to other works that have also focused on making the weights of neural ODEs time dependent. Data controlled neural ODEs from the dissecting neural ODEs paper are, as far as I can tell, exactly the same as the open loop model proposed in this paper. Further, the dissecting neural ODEs paper also proposes using time varying weights (as do some other papers), although not in exactly the same way as this paper. As such the novelty of this paper is quite limited (although the autoencoder experiments are, to the best of my knowledge novel). It would be good to have a more thorough discussion of the differences between these models to better understand where the novelty/contribution comes in.\n- The closed loop model (which is the main innovation) is thoroughly discussed in the paper. However, it seems like most experiments are actually performed with the open loop model (which is very similar to other models already proposed in the literature). The image classification experiments and the autoencoder experiments both use (as far as I can tell), the open loop model. The only place where the authors seem to use the closed loop model is in the toy experiments, where the model performs worse than the simpler open loop model. This does put into question whether the full closed loop model is actually useful in practice.\n- There is no evaluation of the number of functions evaluations in the paper (as far as I can see). According to the abstract, the model trains faster so it seems important to include this information in the paper.\n- The authors mention in the abstract that the model achieves state of the art reconstruction on CIFAR10. However, reconstruction doesn\u2019t really make sense as a task (since the identity function would be optimal in this case). It is interesting if the latent space learned is very low dimensional (i.e. the model compresses the dataset well), however there seems to be no discussion of this. So I feel like this claim is questionable and should be removed.\n\n**Recommendation**\nWhile the paper is well written and has thorough experiments, the proposed model is very closely related to several models that have already been proposed in the literature. Further, the full model seems to not be used in most of the experiments and appears to perform worse than the simplest version of the model. The autoencoder experiments however are quite compelling and novel and would likely be of interest to the ICLR community. I therefore recommend a weak accept.\n\n**Typos and small comments**\n- In the first sentence of the paper the word \u201copens\u201d seems like it shouldn\u2019t be there\n- The word \u201csuch\u201d is repeated on bottom of page 2\n- There are no labels on the Figure A.5 axes\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1916/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1916/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Go with the flow: Adaptive control for Neural ODEs", "authorids": ["~Mathieu_Chalvidal1", "~Matthew_Ricci1", "rufin.vanrullen@cnrs.fr", "~Thomas_Serre1"], "authors": ["Mathieu Chalvidal", "Matthew Ricci", "Rufin VanRullen", "Thomas Serre"], "keywords": ["Neural ODEs", "Optimal Control Theory", "Hypernetworks", "Normalizing flows"], "abstract": "Despite their elegant formulation and lightweight memory cost, neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) suffer from known representational limitations.

We have addressed these remarks in the revised manuscript and we believe the resulting theoretical and empirical description of our model is much strengthened as a result. In detail:\n\n - We have included a new passage in Sec. 3.1 in the  \u201cOpen-loop Control\u201d paragraph comparing NCODE to concurrent work by Massaroli and others. In this section, we state that appending data to the dynamic variable is one form of data control similar in spirit to the time-concatenation trick used to make NODEs non-autonomous systems, but that there are many forms of dynamics that we can explore, notably closed-loop control. Our formulation, which, unlike earlier work, makes an architectural distinction between controller and dynamics, makes generalization to this other type of control easy. \n\n- Consequently, and in light of your remark on the lack of experimental results for the closed-loop system, we have added a new experiment in which the special benefits of this formulation are more evident. \n\n- This experiment (new section 4.3) relies on our intuition that the closed-loop formulation is especially useful on problems involving non-stationary stimuli in which processing must occur \u201con-the-fly\u201d. This simulation shows how closed-loop NCODE vastly outperforms competing models on a pattern memorization task in which systems view several high-dimensional bit vectors and must then reconstruct a degraded version of one of them from memory. This new experiment shows how closed-loop control not only beats other continuous-time models, but also the open-loop NCODE formulation. It further empirically demonstrates the value of our system over the related open-loop formalism of Massaroli, in which controller and equation of motion are not architecturally distinct. \n\n- Finally, we agree with reviewer 1 on the image reconstruction claim. We changed the formulation in the abstract and body, now emphasizing the improvement that latent flows induce when added to a vanilla autoencoder. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1916/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1916/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Go with the flow: Adaptive control for Neural ODEs", "authorids": ["~Mathieu_Chalvidal1", "~Matthew_Ricci1", "rufin.vanrullen@cnrs.fr", "~Thomas_Serre1"], "authors": ["Mathieu Chalvidal", "Matthew Ricci", "Rufin VanRullen", "Thomas Serre"], "keywords": ["Neural ODEs", "Optimal Control Theory", "Hypernetworks", "Normalizing flows"], "abstract": "Despite their elegant formulation and lightweight memory cost, neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) suffer from known representational limitations.

We emphasized that we propose to solve an augmented adjoint system that encompasses the weights as control variables of the system.

The design of this experiment can already be read in section C.2.\n\n- We have reframed the unsupervised learning section to be specifically about the improvement in image generation caused by the addition of latent flows to a vanilla autoencoder. We thank the reviewer for the suggestion to explore the effect of NODE latent transformations, as we haven\u2019t tested this configuration. As our interest is not the absolute performance of our system compared to various other models (now redacted), we believe that comparisons to other continuous-time models can be left for future specific work.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1916/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1916/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Go with the flow: Adaptive control for Neural ODEs", "authorids": ["~Mathieu_Chalvidal1", "~Matthew_Ricci1", "rufin.vanrullen@cnrs.fr", "~Thomas_Serre1"], "authors": ["Mathieu Chalvidal", "Matthew Ricci", "Rufin VanRullen", "Thomas Serre"], "keywords": ["Neural ODEs", "Optimal Control Theory", "Hypernetworks", "Normalizing flows"], "abstract": "Despite their elegant formulation and lightweight memory cost, neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) suffer from known representational limitations.

Nevertheless, and we believe that a more explicit comparison between our work and this other material will strengthen the manuscript. In addition to discussing this other work in greater detail, we have also:\n\n - Added a brief section ( in Sec. 3.1., \u201cOpen-loop Control\u201d) comparing NCODE to the data-controlled NODEs of Massaroli et al. We note how two differ primarily by our notational decision to separate controller and dynamics into separate functions. We argue further, however, that this notational decision arises from our system\u2019s generalizability to non-stationary control parameters, which we note next. \n\n - Included a new experiment (Sec. 4.3) involving non-stationary input in which closed-loop NCODE performs favorably compared to the data-controlled NODEs of Massaroli et al., demonstrating the difference between our method and that of the other authors as well as the special value of our control formulation for non-stationary environments.\n\n - We also agree with the reviewer that the relative contributions of the decoder and latent NCODE representations to performance in the unsupervised setting were not explained clearly enough in the original manuscript. We have adjusted the manuscript to emphasize that that the encoder/decoder architectures in both the vanilla autoencoder and the NCODE version are identical so that, as the reviewer suggests, \u201c[N]CODE is more amenable to warping the latent space suitable for the decoder\u201d than having no warping at all. We have also added unsupervised clustering results on CIFAR-10 and MNIST for the AutoNCODE latent space which suggest that a different organization of the latent space from a vanilla autoencoder (Sec. C.7). \n\n - The reviewer\u2019s suggestion that the model should be applied to higher resolution images is well-taken and we hope to perform this experiment in the future.  In accordance with the reviewer\u2019s suggestion, we have reframed the image generation section of the paper to argue that NCODE can be used to boost the performance of a vanilla autoencoder architecture, producing competitive results on a well-worn data set, rather than act as a state-of-the-art supervised generative method in its own right. \n\n- Finally, we have corrected the typographical errors and clarified the presented results as pointed out by the reviewer. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1916/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1916/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Go with the flow: Adaptive control for Neural ODEs", "authorids": ["~Mathieu_Chalvidal1", "~Matthew_Ricci1", "rufin.vanrullen@cnrs.fr", "~Thomas_Serre1"], "authors": ["Mathieu Chalvidal", "Matthew Ricci", "Rufin VanRullen", "Thomas Serre"], "keywords": ["Neural ODEs", "Optimal Control Theory", "Hypernetworks", "Normalizing flows"], "abstract": "Despite their elegant formulation and lightweight memory cost, neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) suffer from known representational limitations.

Instead of learning a fixed set of parameters $\\theta$ that governs the ODE dynamic, the proposed approach learns dynamic parameters that evolve over time. The authors propose two variants of the methods: $\\textit{open-loop}$ and $\\textit{closed-loop}$. The former only maps the initial observation as the controller whereas $\\theta$ in the later model follows another NODE $g$. Model performance is demonstrated on several tasks. The model is shown to solve the well-known \"crossing curves\" problem, on which NODE fails. Also, it's demonstrated that the presented technique yields sharper images compared to VAEs and also better at classification and interpolation. \n\nOverall Score: I recommend an accept. \n- First of all, the presented N-CODE method solves one of the most crucial limitations of NODEs in a principled manner. The model is also shown to outperform the vanilla Augmented NODE method.\n- The results are very impressive. Both the tables and generated images/interpolations are of high-quality, especially given VAEs don't excel at this task.\n- The method has certain overlaps with the control theory and maximum principle, deep generative models, and neural nets with adaptive weights. So I believe such connections would open new research avenues.\n\nCons: I would be happy if the below are addressed:\n- Did you investigate how the model performance changes as f grows? I speculate that learning the parameters of a neural network via another neural network(s) is a very challenging problem, and would like to see this is verified or not. Also, I cannot see the architecture of f in your experiments (looking at Table A.1).\n- Connection with control theory can be made clear. As such, there is very little reference to Pontryagin's maximum principle and the link is not visible (at least to me).\n- Did you test vanilla NODE on experiments 5.3 and 5.4? The virtue of N-CODE is obvious on the toy problem (as expected) and somewhat significant on the classification task. I'm wondering when NODE is latent (as in 5.3-5.4), is the improvement significant?\n\nAdditional comment: Is Figure-4 caption correct?", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1916/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1916/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Go with the flow: Adaptive control for Neural ODEs", "authorids": ["~Mathieu_Chalvidal1", "~Matthew_Ricci1", "rufin.vanrullen@cnrs.fr", "~Thomas_Serre1"], "authors": ["Mathieu Chalvidal", "Matthew Ricci", "Rufin VanRullen", "Thomas Serre"], "keywords": ["Neural ODEs", "Optimal Control Theory", "Hypernetworks", "Normalizing flows"], "abstract": "Despite their elegant formulation and lightweight memory cost, neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) suffer from known representational limitations.

In particular, the single flow learned by NODEs cannot express all homeomorphisms from a given data space to itself, and their static weight parameterization restricts the type of functions they can learn compared to discrete architectures with layer-dependent weights. Here, we describe a new module called neurally-controlled ODE (N-CODE) designed to improve the expressivity of NODEs. The parameters of N-CODE modules are dynamic variables governed by a trainable map from initial or current activation state, resulting in forms of open-loop and closed-loop control, respectively. A single module is sufficient for learning a distribution on non-autonomous flows that adaptively drive neural representations. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that N-CODE circumvents limitations of previous NODEs models and show how increased model expressivity manifests in several supervised and unsupervised learning problems. These favorable empirical results indicate the potential of using data- and activity-dependent plasticity in neural networks across numerous domains.", "one-sentence_summary": "This paper presents a new method to enhance Neural ODEs representation power by dynamically controlling their weight parametrization.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "chalvidal|go_with_the_flow_adaptive_control_for_neural_odes", "pdf": "/pdf/0bc3128fc75eed11fbdd877970104113788935e4.pdf", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Poster", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nchalvidal2021go,\ntitle={Go with the flow: Adaptive control for Neural {\\{}ODE{\\}}s},\nauthor={Mathieu Chalvidal and Matthew Ricci and Rufin VanRullen and Thomas Serre},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=giit4HdDNa}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
