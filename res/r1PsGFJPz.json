The authors give a thorough and detailed review of the main difference between classic active learning (AL) and batch active learning. The motivation of using batch AL is intuitive and the proposed framework has a clear structure which considers both the query item's quality and query item's diversity. \n\nHowever, a few things could be improved, and below are the detailed comments:\n- The authors simply utilize the product of the probability of quality and diversity as the criteria. What is the intuitive of using such kind of final distribution? Are these two have to be independent? It would be interesting to consider their correlation as well. With the increasing number of items, the diversity of items (defined using the vector angle) could be very difficult to be guaranteed. This diversity criterion could have limited selection power in your batch AL.\n- Regarding the experiment, the selection of parameters B and M seems like to be heuristic choices. Please elaborate the reasons for using these values.\n- The experiment only considers the batch AL. If the authors have claimed the effectiveness of batch AL, the comparison between batch AL and AL should be listed in the experimental section.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Meta-Learning for Batch Mode Active Learning", "abstract": "Active learning involves selecting unlabeled data items to label in order to best improve an existing classifier.
