Then we output all the long entities which have overlappings with other known entities. Invalid entity pairs are filtered by a manual check by humans. In this way, we obtain a dictionary which stores long entities and it's containing short entities. Using this entity-containing dictionary, we labeled these short entities in the sentences where the long entities are labeled. The whole dataset cannot be released directly due to the copyright issues on the original CONLL2003 dataset and OntoNotes 5.0 dataset. However, we can release the entity-containing dictionary and the pipeline scripts. Through data processing, the MG datasets can be easily recovered if the original CONLL2003 dataset and OntoNotes 5.0 dataset are accessible.\n\n2, Traditional NER task is addressed by sequence labeling models. However, entities in the same sentence may have overlaps. Our proposed model is able to overcome the weakness of sequential labeling schema and recognize overlapping entity recognition by proposing entities first and then classifying them into different categories.\n\n3, Bad cases where MG NER fails:\n\n\u201cOf course , it was discovered that his men 's basketball coach had directly given six grand to a Yugoslavian recruit , but that was just his stipend for travel and coach Jim O'Brien was just having a problem with the currency exchange rates ... right Andy ?\u201d, is a test instance in the ACE2005 dataset.

In order to limit the number of generated proposals, we set the maximum length of an entity proposal to R.\n3) $t$ in Eq 5 should be updated as $r$.\n\nWe've updated these typos in the revised version.\n\n2, For generating proposals:\n\tThe max length of an entity proposal is set as R. We use a sliding window to generate entity proposals that revolve around each token position. For each token position k, we will generate R entity proposals with length varies from 1 to R. \n\n\tFor example, we have an utterance with \"t1, t2, t3, t4, t5\" and R is set as 5. We will generate 5 proposals revolving around t1, 5 proposals revolving around t2, 5 proposals revolving around t3, ..., 5 proposals revolving around t5. The way five proposals are devised guarantee that each candidate entity within the max length will be captured by one of the proposals at a certain token position. Figure 3 shows an example of the five proposals generated at t3. \n\tWe also generate proposals for other token positions using the same strategy.\n\tFor t1, we will generate 5 proposals: (t1),(t1,t2),(t0,t1,t2),(t0,t1,t2,t3),(t-1,t0,t1,t2,t3).\n\tFor t2, we will generate 5 proposals: (t2),(t2,t3),(t1,t2,t3),(t1,t2,t3,t4),(t0,t1,t2,t3,t4).\n\tFor t4, we will generate 5 proposals: (t4),(t4,t5),(t3,t4,t5),(t3,t4,t5,t6),(t2,t3,t4,t5,t6).\n\tFor t5, we will generate 5 proposals: (t5),(t5,t6),(t4,t5,t6),(t4,t5,t6,t7),(t3,t4,t5,t6,t7).\n\n\tProposals that contain invalid indexes like (t0,t1,t2), (t5, t6) will be deleted. Hence we can obtain all the valid entity proposals under the condition that the max length is R.\n\n3, The R in this sentence, \"s_k contains 2R scores including R scores for being an entity and R scores for not being an entity at position k\", is a number. We use a two-class softmax function to determine the quality of an entity proposal. For each proposal, we will have one score for being an entity and one score for not being an entity. And there are R entity proposals at position k. So, we have 2R scores for each token position at k and s_k is a vector with dimension 2*R.\n\n4, Our system is composed of two modules: the Proposal Network and the Classification Network. The Proposal Network generates proposals on possible entity candidates, where the classification network determines the entity type for each entity candidate. To this end, we provide the experiment results to evaluate the performance of the proposal network on the multi-grained ner task in Table 3 and the performance on the traditional ner task in Table 5.\n\n5, We\u2019ve updated our table with baselines [4, 5, 6] in the revised paper. [1] is proposed as a multi-task learning problem, hence we didn't compare with this model.

The model obtain good performance on both Multi-grained NER task and traditional NER task. The paper is in general well written, the idea of proposal network break the traditional framework of sequence tagging formulation in NER task and thus can be effectively applied to detect overlapped named entities.\n\nHowever, I still have many concerns regarding the notation, the novelty of the paper, and the comparison with related literature, especially on previous overlapped span detection NER papers. The detailed concerns and questions are as follows:\nThe notations are very confusing. Many of the notations are not defined. For example, what does $T$ in $2D_sl*2T$ below Eq. 4 indicates?  What does $R$ scores means? I guess $R$ does not equal to number of entity types, but I\u2019m not sure what $R$ exactly indicates. If $R$ is not number of entity types, why do you need R scores for being an entity and R scores for not being an entity? And what is $t$ in Eq 5? Is that entity type id or something else?\nI\u2019m still confused how you select the entity spans from a large number of entity candidates. In Figure 5, if the max window length is 5, there may be more span candidates than the listed 5 examples, such as t_3 t_4 t_5. How do you prune it out?\nTable 5 is weird. There is not comparison with any baselines but just a report of the performance with this system. I don\u2019t know what point this table is showing.\nThis is not the first paper that enumerates all possible spans for NER task.The idea of enumerating possible spans for NER task has appeared in [1] and can also effectively detect overlapped span. I would like to see the performance comparison between the two systems. The enumerating span ideas has been applied in many other tasks as well such as coreference resolution [2]and SRL[3], none of which is mentioned in related work.\nI feel that most of the gain is from ELMo but not the model architecture itself, since in Table 4, the improvement from the ELMo is only 0.06. The LSTM-LSTM-CRF is without adding ELMo, which is not a fair comparison. \nThe comparison of baselines is not adequate and is far from enough. The paper only compares with LSTM+CRF frameworks, which are not designed for detecting overlapped spans. There are many papers on detecting overlapping spans, such as [4], [5] and [6]. It\u2019s important to compare with those paper since those methods are especially designed for overlapped span NER tasks.\n[1] Multi-Task Identification of Entities, Relations, and Coreferencefor Scientific Knowledge Graph Construction, EMNLP 2018\n[2] End-to-end neural coreference resolution, EMNLP 2017\n[3] Jointly predicting predicates and arguments in neural semantic role labeling, ACL 2018\n[4] Nested Named Entity Recognition Revisited, NAACL 2018\n[5] A Neural Layered Model for Nested Named Entity Recognition, NAACL 2018\n[6] Neural Segmental Hypergraphs for Overlapping Mention Recognition, EMNLP 2018", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1468/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-Grained Entity Proposal Network for Named Entity Recognition", "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on a new Named Entity Recognition (NER) task, i.e., the Multi-grained NER task.

Authors propose a Multi-grained Entity Proposal Network (MGEPN) which comprises (1) a Proposal Network that determines entity boundaries, and (2) a Classification network that classifies each proposed segment of an entity.\n\nThe task is primarily tested against the proposed method itself. The proposed method does outperform traditional sequence-labeling baseline model (LSTM-LSTM-CRF), validating the proposed approach. When the proposed model (trained with extra MG data) is evaluated on the traditional NER task (on test sets), however, no significant improvement is observed -- I believe this result is understandable though, because e.g. MG datasets have slightly different label distributions from original datasets, hence likely to result in lower recall, etc.\n\n<Comments>\nThe task studied is interesting, and can potentially benefit other downstream applications that consume NER results -- although it seems as though similar tasks have been studied prior to this study. The novelty of the proposed architecture is moderate - while each component of the model does not have too much technical novelty, the idea of separating the model into a proposal network and a classifier seems to be a new approach in the context of NER (that diverges from the traditional sequence labelling approaches), and is reasonably designed for the proposed task.\n\nThe details for creating the MG datasets is missing - are they labeled by human labelers, or bootstrapped? Experts or crowd-sourced? By how many people? Will the new datasets be released? Please provide clarifications.\n\nThe proposed approach does not or barely outperform base models when tested on the traditional NER task -- the proposed work thus can be strengthened by better illustrating the motivation of the MGNER task and/or validating its efficacy in other downstream tasks, etc. \f\n\nAuthors could provide better insights into the new proposed task by providing more in-depth error analysis - especially the cases when MG NER fails as well (e.g. when coarse-grained prediction predicts a false positive named-entity, etc.)\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1468/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-Grained Entity Proposal Network for Named Entity Recognition", "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on a new Named Entity Recognition (NER) task, i.e., the Multi-grained NER task.
