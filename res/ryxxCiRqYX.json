Experiments show that replacing a block of layers with multiple iterations of the corresponding solver improves classification accuracy. My detailed comments are as follows. \n\n*Positive points: \n\n1. The perspective is novel and interesting, i.e., training a forward pass through a dropout layer followed by a linear layer and a non-linear activation is equivalent to optimizing a convex problem by a Proximal Stochastic Gradient method. More importantly, this perspective has been theoretically verified. \n\n2. In the experiments, training networks with solvers replacing deep layers is able to improve accuracy significantly. \n\n*Negative points:\n\n1. Some technical details are not clear and many notations are used without clear explanations. Specifically, many notations based on (Bibi & Ghanem, 2017) make the paper hard to follow. Moreover, there are many mistakes in proofs. Please revise the paper according to the following comments.\n\n2. There are many limitations for the proposed method. Specifically, the theoretical results are hard to be extended to more general neural networks (e.g., ResNet) with Batch Normalization which are widely used.\n\n3. The experiment section should be significantly improved. There are only two datasets (i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100). It would be convincing that more baselines are compared on other datasets, such as ImageNet.\n\n*Detailed comments:\n\n**Comments on technical issues.\n\n1. In Problem (1), the definition of $g(x)$ and $f\u00ac_i()$ should be provided for clarity.\n\n2. The motivation and some details of Function (2) should be provided since $F(x^l)$ is important for proving the equivalence between stochastic solvers and a forward network. In addition, $x$ should be corrected as $x^l$.\n\n3. Is Equation (3) wrong? Based on the definition of Prox-GD in (Xiao & Zhang, 2014), it should be $x^l=Prox(x^{l-1} \u2013 1/L \\nabla F(x^l)) = Prox((I-1/L A)x^{l-1} + 1/L (AA^T x^l + b))$ which is different from Equation (3). Moreover, the Lipschitz constant w.r.t. maximal eigenvalue should be proved.\n\n4. In Definitions D.1 and D.2, what is the definition of $fold_{H0}$? Is the dimensionality of $bdiag(D)$ wrong? Why is $bdiag(D)$ an identity mapping when $n_3=n_4$?\n\n5. There are some issues on Equation (7) and its proofs. Is $A(:, i, :, :)$ and $\\vec{X}(i, :, :, :) $ wrong? It affects the results of Equation (8). Does Equation (25) miss the operator $fold_{HO}$ in Appendix G? Please check the proofs of Proposition 1.\n\n6. There are some issues on proofs of Lemma 2. Why are $F_H \\otimes F_W \\otimes I_{n_1}$ and $F_H \\otimes F_W \\otimes I_{n_2}$ orthogonal? Is the third and fourth equality in (24) wrong? For the fourth equality in (24), Eigen decomposition seems to be for a matrix, not a tensor.\n\n\n**Comments on Experiments\n\n1. Training Networks is equivalent to optimizing proximal solvers. Why can training networks with solvers replacing blocks of layers improve accuracy? Reasonable explanations should be provided.\n\n2. Optimizing a convex optimization problem can easily obtain the optimal solution. What happens if solvers are used to replace more blocks of layers? Complexity analysis for these should be provided.\n\n3. The experiments are only conducted on two datasets (i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100). It would be better to compared more baselines on other datasets, such as ImageNet.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper863/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Layers as Stochastic Solvers", "abstract": "We provide a novel perspective on the forward pass through a block of layers in a deep network.

Is the third and fourth equalities in (24) wrong? On the fourth equality in (24).\n\nThe proof in Lemma 2 is correct. First, note that the normalized DFT matrices $\\mathbf{F}_{H}$ and $\\mathbf{F}_W$ and the identity matrix $\\mathbf{I}$ are orthogonal/unitary. It is trivial to prove using properties of the Kronecker product that the Kronecker product of orthogonal matrices is an orthogonal matrix. Note that for matrices $\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{B},\\mathbf{C},\\mathbf{D}$ of appropriate sizes, $(\\mathbf{A} \\otimes \\mathbf{B})^\\top = \\mathbf{A}^\\top \\otimes \\mathbf{B}^\\top$ and $(\\mathbf{A} \\otimes \\mathbf{B}) (\\mathbf{C} \\otimes \\mathbf{D}) = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{C} \\otimes \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{D}$. Using the previous properties, the proof follows trivially. The only typo is in the text below Eq (24). $\\mathcal{\\hat{A}}(:,:,i,j) \\mathcal{\\hat{A}}^{\\textbf{H}}(:,:,i,j) = \\mathbf{U}_{ij} \\Sigma_{ij} \\mathbf{U}^{\\mathbf{H}}_{ij}$. That is, we are performing an eigendecomposition of the faces of the tensors which are matrices. We have corrected the typo and changed the notation a bit in Eq (24) for further clarity.\n\nComments on Experiments.\n\n(1) Training Networks is equivalent to optimizing proximal solvers. Why can training networks with solvers replacing blocks of layers improve accuracy? Reasonable explanations should be provided.\n\nIn general, we do not have theoretical generalization bounds justifying the improvement. However, similar observations [6,7] have been made in various contexts upon designing networks. It seems that the recurrent structure in hidden activations has merits in improving generalization but no one has thorough theoretical foundations for this yet. Such behaviour has also been observed very recently in [8] where ODE solvers are used rather than optimization solvers. Our hypothesis is that since the output of a feed-forward network approximates the optimal solution of some convex optimization in each layer, attaining better solutions by performing more iterations of the corresponding solver may improve accuracy.\n\n\n(2) Optimizing a convex objective can easily obtain the optimal solution. What happens if solvers are used to replace more blocks of layers? Complexity analysis for these should be provided.\n\nOptimizing convex objectives is easier than other problems in the sense of global optimality guarantees and analysis of various deterministic and stochastic algorithms. However, achieving high accuracy solutions may still require performing a large number of iterations (e.g., $>10^3$). In our framework, larger number of iterations will increase the computational complexity of the network, particularly during training. On the other hand, replacing more blocks of layers with solvers (each with a small number of iterations) has the potential to improve the performance as highlighted in Table (4). However, replacing more blocks of feed-forward networks with solvers will suffer from diminishing returns, i.e. the improvements will tend to be smaller with more blocks replaced with solvers. This is firstly because many networks are already close to saturating datasets (e.g., VGG16 on CIFAR10). That is to say that the baseline networks are already achieving high accuracy ($> 90\\%$). Secondly, some networks do not have enough capacity to improve on certain datasets (e.g., AlexNet on CIFAR-100). Note that replacing blocks of layers with solvers does not increase capacity; thus the improvement is attributed to the new structure and not to any form of over-parameterization of the network. As for complexity, adding $t$ layers of a solver is as expensive as performing $t$ feed-forward passes through a single layer."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper863/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper863/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper863/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Layers as Stochastic Solvers", "abstract": "We provide a novel perspective on the forward pass through a block of layers in a deep network.

As suggested by R2 and R3, we have added further details and examples in the first page. Note that for instance, if $f_i(\\mathbf{a}_i^\\top \\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{a}_i^\\top \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}_i)^2$ and $g(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2^2$, we recover ridge regression, while with $g(\\mathbf{x}) = \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_1$ we recover LASSO regression.\n\n(2) The motivation and some details of Function (2). In addition, $x$ should be corrected as $x^l$.\n\nThe missing superscript was corrected. It is not clear to us what R2 is asking for in terms of extra motivation and details. Could you clarify, so that we can alleviate this concern in the paper?\n\n(3) Is Equation (3) wrong?\n\nNo, Eq (3) is correct. Note that $\\mathbf{x}^l$ is the optimization variable while $\\mathbf{x}^{l-1}$ is a fixed optimization parameter. R2 is confusing $\\mathbf{x}^{l-1}$ (the activation output of the $l-1$ layer) with the optimization variable  $\\mathbf{x}^l$ (the output activations of layer $l$). Thus, unlike what is stated by R2, the Prox-GD update has the following form: $\\mathbf{x}^l \\leftarrow \\text{Prox} \\left(\\mathbf{x}^l - \\frac{1}{L} \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}^l)\\right)$.  Consequently, we have $\\mathbf{x}^l \\leftarrow \\text{Prox} \\left(\\mathbf{x}^l - \\frac{1}{L}\\left(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{A}^\\top\\mathbf{x}^l - \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}^{l-1} - \\mathbf{b}\\right)\\right)$, which is identical to Eq (3). Lastly, R2 is asking to prove ``the Lipschitz constant w.r.t. maximal eigenvalue''. We do not understand the request. It is well-known that the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of $F(\\mathbf{x}^l)$ induces the tightest quadratic upper bound for the smooth part $F(\\mathbf{x})$. This leads to the optimal largest step size $\\frac{1}{L}$ in Prox-GD. This is well-known and straightforward to show [5]. \n\n(4) Definition of $\\text{fold}_{\\text{H0}}(.)$? Is the dimensionality of $\\text{bdiag}(\\mathcal{D})$ wrong? Why is $\\text{bdiag}(\\mathcal{D})$ an identity mapping when $n_3=n_4$?\n\na) The definition of $\\text{fold}_{\\text{HO}}(.)$ can be found in [11] and in [12] for third-order tensors. The operator $\\text{fold}_{\\text{H0}}(.)$ reshapes the elements of a matrix into a tensor. The precise reshape procedure can be best described as the inverse reshape to the tensor-to-matrix unfold operator $\\text{MatVec}_{\\text{HO}}(.)$ such that the following holds: $\\text{fold}_{\\text{HO}} \\left(\\text{MatVec}_{HO}\\left(\\mathcal{A}\\right)\\right)= \\mathcal{A}$. For example, for a third-order tensor $\\mathcal{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_1 \\times n_2 \\times n_3}$, $\\text{MatVec}_{\\text{HO}}\\left(\\mathcal{A}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_1 n_3 \\times n_2}$, which is a matrix, while $\\text{fold}_{\\text{HO}} \\left(\\text{MatVec}_{HO}\\left(\\mathcal{A}\\right)\\right)$ reshapes that matrix into the original tensor $\\mathcal{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_1 \\times n_2 \\times n_3}$.\n\nb) Regarding $\\text{bdiag}(\\mathcal{D})$, there are indeed two typos. The dimensionality of $\\text{bdiag}(\\mathcal{D})$ is $\\mathbb{C}^{n_1 n_3 n_4 \\times n_2 n_3 n_4}$. If $n_3 = n_4 = 1$ then $\\text{bdiag}(\\mathcal{D})$ is an identity mapping. We have corrected the typos in the revision.\n\n(5) Some issues in Eqs (7,8). Does Eq (25) miss the operator $\\text{fold}_{\\text{H0}(.)}$ in Appendix G?\n\t\nEqs (7,8,25) are correct with nothing missing. Eq (25) is not missing any operator. The reason $\\text{fold}_{\\text{HO}}(.)$ did not appear in Eq (25) simply follows from the fact that the Frobenius norm of a tensor and the Frobenius norm of the unfolded tensor are identical since $\\text{fold}_{\\text{HO}}(.)$ performs reordering of the elements. That is, $\\|\\text{MatVec}_{\\text{HO}} \\left(\\mathcal{A}\\right)\\|_F^2 = \\|\\text{fold}_{\\text{HO}}\\left(\\text{MatVec}_{\\text{HO}} \\left(\\mathcal{A}\\right)\\right)\\|_F^2$. This has also been discussed in the text below Eq (23) as this identity appears there too.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper863/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper863/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper863/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Layers as Stochastic Solvers", "abstract": "We provide a novel perspective on the forward pass through a block of layers in a deep network.

This response is in Appendix M. The mathematical notation is easier to read in the PDF.\n\nWe thank R3 for the positive review and feedback. Below are our responses to all concerns.\n\nOn the major concerns.\n\n(1) Some clarity on the forward/backward pass of networks with Prox solvers.\n\nR3's description of the forward pass through the network with a Prox solver is correct. In general, the best way to understand how a network with a Prox solver operates in both forward and backward passes is to think of that layer with a Prox solver as a recurrent neural network. Thus, asking how one performs a backward pass through such a layer is equivalent to asking how one would perform a backward pass through a recurrent neural network. The backward pass through the Prox solver is still performed: not through the original network as R3 thought, but through the same network with the Prox solver, akin to backpropagation-through-time (BPTT). This resembles the parameter update procedure in recurrent neural networks.\n\n(2) Adjusting baselines to perform the same amount of computation for a fair comparison.\n\nR3 is correct about the fact that networks with Prox solvers do in fact perform more computation. However, the capacity of both networks (baseline and the Prox solver network) is identical. This means that both networks have the same exact number of parameters and there is no advantage of the Prox solvers in terms of capacity over the baseline. This is the essential factor for a fair comparison, since accuracy is often considered as a function of network capacity rather than the amount of computation. Moreover, note that to the best of our knowledge we have reported the best results for the baselines in comparison to any publicly available online repository that performs training without using any test data statistics (i.e. proper training). For instance, the results of VGG16 on CIFAR-10 are comparable to or better than some ResNet architectures on the same dataset. We are not aware of better numbers for the corresponding networks on the corresponding datasets. \n\nOn the minor issues.\n\n(1) Missing definitions.\n\nWe have addressed this in the revised version. We provided several examples of $g(\\mathbf{x})$ when it was first introduced in the first page. We have explicitly, as suggested, defined $p$ in Proposition 1.\n\n(2) Give examples of where the prox problems in Table 1 show up in practice (outside of activation functions in neural networks).\n\nWe are only aware of applications in activation functions in neural networks. But this is sufficient motivation for us.\n\n(3) On the statement ``for different choices of dropout rate the baseline can always be improved by...\" in the Experiments.\n\nWe have softened the statement in the revision. The statement is now ``we observe that for different choices of dropout rate the baseline performance improves upon replacing ...\".\n\n(4) Include results for Dropout rate p=0 in Table 5.\n\nWe have added this experiment to Table 5."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper863/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper863/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper863/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Layers as Stochastic Solvers", "abstract": "We provide a novel perspective on the forward pass through a block of layers in a deep network.

This is for the forward pass through the network. As for backpropagation, it is performed by simply unrolling the layers.

This connection is quite interesting. They further relate different stochastic prox algorithms to different dropout  layers and show results of improved performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 on several architectures. The paper is well-written.\n\nMajor Concerns:\n\n1. While the equivalence of one iteration of a prox algorithm and a single forward pass of the block is understandable, it is not clear what happens from making several iterations (10 in the case of fully-connected layers in the experiments) of the prox algorithm. It seems that this would be equivalent to making a forward pass through 10 equivalent blocks (i.e., 10 layers with the same weights and biases). But then the backward pass is still through the original network, so the problem being solved is not clear. Clarity on this would help.\n\n2. Since the equivalence of 10 forward passes of a block are done at each iteration, using solvers does more computations (can be thought of as extra forward passes through extra layers as noted above), which makes the comparison not completely fair. Either adding more batches or more passes over the same batch multiple times (or at least for a few batches just to use the some computational power) would be more fair and likely improve the performance of the baseline networks.\n\nMinor Issues:\n\n1. missing definitions such as g(x) at beginning of Section 3 and p in Proposition 1.\n\n2.
