In contrast to most other models, the model does not apply a weighted average pooling in the earlier layers of the network but only in the last layer. Instead, the features are reweighted in each layer with the predicted attention.\n\n1.\tContribution of approach: The approach to use attention in this way is to my knowledge novel and interesting.\n2.\tQualitative results: \n2.1.\tI like the large number of qualitative results; however, I would have wished the focus would have been less on the \u201cnumber\u201d dataset and more on the Visual Genome dataset.\n2.2.\tThe qualitative results for the Genome dataset unfortunately does not provide the predicted attributes. It would be interesting to see e.g. the highest predicted attributes for a given query. So far the results only show the intermediate results.\n3.\tQualitative results:\n3.1.\tThe paper presents results on two datasets, one simulated dataset as well as Visual Genome. On both it shows moderate but significant improvements over related approaches.\n3.2.\tFor the visual genome dataset, it would be interesting to include a quantitative evaluation how good the localization performance is of the attention approach.\n3.3.\tIt would be interesting to get a more detailed understanding of the model by providing results for different CNN layers where the attention is applied.\n4.\tIt would be interesting to see results on more established tasks, e.g. VQA, where the model should similarly apply.

Experiments on VQA\nVQA takes a free-form question as an input, so it is different from the attribute prediction task where the input is just an object and the output is designed to be its attribute. Although attribute prediction task can be regarded as a special VQA question type, but general VQA problems contain a lot more variety of questions. On the other hand, for the attribute prediction task, the target objects are often small in size, so precise attention with detailed spatial extent on the target objects are essential for correctly predicting their attributes. However, for many types of questions in VQA, precise attention covering an object extent is often not required. Even with these differences, we have conducted additional experiments on VQA with a na\u00efve extension of PAN (using skip-thought vector to encode questions and treat it as an attention target) but this na\u00efve extension did not give much performance gain. In order to apply the proposed model more appropriately for VQA, we need to use natural language processing to parse and understand questions and model multi-step attention processing pipeline such as attention for a target object, attention combination, attention transformation as in the work of \u2018Neural Module Networks\u2019, which we can explore as a future work."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Progressive Attention Networks for Visual Attribute Prediction", "abstract": "We propose a novel attention model which can accurately attend to target objects of various scales and shapes in images.

Here are our responses to your comments.\n\n1. comparison to STN with multiple transformer layers (STN-M)\nThe proposed progressive attention model can attend to the precise region of the target object by predicting attention maps with fine-grained shapes. In contrast, the shape of the attended regions in STN is constrained by a predefined transformation type such as affine transformation. The same limitation exists even with multiple transformation layers (STN-M). Note that the ability to attend to precise spatial support of object is crucial for predicting some attributes e.g. colors. In addition, the proposed method can also attend to a variable number of isolated regions (i.e. multi-modal target distribution) simultaneously whereas the number of attended regions of STN is fixed when the network is designed. Also, STN is developed in the context of classification tasks while our model is designed for attribute prediction.\nAs you suggested, we conducted experiments on using STN with multiple transformer layers (STN-M) for our task and the results are reported in Table. 1a. Although STN-M performs better on simple settings such as MREF than other baselines (reported in our paper), but is still far from the accuracy of the proposed method. Moreover, the performance of STN-M drops significantly as the task becomes more difficult and is even lower than the other baselines on MBG. Finally, STN-M could not learn proper spatial attention process on Visual Genome but learned a coding system of the query to fit the query-specific biases through transformations. The transformer layers generated padded images of different sizes and rotations to encode the query vector. We included these experiments related to STN-M in the updated paper.\n\n2. comparison to dasNet [Deep Networks with Internal Selective Attention through Feedback Connections]\nWhile a channel-wise attention process is applied to multiple layers of the network in dasNet, there is no \u201cspatial\u201d attention. Our task requires to have an attention to local regions specified by the query. More importantly, extending dasNet to our tasks is not trivial for the following reasons: First, to build a dasNet for our target task, we need to assume that a pretrained attribute classifier is available prior to learning attention. Second, query module needs to be integrated in the network for feature manipulation. Finally, the network is not end-to-end trainable while the task itself involves the attention process. We added this paper in the related work section.\n\n3. localization networks of baselines\nThe attention functions in our experiments are depicted in Figure 5b for MNIST Reference and in Appendix Figure 9c for VG and are shared among all the networks including baselines. Note that the local context of $\\mathcal{F}^l_{i, j}$ is only used in PAN-CTX.\n\n4. performance improvements on Visual Genome\nThe performance improvement is much larger on the MNIST Reference experiment than the VG experiment as the former benefits more directly from accurate attention maps while the latter has higher uncertainty on attribute prediction even if the resulting attention map is reasonable. Note that as shown in Table. 2, the proposed method achieves 29.38% mAP while the baseline (SAN) achieves 27.62% on VG. It appears to be a small improvement, but it is still 6.37% relative improvement on mAP. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Progressive Attention Networks for Visual Attribute Prediction", "abstract": "We propose a novel attention model which can accurately attend to target objects of various scales and shapes in images.

Instead, we first accumulated all the raw attention maps and then rescaled the accumulated map once to obtain final maps for visualization.\n\nThanks,\nPaul"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Progressive Attention Networks for Visual Attribute Prediction", "abstract": "We propose a novel attention model which can accurately attend to target objects of various scales and shapes in images.
