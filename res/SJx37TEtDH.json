The paper also gave a theoretical result showing that Adam converges in the regime of heavy-tailed noise. \n\n\nThe experiment finding is quite surprising to me, since many papers (see e.g. \nA Tail-Index Analysis of Stochastic Gradient Noise in Deep Neural Networks\n)  claim that the SGD noise is heavy-tailed for image recognization tasks such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100. The referred paper used rigorous statistical testing for the tail-index of the SGD noise, while this paper simply drew some image. \n\n\nMoreover, the theoretical result in this paper also worries me quite a bit, since from the bounds it seems that Adam is the dominating algorithm (both in the heavy-tail case and in Gaussian tail case). Moreover, SGD also converges in the heavy-tail noise case (by showing that the norm of x_t is not too large during the training process using martingale-based argument). Hence, the upper bound of the theoretical result is convincing enough to claim that Adam is better than SGD in certain regime. \n\n\nAfter Rebuttal: I have read the authors' responses and acknowledge the sensibility of the statement.

We address the reviewer\u2019s questions as follows:\n\n1. Gaussianity of Resnet noise: (Simsekli et al. 2019) plot the individual coordinates of the noise vector, whereas we examine the norm of the noise vector. The latter is more relevant for the convergence of SGD. Replicating the tail-index tests of (Simsekli et al. 2019) on the norm of the noise vectors confirms that Resnet is indeed gaussian (has alpha \u2248 2) and that BERT is heavy-tailed (has alpha \u2248 1). We refer to Appendix H of the updated version for details. Other recent papers (e.g. Panigrahi et al. 2019 \u201cNon-Gaussianity of stochastic gradient noise\u201d) also dispute the validity of the results in (Simsekli et al. 2019) due to estimating tail index of per-coordinate noise as a scalar random variable instead of the norm of a vector valued variable. Their results corroborate with our findings that Resnet has Gaussian noise.  \n\n\n2. Convergence of SGD with heavy tailed noise: Our theory suggests that whenever there is heavy-tailed noise, Adam will outperform SGD. In such situations, the variance is potentially infinite making the iterates of SGD unstable. The martingale concentration suggested by the reviewer requires sub-gaussian noise and cannot occur with heavy-tailed noise (see Appendix A for a formal treatment). Note that Adam (and Acclip) do not have this issue and converge even with heavy-tailed noise.\n\n3. Convergence with sub-gaussian noise: On the other hand, if the noise is sub-gaussian then indeed SGD converges and the martingale concentration mentioned by the reviewer kicks in. In such cases, Adam and Acclip do not have any advantage over SGD. Thus, our theory perfectly reflects our experimental results and we see no discrepancy.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper463/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper463/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Why ADAM Beats SGD for Attention Models\t", "authors": ["Jingzhao Zhang", "Sai Praneeth Karimireddy", "Andreas Veit", "Seungyeon Kim", "Sashank J Reddi", "Sanjiv Kumar", "Suvrit Sra"], "authorids": ["jzhzhang@mit.edu", "sai.karimrieddy@epfl.ch", "aveit@google.com", "seungyeonk@google.com", "sashank@google.com", "sanjivk@google.com", "suvrit@mit.edu"], "keywords": ["Optimization", "ADAM", "Deep learning"], "TL;DR": "Adaptive methods provably beat SGD in training attention models due to existence of heavy tailed noise.", "abstract": "While stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is still the de facto algorithm in deep learning, adaptive methods like Adam have been observed to outperform SGD across important tasks, such as attention models.

In other word, it's much easier to conclude that one distribution is more heavy-tailed than another, as opposed to define what it means for a distribution to be \"heavy-tailed\". In fact, with much more samples (by bootstrapping from the empirical distribution), we will finally observe the Gaussian behavior in all models with a finite dataset. However, the concentration will kick in much earlier for some model than for other models.\n\nSecond, following the above argument, we only need to consider why the multidimensional gradient noise is better concentrated. This happens whenever the noise in each coordinate are not perfectly correlated. The gradient norm, which is squared root of sum of random variables will have some concentration due the independence or even negative correlation across coordinates. Due to the large number of parameters in a neural net, this concentration can lead to hugely different behavior.\n\n\n\n "}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper463/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper463/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Why ADAM Beats SGD for Attention Models\t", "authors": ["Jingzhao Zhang", "Sai Praneeth Karimireddy", "Andreas Veit", "Seungyeon Kim", "Sashank J Reddi", "Sanjiv Kumar", "Suvrit Sra"], "authorids": ["jzhzhang@mit.edu", "sai.karimrieddy@epfl.ch", "aveit@google.com", "seungyeonk@google.com", "sashank@google.com", "sanjivk@google.com", "suvrit@mit.edu"], "keywords": ["Optimization", "ADAM", "Deep learning"], "TL;DR": "Adaptive methods provably beat SGD in training attention models due to existence of heavy tailed noise.", "abstract": "While stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is still the de facto algorithm in deep learning, adaptive methods like Adam have been observed to outperform SGD across important tasks, such as attention models.

We address the reviewer\u2019s questions as follows:\n\n1\u201canalyses of this form are of no value in guiding practice;  it is mainly the experimental results that matter\u201d:\n\nThe discrepancy between convergence analysis and empirical result is the main motivation of our work. Particularly, we show that under a more realistic assumption that noise is heavy tailed, theory can guide practice.\n\nWe would like to emphasize that the central goal of the paper is to address the important practical question: Why Adam outperforms SGD in Attention models? It is indeed puzzling why training these models necessitates the use of adaptive optimization techniques like Adam in comparison to computer vision models like ResNet where SGD + Momentum gives the best performance.\n\nIn this paper, we hypothesize that heavy-tail noise is one root cause of this difference and provide strong theoretical (see Table 1 and corresponding theorems) and empirical evidence for this hypothesis. These results show that under heavy tail noise of stochastic gradients (or high variance in general) , the performance of SGD deteriorates significantly (see Assumption 1 and Section A of Appendix). While we believe that the convergence rates are interesting and important, even from a practical standpoint, our theoretical results provide qualitative insights into why SGD fails to perform well in the aforementioned settings.  Our analysis provides guidelines for the development of optimization techniques for attention models (indeed, ACClip follows as a direct consequence of this analysis).\n\n\n\n2. \u201cThere is no mention of RoBERTa and her descendents.\u201d: \n\nSince RoBERTa is a different training procedure (more data, more iterations, larger batch) of the same BERT model, we believe that ACClip should perform similarly well in these models. We will be happy to run more experiments and include them in the final version if this is the point of concern. \n\nWe indeed extensively tuned the hyperparameters to get the best result for each optimizer and will include the details in the next version. We thank the reviewer for pointing out our oversight. In particular, we found that the set of ADAM hyperparameters used in the original BERT [Devlin et al] paper works the best. Hence we use the same params as in [Devlin et al] and achieved slightly better baseline performance. \n\nIt will indeed be great if GLUE leader board members can examine the paper and try our optimization technique. We will be happy to help them in this process. That said, we would like to emphasize that the primary focus of the paper is not to achieve SOTA results for attention models but rather understand the optimization challenges in training attention models and provide guidelines for development of optimization techniques specially catered to these settings.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper463/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper463/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Why ADAM Beats SGD for Attention Models\t", "authors": ["Jingzhao Zhang", "Sai Praneeth Karimireddy", "Andreas Veit", "Seungyeon Kim", "Sashank J Reddi", "Sanjiv Kumar", "Suvrit Sra"], "authorids": ["jzhzhang@mit.edu", "sai.karimrieddy@epfl.ch", "aveit@google.com", "seungyeonk@google.com", "sashank@google.com", "sanjivk@google.com", "suvrit@mit.edu"], "keywords": ["Optimization", "ADAM", "Deep learning"], "TL;DR": "Adaptive methods provably beat SGD in training attention models due to existence of heavy tailed noise.", "abstract": "While stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is still the de facto algorithm in deep learning, adaptive methods like Adam have been observed to outperform SGD across important tasks, such as attention models.

A detailed comment is added to Appendix H. We would like to highlight that we are estimating the distribution of the norm of a vector-valued noise while [Simsekli et al] treated the noise in each coordinate as an independent scalar random variable. This leads to different conclusions.\n\nSecond, we tested the performance of ACClip on ImageNet training (added inAppendix I). The performance is worse than SGD but slightly better than Adam. This is consistent with our theory that with well-concentrated noise distribution, Adam-like algorithms do not outperform SGD.\n\nWe emphasize that our main contribution is a novel theoretically-justified explanation for why Adam-like algorithms outperforms SGD in certain tasks but not in others.
