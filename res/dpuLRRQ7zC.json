By learning diverse classifiers and then applying randomized smoothing the authors arrive at an ensemble of smoothed classifiers. Predictions are then made based on a linear combination of the models outputs which are weighted based on empirical risk and robustness of each model. The authors make an argument for the optimality of the proposed approach and show that it performs favorably compared to randomized smoothing certification of only a single model.\n\nWhile I can confirm that the notion of certified robustness that the authors propose in (6) is sensible and sound in terms of probabilistic guarantees of robustness, it is not clear to me exactly how Theorem 2 is the consequence of a using the proposed SWEEN model and not a property which is generally true of ensembles. Using a linear combination of models based on their empirical risk seems to be something which one could do in general, just that in theorem 2 the authors are using a notion of risk which also includes the certified robustness of the models. Perhaps I have missed something here. Given some time, I will read further into the exact details in the supplementary which I was unable to do sufficiently during the initial review period. \n\nThe results that the authors show for their models are favorable and show increased robustness wrt the adversarial smoothing criterion. I wonder if the authors have any results on adversarial attacks (e.g. FGSM, PGD) as there is some notion that using a diverse set of models can lead to a more robust predictor wrt attacks [1] but then there is evidence that for deterministic ensembles this may not be the case [2].\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04359\n\n[2] https://nicholas.carlini.com/papers/2017_woot_ensembles.pdf\n\n\nPost rebuttal response:\n\nI thank the authors for their response to my review and I take their point that establishing theorem 2 points to a limitation of using smoothing with ensembles, but I think this point could be made much more clear in the main text. Following a reading of all of the other reviews and re-evaluating the paper I remain optimistic and slightly positive about the paper as I think it is an important and interesting research direction; however, I am not fully convinced to increase my score given that some of the empirical comparisons could be greatly strengthened to be more than marginal improvements over MACER trained networks. I think that any insights that arise during the process of strengthening the results would contribute to a better understanding of the method and a stronger paper.

This scheme uses pre-trained models and learns the weights used to sum the output predictions. During deployment, smoothed models rely on sampling a large number of input perturbations and ensembling exacerbates the computation burden. Hence, the authors also propose an adaptive scheme that automatically adjusts the number of samples.\n\nOverall, the paper is well-written and provides solid evidence that ensembling can improve certified robustness.\n1) In the experiments, the authors focus on SWEEN-3/7 with standard training and SWEEN-3 with MACER.

I am generally curious about the limits of the approach.\n2) While the adaptive scheme is useful, it distracts the reader from the main message. I'd suggest moving it to the appendix and consider experiments on ImageNet.\n3) The wording is slightly unclear on how exactly the ensemble weights are trained. From the supplementary material, I gathered that the weight are trained to minimize the cross-entropy loss on perturbed inputs (perturbed by Gaussian noise) - as done for \"standard training\". Is that correct?\n4) It is unclear why the $\\gamma$-robustness index needs to be introduced to demonstrate that SWEEN can be trained to near-optimal risk with a surrogate loss.\n\nDetails:\nA) Fig. 1 is not color-blind friendly and difficult to read (small font).\n\n\n---------\nUpdate post-rebuttal: Thank you for addressing most of my comments. The new results on ImageNets are greatly appreciated too. However, in light of other reviews, I would have hoped that the authors try better training procedures on SWEEN-7 (e.g., MACER even if it means using other ResNets instead of VGG), as otherwise it is difficult to judge whether ensembling really helps.

Also, the paper should provide more detailed explanation and rationale on Algorithm 1.\n- The empirical results are not fully convincing to show that model ensemble reliably improve robustness: the paper only present two specific configurations of ensemble, namely SWEEN-3 and SWEEN-7, but there should be much more combinations to verify the effectiveness of ensemble.

Actually, such a claim is not correct. For example, it is impossible to show the superiority of ensemble models if one of the candidate models achieves the possible optimal performance. The best result is that SWEEN-7 performs not worse than ResNet-110, which is trivial since SWEEN-7 contains ResNet-110. However, we highlight the significance of our theoretical results in supporting SWEEN:\n\n- $\\mathscr{F}_p$ is more expressive than one single model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ with $\\theta$ in a fixed $\\Theta$, and training a SWEEN model consisting of small candidate models is much easier than training a single large model. Thus, SWEEN can be beneficial. It is supported by the empirical evidence that SWEEN-3 (ResNet-20, 26, and 32) performs better than each candidate model and even ResNet-110.\n\n- We acknowledge the gap between Theorem 2 and our experimental settings. However, our theoretical results can be considered a supplement to our empirical evidence. Lemma 1 and Theorem 2 are used to highlight the desired properties, e.g., ensembling generality and the accessibility of optimal $\\gamma$-robustness with large $K$. In return, the experiments show that the certified robustness can be improved with only a few candidate models.\n\nIn summary, we believe that our theoretical and experimental results support SWEEN from different perspectives, so we include both parts in the main text."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1475/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1475/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Enhancing Certified Robustness of Smoothed Classifiers via Weighted Model Ensembling", "authorids": ["~Chizhou_Liu1", "~Yunzhen_Feng1", "ranranw@bibdr.org", "~Bin_Dong1"], "authors": ["Chizhou Liu", "Yunzhen Feng", "Ranran Wang", "Bin Dong"], "keywords": ["Adversairal Robustness", "Randomized Smoothing", "Ensembling"], "abstract": "Randomized smoothing has achieved state-of-the-art certified robustness against $l_2$-norm adversarial attacks.

Here are our responses to your questions and concerns:\n\n[Regarding the novelty of Lemma 1 and Theorem 2]\n\nWe respectfully disagree with the comment that Lemma 1 and Theorem 2 are incremental implications of the well-known generalization theory. We would like to restate our theoretical part and then show the difference between the generalization theory and our results.\n\n(a)\tLemma 1 gives the result that ensembling in the space can achieve optimal $\\\\gamma$-robustness in $\\\\mathscr F_p$, which is independent of the generalization theory. The essence of Lemma 1 is to extend the optimal risk in the discrete ensembling space $\\hat{\\mathscr{F}_{\\theta}}$ to the more expressive continuous space $\\mathscr{F}_p$, which is exactly the benefits of ensembling.\n\n(b) Theorem 2 states that the SWEEN model can be easily trained to achieve near-optimal robustness. We decompose the robustness gap between empirically optimized SWEEN $\\\\hat{\\\\phi}$ and the optimal robustness, $\\\\mathcal{R}[\\\\hat{\\\\phi}] - \\\\inf \\\\limits_{\\\\phi \\\\in \\\\mathscr{F}_p} \\\\mathcal{R}[\\\\phi]$, into several parts:\n\n$$\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\\\mathcal{R}[\\\\hat{\\\\phi}]-\\\\inf_{\\\\phi\\\\in\\\\mathscr{F}_p}\\\\mathcal{R}[\\\\phi] &=& (\\\\mathcal{R}[\\\\hat{\\\\phi}]-\\\\mathcal{R}_\\{se}[\\\\hat{\\\\phi}]) + (\\\\mathcal{R}_\\{se}[\\\\hat{\\\\phi}]-\\\\mathcal{R}_\\{emp}[\\\\hat{\\phi}])+(\\\\mathcal{R}_\\{emp}[\\\\hat{\\\\phi}]-\\\\mathcal{R}_\\{emp}[\\\\phi^*])+\\\\\\\\\n&&(\\\\mathcal{R}_\\{emp}[\\phi^*]-\\\\mathcal{R}_\\{se}[\\phi^*])+(\\\\mathcal{R}_\\{se}[\\phi^*] - \\\\mathcal{R}[\\phi^*])+(\\\\mathcal{R}[\\phi^*]-\\\\mathcal{R}[\\phi_0])+(\\\\mathcal{R}[\\phi_0]-\\\\inf_\\{\\phi\\in\\\\mathscr{F}_p}\\\\mathcal{R}[\\phi]).\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n$$\n\nOnly the first and fifth items are bounded by the standard generalization theory (Lemma 7). The sixth part, the gap between the optimal discrete ensemble and the optimal $\\phi_0$ in the continuos space $\\mathscr{F}_p$, can only be bounded by Lemma 4 (the core of Lemma 1). What's more, the second and fourth items are bounded by Jensen's inequality and McDiarmid's inequality (Lemma 11); the third and the last items are bounded by the definition of the minimizer. Using the generalization bound cannot go through this process.\n\nAnother way to use the generalization theory is to apply it to both $\\phi_0$ and $\\hat{\\phi}$. Ignoring the details on bounding two Rademacher terms, we still face the gap between $\\mathcal{R}_\\{se}[\\hat{\\phi}]$ and $\\mathcal{R}_\\{se}[\\phi_0]$ (or $\\mathcal{R}_\\{emp}[\\hat{\\phi}]$ and $\\mathcal{R}_\\{emp}[\\phi_0]$). Bounding either term requires comparing the optimal discrete ensemble and the optimal $\\phi_0$ in the continuous space $\\mathscr{F}_p$, and we still need Lemma 1. \n\n[Regarding Algorithm 1]\n\nIn our SWEEN function, using Monte Carlo estimation is independent of using Algorithm 1. According to Eqn(2) in Section 3, Monte Carlo is used to smooth the base function $f$ to $g$ while SWEEN proposes to use ensembling to better learn a base function $f_{ens}$. That is, Algorithm 1 is used to speed up the ensembling and replace $f_{ens}$ with $f_{ens}^{alg1}$. $f_{ens}^{alg1}$ will then be smoothed to provide certified robustness. Thus, Algorithm 1 will not affect the Monte Carlo estimation and certification procedure of smoothed classifiers. \n\nNonetheless, we agree that there are questions related to Algorithm 1 that require further thinking. The stopping criterion in Algorithm 1 or the original algorithm in [Inoue 2019] is inspired by the confidence interval. How to theoretically analyze the gap introduced by algorithm 1 and how to balance the tradeoff between the speed-up and the gap are all meaningful questions for ensembling. But we think they are out of the scope of this paper.\n\n[Regarding the empirical results]\n\nWe have listed extra results on SWEEN using identical architectures (ResNet-110s)  in Appendix B.3. The most commonly used architecture in adversarial robustness is the ResNet. Besides ensembling ResNets with different depths, we also include AlexNet, DenseNet, and VGG. We think that SWEEN-3 (limited number of candidate models in ResNets), SWEEN-7 (adequate candidate models with diverse architecture), and SWEEN with identical architectures are representative enough to show the effectiveness of SWEEN in different scenarios.\n\nWe agree that if only the ACR is considered, ensembling MACER models provide marginal improvement. However, the training time is decreased, the number of parameters is lowered, and the number of FLOPs is smaller. We think when comparing results, not only the performance but the energy consumption should be considered. Thus, the improvement is beyond marginal.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1475/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1475/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Enhancing Certified Robustness of Smoothed Classifiers via Weighted Model Ensembling", "authorids": ["~Chizhou_Liu1", "~Yunzhen_Feng1", "ranranw@bibdr.org", "~Bin_Dong1"], "authors": ["Chizhou Liu", "Yunzhen Feng", "Ranran Wang", "Bin Dong"], "keywords": ["Adversairal Robustness", "Randomized Smoothing", "Ensembling"], "abstract": "Randomized smoothing has achieved state-of-the-art certified robustness against $l_2$-norm adversarial attacks.

In the following, we address each point sequentially.\n\n[Regarding SWEEN-7 with MACER]\n\nWe found that MACER performs poorly in training models that are not ResNets. For VGG, the optimization may not converge. Since SWEEN-7 contains several such models, i.e., VGG-16 and VGG-19, we only experimented with MACER on SWEEN-3. \n\nWe also experimented with adding the ResNet-110 to SWEEN-3 in the MACER scheme. We share the results below in table form. SWEEN-3 + ResNet-110 outperforms both SWEEN-3 and ResNet-110, indicating that SWEEN can consistently improve certified robustness given more candidate models.\n\n| $\\\\sigma$ | Model                                  | 0\\.00 &ensp;| 0\\.25 &ensp;| 0\\.5 &ensp; | 0\\.75 &ensp;| 1\\.00 &ensp;| 1\\.25 &ensp;| 1\\.50&ensp; | 1\\.75&ensp; | 2\\.00 &ensp;| ACR     &ensp;           |\n|-----------|----------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------------------|\n|           | ResNet\\-110                            | 66  &ensp;  | 60 &ensp;   | 53  &ensp;  | 46 &ensp;   | 38 &ensp;   | 29 &ensp;   | 19    &ensp;| 12  &ensp;  | 0  &ensp;   | 0\\.726    &ensp;         |\n|     0.5   &ensp;   | UE (SWEEN\\-3  ) | 64\\.9 | 57\\.1 | 49\\.7 | 41\\.1 | 34\\.1 | 26\\.2 | 20\\.2 | 11\\.7 | 0     | 0\\.685             |\n|           | SWEEN\\-3                               | 64\\.7 | 58\\.4 | 51\\.8 | 43\\.9 | 37\\.2 | 29\\.2 | 22\\.8 | 14\\.6 | 0     | 0\\.727             |\n|           | SWEEN\\-3\\+ResNet\\-110  &emsp;                | 65\\.9 | 59\\.5 | 52\\.1 | 44\\.2 | 36\\.6 | 30\\.4 | 22\\.7 | 14\\.8 | 0     | $\\\\textbf\\{0\\.736\\}$ |\n\n\n[Regarding Algorithm 1]\n\nThanks for this suggestion. We have moved the detailed algorithm to Appendix B.1. As for experiments on ImageNet, the experiments are not finished yet. We will add experiments and replace the adaptive algorithm part once the results are avaliable.\n\n[Regarding ensemble weight training]\n\nYes. We have tried various losses to train the weights, including cross-entropy, MACER's loss, adversarial loss. The results are quite similar, and we choose the most efficient way. We have changed the formulation to make this point more clear. \n\n[Regarding the $\\gamma$-robustness index]\n\nWe introduced the notion to make our results more general and clear. Lemma 1 goes beyond the surrogate loss and applies in a broader setting. However, Theorem 2 is restricted to the surrogate loss setting because training is involved.\n\n[Regarding figures]\n\nSorry for the inconvenience. We added a large version of those figures in Appendix D. We also used different markers and line types to distinguish different models to improve delivery.\n\nWe hope our responses can address your concern. We would also be glad to answer any other questions you may have."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1475/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1475/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Enhancing Certified Robustness of Smoothed Classifiers via Weighted Model Ensembling", "authorids": ["~Chizhou_Liu1", "~Yunzhen_Feng1", "ranranw@bibdr.org", "~Bin_Dong1"], "authors": ["Chizhou Liu", "Yunzhen Feng", "Ranran Wang", "Bin Dong"], "keywords": ["Adversairal Robustness", "Randomized Smoothing", "Ensembling"], "abstract": "Randomized smoothing has achieved state-of-the-art certified robustness against $l_2$-norm adversarial attacks.

However, we would like to highlight our efforts in overcoming the complications and technical difficulties introduced by certified robustness. The major differences are the robust loss and the Monte Carlo (MC) sampling used in smoothing the network. To address the $\\gamma$-robustness index, we had to consider the property of $\\mathscr{F}_p$ for technical details in Lemma 3. We also introduced a semi-empirical risk in Definition 5 for the MC estimation error in training.\n\nIn a word, we propose Theorem 2 to justify the feasibility of SWEEN. The theoretical results are not meant to show the unique suitability of randomized smoothing to ensembles but rather highlight desirable properties (e.g., the attainability of optimal $\\gamma$-robustness index).\n\n[Regarding SWEEN versus adversarial attacks]\n\nThanks for the suggestion. We further investigated SWEEN models' performance versus AutoAttack[1], an ensemble of four diverse attacks to reliably evaluate robustness. Similar to [2], we used 128 samples to estimate the smoothed classifier. We show the results in the table below. It can be seen that SWEEN can improve the empirical robustness as well.

Below we address the concerns mentioned in the review:\n\n[Regarding Theorem 2]\n\n- We acknowledge the gap between theoretical results and experimental settings. We have now added comments about the number of candidate models and training samples in Section 4.2.\n\n- We are grateful that the reviewer pointed out this! After checking our derivations, we found out that the assumption $l(0, y)=0$ is NOT needed in Theorem 2. We use Lemma 8 to prove Theorem 3, in whose proof Lemma 8 is applied to $c(\\cdot,y)-c(0,y)$. With such shifting, Theorem 3 and results afterward, i.e., Lemma 10, Theorem 4, and Theorem 2, do not need the assumption anymore. We have modified the formulation of these results.\n\n[Regarding experiments]\n\nWe are running experiments right now and will update the results as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n[Regarding Algorithms]\n\n- To make the content more compact, we have moved Algorithm 1 to Appendix B.1 and made more detailed comments about our adaptive prediction algorithm there.\n\n- We presented the algorithm for training a SWEEN model in Appendix B.2.\n\n\nWe hope our responses can address your questions and concerns about our work.

Empirically, the ensemble models have better performance in approximately provable robustness than an individual model of even more trainable parameters.\n\n--Novelty and Contribution\n\nPros:\n\n1. It is well known that adversarial robustness needs higher model capacity, so ensemble model can improve empirical robustness. Although not surprising, as far as I know, there is no prior work investigating ensemble in the context of randomized smoothing. \n\n2. The experimental result shows ensemble models can really improve the robustness. The results on CIFAR10 and SVHN is comprehensive. The authors also show that adaptive prediction ensembling can accelerate the computation.\n\nCons:\n\n1. There is a significant gap between theoretical analysis and experimental settings. Based on the condition above Equation (25), both the number of individual models and the number of training samples are trivially large. Theorem 2 should also emphasize the need of sufficient training samples.\n\n2. One assumption of Theorem 2: $l(0, y) = 0$ might be inconsistent with the practice. The most popular loss function is cross-entropy loss, which does not meet this assumption. I notice that this assumption is first used in Lemma 8 to prove Theorem 3. Removing this condition might result in a negative term on RHS of Theorem 4. I think the author should discuss on this assumption at least.\n\n3. It is better to have results on ImageNet or its downsampled version,  like [Salman 2019].\n\n--Presentation\n\nPros:\n\nGenerally, this paper is well-written. The notation and formulation are easy to follow.\n\nCons:\n\n1. The author should discuss more about the condition to finish the loop in Algorithm 1. This part is not well-justified. Especially, the authors should point out what is new in Algorithm 1 compared with [Inoue 2019].\n\n2. It is better to make an algorithm box demonstrating the whole method.\n\n--Summary\n\nFrom my point of view, this is a borderline paper. It systematically study the ensemble of randomized smooth models and demonstrate interesting results.
