Optimize \"permutation matrices\"-part by using Riemannian gradient descent and optimize coefficients using normal gradient descent. Refine final solution by either deterministic rounding or rounding by stochastic sampling. \n\n### Strengths\n**[+]** Idea is easy to understand, and the explanation is fairly straight-forward to read. \n\n**[+]** The math seems correct. \n\n### Weaknesses\n\n**[-]** While the BvN decomposition might be of interest to the ICLR community, I am concerned the suggested differentiable approach to attaining the BvN decomposition is not. \n\n**[-]** It seems fairly straight-forward to recast the matrix decomposition problem as an optimization problem and use RGD and GD. It is possible I am being to harsh on this account, and I'll be happy to revise my conviction if the other reviewers disagree. \n\n**[-]** There is no time complexity analysis of Algorithm 1. \n\n**[-]** The method is only tested for $n\\le 30$, I am concerned the algorithm would not scale to even $n=100$. It is not clear to me whether this method will have any practical impact for $n=30$, however, it is definitely possible I am wrong on this account. \n\n### Recommendation: Rejection 4, but with low confidence. \n\n**[-]** While the BvN decomposition might be of interest to the ICLR community, I am concerned the suggested differentiable approach to attaining the BvN decomposition is not. \n\n**[-]** It seems fairly straight-forward to recast the matrix decomposition problem as an optimization problem and use RGD and GD. It is possible I am being to harsh on this account, and I'll be happy to revise my conviction if the other reviewers disagree. \n\nI am not very confident in this review and open to changing my recommendation, in particular, I'll re-evaluate my opinion based on the comments from the other reviews.\n\n### Questions and Concerns\nPlease note the questions below were posted before this review and the authors already responded to these questions. \n\n---\n\nThanks for submitting your work to ICLR. I hope you can help me clarify a few potential misunderstandings on my behalf. \n\nQuestion 1. Is it correct that you named the approach 'differentiable' because it approximates the BvND by minimizing a differentiable loss? \nI ask because I thought, after reading the title, that you compute BvND while supporting gradient computations, similar to how PyTorch supports gradient computations through eigendecomposition. \n\nAnswer: Yes. \n\nQuestion 2. On the bottom of page 2 I was confused by  *\"... the discrete set of permutation matrices $P_n$ is the intersection of the convex set of doubly stochastic matrices *and the* $DP_n\\cap O_n$, ... \"*. \nDo you mean that $P_n = DP_n \\cap O_n$? \n\nAnswer: Yes.\n\nQuestion 3. Is it correct that experiment 5.1 and 5.2 use matrices of size at most $10$? You mention that finding the smallest $k$ is NP-Hard. But if $n=10$ I am not sure why it wouldn't just be possible to brute-force the solution. One can usually brute-force 3SAT or TSP problems of size $n=10$. Am I am misunderstanding something? Are the constants too big or something?\n\nAnswer: See the posted answer for details. \n\nQuestion 4. It is not clear how big the matrices are in experiment 5.3. I get that you attempt to compute a decomposition with $k=10$ permutation matrices, but I am not sure how big the matrices are. In the appendix you state that you sample $30$ news articles and the article states there are $3000$ users. How big are the matrices?\n\nAnswer: The largest matrices are of size $(30, 30)$. \n\nI apologize for any misunderstandings and look forward to reading your clarification. \n\n---\n\n### Additional Feedback\n\nComment 1. In the Preliminaries section, you introduce a lot of notation. The ICLR style template attempts to standardize notation, and I believe most of your notation is the same as the ICLR style template. \n\nComment 2. I was confused by the last sentence on page 2, I think you can revise/clarify this sentence. \n\nComment 3. In section 4 you write \".. bias constraints We encode this ...\", you are missing a period before \"We\". \n\n### Ethics Disclaimer\nI have no training in ethics and thus have no basis to review the ethical implications of \"{static, dynamic} fairness of exposure\". I can read and understand the mathematical formulation of the problem, but for all I know, the problem formulation could be non-sensual from an ethical perspective.

Sample from (create multiple feasible) BvN decompositions for a particular doubly stochastic matrix? \nWhat is the relation to the fairness in ranking problems and how does their algorithm help in this context?\nWhy do other methods \"underperform\" when there is a \"constraint in the prediction\" and their approach does not?\nWhen and why would we not need to \"sample permutations online\" -- which is presumably the scenario when their algorithm is advantageous?\n\nIn addition there are a number of typos and mistakes which impede a smooth reading of the paper. Some examples:\np.2 \"DS matrices is incident\" -> should be \"equivalent\"? if not what does incident mean in this context?\np.2. the last paragraph on the page is somewhat confusing the way it is written (cf. the clarification question by one reviewer). The orthogonal group should presumably have the same symbol twice (\\mathcal{O}_m).\nWhy introduce the Stiefel manifold, if it is never used afterwards? It would be enough to simply introduce the orthogonal group as the set of square matrices with orthonormal columns (X^T X = I_n)??\n\nRe: section 3 and 4. I found these sections difficult to follow. \nFor instance, how is a hypersphere relaxation defined? Why is it relevant here, if it is not used?\nAs another example, it seems the Barman (2018) comes after Kulkarni (2017), so how does the (chronologically) earlier paper improve upon a later paper??\nHow should we set the parameters in the optimization problem? How do we actually construct the permutation matrices from the outputs of the optimization. \nThe authors simply list a few high level alternatives but no precise description is given. \n\nWhere does it save computation/memory as advertised in the introduction? \nPersonally, I think the application is quite interesting, but based on the presentation I simply cannot see the connection based on what the authors wrote.\nI don't think the connection of section 4 to the BvN decomposition problem is understandable from the presentations of the authors. Why is the result the authors present relevant? \n\n## Theoretical contribution\nI think the strongest potential contribution here is theoretical, in that a new algorithm is introduced for a relevant problem.\nHowever, the paper does deliver a more detailed analysis of the algorithm but mainly states an optimization problem.\nFor instance, issues such as time / memory complexity are not discussed in more detail. \nAs mentioned above the procedure to actually construct permutation matrices is not described at all. In particular a rounding procedure would break the differentiability, which presumably is one of the advantages of the new method?\nAs the algorithm is approximate: what about the approximation error?\nWhat is the sensitivity of the algorithm w.r.t. to the hyperparameters and how do we set them? \nHow does it effect the diversity of the permutation matrices one obtains (as the authors hint, there might be an issue here -- at least some more detailed discussion could be given).\n\n## Application\nI found the descriptions of the application to be not detailed enough to understand how the results of the authors come into play here.\nNeglecting this aspect, it also remains unclear to me why the algorithm of the authors provides an advantage here as it does not seem to perform better in the applications shown compared to the baseline?\nI think this would have potentially ok, if the paper would have provided a stronger theoretical analysis. However, as it stands I think both the \"theory\" as well as the \"application\" part of the paper fall below acceptance standards.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper877/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper877/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Approximate Birkhoff-von-Neumann decomposition: a differentiable approach", "authorids": ["~Andr\u00e9s_Hoyos-Idrobo1"], "authors": ["Andr\u00e9s Hoyos-Idrobo"], "keywords": ["Birkhoff-von-Neumann decomposition", "doubly stochastic matrices", "Riemannian optimization", "Fairness exposure in ranking"], "abstract": "The Birkhoff-von-Neumann (BvN) decomposition is a standard tool used to draw permutation matrices from a doubly stochastic (DS) matrix.

The optimization is carried out in the optimization over manifolds setting, using a recent result that gives a Riemannian structure to the set of doubly stochastic matrices.\n\nThe writing of the paper is correct in general, although there are some points commented below.\n\nThe term \"differentiable\" in this setting is somehow confusing. I would add \"differentiable cost function\" or something that leaves no room for misunderstandings. I was reading the paper thinking that I would find something different regarding the differentiable part.\n\nThe proposed formulation and optimization method seem correct, and to me it is a promising starting point. From here, I would expect to see some theoretical results regarding convergence (at least partially, in the spirit of [Z]), or applications where its full potential can be seen.\n\nSection 4, which is an application of the proposed method, constitutes a great part of the paper (maybe more than half of it). Of course, the application of a given method is extremely important, but in this case it shifts the focus of the paper. Besides that, the writing of this large section seems to be quite different from the previous parts. While the first part was relatively well written and easy to follow, this half is rough. \n\nTo me, the interesting part of the paper is the method, and it falls short, given the comments above.\n\nI would usually write this under \"minor comments\", but in this case it shows a lack of care and attention.\nI appreciate the notation paragraph, but it seems to correspond to another paper. The notation for cardinality is never used as such, but the same notation is used for the absolute value several times. The upper index in $X^i$ is never defined (it could index a set of matrices, or indicate rows/columns). The Hadamard operations and pseudo-inverse are never used. On the other hand, in Algorithm 1 there are undefined operators, such as $\\Pi$ and $R_X$ (which I assume are projection and retraction).\n\nMinor comments:\n - Please add punctuation to the equations, since they are part of the text (in Definition 1 for instance)\n - The last sentence in page 2 is weird. \n - In the last sentence of the first paragraph, Section 3.1, there is an extra \"f\" (of f O(n^4) )\n - typo: geootp -> geoopt\n - The bibliography is not consistent.
