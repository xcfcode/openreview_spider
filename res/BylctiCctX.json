In particular, we are delighted that you see the potential of the stethoscope framework lending itself to much broader applications. We agree - particularly for applications regarding the interpretability of deep representations as well as the manipulation of biases contained therein. This is a key consideration in our belief that it makes for a valuable contribution to the community. \n\nWe have opted, in this submission, to focus on our primary application domain, which is intuitive physics. In particular, we demonstrate the efficacy of neural stethoscopes in interpreting, promoting and suppressing specific information in the context of the complex interplay between visual clues and physical properties in stability prediction. Our work is primarily motivated by the question as to what extent neural networks learn about physical principles or whether they merely follow visual clues and how we can guide the learning process. We showcase the stethoscope framework here to that effect and, based on its application, provide some interesting and novel [according to Reviewer 1] insights into representations for visual stability prediction.\n\nAs regards the implications of the paper, we would like to address this in the context of the reviewer\u2019s comment that increased performance is not surprising given the additional supervision provided. Our submission argues that the manner in which this information is provided really does matter. Figure 6 addresses this point in that multi-task learning fails to leverage the potential of the additional training labels (and, indeed, leads to a detrimental effect, Fig 6b) whereas the stethoscope framework allows the specification of whether the information considered should be promoted or suppressed. This leads to the performance gains shown in Fig 6a.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper473/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper473/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper473/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Guiding Physical Intuition with Neural Stethoscopes", "abstract": "Model interpretability and systematic, targeted model adaptation present central challenges in deep learning.

However, at present, it is not clear to us what this refers to as \\lambda is a weighting on a loss term. Clarification would be much appreciated so we can fully engage with this point. As far as the existing approach is concerned, Figure 6 illustrates the influence of \\lambda on the accuracy and correlation of global and local stability prediction.\n\n2)\nThe inconsistent correlations between the two tasks are exactly the scenarios where stethoscopes come into their own: testing positive and negative regimes of lambda (corresponding to auxiliary and adversarial training, respectively) reveals the interplay between the two tasks and potentially allows for de-biasing the algorithm as shown in Figure 6a. Therefore, in contrast to the design not considering these relationships, it explicitly addresses them.\n\nCould you please elaborate on the comment \u2019the current design [\u2026] simply sums them up\u2019?

The visualization of the \\lambda map might be more interpretable for understanding the stability prediction. \n\n2) The global stability prediction does not have a consistent correlation with the local stability prediction, as shown by the easy and hard examples.

Moreover it can promote or suppress the correlation of such features to the tasks related to the main one. The framework is applied to the task of visual stability prediction of block towers. The paper builds upon Groth et al. 2018, adding the concept of local stability as correlated secondary task, used with the proposed neural stethoscopes. Experiments with an extension of ShapeStacks (Groth et al. 2018) dataset where the local stability is added to the global stability class, show that it is possibile increase the performance using the additional task.
