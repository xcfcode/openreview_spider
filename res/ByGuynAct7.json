The paper suggest a few tractable methods to learn the prior and the model jointly. The paper, overall, is interesting.\n\nThe reviewers have had some disagreement regarding the effectiveness of the method. The factorized prior may not be the most informative prior and using extra machinery to estimate it might deteriorates the performance. On the other hand, estimating a more informative prior might be difficult. It is extremely important to discuss this trade-off in the paper. I strongly recommend for the authors to discuss the pros and cons of using priors that are weakly informative vs strongly informative.\n\nThe idea of using a hierarchical model has been around, e.g., see the paper on \"Hierarchical variational models\" and more recently \"semi-implicit Variational Inference\". Please include a related work on such existing work.

The prior for the weights is considered in which the weights from various layers, input and output channels are assumed to be independent.  A varational method is considered to approximate the posterior distribution of the weights of CNN.  It looks to me that the prior distribution is a fairly standard product which may not perfectly suitable for CNN. Also the validity of the proposed variational method needs further evaluation. Below I summarize my concerns more technically.\n\n1. CNN essentially has a tree structure, i.e., each layer can be viewed as the parent of the next layer. So the consecutive layers should have a sort of dependence. Also, the weights based on the same input channel should all inherit features of that channel. Based on these considerations, is it really reasonable to assume that the random weights are independent?\nI agree that independence assumption makes the model and computation easier, but the prior itself should reflect the possible dependence structure of the channels.\n\n2. The KL divergence might not be tractable and so the proposed variational method replaces it with an upper bound. This method highly depends on the assumption that the upper bound of the KL divergence is accurate. Otherwise it is hard to tell that the method really approximates the authentic variational method very well. It would be great if the accuracy of the upper bound can be further evaluated (theoretically and numerically).\n\n\n\n\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper999/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "The Deep Weight Prior", "abstract": "Bayesian inference is known to provide a general framework for incorporating prior knowledge or specific properties into machine learning models via carefully choosing a prior distribution.

We use more general factorization, now at least there are spatial correlations between the weights in a kernel, but not yet between kernels and between layers. The method allows us to use more flexible priors and can be potentially generalized to more complex dependencies. We discuss the factorization in (Section 6) and consider this direction for the future work. \n\n2) This method highly depends on the assumption that the upper bound of the KL divergence is accurate.  \n\nIndeed, our method depends on the accuracy of the upper bound on KL-divergence or equivalently a gap between an intractable variational lower bound L and a proposed variational lower bound L^{aux}. As we show in (Appendix A, eq. 13), maximization of the L^{aux} minimizes the gap L - L^{aux} = E_q(w) [KL(r(z | w) || p(z | w))] by adjusting parameters of reversed model r(z | w), in other words, the gap reduces as reversed model r(z | w) gets more accurate. The bound is tight if and only if the auxiliary distribution coincides with the exact posterior distribution of the implicit weight model, i.e., r(z | w) = p(z | w). A huge piece of literature on ELBOs relies on this type of argument. \n\nAt the same time, there already exists a number of works on applications and analysis of tightness of variational bounds (for instance [1, 2]). Therefore, we did not address the underlined issue directly. One of the most straightforward approaches to providing more accurate variational bounds is to employ importance weighted bounds introduced in [3], which allow to trade off sample complexity and tightness of variational bounds. We have added the estimates of approximation gap using importance weighted bound to Appendix F, however, these figures should be treated with caution, as IWAE still gives us a lower bound on L.\n\n[1] On the Quantitative Analysis of Decoder-Based Generative Models, https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04273\n[2] Tighter Variational Bounds are Not Necessarily Better, https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04537\n[3] Importance Weighted Autoencoders, https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00519"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper999/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper999/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper999/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Deep Weight Prior", "abstract": "Bayesian inference is known to provide a general framework for incorporating prior knowledge or specific properties into machine learning models via carefully choosing a prior distribution.

Subsection 4.1 has been rewritten and moved to Section 3, as it has more to do with the method rather than experiments. The description of experiments also has been improved. \n\n2)  I did wonder whether there was any link between the suggested priors and the idea of modelling the current and related data sets used in constructing the prior jointly, with data set specific parameters given an exchangeable prior? \u2026 I just wondered if there is some conceptual link with the current method being an approximation of that approach in some sense. \n\nThe suggestion indeed seems to be a generalization of the current approach, that however may be closer to empirical Bayes, since the prior distribution p(W) can be adopted using the current dataset. In the paper, we do not consider any explicit model of a dataset e.g., dataset-embeddings, but it would be an interesting direction for research.\n\n3) In Section 4.1, it seems that for the trained networks on the source datasets, point estimates of the filter weights are treated as data for learning the variational autoencoder - is that correct?  \n\nYes, this is correct.\n\n4) Could you model dataset heterogeneity here as well? \n\nIf we understand the question correctly, given the current model, the answer is no. Currently, we do not explicitly use kernels heterogeneity e.g., (a) the estimated variance of each training kernel, or (b) the problem from which each training kernel comes from, but using these additional factors could be an interesting topic of investigation.\n\n3) Presumably the p_l(z) density is N(0,I)?\n\nYes, this is correct, we described the form of the prior p(z) in VAE section, but it is worth to add it explicitly at the description of our model. \n\n3) In Section 4.2, you say that the number of filters is proportional to the scale parameter k and that you vary k.

Both explicit and implicit priors are considered, with the latter having the benefit of increased flexibility but having the drawback of a lack of a parametric form to plug in to the ELBO.  The authors address this last point by extending the ELBO appropriately.  Experiments are performed testing the prior\u2019s ability to capture trained filters (Figure 1), provide a good initialization (Figure 2), improve sample efficiency (Figure 3), improve training speed (Figure 4).  \n\nPros:\n\nI like this paper: it is a intuitive idea, and the experiments explore exactly what one would hope to gain from the prior (i.e. better initialization, improved sample efficiency).  I find the paper clearly written and to have a logical flow.  Furthermore, I think eliciting priors---while so crucial in more traditional Bayesian modeling---has been mostly overlooked by the Bayesian ML community, and this paper clearly shows that there are gains to be had from a fairly straightforward procedure.  \n\n\nCons:\n\nThe only potential issue with the paper is the use of the implicit prior, as it complicates variational inference, requiring the extension to the ELBO described in Section 3.2.  As far as I can tell, all experiments use the implicit priors.  I would have liked to have seen an experiment using a parametric prior (eg Gaussian) that shows what gains the implicit prior provides.  Or is it simply a matter of memory efficiency?  \n\n\nOther comments:\n\n-- Nice first sentence in the introduction!  I like how it\u2019s a general statement but immediately focuses the reader\u2019s attention to the paper\u2019s topic.\n\n-- While it doesn\u2019t say so explicitly, the paper seems to imply it is the first to use implicit priors.

For trained networks on related datasets the authors use autoencoders to obtain an expressive prior on the filter weights, with independence assumed between different layers.  The resulting prior is generative and its density has no closed form expression, and a novel variational method for dealing with this is described.  Some empirical comparisons of the deep weight prior with alternative priors is considered, as well as a comparison of deep weight samples for initialization with alternative initialization schemes.  \n\nThis is an interesting paper.  It is mostly clearly written, but there is a lack of detail in Section 4 that makes it hard for me, at least, to understand exactly what was done there.  I think the originality level of the paper is high.  The issue of informative priors in these complex models seems wide open and the authors provide an interesting approach both conceptually and computationally.  I did wonder whether there was any link between the suggested priors and the idea of modelling the current and related data sets used in constructing the prior jointly, with data set specific parameters given an exchangeable prior?  This would be a standard hierarchical modelling approach.  Such an approach would not be computationally attractive, I just wondered if there is some conceptual link with the current method being an approximation of that approach in some sense.  In Section 4.1, it seems that for the trained networks on the source datasets, point estimates of the filter weights are treated as data for learning the variational autoencoder - is that correct?  Could you model dataset heterogeneity here as well?  Presumably the p_l(z) density is N(0,I)?  Details of the inference and reconstruction networks are sketchy.
