RICA made ICA stackable by combining PCA and ICA, and applying a component-wise nonlinearity to the outputs of each layer.

The RICA algorithm is modified from its original form to utilize the author's previous innovation of 'sparse PCA.'  The results are conveyed through a few depictions of the receptive fields and some qualitative links to neurophysiology.\r\n\r\nContributions:\r\n> The authors have updated the RICA algorithm to utilize SPCA instead of PCA.\r\n> The authors claim that sPCA on the outputs of the first-layer ICA, produces V1-complex cells.\r\n> The authors suggest that some unoriented neurons in a V2 experiment correspond to a subset of their second ICA layer.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is an interesting direction and there are signs of promising results.  However, the poor exposition, preliminary nature of the result, and lack of quantitative matching to neurophysiology (or other strong metrics for differentiation/novelty), indicate that this work is not yet ready for publication/acceptance.  The update of RICA to use SPCA is a minor innovation, and the claims about V1 complex cells and V2 are not well supported by experiments (matching to neural findings).  In the following I provide some feedback that I hope will assist the authors in this work and a future publication of this work.\r\n\r\nIn the background, more attention should be paid to similar techniques to RICA.

Neural computation 24 (4), 827-866\r\nThese should be discussed.\r\n\r\nSome points on exposition:\r\n> be careful when referring between human visual system and then relying on non-human primate data.  You seem to use these different species interchangeably\r\n> your statement that 'a previous neurophysiological study improperly discarded some of their recorded neurons' could be rephrased.  I think you can be more fair in discussing the actions of our colleagues.\r\n> You repeated state 1st layer ICA algorithms (including yours) learn edge/bar shaped receptive fields.  This statement is false.  The generative fields (and receptive fields) resemble Gabor functions.  Gabor functions are not edge or bar shaped.  They are localized in space, orientation and position.  While edges/bars are broadband.  Don't fall into this sloppy language.  Note also that results in neurophys. indicate that V1 are not edge/bar selective, but selective for stimuli localized in space, orientation and position (just like Gabors, and unlike edges/bars).\r\n> you use both 'sPCA' and 'SPCA'.\r\n> you are missing citations that you refer to in the text.\r\n> the term 'autoencoder' refers to a specific class of models and I do not believe your optimization falls into this class.\r\n\r\nMy major suggestion is to spend more time on the link between the properties of the intermediate layers of your model and the neurophysiology literature.  There is a tremendous amount of data on V1-complex cells and you can produce non-trivial (meaning you need a control) links between your model and these quantitative findings.  While there are fewer results on V2, there are quantitative experiments to run on your model.  Your current results are too qualitative and require the reader to make leaps from the receptive field depictions you use and an experimental result using certain stimuli, plotted in a completely different methodology (Figure 5 and 6).  The experiment in Figure 4 is a step in the right direction, but showing one cell isn't sufficient, there is no control, and their are quantitative distribution metrics that are relevant in the Chen, Han, Poo and Dan PNAS 2007 paper (e.g. Figure 5 in that paper)."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Efficient Visual Coding: From Retina To V2", "decision": "submitted, no decision", "abstract": "The human visual system has a hierarchical structure consisting of layers of processing, such as the retina, V1, V2, etc. Understanding the functional roles of these visual processing layers would help to integrate the psychophysiological and neurophysiological models into a consistent theory of human vision, and would also provide insights to computer vision research.
