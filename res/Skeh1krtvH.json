The new version of the paper is definitely clearer, especially the contribution section and the experimental results. The new version addresses all my concerns, hence I am upgrading my rating to Accept.\n\n## Original review\n\nThis paper presents the WaveGlow model, a generative model for raw audio. The model is based on a 2D-matrix approach, which allows to generate the audio with a fixed amount of step. The model is shown to be a generalization of the two main approaches for raw audio generation, autoregressive flow and bipartite flow. The model is evaluated and compared with related work on an objective evaluation (Log-likelihood) and a subjective evaluation (MOS), and is shown to be a trade-off between memory footprint, generation speed and quality.\n\nI think this paper should be accepted, for the following reasons:\n- The theoretical framework presented is novel and significant, as it provides a unified view of the two main approaches for neural waveform generation.\n- The experiments are reasonably convincing, although they could be improved.\n\nDetailed comments:\n- In the subjective evaluation section (5.2), Table 5 is hard to decipher, especially given that there are three measurements to take into account, so it's not easy to see the benefit of the approach. Maybe the results should be organised differently, for instance grouping them according to one measurement could help, typically showing what speed and MOS each of the three models can achieve for a given model size. Maybe plotting speed vs MOS for the same model size could also be interesting. \n- In the same section, is the WaveNet model the original one, or the Parallel WaveNet ? if it's the original, why not include Parallel WaveNet in the table ?\n- Typo at the end of Section 1: \"We orgnize\" -> \"organize\"", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I did not assess the derivations or theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1484/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1484/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "WaveFlow: A Compact Flow-based Model for Raw Audio", "authors": ["Wei Ping", "Kainan Peng", "Kexin Zhao", "Zhao Song"], "authorids": ["weiping.thu@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["flow-based models", "raw audio", "waveforms", "speech synthesis", "generative models"], "abstract": "In this work, we present WaveFlow, a small-footprint generative flow for raw audio, which is trained with maximum likelihood without complicated density distillation and auxiliary losses as used in Parallel WaveNet.

Our small-footprint WaveFlow now obtains larger test likelihood (see Table 3 in the revision) and improved speech fidelity (see Table 5 in the revision).   2) We implement convolution queue (Paine et al., 2016), which brings additional 3x to 5x speedup for WaveFlow models.  As a result, our small-footprint WaveFlow (5.91M parameters) can now generate 22.05kHz high-fidelity speech (MOS: 4.32) more than 40x faster than real-time (faster than WaveGlow), which provides a very promising neural vocoder. We also recommend setting h = 16 for neural vocoding task, because it provides better speech fidelity and its synthesis speed is only marginally slower than h = 8 with the help of convolution queue. **\n\nWe will address your detailed comments in the following.\n\n- \u201cIn the subjective evaluation section (5.2), Table 5 is hard to decipher, especially given that there are three measurements to take into account, so it's not easy to see the benefit of the approach.\u201d\n* This is a good point.  In comparison with WaveGlow, WaveFlow requires much fewer parameters (5.91M vs. 87.88M) to generate comparable fidelity speech (MOS: 4.32 vs. 4.34). Its synthesis speed is also slightly faster (42.60x vs. 34.69x).  In comparison with WaveNet, WaveFlow models synthesize speech significantly faster (e.g., 42.60x vs. 0.002x). We will emphasize the benefit of our approach in the final draft. We will also try to organize the results in a clearer way. Many thanks for your nice suggestions.\n\n- \u201cIn the same section, is the WaveNet model the original one, or the Parallel WaveNet ? if it's the original, why not include Parallel WaveNet in the table?\u201d\n* It is the autoregressive WaveNet. Note that, reproducing Parallel WaveNet, which produces high fidelity speech on public dataset, is so far beyond the capability of open source community. For example, here is some related discussion ( https://github.com/r9y9/wavenet_vocoder/issues/7 ).\n\nAlso, many thanks for pointing out the typo.

Our small-footprint WaveFlow now obtains larger test likelihood (see Table 3 in the revision) and improved speech fidelity (see Table 5 in the revision).   2) We implement convolution queue (Paine et al., 2016), which brings additional 3x to 5x speedup for WaveFlow models.  As a result, our small-footprint WaveFlow (5.91M parameters) can now generate 22.05kHz high-fidelity speech (MOS: 4.32) more than 40x faster than real-time (faster than WaveGlow), which provides a promising neural vocoder. We also recommend setting h = 16 for neural vocoding task, because it provides better speech fidelity and its synthesis speed is only marginally slower than h = 8 with the help of convolution queue. **\n\nWe will address your comments in the following.\n\n- \u201cOn one hand, we may catch the contributions. But, on the other hand, the contributions were not clearly explained. The results were averaged but were not clearly explained.\u201d\n* We can summarize our contributions in two points: \n(1) We propose a novel and unified framework for constructing likelihood-based generative models for raw audio, which includes previous approaches (WaveNet and WaveGlow) as special cases. We demonstrate the trade-off between memory footprint, generation speed and audio fidelity within the framework.\n(2) The resulting small WaveFlow is a compelling neural vocoder. In comparison with WaveGlow, it requires much fewer parameters (5.91M vs. 87.88M) to generate high fidelity speech (MOS: 4.32 vs. 4.34). Its synthesis speed is also slightly faster (42.60x vs. 34.69x).  In comparison with WaveNet, WaveFlow models are significantly faster at synthesis.\n\n- \u201cThe property of getting better performance using deeper wavenet was \"not\" clearly explained and investigated.\u201d \n* We only test 30-layer WaveNet in the paper. We think this question was perhaps raised for flow-based models. In Table 4, we investigate WaveFlow with 6x8 = 48 and 8x8 = 64 layers (e.g., row-(l) vs. row-(m)), and WaveGlow with 6x8 = 48 and 12x8 = 96 layers (e.g., row-(e) vs. row-(f)), respectively. The models stacked with larger number of flows (i.e., deeper layers) consistently provide better likelihood. This property is also well known in normalizing flow literature (e.g., [1]). We have added details in Section 5.1.\n\n[1] Rezende and Mohamed. Variational inference with normalizing flows. ICML, 2015.\n\n- \u201cThis paper mentioned that using convolution queue could improve the synthesis speed. But, the synthesis speed has been fast enough because it is almost 15 times faster than real time. In practical applications, 100x faster is almost the same as 15x faster for humans. But, the task isn\u2019t interacted with human. It is suggested to focus on reducing the number of parameters or enhancing the log likelihood.\u201d\n* From human perceptual perspective, 15x faster and 40x faster (our new result)  than real-time has minor difference. However, the convolution queue removes redundant calculation at synthesis, which will also improve system throughput in practical applications. We do agree on that reducing parameters or enhancing the log likelihood is very important for flow-based models. The previously mentioned split & reverse operation is a new endeavor after the submission. Note that, there is still significant likelihood gap that has so far existed between autoregressive models and flow-based models [2]. Our proposed model can close the gap with larger squeezing factor h (e.g., h = 64 in Table 4), or increased model size. \n\n[2] Ho et al.
