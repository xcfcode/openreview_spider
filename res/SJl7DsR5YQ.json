There are a couple typos we missed and perhaps could have written things more concisely, however we feel that this does not entirely negate the ideas and work we are contributing. Sure, the paper format could be more polished, but we believe this type of learning - from previously collected data with scalar feedback on the actions - represents an important framework in between supervised learning and RL that is not well studied. Moreover, it is very applicable to both AV and could be a very beneficial approach in this field. Additionally, although we do not explore other applications of the framework, we believe it could be applicable to other areas as well. For example, learning how much medication to administer from previously collected treatments by doctors with scalar evaluative outcomes. In the AV field, companies that want to train their AV safely can have a human do the demonstration and simply add another human to evaluate the actions, and get a drastic benefit from this over the standard end-to-end approach of behavioral cloning. We admit the paper could be more polished,  but feel that it still constitutes work of interested to the AV and ML field despite the typos. \n\n2. Yes, Mean Squared Error was used to train the FNet\n\n3. The typical off-policy approaches from RL do not work for us because they generally still require exploration. It was our explicit goal to avoid exploration. For example, Importance sampling for the stochastic policy gradient approach still requires stochastic exploration. Since we are modeling something akin to the Q* directly with f, our FNet is analogous to a deterministic policy gradient, which can be used for off-policy RL. However, again, we want to stress that Off-policy RL requires a non-zero chance of choosing any given (state, action) pair to prove convergence. Since we are clearly not doing this, we can find no real justification by drawing the RL connection. The only reason we mention it is 1) For inspiration and insight into what doesn\u2019t work. 2) Because our policy is justified in terms of a Gaussian model, a Gaussian stochastic policy gradient would wind up looking very similar and likely could be used for fine tuning with little need to tweak hyper-parameters. However, since we do not demonstrate the latter, we don\u2019t belabor this point. \n\n4. We now mention in the paper why we only use alpha of 0.0 and 1.0. Namely that all we were trying to show is that some alpha worked and every adjustment of alpha requires re-tuning the learning rate. Moreover the alpha and threshold generalization provided an easy way to recover. behavioral cloning. Perhaps we should have also stressed the fact that our training data already contained more positive examples than negative, since we included data in which we followed the lane optimally. Thus, we already had more positive examples and the training turned out fine. Clearly, however, it would be very important if one had collected twice the amount of negative data as positive data, for the reasons discussed in the loss function section. Then our alpha parameter allows for this to be easily corrected."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper251/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper251/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper251/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ReNeg and Backseat Driver: Learning from demonstration with continuous human feedback", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for solving problems by exploring and learning from mistakes.

To follow up:\n\n2. We are not clear on what you mean by \"granular feedback may work, but seems unrealistic.\u201d We do validate that it works. There has also been extensive work on using evaluative feedback from humans, e.g. COACH. Moreover, all of RL is predicated on scalar rewards. \n\n3. We will add an architecture diagram. The model is a fairly standard set of convolutions on an RGB input followed by fully connected layers. The output is a scalar in (-1,1). For the FNet, the angle input was concatenated at the fully connected laters, and the output is interpreted as feedback instead of angle. The FNet could be used as a loss function for the PNet, however, we instead simply fed in multiple discrete angles to the FNet and chose the best one. The reasons for doing so are listed in the paper.\n\n1 and 5. \nThe reward for a (state, action) pair in a standard RL framework does not change over time. In fact, the reward must be constant so that the objective is not changing. What you are describing sounds a lot like R-MAX, which is a way to control exploration. (I.e. you assume rewards you have not seen are the maximum value.) For us, to use a stochastic policy gradient, we MUST explore stochastically. For it to work, every state-action pair must have a non-zero chance and be taken infinitely many times in the limit. In this case, the car must have a chance of driving off the road. No matter how you adjust the rewards, the car has some chance of trying even really bad actions before it finds a local optimum, and in practice, this will happen.\nWe would also like to add that there are many ways to structure an ML algorithm to learn AV control. We happened to be interested in training a policy network to map directly from RGB state to continuous action of theta. We want a way to learn this from data collected entirely before training. The data also includes scalar evaluative feedback. This problem setting is not well studied as far as we can tell and could have applications outside of AV. (Consider a database of doctor\u2019s treatment dose, the state of the patient, and a scalar metric indicating the quality of the treatment.) The idea was to consider scenarios were we want to learn a policy but don\u2019t want to let our policy make important decisions until we have trained it to be very accurate."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper251/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper251/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper251/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ReNeg and Backseat Driver: Learning from demonstration with continuous human feedback", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for solving problems by exploring and learning from mistakes.

We would like to clarify and rebut some of your points:\n \n\"To the best of our knowledge, no research so far has focused on using any kind of human feedback in the context of AV control with learning from demonstration\" - This is not true. See: \"Learning Monocular Reactive UAV Control in Cluttered Natural Environments, Stephane Ross, Narek Melik-Barkhudarov, Kumar Shaurya Shankar, Andreas Wendel, Debadeepta Dey, J. Andrew Bagnell, Martial Hebert\" who used DAgger for autonomous driving of a drone with human pilot feedback. \nTheir definition of \u201cfeedback\u201d is very different from ours. They used \u201cfeedback\u201d to mean some sort of indication to the human demonstrator about how the huma\u2019s actions would turn out. This is an interesting problem, to solve, since it is hard, for example, to control a car without visual and consequential feedback, but it is entirely different than the evaluative feedback that our human critic provides to the agent. Perhaps we need to further clarify what we mean by feedback.\nThey were not only doing \u201clearning from demonstration\u201d, as we framed the problem. They allowed the agent to freely explore and then took over in emergencies. This is too risky for autonomous vehicles. Instead, we only allowed our human explorer to safely take sub-optimal actions. And this only happens before any training begins. Perhaps we need to further clarify what we mean by learning from demonstration.\n \nOur simulator is a perspective simulation, not top down. We will include an image in the final version.\nOur agent is entirely off-policy. But not only that, no exploration is done at all past the initial collection. Really we are generalizing MSE, not COACH or any stochastic policy gradient, since our approach is not calculating a stochastic policy gradient at all. Our approach is really just MSE generalized with a scalar feedback. We did, however, realize one very important difference from stochastic policy gradients by considering them: the sign of our feedback is very important now and can very easily ruin convergence if we collect more negative examples in a state than positive examples. This is not a feature of the stochastic policy setting. For this reason, we introduce the alpha parameter, which suddenly becomes very relevant in the LfD setting, which again, has no exploration.\nWe also provide a we provide an algorithm for converting angle to feedback and empirically validate it."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper251/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper251/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper251/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ReNeg and Backseat Driver: Learning from demonstration with continuous human feedback", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for solving problems by exploring and learning from mistakes.

We explore states that are bad but not dangerous, so the agent learns and can extrapolate what kinds of states are bad. You cannot do this with normal agent exploration as in RL, because the agent might explore dangerous states. And you cannot do this with imitation learning, because that framework doesn't allow for any suboptimal states to be encountered.\n\nAnd re your point about simulation: we did use a simulator to test this algorithm, but we didn't NEED to. This algorithm could be done in real life; we just chose to test in a simulator because that was all we had on hand.\n\n1. Yes, this is the point of our paper.

One reason for this is that current methods typically assume the agent can learn by exploring many states and actions, however, in many real world tasks, such as driving used here, poor actions can be dangerous. Therefore, methods that can provides the flexible benefits of RL while avoiding this are of significant interest, one promising general ideas pursued for this has been to use human demonstrations.\n\nA number of approaches to Inverse RL have been studied, but many make the assumption that the demonstrations are all examples of optimal behavior. This can be challenging if, for example, some examples contain suboptimal behavior, and it also means that the agent does not get to observe non-optimal trajectories and how to correct for them; the resulting policy often performs poorly due to the distributional shift between the demonstration trajectories and the trajectories induced by the learned policy.\n\nThis work attempts to correct for these problems by labeling the demonstration actions between $[-1, 1]$ indicating how good or bad the demonstration actions are. This introduces a challenge for learning, since good actions can be copied, but a bad action is more ambiguous: it does not necessarily imply the action are far away from the bad action is a good action.\n\nOne view of this work is that they introducing 3 losses for behavior cloning with weighted labels: A weighted (based on the label) L2 loss, an exponential loss and directly fitting the loss and searching over a discrete set of actions to find the highest estimate weighting. Note the current equation for $Loss_{FNET}$ doesn't make sense because it simply minimizing the output of the network, from the text it should be something like $(f - \\hat{\\theta})^2$?\n\nThe text discusses why rescaling the negative examples may be beneficial, but as far as I can tell, figure 4 you only consider $\\alpha=\\{0, 1\\}$? Based on the text, why weren't intermediate values of $\\alpha$ considered?\n\nIt could benefit from copy-editing, checking the equations and in some cases describing concepts more concisely using clear mathematical notation instead of wordy descriptions that are difficult to follow.\n\n``Thus the assumption\nthat our training data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from the agent\u2019s encountered\ndistribution goes out the window'' This is a misleading statement regarding the challenge of distributional shift in off-policy RL. The challenge is that state distribution between the behavior policy and the learned policy may be quite different, not just not iid. Even in on-policy RL the state visitation is certainly not usually iid.\n\n``In the off-policy policy gradient RL framework, this issue is typically circumvented by changing the\nobjective function from an expectation of the learned policy\u2019s value function over the learned policy\nstate-visitation distribution to an expectation of the learned policy\u2019s value function over the behavior\n(exploratory) state-visitation distribution (Degris et al., 2012). In the RL framework, this could be\ndealt with by an approximation off-policy stochastic policy gradient that scales the stochastic policy\ngradient by an importance sampling ratio (Silver et al., 2014) (Degris et al., 2012). ''. The importance sampling in Degris is not to correct for the objective being under the behavior state policy and DPG (Silver et al., 2014) specifically does not require importance sampling so it shouldn't be referenced here. This paragraph seems to be conflating two issues: the distributional shift between the behavior state distribution and the policy state distribution that can make off-policy learning unstable, and importance sampling to estimate outcome likelihoods using behavior experience.\n\nThis work is on a very important topic. However, in its current form it is not well-communicated. Additionally, the best performing method is not novel (as the author's state $\\alpha=1$, the best performing setting, is essentially the same as COACH but with scalar labels). For these reasons reason, I think this work may be of limited interested.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper251/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ReNeg and Backseat Driver: Learning from demonstration with continuous human feedback", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for solving problems by exploring and learning from mistakes.

Labels are collected such that the human actually moves a steering wheel and depending on the steering wheel angle disagreement with the direction the vehicle is actually moving a feedback value is collected which is used to weight the scalar loss function used to learn from these demonstrations. \n\nExperiments on a simple driving simulator is presented. \n\nComments: \n\nI think this paper is attempting to address an important problem in imitation learning that is encountered quite often in DAgger, AggreVate and variants where the expert feedback is provided on the state distribution induced by the learnt policy via a mixture policy. In DAgger (where the corrections are one-step as opposed to AggreVate where the expert takes over and shows the full demonstration to get Q(s,a)) it is difficult to actually provide good feedback especially when the expert demonstrations are not getting executed on the vehicle and hence hard for humans to ascertain what would be the actual effect of the actions they are recommending. In fact there is always a tendency to overcorrect which leads to instability in DAgger iterations. \n\nThe paper proposes using a modified feedback algorithm on page 6 whose magnitude and sign is based on how much the correction signal is in agreement or disagreement with the current policy being executed on the vehicle. \n\nUnfortunately this paper is very confusingly written at the moment. I had to take multiple passes and still can't figure out many claims and discussions: \n\n- \"To the best of our knowledge, no research so far has focused on using any kind of human feedback in the context of AV control with learning from demonstration\" - This is not true. See: \n\n\"Learning Monocular Reactive UAV Control in Cluttered Natural Environments, Stephane Ross, Narek Melik-Barkhudarov, Kumar Shaurya Shankar, Andreas Wendel, Debadeepta Dey, J. Andrew Bagnell, Martial Hebert\" who used DAgger for autonomous driving of a drone with human pilot feedback. \n\n- Lots of terms are introduced without definition or forward references. Example: \\theta and \\hat{\\theta} are provided early-on are refered to on page 3 in the middle of the page but only defined at the end of the page in 3.1. \n\n- Lots of confusing statements have been made without clear discussion like \"...we could also view our problem as a contextual bandit, since the feedback for every action falls in the same range...\" This was a baffling statement since contextual bandit is a one-step RL problem where there is no credit assignment problem unlike sequential decision-making settings as being dealt with in this paper. Perhaps something deeper was meant but it was not clear at all from text. \n\n- The paper is strewn with typos, is really verbose and seems to be written in a rush. For example, \"Since we are off-policy the neural network cannot not influence the probability of seeing an example again, and this leads can lead to problems.\"\n\n- The experiments are very simple and it is not clear whether the images in figure 2 are the actual camera images used (which would be weird since they are from an overhead view which is not what human safety drivers would actually see) or hand-drawn illustrations.\n\n", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper251/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ReNeg and Backseat Driver: Learning from demonstration with continuous human feedback", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for solving problems by exploring and learning from mistakes.

However, in the context of autonomous vehicle (AV) control, requiring an agent to make mistakes, or even allowing mistakes, can be quite dangerous and costly in the real world. For this reason, AV RL is generally only viable in simulation. Because these simulations have imperfect representations, particularly with respect to graphics, physics, and human interaction, we find motivation for a framework similar to RL, suitable to the real world. To this end, we formulate a learning framework that learns from restricted exploration by having a human demonstrator do the exploration. Existing work on learning from demonstration typically either assumes the collected data is performed by an optimal expert, or requires potentially dangerous exploration to find the optimal policy. We propose an alternative framework that learns continuous control from only safe behavior. One of our key insights is that the problem becomes tractable if the feedback score that rates the demonstration applies to the atomic action, as opposed to the entire sequence of actions. We use human experts to collect driving data as well as to label the driving data through a framework we call ``Backseat Driver'', giving us state-action pairs matched with scalar values representing the score for the action. We call the more general learning framework ReNeg, since it learns a regression from states to actions given negative as well as positive examples. We empirically validate several models in the ReNeg framework, testing on lane-following with limited data. We find that the best solution in this context outperforms behavioral cloning has strong connections to stochastic policy gradient approaches.", "TL;DR": "We introduce a novel framework for learning from demonstration that uses continuous human feedback; we evaluate this framework on continuous control for autonomous vehicles.", "authorids": ["zoe_papakipos@alumni.brown.edu", "jacob_beck@alumni.brown.edu", "mlittman@cs.brown.edu"], "authors": ["Zoe Papakipos", "Jacob Beck", "Michael Littman"], "keywords": ["learning from demonstration", "imitation learning", "behavioral cloning", "reinforcement learning", "off-policy", "continuous control", "autonomous vehicles", "deep learning", "machine learning", "policy gradient"], "pdf": "/pdf/7fb2cc13a8644487d323235883b31de2df2eaebf.pdf", "paperhash": "papakipos|reneg_and_backseat_driver_learning_from_demonstration_with_continuous_human_feedback", "_bibtex": "@misc{\npapakipos2019reneg,\ntitle={ReNeg and Backseat Driver: Learning from demonstration with continuous human feedback},\nauthor={Zoe Papakipos and Jacob Beck and Michael Littman},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJl7DsR5YQ},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper251/Public_Comment", "rdate": null, "ddate": null, "expdate": null, "duedate": null, "tmdate": 1542311883723, "tddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "reply": {"signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*|\\(anonymous\\)", "description": "How your identity will be displayed."}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "forum": "SJl7DsR5YQ", "readers": {"description": "Select all user groups that should be able to read this comment.", "value-dropdown-hierarchy": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper251/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper251/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper251/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "replyto": null, "content": {"comment": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}", "required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters)."}, "title": {"value-regex": ".{1,500}", "required": true, "order": 0, "description": "Brief summary of your comment."}}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values-copied": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference", "{signatures}"]}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "invitees": ["~"], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper251/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper251/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper251/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "multiReply": true, "taskCompletionCount": null, "transform": null, "cdate": 1542311883723}}}], "count": 17}
