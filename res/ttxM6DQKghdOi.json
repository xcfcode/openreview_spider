We posted a revised version of the paper to the arxiv (scheduled to be announced March 18 2013). \r\n\r\nWhile reviewer 1922 found the paper ``comprehensive'' and ``clearly written'', reviewers e437 and fce0 were very concerned with the presentation of the paper, describing it as ``clearly not written for a machine learning audience'' and ``As it is, the paper does not cater to a machine learning crowd '' and recommended ``this paper should be submitted to a journal'' (e437) and ``I advise the authors to either: - submit it to an algebraic geometry venue - give as many intuitions as possible to help the reader get a full grasp on the results presented. '' (fce0). \r\n\r\nHaving these recommendations in mind we recognized how certain parts of the original paper might have been too technical to be presented in this venue. We decided to revise the paper focusing on the results that could be most interesting for ICLR, providing a more intuitive picture of the main results, and to treat the purely mathematical problems elsewhere. \r\n\r\nWe significantly shortened the paper from 20 to 11.5 pages + references. We reorganized the entire paper in order to improve the readability and reduce the number of definitions and concepts used throughout. In the revision we focus on the main results which do not require much mathematical background. Following the recommendation ``it is unreasonable to put all the proof in the supplementary material where they are unlikely to receive the necessary attention'' we included the proofs in the main part of the paper. \r\n\r\nWe appreciate the positive comments of reviewer 1922, which served as orientation for which of the results could be most interesting to present here in detail. Further, we thank reviewer 1922 for the literature suggestions regarding RBMs with interactions within layers and training, but in the re-organized paper we elected not to treat these topics."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Discrete Restricted Boltzmann Machines", "decision": "conferenceOral-iclr2013-conference", "abstract": "In this paper we describe discrete restricted Boltzmann machines: graphical probability models with bipartite interactions between discrete visible and hidden variables.

The paper is clearly written. It provides a contextual introduction to the theoretical results by reviewing approximation results for Naive Bayes models and binary restricted Boltzmann machines. Section 4 of the paper lists the theoretical contributions, while proofs are are delayed to the appendix.\r\n\r\nNotably, the first result gives conditions, based on the number of hidden and visible units together with their cardinalities, for the joint RBM to be a universal approximator of distributions over the visible units. The theorem provides an extension to previous results for binary RBMs. The second result shows that discrete RBMs can represent distributions with a number of strong modes that is exponential in the number of hidden units, but not necessarily exponential in the number of parameters. The third result shows that discrete RBMs can approximate any mixture of product distributions, with disjoint supports, arbitrarily well.\r\n\r\nProposition 10 is a nice result showing that a discrete RBM is a Hadamard product of mixtures of product distributions. These decompositions often help with the design of inference algorithms. Lemma 25 provides useful connections between RBMs and mixtures. Subsequently theorem 27 discusses the relation to exponential families.\r\nTheorem 29 provides a very nice approximation bound for the KL divergence between the RBM and a distribution in the set of all distributions over the discrete state space, and so on. The paper also presents a geometry analysis but I did not follow all the appendix details about these.\r\n\r\nFinally the appendices discuss interactions within layers and training.
