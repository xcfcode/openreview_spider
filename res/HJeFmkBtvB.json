Still, as agreed by all three reviewers, this paper might not be a significant step up compared with [1]. I am raising my point to weak reject to reflect my updated belief. I think this paper needs a bit more highlights to pass the threshold. \n\n###############################\n\n\nThis paper tries to address the problem of non-parametric maximal likelihood estimation via matching the score function wrt data. It is a clear rejection due to its significant overlap with the recent NeurIPS publication [1]. The author(s) have failed to clarify how their proposal differs from [1] in a significant way. From what I can tell after a quick read, both papers tried to training the score function using the denoising auto-encoder, amortized through a neural network, strategically annealed with a sequence of different noise levels, sampled with the Langevin scheme. I put two papers side-by-side and you can visually tell the uncanny resemblance.  Additionally, the proposed model does not outperform that from [1] (see Table 1). I am also not happy about the misleading statement in the abstract that this work \"assign likelihood to test data\", which is actually performed by AIS.  Section 2.2 is particularly problematic. The assumption of \"data approximately uniformly distributed on the manifold\" is outrageous, which basically invalidates the need for density estimation because of the uniformity. The 1/f power law characteristic is irrelevant to the likelihood estimation problem, and the statements are both heuristic & misleading. \n\n[1] Y Song, S Ermon.

Indeed NCSN model take noise scale as input but is not a set of completely separate models, so our statement is not entirely accurate. We have thus updated the relevant statements in our paper. The most essential difference between our model and NCSN is that NCSN learns score of a series of different distributions while our method learns only one distribution. \n\nRegarding Q2 1) and 2) The original motivation for our model causes unnecessary confusions, therefore, we have revised our presentation in the updated manuscript. In the revision, we have clarified which part of our algorithm applies generally and which part applies only to Gaussian noise. Essentially equation 4) and 5) apply to any noise distribution, but to make the approximation between equation 5) and 6), one has to choose specific distribution to take the score average over, which will require specific knowledge about the noise distribution.\n\nThanks\n\nReferences \nY Song, S Ermon.

We also discussed possible reasons for the slight underperformance of our model.\n\nRegarding the concern about the convergence of annealed Langevin dynamics. We would like to note that it is a well-known classical result that under Langevin dynamics, the probability density of samples evolves according to the Fokker-Plank equation, which then have Boltzmann distribution p(x) = exp(-E(x)/T)/Z as equilibrium solution. This applies to any constant temperature T. However, according to Neal 2001, annealing process is a heuristic method and there is no theoretical guarantee that an annealing process will produce fair samples from the final distribution, although importance sampling technique can be used if an unbiased average of some function is needed (Neal 2001).\n\nReferences\nY Song, S Ermon.

We acknowledge that the original paper could evoke this impression. We first explain the difference between Song and Ermons\u2019 and our model and then describe the changes in the manuscript to address this issue.  \n1) Model differences:\nThe NCSN model is trained with multiple noise levels and learns a score function conditioned on noise level. In other words, the deep network in the NCSN model learns to map a tuple of a data point and noise level to a score vector.\n\nThe most important difference of our model to the NCSN model is that it is an energy-based model. In other words, the deep learning network in our model maps a data point to an energy value. Thus, the mapping uses the noise level in the data point implicitly, rather than receiving the noise level as an additional input parameter.  \n\nThis difference is reflected in the corresponding objective functions. Both objectives consist of a weighted sum of expectation values of an L2 distance and look superficially similar. But note that in the NCSN objective each L2 term in the sum contains \\sigma_i , a parameter that changes with i.  In contrast, each L2 term in our model contains the same sigma_0, the parameter of the fixed Parzen window. Further note, that the neural network in NCSN model has \\sigma_i as argument, in addition to the data point, whereas the sole argument in the neural network of our model is the data point.   \n\nAs a result of this difference, our model can perform single step denoising over all noise scales without prior information about the noise magnitude. Further, our model is directly a density function of the data whereas it is not straight-forward how to convert the noise conditioned score of the NCSN model into a density.   \n  \n\n2) We have thoroughly rewritten the abstract and body of the paper to make our contribution easily accessible. \n\nIt is now clearly acknowledged that the NCSN model is the first generative model based on denoising score matching that uses noise with multiple levels in the training to provide state-of-the-art performance in sample synthesis of high dimensional datasets. \n\nThe two contributions of our work are now clearly described. \n\n1) An energy based model providing state-of-the-art performance (among energy-based models) in sample synthesis of high dimensional data.\n\n2) Starting from the manifold hypothesis also used by Song & Ermon, we provide theoretical argument along with empirical evidence on why training with multiple noise levels is required for modeling high-dimensional data.\nThis contribution has been recognized by Reviewer 2.  \n\n\nSecond, all reviewers asked why our model performs slightly inferior on sample generation than the NCSN.  \n\nOther than the difference in model architecture and fine tuning, one plausible reason for the slight underperformance of our model is the following: Our model is more parsimonious, but during derivation of the objective function (see section 3.1 of the new version of the paper), an approximation is needed which may reduce performance.\n\nAdditionally, the NCSN\u2019s output is a vector that, at least during optimization, does not always have to be the derivative of a scalar function. For a vector field of dimension n, being the gradient of a scalar function amounts to satisfying n*(n-1)/2 partial differential equations as constraints, as the high-dimensional equivalence of the curl must be 0. For the CIFAR-10 dataset this amounts to more than 1500 constraints per pixel. In contrast, in our model the network output is a scalar function. Thus it is possible that the NCSN model performs better because it explores a larger set of functions during optimization.    \n\n\nReferences\nY Song, S Ermon.

The main contribution of the paper is to show that denoising score matching can be trained on a range of noise scales concurrently using a small modification to the loss. Compared to approximate likelihood learning of Energy based models the key benefit is to sidestep the need for sampling from the model distribution which has proven to be very challenging in practice. Using a slightly modified Langevin Sampler the paper further demonstrated encouraging sample qualities on CIFAR10 as measured by FID and IS scores. \n\nOverall I think the paper is well motivated and written, experiments are sound with encouraging results that will be useful for further progress in training energy based models. I currently score the paper as a \u2018weak accept\u2019, the reason for not giving \u2018accept\u2019 is that I think the paper is closely related to Song & Ermin 2019 (see detailed comments below) - However i can be convinced to bump my score depending on the author feedback \n\nQ1) I think you should elaborate more on how exactly your method is different from the NCSN model presented in Song & Ermon 2019? Especially.\nQ1.1) Is your method similar to the NCSN except that you do linear scaling with temperature in the loss and train a joint model across all temperature scales?\n\nQ1.2) In the related works section you claim that \u2018[Song & Ermin] \u2026 this model learns p(xhat) for each T as a separate model\u2019. Quickly reading through that paper i do not think that statement is accurate - I think they learn a model where the main difference is that it takes T as input instead of scaling the gradient term in the loss?\n\nQ1.3 )Do you have any intuition for why they seem to get slightly better results than the one you obtain in your paper? Is it simply architecture/training details that differ or something more \u2018fundamental\u2019?\n\n\nQ2) In relation to the Score matching objective.\nQ2.1) In eq (4) it is not completely clear to me what the motivation for linear scaling in T is. Can you elaborate on what you mean with \u2018We borrow intuition from physics and simply set E_T(xhat) = E(xhat)/T ...\u2019?\nIn relation to the above Can you clarify which part of your results holds for Gaussian noise and which holds in general. \n\nQ2.2) For the gaussian case I think linear scaling as done in eq(5) is sensible, however for arbitrary noise distributions linear scaling is akin to a first order approximation (which might be inaccurate across a range of different noise levels)?\nMinor: I think it would ease the reading of the paper if you showed the derivation (in appendix) that Eq (1) and Eq(2) are equivalent.\n\nMinor Comment: Learning generative models using denoising have also been explored in [Soenderby 2016]. Here the difficulties of different noise scales was also found and explored but (importantly) not solved.\n\n[Song & Ermon].

This technique has been used before but only with limited success. The authors hypothesize that this is due to the fact that the matching was only performed over a single noise scale. The main idea of this work is to employ a range of scales to learn a single energy function. This trick helps to alleviate the problem of noisy samples concentrating in a low-volume region of the ambient space.\n\nIt seems that the paper draws significant inspiration from the work by Song & Ermon, 19. The difference between the two appears to be minor:\n1) The density is represented as a Boltzman distribution and therefore the score function is reduced to the gradient of the energy function (this has been done before)\n2) Instead of conditioning the energy on the noise level the authors propose to use explicit scaling by the inverse temperature\n \nPros:\n+ The paper is mostly well-written.\n+ I think Section 2 does a good job at illustrating challenges in training energy-based models using denoising score matching with a single noise scale. \n+ As compared to (Song & Ermon, 19) using the Boltzman distribution ensures that the learned score is an actual conservative vector field. Arguably, learning an image to scalar network is easier than learning an image to image one.\n+ Samples from the model are of competitive visual quality.\n\nCons:\n- Scaling energy by the inverse temperature seems to be one of the most important aspects of the paper but is only justified by \u201cintuition from physics\u201d. I\u2019m not entirely sure that this is a valid assumption. In contrast, (Song & Ermon, 19) don\u2019t put any hard constraints on the values of the score for different noise levels besides that they are produced by a single conditional network. I would appreciate if the authors discussed that difference in more detail.\n- The authors don\u2019t provide any analysis as to whether the annealed Langevin MC procedure leads to the samples from the right distribution.\n- The quantitative results don\u2019t seem to be better (actually, they are worse) than those from (Song & Ermon, 19).\n\nNotes/questions:\n* Abstract: \u201cunmormalized\u201d -> \u201cunnormalized\u201d\n* Section 2.1, (1): \\tilde{x} -> \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}\n* Section 2.2, paragraph 2: What does superscript C mean in the noisy manifold? Never defined.\n* Section 2.2, paragraph 4: \u201csome example\u201d -> \u201csome examples\u201d (?)\n* Section 3, paragraph 1: \u201cCIFAT-10\u201d -> \u201cCIFAR-10\u201d\n* Section 4, paragraph 2: \u201cfor each T as a separate model\u201d. I don\u2019t think this is a correct statement. (Song & Ermon, 19) use a single conditional model for all the noise levels.\n* Section 4, paragraph 2: \u201cdoes not rely on explicit receive noise magnitude\u201d -> \u201cdoes not rely on receiving noise magnitude explicitly\u201d (?) I also don\u2019t quite understand this entire sentence. Does the model really infer the noise magnitude from a given image? It seems like in Equation (7) there is an assumption that the temperature T is equal to 1. I don\u2019t feel like there is a lot of difference between the proposed model and (Song & Ermon, 19) when it comes to supplying noise information. I\u2019d appreciate if the authors could clarify that bit for me.\n\nMy main concern about this paper is that it doesn\u2019t seem like a big step from its starting point (Song & Ermon, 19). The modifications are shown to work empirically but don\u2019t result in a significantly better model. Moreover, I feel like the paper could do a better job at justifying those changes. I\u2019m giving a borderline score but willing to increase it if the authors address my questions."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1624/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1624/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Annealed Denoising score matching: learning Energy based model in high-dimensional spaces", "authors": ["Zengyi Li", "Yubei Chen", "Friedrich T.

Such a estimation is essential in a variety of application problems suchas sample generation, denoising, sample restoration, outlier detection, Bayesianreasoning, and many more.  However, standard maximum likelihood training iscomputationally expensive due to the requirement of sampling model distribution.Score matching potentially alleviates this problem, and denoising score matching(Vincent, 2011) is a particular convenient version.  However,  previous attemptsfailed to produce models capable of high quality sample synthesis.  We believethat  it  is  because  they  only  performed  denoising  score  matching  over  a  singlenoise scale. To overcome this limitation, here we instead learn an energy functionusing all noise scales.   When sampled using Annealed Langevin dynamics andsingle step denoising jump, our model produced high-quality samples comparableto state-of-the-art techniques such as GANs, in addition to assigning likelihood totest data comparable to previous likelihood models.  Our model set a new sam-ple quality baseline in likelihood-based models.
