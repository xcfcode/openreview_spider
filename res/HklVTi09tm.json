Experimental results show that YOLO is robust and accurate, which outperforms traditional state-of-the-art defect detection methods significantly.\n\nPros:\n+ Detecting defects in 2D active nematics is an important task to study. \n+ YOLO is effective in object detection and shows good results for defect detection. \n+ The experiment shows that YOLO appears to outperform traditional state-of-the-art defect detection methods. \n\nCons:\n-\tThe technical contribution seems not enough. YOLO is state-of-the-art object detection method and has been widely used. However, this paper directly applies YOLO for this task, while few variants have been specifically designed or modified for the defect detection tasks. \n-\tThe experiments may miss some details. For example, what is the traditional method used for comparison? What is the difference between traditional method and YOLO? The paper should provide some explanations and introductions. \n-\tSince the training data set is imbalanced, does the proposed model utilize some strategy to overcome this problem?\n-\tThe detection rate comparison is not convincing. As shown in the experiments, traditional model and YOLO is operated by different machines, therefore, the detection rate comparison is not convincing.\n-\tThe paper contains some minors. For example, in table 1 and table 2, +1/2 defects should be -1/2.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper791/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Detecting Topological Defects in 2D Active Nematics Using Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "Active matter consists of active agents which transform energy extracted from surroundings into momentum, producing a variety of collective phenomena.

Typically, defects are identified using a costly algorithm that is based on numerically computing the winding number at different locations in the image to identify defects. The authors demonstrate that a deep learning approach offers improvement to both the identification accuracy and rate at which defects can be identified. Finally, the authors do some work investigating the limitations of the model and show that breakdown occurs near the edge of the field of view of the microscope. They show that this also happens with a conventional approach.\n\nOverall, this seemed like a nice application of machine learning to a subject that has received significant attention from soft matter community. The results appear to be carefully presented and the analysis seems solid. However, it does not seem to me that ICLR is a particularly appropriate venue for this work and it is unclear exactly what this paper adds to a discussion on machine learning. While there is nothing wrong with taking an existing architecture (YOLO) and showing that it can successfully be applied to another domain, it does limit the machine learning novelty. It also does not seem as though the authors pushed particularly hard in this direction. I would have been interested, for example, in seeing some analysis of the features learned by the architecture trained to classify defects appropriately.\n\nI would encourage the authors to either submit this work to a journal closer to soft matter or to do some work to determine what insights and lessons might help machine learning researchers working on other applied projects. The closest I got from the paper was the discussion of bounding box sizes and subclassification in section 3. It would have been nice to see some work discussing the dependence on this choice and what physical insights one might be able to glean from it. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper791/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Detecting Topological Defects in 2D Active Nematics Using Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "Active matter consists of active agents which transform energy extracted from surroundings into momentum, producing a variety of collective phenomena.
