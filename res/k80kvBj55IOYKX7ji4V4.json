Then we show that even more accurate CNNs can be trained under the guidance of LSTMs using a variant of model compression, which we call model blending because the teacher and student models are similar in complexity but different in inductive bias. Blending further improves the accuracy of our CNN, yielding a computationally efficient model of accuracy higher than any of the other individual models. Examining the effect of \u201cdark knowledge\u201d in this model compression task, we find that less than 1% of the highest probability labels are needed for accurate model compression.", "pdf": "/pdf/k80kvBj55IOYKX7ji4V4.pdf", "paperhash": "geras|blending_lstms_into_cnns", "conflicts": ["ed.ac.uk", "amazon.com", "microsoft.com", "uci.edu", "washington.edu", "ualberta.ca"], "authors": ["Krzysztof J.
