To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to solve NLI tasks with such approach.\n\nPerformance difference between proposed model and previous models?\nThe intention of this paper is to explore a new approach that extracting deep semantic features from a dense alignment tensor to solve NLI tasks. The experiment results show that our approach achieves and pushes state-of-the-art performance on multiple dataset thus justifying its potential. In error analysis section, we show the strength of our model on samples with paraphrase, antonyms and overlapping words. On the other hand, the model has limitation on samples with rules (CONDITIONAL tags). Therefore, our approaches and other approaches is in complementary with each other.\n\nWhy the model has lower accuracy on samples with CONDITIONAL tag (rules)?\nSince our approach is mainly based on attention alignment tensor, our approach has advantage over cases such as paraphrase where attention mechanism excels. How to solve samples with rules will be the focus of our future work.\n\nUnfair comparison with other model in MultiNLI?\nThough other models are subject to the limitation of RepEval 2017 workshop, ESIM baseline provided by Williams et al (2017) are not subject to such restrict. ESIM shows state-of-the-art performance on SNLI corpus. Our model outperforms their model on MultiNLI with near 6.5% of accuracy on single model setting. It is a fair comparison and our model has clear advantage over it. \n\nNo improvement over SNLI?\nAs stated by Williams et al (2017), SNLI mainly uses caption sentences which is relatively simple in syntax and semantics. However, the MultiNLI corpus, a follow-up corpus on SNLI, collects sentences from various kinds of literature and is far more challenging. Even though our model has similar performance with ESIM on SNLI, it outperforms ESIM with a large margin on MultiNLI corpus.\n\nMissing of untied parameter ablation study?\nThanks for pointing it out. We have included the study and result into the updated version of paper. As a reference, the tied parameter version of DIIN achieves 78.5 on matched-dev set and 78.3 on mismatched-dev set.\n\nReference:\nWilliams, A., Nangia, N., & Bowman, S. R. (2017).

Their results show that this model has better performance than others.\n\nEven though the results of this paper is interesting, I have the problem with paper writing and motivation for their architecture:\n\n- Paper pages are well beyond 8-page limits for ICLR. The paper should be 8-pages + References. This paper has 11 pages excluding the references.\n-  The introduction text in the 2nd page doesn't have smooth flow and sometimes hard to follow.\n-  In my view section, 3.1 is redundant and text in section 3.2 can be improved\n-  Encoding layer in section 3.2 is really hard to follow in regards to equations and naming e.g p_{itr att} and why choose \\alpha(a,b,w)? \n-  Encoding layer in section 3.2, there is no motivation why it needs to use fuse gate.\n-  Feature Extraction Layer is very confusing again. What is FSDR or TSDR?\n-  Why the paper uses Eq. 8? the intuition behind it?\n-  One important thing which is missing in this paper, I didn't understand what is the motivation behind using each of these components? and how each of these components is selected?\n- How long does it take to train this network? Since it needs to works with other models (GLOV+ char features + POS tagging,..), it requires lots of effort to set up this network.\n\nEven though the paper outperforms others, it would be useful to the community by providing the motivation and intuition why each of these components was chosen. This is important especially for this paper because each layer of their architecture uses multiple components, i.e. embedding layer [Glov+ Character Features + Syntactical features].  In my view, having just good results are not enough and will not guarantee a publication in ICLR, the paper should be well-written and well-motivated in order to be useful for the future research and the other researchers.\nIn summary, I don't think the paper is ready yet and it needs significant revision.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nComments after the rebuttal and revision :\nI'd like thanks the authors for the revision and their answers. \nHere are my comments after reading the revised version and considering the rebuttal:\n- It is fair to say that the paper presentation is much better now. That said I am still having issues with 11 pages.\n- The authors imply on page 2, end of paragraph 5,  that this is the first work that shows attention weight contains rich semantic and previous works are used attention merely as a medium for alignment.  Referring to the some of the related works (cited in this paper), I am not sure this is a correct statement.\n- The authors claim to introduce a new class of architectures for NLI and generability of for this problem. In my view, this is a very strong statement and unsupported in the paper, especially considering ablation studies (table 5). In order for the model to show the best performance, all these components should come together. I am not sure why this method can be considered a class of architecture and why not just a new model?\n\nsome other comments:\n- In page 4, the citation is missing for highway networks\n- Page 5, equation 1, the parenthesis should close after \\hat{P}_j.\n\nSince the new version has been improved, I have increased my review score.  However, I'm still not convinced that this paper would be a good fit at ICLR given novelty and contribution.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Natural Language Inference over Interaction Space", "abstract": "Natural Language Inference (NLI) task requires an agent to determine the logical relationship between a natural language premise and a natural language hypothesis.

It is very nice piece of work and the problem of coding the \"necessary semantic information required for understanding the text\" is really a very important one.\n\nYet, as many papers, it fails to be clear in describing what is its real novelty and the introduction does not help in focussing what is this innovation. \n\nThe key point of the paper seems to demonstrate that the \"interaction tensor contains the necessary semantic information required for understanding the text\". This is a clear issue as this demostration is given only using 1) ablation studies removing gates and non capabilities; 2) analyzing the behavior of the model in the annotated subpart of the MultiNLI corpus; 3) a visual representation of the alignment produced by the model. Hence, there is not a direct analysis of what's inside the interaction tensors. This is the major limitation of the study. According to this analysis, DIIN seems to be a very good paraphrase detector and word aligner. In fact, Table 6 reports the astonishing 100% in paraphrase detection for the Mismatch examples. It seems also that examples where rules are necessary are not correctly modeled by DIIN: this is shown by the poor result on Conditional and Active Passive. Hence, DIIN seems not to be able to capture rules. \n\nFor a better demostration, there should be a clearer analysis of these \"interaction tensors\". The issue of the interpretability of what is in these tensors is gaining attention and should be taken into consideration if the main claim of the paper is that: \"interaction tensor contains the necessary semantic information required for understanding the text\".

Note that the proposed DIIN model does represent a premise or a hypothesis by variable lengths (see interaction layer in Figure 1), and tensors provide some sorts of attention between them. Can this (Table 2) really shows the advantage of the proposed models? However, when a variable-length representation is allowed (see Table 3 on SNLI), the advantage of the model is also not observed, with no improvement as a single model (compared with ESIM) and being almost same as previous models (e.g., model 18 in Table 3) in ensembling.\n2) Method-wise, as discussed above, using tensors to capture high-order interaction and performing dimension reduction over that are both not novel.\n3) The paper mentions the use of untied parameters for premise and hypothesis, but it doesn\u2019t compare it with tied version in the experiment section. \n4) In Table 6, for CONDITIONAL tag, why the baseline models (lower total accuracies) have a 100% accuracy, but DIIN only has about a 60% accuracy?\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Natural Language Inference over Interaction Space", "abstract": "Natural Language Inference (NLI) task requires an agent to determine the logical relationship between a natural language premise and a natural language hypothesis.

We have updated our paper to clarify the noted defects and we list our responses as follows:\n\nBeyond 8-page limit?\n8-page length is a recommendation rather than a restriction in ICLR 2018. We have done extensive experiments to show the strength of our model and wish to be as comprehensive as possible. In order to keep the paper length short, we\u2019ll move part of content to supplementary materials.\n\nIntroduction in the 2nd page hard to follow?\nThanks for pointing it out. We have reworded the introduction in second page to make it clear.\n\nIs section 3.1 redundant? \nThe section 3.1 serves the purpose of introducing a general framework on the NLI task. As indicated by paper \u201cSupervised Learning of Universal Sentence Representations from Natural Language Inference Data\u201d, there is a generic NLI training scheme. We intend to propose a new training scheme. The experiment 3 in the ablation study intends to compare between these two approaches. \n\nBad equation notations?\nThanks for pointing it out. We have updated the paper to clarify the equations.\n\nWhy choosing \\alpha(a,b) and \\beta(a,b)?\nWe choose this notation on purpose because both of them are the function of attention. Attention has various kinds of implementation and we want to keep the option open. We have attempted multiple version of attention and they perform similarly. Therefore, we only choose one version to be presented in this paper. Other implementations of attention mechanism are beyond the discuss of this paper.\n\nThe motivation of fuse gate?\nAs indicated in encoding layer description as well as in ablation study experiment 6&7, we are motivated to use fuse gate as a skip connection. Even though using addition as skip-connection is useful to combine the output of self-attention and highway network, we empirically demonstrate that using fuse gate, which weights the new information and old one to carefully fuse them, is better than using addition. Similar observation can be found in paper \u201cRuminating Reader: Reasoning with Gated Multi-Hop Attention\u201d. \n\nWhat is FSDR or TSDR?\nThanks for pointing it out. FSDR stands for \u201cfirst scale down ratio\u201d and TSDR stands for \u201ctransition scale down ratio\u201d. They are two scale down ratio hyperparameters in feature extraction layer. In the updated version of paper, we have renamed these two hyperparameters with greek characters \\eta and \\theta. \n\n\nWhy the paper uses Eq. 8? The intuition?\nEquation is an auxiliary function that helps L2 regularization. As the training goes by, the model starts to overfit the training set. Therefore, we wish to increase the L2 regularization strength along with the training process.\n\nHow long does it take to train this network?\nThe training time depends on the task. With a single TITAN X GPU, it takes near 48 hours to converge on MultiNLI, 24 hours on SNLI and Quora Question Pair corpora. Though our model has many components as input, they only need to be processed once. The setup time is ignorable after the dataset has been processed. We have open sourced our code and processed dataset. However, due to the anonymous policy, we intend to post the link here after the paper is accepted. \n\nThe motivation behind complex component e.g. embedding layer?\nThanks for pointing it out. We have updated the paper to make sure it is as comprehensive as possible. If a component is one of the common practices, then we have cited the related references. If a component is innovated, then we have explained the motivation in text and empirically evaluate it with ablation studies.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Natural Language Inference over Interaction Space", "abstract": "Natural Language Inference (NLI) task requires an agent to determine the logical relationship between a natural language premise and a natural language hypothesis.

We have updated our paper to clarify the noted defects and we list our responses as follows:\n\nNovelty of our approaches?\nThe novelty of our approaches stands on two sides: performance side and method side. \nOn performance side, our approach pushed the new state-of-the-art performance on various dataset which is a strong indicator of the novelty.\nOn method side, our approach learned deep semantic feature from interaction space. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to solve NLI tasks with such approach.\n\n\nMain claim? \nWe have updated the main claim of the paper to \u201cthe attention weight can assist with machine to understanding the text\u201d. As noted in the review, our system is a very good paraphrase detector and word aligner. It is because our system is an exploration of attention mechanism and the feature extractor can well extract the alignment feature from attention weight (the interaction tensor). Given the fact that attention is not designed for capturing rules, our system is not strong on the samples with rules involved. How to solve the ruled based samples will be the focus of our future work. \n\n\nModel interpretability?\nThe interaction tensor is essentially a kind of high-order attention weight to model the alignment of two sentences in a more flexible way. As compared between experiment 1 and 8 in ablation study, a high-order attention weight outperform the regular attention weight with a large margin. \nThe deep learning research is known to be challenging in interpreting the model. In NLP deep learning research, we often empirically evaluate the model capacity with their performance on challenging task. \nEven though it is challenging to interpret our models directly, we tried to implement ablation studies, error analysis and visual representation to provide an intuition for our approach. \nWe thank R1 for providing very interesting paper.\n\n\nGrammer issues?\nThanks for pointing it out.
