Thank you very much for pointing out this problem. We find it exactly loose. Therefore, we will solve this problem in subsequent improvements.\n\n4. (1) We do not target to find an explicit transformation $\\tilde{W}$ of classification weights between novel and base classes. Since the ideal classifier on novel classes is unavailable, the transformation $\\tilde{W}$ is hard to explicitly optimized. (2) There are some terms regarding the distribution of novel classes in Eq. 12. These terms are unavailable and non-differentiable during training. Therefore, we focus on reducing the differentiable classifier discrepancy in Eq. 12.\n\n5. (1) In this paper, we decompose the model into a feature extractor and a classifier. The feature extractor is generally a neural network with convolution layers, and the classifier is generally linear. Popular classifiers such as PN [1] and SVM [2] do not have non-linear layers like ReLU. (2) The assumption of linear transferablity of linear classifiers is a necessary step to derivate the final objecitve.\n\n\n   [1] Snell J, Swersky K, Zemel R.

Thank you for your suggestion about experiments on cross-domain datasets. Indeed, this work focused on standard few-shot setting and didn't consider the cross-domain problem. It is possible that the classifier discrepancy is not necessarily the dominant factor in the cross-domain setting. Models might have poor seperability because of huge gap among datasets. Due to limited time, we will conduct more discussions on this issue in the follow-up works.\n2. (1) It is unnecessarily for supervised learning tasks to benefit from longer training time, as discussed in [1]. In addition, as the training time increases, the model is more likely to be over-fitted on base classes in few-shot learning and can not generalize well to novel classes. We will conduct detailed experiments in the follow-up work to verify it. (2) Hyper-parameter and constraint are two aspects. We do not focus on carefully selecting hyper-parameters.\n3. Eq. 9 in Appendix gives the relationship between the classifier discrepancy $dis_{base}$ on base classes and the classifier discrepancy $dis_{novel}$ on novel classes. By Eq. 9, we can obtain low discrepancy $dis_{novel}$ by reducing $dis_{base}$ which is computable during training.\n4. We will unify the notations in the main paper and appendix for better readability. \n5.

Neither assumption is ever proved.\n-- The proof for Lemma 1 introduces terms such as $\\epsilon_N(h^*, h'^*)$ that are never defined. This term seems to relate to $dis(h, h')$ introduced in the main paper for measuring the discrepancy between two classifiers, but that makes no sense since $h^*$ and $h'^*$ operate on completely different label spaces.\n(There are probably more; I ran out of steam at this point).\n- Comparisons to state-of-the-art in few-shot learning is missing.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper439/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper439/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": " Towards Understanding the Cause of Error in Few-Shot Learning", "authorids": ["~Liang_Song1", "~Jinlu_Liu1", "~Yongqiang_Qin1"], "authors": ["Liang Song", "Jinlu Liu", "Yongqiang Qin"], "keywords": ["upper bound of error", "feature separability", "classifier discrepancy", "few-shot learning"], "abstract": "Few-Shot Learning (FSL) is a challenging task of recognizing novel classes from scarce labeled samples.

It derives that the upper bound is decided by feature separability and classifier discrepancy and shows that classification error is mainly caused by classifier discrepancy in few-shot scenarios. In addition, this paper proposes a new method to lower the upper bound of classification error by reducing classifier discrepancy. \n\n-----------------------------------\nPros:\n1. The author proposes an upper bound of the error rate on few-shot learning.\n2. The classifier discrepancy loss is further introduced on top of the traditional methods to reduce the error rate on novel classes.\n3. Extensive experiments and a visualization of the feature space are provided to demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness.\n\n-----------------------------------\nCons:\n1. In Eq.5, isn't it supposed to be (\\hat{y_i^{\\ast}}\\neq y_i)? Otherwise, it contradicts Eq.6.\n2. Table 1 should include \\epsilon_novel(h). Otherwise, it is hard to support the statement that the error on novel classes is dominantly caused by classifier discrepancy. For a fixed \\epsilon_novel(h^{\\ast}), a large dis(h, h^{\\ast}) does not necessarily imply a large \\epsilon_novel(h).\n3. Eq.10 is too loose. As the base dataset and the novel dataset have no intersection, it is not feasible to approximate the classifier on the novel dataset with a classifier trained on the base dataset by domain adaptation. The marginal distribution won't be matched, let alone the optimal joint error.\n4. The linear transformation \\tidle{W} does not appear in the final objective Eq.16; thus, the reviewer doesn't know whether it is used during the training. Besides, by comparing Eq.16 and the proposed upper bound Eq.12, it seems that only the first two terms of the upper bound are optimized, which makes the entire method not persuasive enough.\n5. Linearity assumption for classifiers makes no sense as a simple ReLU function will introduce non-linearity, and the reviewer doesn't think it is necessary according to the final objective.\n\n-----------------------------------\nReasons for Score:\n\nThe reviewer rates 4/10 because the third concern is critical.

The authors are particularly interested in the upper-bound of the error rate, which they break down into linear separability in the feature space of the meta-train classes and classifier discrepancy on the meta-train classes, among other terms. Empirical results show that the latter is the dominant term. After identifying this, the authors propose a method, Reducing Classifier Discrepancy, to reduce the classifier discrepancy, lowering the upper-bound of the error rate. Empirical results show the benefits of the proposed method on three few-shot datasets.\n\nPros:\n1. This work investigates the cause of error in few-shot classification and finds an upper-bound for it.\n2. The proposed method, Reducing Classifier Discrepancy, is simple. Empirical results on three few-shot datasets show its effectiveness.\n\nCons:\n1. Through experimentation, the authors find that classifier discrepancy dominates the few-shot classification error. This could be due to the dataset being used for the experiments. This might not hold true in a cross-domain dataset, such as Meta-Dataset [1]. Can results be provided on such a dataset?\n2. The proposed method, Reducing Classifier Discrepancy, has two training phases. There have been works [2, 3] that show that after the first phase of conventional supervised training, the model does very well on few-shot tasks. How does the performance after the first phase compare to the that of the proposed method? Is the gain in the proposed method coming from the model being trained longer?\n3. Additionally, the classifier discrepancy loss forces better clustering of samples in the meta-train dataset. Can this not be achieved by training for longer or using better hyper-parameters?\n\nClarifications:\n1. In Equation 9 of the appendix, is the expansion of the discrepancy between \\Lambda(h) and h^{\\prime *} required for the result?\n\nNotes:\n1. It is hard to follow the equations. Additionally, the notation changes going from the main paper to the appendix. I would suggest cleaning that up for better readability.\n2. Equation 12 seems to have a typo - \\Lambda^{-1} instead of \\Lambda.\n\n[1] Mengye Ren et al. Meta-Learning for Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Classification.\n[2] Wei-Yu Chen at al.
