The whole dataset consists of several data from different sources. The authors test several representative meta-learning models (e.g., matching network, Prototype network, MAML) on this dataset and give the analysis. Furthermore, the authors combine MAML and Prototype network, which achieves the best performance on this new dataset.\n\nPros:\n+ Compared with previous datasets (e.g., miniimagenet, omniglot), the constructed meta-dataset is larger and more realistic, which contains several datasets collected from different sources\n+ Several competitive baselines are compared on this dataset under different scenarios (e.g., different number of shot) with reasonable analysis.\n\nCons:\n- I am familiar with meta-learning, however, it is my first time to review a paper whose main contribution is proposing a new benchmark. The proposed dataset may useful in further meta-learning research. However, I do not feel the construction way is quite difficult. The authors only propose several rules to construct the data set (see 3.2). \n- It would be better if the authors can explain more about Proto-MAML. My understanding of Proto-MAML is to apply the prototype on the last layer and keep the other layers.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAfter rebuttal:\n\nAfter reading the response, I think constructing a new benchmark is important and useful.

Our responses are below.\n\n1. The steps in our Episode Sampling section assume that we are \u201cgiven a particular split of a particular dataset\u201d. But we agree it would be clearer to only assume we are given a particular split, and add \u201cStep 0: Uniformly sample a dataset from the set of datasets that have classes assigned to the chosen split\u201d. We will update the text to reflect this suggestion.\n2. Good idea, we will update Figure 1c,d to also include error bars.\n3. We agree it seems odd to present Proto-MAML in the Background section, as it is one of the contributions of this work, and not background. Section 3 however is dedicated to the description of the Meta-Dataset benchmark, so we didn\u2019t want to blend that with describing models. Perhaps it would be clearer to rename the Background section to something like: \u201cFew-shot Classification Task and Approaches\u201d. Alternatively, we can create a separate sub-section or section solely for introducing Proto-MAML. We thank Reviewer 2 for pointing this out and look forward to hearing their thoughts on this.\n4. Steps 2b and 2c describe two different processes: 2b computes the *total* support set size, and 2c then decides how to distribute that total budget among the different classes that will participate in the episode. We therefore believe it\u2019s clearer to keep them separate, but we\u2019re happy to discuss this further if Reviewer 2 still disagrees.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1019/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1019/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["eleni@cs.toronto.edu", "tylerzhu@google.com", "vdumoulin@google.com", "lamblinp@google.com", "evcu@google.com", "kelvinxu@berkeley.edu", "goroshin@google.com", "cgel@google.com", "kswersky@google.com", "manzagop@google.com", "hugolarochelle@google.com"], "title": "Meta-Dataset: A Dataset of Datasets for Learning to Learn from Few Examples", "authors": ["Eleni Triantafillou", "Tyler Zhu", "Vincent Dumoulin", "Pascal Lamblin", "Utku Evci", "Kelvin Xu", "Ross Goroshin", "Carles Gelada", "Kevin Swersky", "Pierre-Antoine Manzagol", "Hugo Larochelle"], "pdf": "/pdf/5bbab78661f015b59ef2f2bad5695aa5b98cd6c8.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a new large-scale diverse environment for few-shot learning, and evaluate popular models' performance on it, revealing important research challenges.", "abstract": "Few-shot classification refers to learning a classifier for new classes given only a few examples.

This is the only difference compared to vanilla MAML. Intuitively then, the aim is to meta-learn the embedding weights such that: given a new task, initializing the output layer from the prototypes of that task and performing a few adaptation steps on the embedding and output layer suffice for performing well on the query set of that task. \n\nWe\u2019d be happy to answer any other questions about Proto-MAML and update the text accordingly if Reviewer 3 thinks our explanation is unclear.

We tried our best to keep the submission within the recommended 8 page limit while at the same time including most important results in the main paper. If all reviewers agree though, we would love to use some extra space (the hard limit is 10 pages if we understand correctly) to move some of the figures from the Appendix into the main paper.\n\nMeanwhile, we tried our best to arrange things so that the Appendix does not have too many new results. Instead, most of the plots there offer different viewpoints of the results already presented in the main paper. More concretely, in the Appendix:\n- Figure 3 performs the same analysis as Figure 1c,d but for the case of training on all datasets. This is presented for completeness but the conclusion is the same as for the ImageNet-only case which is presented in the main paper.\n- Figure 4 is an alternative visualization of Table 1 in bar plot form (there is no new information there).\n- Figure 5 is computed by taking the element-wise difference of the two sets of results in Table 1 (trained on all datasets - trained on ImageNet only). It offers a perhaps more convenient way of visualizing those results but also does not contain any new information that is not in Table 1.\n- Figures 6 and 8 contain exactly the same plots as Figure 1a,b, and Figure 1e,f, respectively, only printed larger for easier viewing of error bars.\n- Figures 7 and 9 offer alternative views of the barplots in Figures 6 and 8, respectively (do not contain any additional information).\n- Table 2 contains the same results as Table 1 with the only difference of displaying confidence intervals and per-dataset ranks too, for completeness.\n- Figure 10 contains the fine-grainedness analysis that we discuss in the main text just above the conclusion. This is not a main result so we think that simply mentioning the take-away in the main paper is sufficient.\n\nRegarding the second suggestion: \u201cRemoval of repeating results from the main text\u201d, we were not sure which \u201crepeating results\u201d Reviewer 1 is referring to and we\u2019d appreciate a clarification, so we can appropriately take it into consideration.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1019/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1019/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["eleni@cs.toronto.edu", "tylerzhu@google.com", "vdumoulin@google.com", "lamblinp@google.com", "evcu@google.com", "kelvinxu@berkeley.edu", "goroshin@google.com", "cgel@google.com", "kswersky@google.com", "manzagop@google.com", "hugolarochelle@google.com"], "title": "Meta-Dataset: A Dataset of Datasets for Learning to Learn from Few Examples", "authors": ["Eleni Triantafillou", "Tyler Zhu", "Vincent Dumoulin", "Pascal Lamblin", "Utku Evci", "Kelvin Xu", "Ross Goroshin", "Carles Gelada", "Kevin Swersky", "Pierre-Antoine Manzagol", "Hugo Larochelle"], "pdf": "/pdf/5bbab78661f015b59ef2f2bad5695aa5b98cd6c8.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a new large-scale diverse environment for few-shot learning, and evaluate popular models' performance on it, revealing important research challenges.", "abstract": "Few-shot classification refers to learning a classifier for new classes given only a few examples.

It performs an empirical evaluation of six algorithms from the literature, k-NN, FineTune, Prototypical Networks, Matching Networks, Relation Networks, and MAML. A new approach combining Prototypical Networks and first-order MAML is shown to outperform those algorithms, but there is substantial room for improvement overall.\n\nMany papers in the literature have observed that current algorithms achieve very high performance on existing few-shot classification data sets such as Omniglot, making it difficult to compare them. This paper fills the need for a more challenging data set. This data set is also more realistic in that\n1. The training and test data may come from different data sets. In the real world, we often encounter locations, weather conditions, etc. that are unseen during training, and agents must be able to adapt quickly to these new situations.\n2. Classes are selected based on their semantic structure. This allows control of the difficulty of the task, as it is easier to adapt to a semantically similar class, and thus enables a more nuanced comparison of few-shot classification algorithms.\n\nSuggestions for clarifying the writing:\n1. Section 3 should also discuss choosing the data set to sample from.\n2. In figures 1c and 1d, it would be helpful to include standard error regions, like in the rest of figure 1.\n3. Maybe the paragraph on Proto-MAML should be moved to section 3, as it is not from previous literature. In addition, steps 2b and 2c in section 3.2 overlap in content, and so it may be clearer to combine them."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1019/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1019/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["eleni@cs.toronto.edu", "tylerzhu@google.com", "vdumoulin@google.com", "lamblinp@google.com", "evcu@google.com", "kelvinxu@berkeley.edu", "goroshin@google.com", "cgel@google.com", "kswersky@google.com", "manzagop@google.com", "hugolarochelle@google.com"], "title": "Meta-Dataset: A Dataset of Datasets for Learning to Learn from Few Examples", "authors": ["Eleni Triantafillou", "Tyler Zhu", "Vincent Dumoulin", "Pascal Lamblin", "Utku Evci", "Kelvin Xu", "Ross Goroshin", "Carles Gelada", "Kevin Swersky", "Pierre-Antoine Manzagol", "Hugo Larochelle"], "pdf": "/pdf/5bbab78661f015b59ef2f2bad5695aa5b98cd6c8.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a new large-scale diverse environment for few-shot learning, and evaluate popular models' performance on it, revealing important research challenges.", "abstract": "Few-shot classification refers to learning a classifier for new classes given only a few examples.
