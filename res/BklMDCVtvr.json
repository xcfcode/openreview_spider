We have done our best to incorporate the suggestions from you and the other reviewers into the revised version of the paper now uploaded to OpenReview. Your comments led to considerable revisions of the paper, as the length of this comment attests. We hope you will agree that the paper is notably stronger as a result.\n\nFollowing your suggestion, we are computing the variance in our results; we expect that this will be incorporated into a final revision that we will upload on Friday Nov 15.\n\nRegarding the SCAN role analysis, there are 3 facets which may contribute to your concern that we\u2019d like to comment on. \n\n1. As mentioned in the paper, the role-assignment algorithm now in Appendix A.8.1 was indeed hand-generated, as were the admittedly speculative comments in Sec. 6.2 about how such a role scheme might contribute to the strong performance of the original GRU seq2seq SCAN network being analyzed by ROLE. In our view, however, interpretation of neural nets has an inevitable human component, as the goal is to connect the formal properties of the network to (informal) human understanding. We see these human-generated observations as hypotheses to test; although the generation of hypotheses may not be formal, testing them can be. Formally testing the hypothesized algorithm in Sec. A.8.1 is straightforward, and as reported in Sec. A.8.1, the result is 98.7% accuracy on the test set, which was not consulted when generating the hypothesized algorithm from the training set alone: the algorithm does not over-fit the data used to generate it, but robustly generalizes to held-out data. Thus, while the hypothesized algorithm was informally generated, it received strong formal verification: the best outcome possible, in our view.\n\n2. The revised paper makes the following argument in Appendix A.8.2 (p. 17): \u201c The algorithm in A.8 does not constitute a simple, transparent role scheme. But its job is to describe the representations that the original network produces, and we have no a priori expectation about how complex that process may be. The role-assignment algorithm implicitly learned by ROLE is interpretable locally (each line is readily expressible in English), but not intuitively transparent globally. We see this as a positive result, in two respects. \n\nFirst, it shows why ROLE is crucial: no human-generated role scheme would provide a good approximation to this algorithm; it can only be identified because ROLE is able to use gradient descent to find role schemes far more complex than any we would hypothesize intuitively. This enables us to analyze networks far more complex than we could analyze previously when we were limited to hand-designed role schemes based on human intuitions about how to perform the task. \nSecond, when future work illuminates the computation in the original SCAN GRU seq2seq decoder, the baroqueness of the role-assignment algorithm that ROLE has shown to be implicit in the seq2seq encoder can potentially explain certain limitations in the original model, which is known to suffer from severe failures of systematic generalization outside the training distribution (Lake and Baroni, 2018). It is reasonable to hypothesize that systematic generalization requires that the encoder learn an implicit role scheme that is relatively simple and highly compositional. Future proposals for improving the systematic generalization of models on SCAN can be examined using ROLE to test the hypothesis that greater systematicity requires greater compositional simplicity in the role scheme implicitly learned by the encoder.\u201d \n\n3. While the role-assignment algorithm of A.8.1 may not be simple, it is quite surprising that it is not far more complex. Although ROLE is provided 50 roles to learn to deploy as it likes, it only chooses to use 16 of them (only 16 are ever selected as the argmax($\\mathbf{a}_t$); see Sec. 6.1). And as stated in the revised paper in Sec. A.8.2 (p. 17): \u201cThe SCAN grammar generates 20,910 input sequences, containing a total of 151,688 words (an average of 7.25 words per input). This means that, if one were to generate a series of conditional statements to determine which role is assigned to each word in every context, this could in theory require up to 151,688 conditionals (e.g., \u201cif the filler is \u2018jump\u2019 in the context \u2018walk thrice after ____ opposite left\u2019, then assign role 17\u201d). However, our algorithm involves just 47 conditionals. This reduction helps explain how the model performs so well on the test set:If it used many more of the 151,688 possible conditional rules, it would completely overfit the training examples in a way that would be unlikely to generalize. The 47-conditional algorithm we found is more likely to generalize by abstracting over many details of the context.\u201d\n\nWe thank you again for your comments, which have led us to improve the paper significantly.

Regarding our suggestions for how improved understanding of the compositional structure of RNN representations might lead to improved future architectures, we agree that these were brief and tentative, so we have rephrased Sec. 1 to focus the overview on the main issue addressed, a question of understanding: \u201cHow do NNs achieve such strong generalization on partially-compositional tasks, and good performance on fully-compositional tasks?\u201c We  have also expanded our concrete proposal for a \u2018factorization bias\u2019 into a new Section A.11 of the Appendix, and have inserted additional text in Sec. 8 where we make more substantial suggestions for improving future models: \u201cIn this work, we used ROLE to interpret the workings of a target encoder $\\mathcal{E}$, and in future work, we plan to train ROLE in an end-to-end manner, either using it as the encoder itself, or using it to regularize a standard (e.g., RNN) encoder with a loss term that rewards learning compositional encodings, operationalized as encodings that ROLE can approximate well.

In addition to the revisions mentioned below, let us point out a new Section of the Appendix, A.8.2, which contains considerable discussion of the algorithm ROLE implicitly uses to assign roles; we think there are several important points there. \n\nRegarding the standard RNN used on SCAN, the current revision adds an additional section to the appendix (A.6) where we discuss this in some detail. As for the activation function, we used a standard GRU cell, which includes both sigmoid and tanh activation functions.\n\nAs for our suggestions for how improved understanding of the compositional structure of RNN representations might lead to improved future architectures, we agree that these were brief and tentative, so we have rephrased Sec. 1 to focus the overview on the main issue addressed, a question of understanding: \u201cHow do NNs achieve such strong generalization on partially-compositional tasks, and good performance on fully-compositional tasks?\u201c We  have also expanded our concrete proposal for a \u2018factorization bias\u2019 into a new Section A.11 of the Appendix, and have inserted additional text in Sec. 8 where we make more substantial suggestions for improving future models: \u201cIn this work, we used ROLE to interpret the workings of a target encoder $\\mathcal{E}$, and in future work, we plan to train ROLE in an end-to-end manner, either using it as the encoder itself, or using it to regularize a standard (e.g., RNN) encoder with a loss term that rewards learning compositional encodings, operationalized as encodings that ROLE can approximate well. We will test whether such an explicit bias for compositionality allows networks to train faster, or with fewer parameters, and to achieve more systematic generalization.

The main motivations are the understanding of what is learnt by a such neural network and getting ideas on which architecture to choose for improving generalization on compositional tasks.\n \nThe experimental study shows that ROLE \u2019s results are relevant when dealing with a fully compositional model by design. This is a kind of sanity check, that ROLE may uncover the ground truth from the data, while no prior information is provided on the nature of the roles. \nThe experiments on the SCAN dataset concern a standard RNN model learned from data. I am not sure of the nature of RNN used here. How many layers, which activation function ? The experimental section also provides insights on what is learned by the ROLE model and on how its (compositional) representations match the ones learned by the RNN.     \n\nAs far as in understand, beyond the understanding of the learned representations in RNNs, the paper motivates the work with the expectation that the gained knowledge might be useful for designing better neural nets, with improved generalization ability.

To analyze the internal representations that enable such success, we propose ROLE, a technique that detects whether these representations implicitly encode symbolic structure. ROLE learns to approximate the representations of a target encoder E by learning a symbolic constituent structure and an embedding of that structure into E\u2019s representational vector space. The constituents of the approximating symbol structure are defined by structural positions \u2014 roles \u2014 that can be filled by symbols. We show that when E is constructed to explicitly embed a particular type of structure (e.g., string or tree), ROLE successfully extracts the ground-truth roles defining that structure. We then analyze a seq2seq network trained to perform a more complex compositional task (SCAN), where there is no ground truth role scheme available. For this model, ROLE successfully discovers an interpretable symbolic structure that the model implicitly uses to perform the SCAN task, providing a comprehensive account of the link between the representations and the behavior of a notoriously hard-to-interpret type of model. We verify the causal importance of the discovered symbolic structure by showing that, when we systematically manipulate hidden embeddings based on this symbolic structure, the model\u2019s output is also changed in the way predicted by our analysis. Finally, we use ROLE to explore whether popular sentence embedding models are capturing compositional structure and find evidence that they are not; we conclude by discussing how insights from ROLE can be used to impart new inductive biases that will improve the compositional abilities of such models.", "code": "https://github.com/iclr2020-anonymous1/role-learner", "keywords": ["compositionality", "generalization", "neurosymbolic", "symbolic structures", "interpretability", "tensor product representations"], "paperhash": "soulos|discovering_the_compositional_structure_of_vector_representations_with_role_learning_networks", "original_pdf": "/attachment/4c792fb19d9714ce4baed411393ac91500ba7130.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nsoulos2020discovering,\ntitle={Discovering the compositional structure of vector representations with Role Learning Networks},\nauthor={Paul Soulos and Tom McCoy and Tal Linzen and Paul Smolensky},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BklMDCVtvr}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
