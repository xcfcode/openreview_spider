(I could not speak how this relates to prior work in similar areas - outside my domain.)\n\nNovelty:\n\nThis doesn't feel to me that novel, but the idea may not have been used in this domain.\n\nClarity:\n\nClear enough\n\nSignificance:\n\nI doubt that this is highly significant\n\nQuality:\n\nThis seems a fairly minor contribution.\n\nIt wasn't quite clear to me how you do textification for things like numeric fields, but maybe you effectively tokenize them and do it a digit at a time or something? There has been some recent work on \"attacks\" on neural models where effectively you are extracting source text from out of learned parameters. Could the approach here fall prey to the same idea and hence end up revealing more than the authors' suspect? There is no proof that the word vector encoding is really secure. See e.g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08232.pdf . The introduction paragraph felt a bit data and too elementary for the core ICLR audience.\n\nPros:\n\n- This is sort of interesting as a perhaps novel use of word vectors\n- It is sort of appealing to think of an embedding model as a one-way semantic hash.\n\nCons:\n\n- There's just not a ton of content in this paper, even for a workshop paper. No experiments. No proofs/proof sketches. All there is is the idea of doing this and an illustrative example.\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "USING WORD EMBEDDING TO SELECTIVELY DISCLOSE DATABASE INFORMATION", "abstract": "Database information may be disclosed in a variety of ways depending on the sensitivity of the stored information and the recipient\u2019s need to know.

There is a quick introduction to word embeddings, which is very out of place for ICLR (everyone will get the basic gist of word embeddings, hopefully), but no effort to relate the work to e.g. knowledge base representations, or representation learning over databases. See e.g. Nickel et al. (2016) \"A Review of Relational Machine Learning for Knowledge Graphs\", and references therein, e.g. Nickel et al. (2011) \"A Three-Way Model for Collective Learning on Multi-Relational Data\" and Bordes et al. (2011) \"Learning Structured Embeddings of Knowledge Bases\" for embedding structured information, or e.g. Seq2SQL for learning to interface with databases, or Key-Value Memory Networks for querying. Sections 1 and 2 generally feel like a throwback to 2014, while the field has moved on significantly.\n\nThe (rather laughably named) \"Cognitive intelligence\" queries should have been explained much better, and looking at that paper I also find it hard to see what is new about it from an ML perspective.

The mechanism is based on word embedding, a technique from Natural Language processing (NLP) in which each word is associated with a low dimensional (say, 200) vector of real numbers. These vectors are constructed so as to capture the meaning of the associated words. In disclosing vectors constructed based on sensitive information, rather than the information itself, we achieve degrees of disclosures.", "paperhash": "bordawekar|using_word_embedding_to_selectively_disclose_database_information", "keywords": ["Word Embedding", "Data Privacy", "Relational Databases"], "_bibtex": "@misc{\n  bordawekar2018using,\n  title={USING WORD EMBEDDING TO SELECTIVELY DISCLOSE DATABASE INFORMATION},\n  author={Rajesh Bordawekar and Oded Shmueli},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1tLzLkvf}\n}", "authorids": ["bordaw@us.ibm.com", "oshmuel@cs.technion.ac.il"], "authors": ["Rajesh Bordawekar", "Oded Shmueli"], "TL;DR": "Using word embedding approaches to enable data privacy in relational databases", "pdf": "/pdf/0a85b89c8dfa68bfb7bdfefef7a3d6791d2b67ac.pdf"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "duedate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "tmdate": 1518629844880, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/-/Acceptance_Decision", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs"], "reply": {"forum": null, "replyto": null, "invitation": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/-/Submission", "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs"]}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs"]}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "value-dropdown": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs", "everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 1, "value": "ICLR 2018 Workshop Acceptance Decision"}, "comment": {"required": false, "order": 3, "description": "(optional) Comment on this decision.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{0,5000}"}, "decision": {"required": true, "order": 2, "value-dropdown": ["Accept", "Reject"]}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "cdate": 1518629844880}}}], "count": 5}
