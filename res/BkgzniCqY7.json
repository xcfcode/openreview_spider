Yet am not quite sure how \u201cobtained group-sparse adversarial patterns better shed light on the mechanisms of adversarial perturbations\u201d. I think the mechanisms of adversarial perturbations remain as unclear as they were before this paper.\n\nI am not ready to recommend acceptance of this paper, because I think the due effort to explain the motivation for research and its potential impacts has not been done in this case. \n\nUPD: the discussion and the edits with the authors convinced me that I may have been a bit too strict.

We show that StrAttack is indeed the desired adversarial attack. \n\n\nIn the revised paper, we strengthen the potential impacts of StrAttack from the aspects a) performance of attacking robust adversarially trained model, a) attack transferability, and c) interpretability of complex images. \n\n\nFirst, we show the powerfulness of StrAttack to attack the defensive model obtained from robust adversarial training [Madry et al. 2018], which is commonly regarded as the strongest defense on MNIST. As we can see, although StrAttack perturbs much less pixels, its attack success rate does not drop. This implies that we could perturb less but \u2018right\u2019 pixels  (with better interpretable adversarial patterns) without losing its attack performance. \n\nSecond, we compare the transferability of StrAttack to other attacks. Here the transferability is characterized by the attack success rate of adversarial examples (found by one attack generation method against a given network model) transferred to another different network model. We present the transferability of 3 attacks from the model Inception V3 to model Inception V3, Inception V4, ResNet 50, ResNet 152, DenseNet 121 and DenseNet  161. As we can see, StrAttack yields the highest transferability almost at every model. We refer the reviewer to Table 3 for more details. \n\n\nThird, we show more examples to visualize the interpretability of adversarial perturbations on certain complex images. In the \u2018pug\u2019-\u2018street sign\u2019 example of Fig. 4, objects of the original label (pug) and the target label (street sign) exist simultaneously. As we can see, adversarial perturbations generated from StrAttack are perfectly matched to the most discriminative image regions localized by CAM: the adversary shows suppression on the discriminative region of the original label and promotion on the discriminative region of the target label. By contrast, the CW attack is less interpretable due to the high noise visibility (perturbing too many pixels).\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper689/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper689/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper689/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Structured Adversarial Attack:  Towards General Implementation and Better Interpretability", "abstract": "When generating adversarial examples to attack deep neural networks (DNNs), Lp norm of the added perturbation is usually used to measure the similarity between original image and adversarial example.

Our structure-driven attack is motivated by devising a more efficient attack that takes advantages of two attacks using extremely opposite principles - C\\&W attack (or \\ell_infty attacks such as I-FGSM) that modifies all pixels, and one-pixel attack (Su et al., 2017) that only modifies a few pixels. The C\\&W attack can achieve small \\ell_infty perturbations but has to perturb most pixels (large \\ell_0 norm). Although the one-pixel attack can achieve extremely small \\ell_0 norm but with much higher \\ell_infty norm and low attack success rate.  Both the above attack methods lead to higher noise visibility due to perturbing too many pixels or perturbing a few pixels too much. Motivated by them, we wonder if there exists a more effective attack that can be as successful as existing attacks but only requires to modify a small subset of pixels, and what the resulting sparse adversarial pattern can tell. To answer these questions, we propose StrAttack which achieves strong group sparsity without losing attack effectiveness including both attack success rate and Lp distortion. Furthermore, we show that the resulting sparse adversarial patterns offer a great interpretability through adversarial saliency map (ASM) and class activation map (CAM).\n\nb) The proposed StrAttack problem formulation cannot be solved using standard optimization solvers, e.g., Adam, or proximal gradient algorithm, etc, due to the presence of non-smooth regularizers and hard constraints. To address this technique challenge, we proposed the ADMM solution that splits the original complex problem into neat subproblems, each of which yields an analytical solution.\n\nc) We investigated the group sparsity by exploring various mask sizes. Clearly, there is a trade-off between the group size and the representation of local regions. Large mask size tends to make StrAttack insensitive to the structure of local regions. In the experimental evaluation of this paper, the best mask size that we empirically found are 2x2 MNIST/CIFAR-10 and 13x13 for ImageNET respectively.\n\nLast but not the least, to strengthen the effectiveness and the interpretability of StrAttack, in the revised version we present the potential impacts of StrAttack from a) performance of attacking robust adversarially trained model (Table 2),  b) attack transferability (Table 3),  and c) interpretability of complex images (Figure 4).

As a prompt response, we would like to use this opportunity to reiterate and clarify our motivation, contributions and their potential impacts. Meanwhile, we are also preparing a revision to better address the reviewer's comments.\n\na) The first contribution \"Structure-driven attack\" actually indicates the existence of a more stealthy pixel-level adversarial attack under the same norm-bounded threat model, which has not been entirely explored in existing attacks. The motivation of our research stems from devising a more efficient attack that takes advantages of two attacks using extremely opposite principles - C\\&W attack (or \\ell_infty attacks such as I-FGSM) that modifies all pixels, and one-pixel attack (Su et al., 2017) that only modifies a few pixels. The C\\&W attack can achieve small \\ell_infty perturbations but has to perturb most pixels (large \\ell_0 norm), while the one-pixel attack can achieve extremely small \\ell_0 norm but with much higher \\ell_infty norm.\n\nBoth attack methods may lead to higher noise visibility due to perturbing too many pixels or perturbing a few pixels too much. Motivated by these attack methods and under the same threat model (e.g., \\ell_infty constraint), we wonder if there exists a more effective attack that can be as successful as existing attacks but only requires to modify a small subset of pixels. We show that StrAttack is indeed the desired adversarial attack. It is also worth mentioning that one pixel attack has much lower attack success rate on ImageNet than CW and ours. \n\nConsequently, the impacts of StrAttack include (i): understanding why the identified regions in the image are vulnerable to adversarial attacks; and (ii) investigating how the identified attack sparse patterns can benefit adversarial attacks/defenses\n\nb) The second and the third contributions are our technical contributions from the algorithmic perspective. The results indicate that powerful attacks could be derived from more advanced optimization techniques. Note that the proposed StrAttack problem formulation cannot be solved using standard optimization solvers, e.g., Adam, or proximal gradient algorithm, etc, due to the presence of non-smooth regularizers and hard constraints. To address this technique challenge, we proposed the ADMM solution which is quite new for finding adversarial perturbations and enjoys the benefit of having an analytical solution at every ADMM subproblem.\n\nc) We thank R2 for acknowledging interpretability as an impactful contribution. The proposed idea indeed helps researchers to better explain and visualize the effect of adversarial perturbations. Our experimental results, e.g., Figure 1 and 3, clearly show that why we could perturb less but `right` pixels  (with group-sparse patterns) to fool DNNs. Those `right` pixels are the most sensitive pixels to affect the output of classifiers, checked by adversarial saliency analysis in Sec. 6. They also correspond to the most discriminative region of a class activation map, which demonstrates the interpretability of the proposed structured attack. Also, we would like to clarify that \"The mechanisms of adversarial perturbations \" meant the above findings. Based on the feedback, we now realize that  'mechanisms' might not be the best word to describe our contribution, and thus we will rephrase our claim and make it clearer and more accurate. Note that many adversarial attack methods were proposed in the literature, however, few of them linked interpretability with adversarial examples.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper689/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper689/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper689/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Structured Adversarial Attack:  Towards General Implementation and Better Interpretability", "abstract": "When generating adversarial examples to attack deep neural networks (DNNs), Lp norm of the added perturbation is usually used to measure the similarity between original image and adversarial example.

We also show that StrAttack provides better interpretability (i.e., better correspondence with discriminative image regions) through adversarial saliency map (Paper-not et al., 2016b) and class activation map (Zhou et al., 2016).", "keywords": [], "authorids": ["xu.kaid@husky.neu.edu", "sijia.liu@ibm.com", "zhao.pu@husky.neu.edu", "pin-yu.chen@ibm.com", "ecezhang@ucdavis.edu", "qfan@us.ibm.com", "erdogmus@ece.neu.edu", "yanz.wang@northeastern.edu", "xue.lin@northeastern.edu"], "authors": ["Kaidi Xu", "Sijia Liu", "Pu Zhao", "Pin-Yu Chen", "Huan Zhang", "Quanfu Fan", "Deniz Erdogmus", "Yanzhi Wang", "Xue Lin"], "pdf": "/pdf/c2894f6bd590649f8df8a3b128ac6d28ccaa54f6.pdf", "paperhash": "xu|structured_adversarial_attack_towards_general_implementation_and_better_interpretability", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nxu2018structured,\ntitle={Structured Adversarial Attack:  Towards General Implementation and Better Interpretability},\nauthor={Kaidi Xu and Sijia Liu and Pu Zhao and Pin-Yu Chen and Huan Zhang and Quanfu Fan and Deniz Erdogmus and Yanzhi Wang and Xue Lin},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkgzniCqY7},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper689/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234402327, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "BkgzniCqY7", "replyto": "BkgzniCqY7", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper689/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335781147, "tmdate": 1552335781147, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper689/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 13}
