The most recent revision of the paper incorporates a number of the suggestions and aims to address the most serious concerns.\n\nAnonReviewer3\n\n- Can authors comment about the computational resources needed to train the UNREAL agent?\n\nPlease see the answer to a previous question below.\n\n- The overall architecture is quite complicated. Are the authors willing to release the source code for their model?\n\nThe UNREAL architecture was quite straightforward to implement. We will add pseudocode to the appendix of the camera ready version to clarify how the model works. We don\u2019t currently have plans to release the code but we\u2019re happy to assist any open source reimplementation effort.\n\nAnonReviewer4\n\n- I believe you should say something about the extra computational cost of optimizing these auxiliary tasks. How much do you lose in terms of training speed? Which are the most costly components?\n\nPlease see the answer to a previous question below. The wall clock speedup of UNREAL vs A3C is currently about 8x.\n\n- If possible, please try to make it clearer in the abstract / intro that the agent is learning different policies for each task. When I read in the abstract that the agent \"also maximises many other pseudo-reward functions simultaneously by reinforcement learning\", my first understanding was that it learned a single policy to optimize all rewards together, and I realized my mistake only when reaching eq. 1.\n\nThanks for pointing this out. We\u2019ve tried to clarify this in the abstract.\n\n- The \"feature control\" idea is not validated empirically (the preliminary experiment in Fig. 5 is far from convincing as it only seems to help slightly initially). I like that idea but I am worried by the fact the task is changing during learning, since the extracted features are being modified. There might be stability / convergence issues at play here.\n\nThat is a fair point. We have updated the paper with improved results for feature control. We used a target network to make the features being controlled change less frequently during training. Feature control now works roughly as well as pixel control.\n\n- Since as you mentioned, \"the performance of our agents is still steadily improving\", why not keep them going to see how far they go? (at least the best ones)\n\nWe haven\u2019t done this because we were following the training protocol for A3C. It would be interesting to see where the scores saturate.\n\n- Why aren't the auxiliary tasks weight parameters (the lambda_*) hyperparameters to optimize? Were there any experiments to validate that using 1 was a good choice?\n\nWe do include the lambda for pixel control in the hyperparameter search. The parameter ranges are given in the Appendix.\n\n- Please mention the fact that auxiliary tasks are not trained with \"true\" Q-Learning since they are trained off-policy with more than one step of empirical rewards (as discussed in the OpenReview comments)\n\nWe do say that they are trained with n-step Q-learning. Do you mean that it is not a true off-policy learning method?\n\nAnonReviewer5\n\n- I think one weakness of the paper (or rather, considering the number of things that can fit in a paper, crucially needed future work) is that there is very little experimental analysis of the effect of the auxiliary tasks appart from their (very strong) effect on performance. In the same vein, pixel/feature control seems to have the most impact, in Labyrinth just A3C+PC beats anything else (except UNREAL), I think it would have been worth looking at this, either in isolation or in more depth, measuring more than just performance on RL tasks.\n\nWe have noticed some qualitative differences between the learned policies of the UNREAL and A3C agents. The policies learned by UNREAL tend to \u201cpay attention\u201d to where they are going, for example they look straight ahead when moving forward while agents trained with A3C sometimes look in less informative directions (e.g. looking at the sky). They also seem to lead to agents which prefer to stay in the middle of corridors, bump much less frequently into walls."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Reinforcement Learning with Unsupervised Auxiliary Tasks", "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning agents have achieved state-of-the-art results by directly maximising cumulative reward.

Or vice-versa, in pixel control why not learn to maximally activate a pixel? I can think of my own reasons but I am curious as to your reasoning. (by maximizing value instead of maximizing change, you need to learn to control the direction as well, which requires more knowledge, so intuitively maximizing value seems better)\n\nWe did experiment with controlling feature values and controlling feature changes in feature control, but we did not see a big difference between the two. We could include both results for consistency. We did not experiment with maximally activating pixels in pixel control. It would be interesting to try doing this on the RGB channels but we haven\u2019t experimented with that.\n\n- Is the method 10x faster on average for top-3 experiments or across hyperparameters? (sec 4.1.1)\n\n10x speed up refers to top3 experiments. The average speedup across all hyperparameters is around 12x. We also added a plot to the appendix C to show results for this setting.\n\n- One can guess (or maybe I missed it), but it's not explicitly said whether UNREAL uses Feature Control or only Pixel Control (the loss name L_PC suggests so).

So when exactly is which part optimised? \n\nFrom how I understand the paper now, it seems that in practise, the individual loss functions on the right-hand side of equation (2) are updated separately, i.e., during training, you switch between loss functions and this way optimise them \"simultaneously in parallel\" (p.4). Do I understand this correctly? Because then I don't understand how the lambdas come into play; in what way do they influence the learning (or evaluation) of the agent? Do you ever actually look at L_UNREAL, or evaluate how the agent performs on the auxiliary tasks?

These tasks are about control (learning other policies that attempt to maximally modify the state space, i.e. here the pixels), immediate reward prediction, and value function replay. Except for the latter, these auxiliary tasks are only used to help shape the features (by sharing the CNN+LSTM feature extraction network). Experiments show the benefits of this approach on Atari and Labyrinth problems, with in particular much better data efficiency than A3C.\n\nThe paper is well written, ideas are sound, and results pretty convincing, so to me this is a clear acceptance. At high level I only have few things to say, none being of major concern:\n- I believe you should say something about the extra computational cost of optimizing these auxiliary tasks. How much do you lose in terms of training speed? Which are the most costly components?\n- If possible, please try to make it clearer in the abstract / intro that the agent is learning different policies for each task. When I read in the abstract that the agent \"also maximises many other pseudo-reward functions simultaneously by reinforcement learning\", my first understanding was that it learned a single policy to optimize all rewards together, and I realized my mistake only when reaching eq. 1.\n- The \"feature control\" idea is not validated empirically (the preliminary experiment in Fig. 5 is far from convincing as it only seems to help slightly initially). I like that idea but I am worried by the fact the task is changing during learning, since the extracted features are being modified. There might be stability / convergence issues at play here.\n- Since as you mentioned, \"the performance of our agents is still steadily improving\", why not keep them going to see how far they go? (at least the best ones)\n- Why aren't the auxiliary tasks weight parameters (the lambda_*) hyperparameters to optimize? Were there any experiments to validate that using 1 was a good choice?\n- Please mention the fact that auxiliary tasks are not trained with \"true\" Q-Learning since they are trained off-policy with more than one step of empirical rewards (as discussed in the OpenReview comments)\n\nMinor stuff:\n- \"Policy gradient algorithms adjust the policy to maximise the expected reward, L_pi = -...\" => that's actually a loss to be minimized\n- In eq. 1 lambda_c should be within the sum\n- Just below eq. 1 r_t^(c) should be r_t+k^(c)\n- Figure 2 does not seem to be referenced in the text, also Figure 1(d) should be referenced in 3.3\n- \"the features discovered in this manner is shared\" => are shared\n- The text around eq. 2 refers to the loss L_PC but that term is not defined and is not (explicitly) in eq. 2\n- Please explain what \"Clip\" means for dueling networks in the legend of Figure 3\n- I would have liked to see more ablated versions on Atari, to see in particular if the same patterns of individual contribution as on Labyrinth were observed\n- In the legend of Figure 3 the % mentioned are for Labyrinth, which is not clear from the text.\n- In 4.1.2: \"Figure 3 (right) shows...\" => it is actually the top left plot of the figure. Also later \"This is shown in Figure 3 Top\" should be Figure 3 Top Right.\n- \"Figure 5 shows the learning curves for the top 5 hyperparameter settings on three Labyrinth navigation levels\" => I think it is referring to the left and middle plots of the figure, so only on two levels (the text above might also need fixing)\n- In 4.2: \"The left side shows the average performance curves of the top 5 agents for all three methods the right half shows...\" => missing a comma or something after \"methods\"\n- Appendix: \"Further details are included in the supplementary materials.\" => where are they?\n- What is the value of lambda_PC?

They also propose a supervised regression task, predict immediate reward following a sequence of events. The latter is learned offline via a skewed sampling of an experience replay buffer in order to balance seeing reward or not to 1/2 chance.\nSuch agents perform significantly well on discrete-action-continuous-space RL tasks, and reach baseline performance in 10x less iterations. \n\nThis work contrasts with traditional \"passive\" unsupervised or model-based learning. Instead of forcing the model to learn a potentially useless representation of the input, or to learn the possibly impossible (due to partial observability) task-modelling objective, learning to control local and internal features of the environment complements learning the optimal control policy.\n\nTo me the approach is novel and proposes a very interesting alternative to unsupervised learning that takes advantage of the \"possibility\" of control that an agent has over the environment.\nThe proposed tasks are explained at a rather high level, which is convenient to understand intuition, but I think some lower level of detail might be useful. For example L_PC should be explicitly mentioned, before reaching the appendix. Otherwise this work is clear and easily understandable by readers familiar with Deep RL.\nThe methodology is sound, on one hand hand the distribution of best hyperparameters might be different for A3C and UNREAL, but also measuring top-3 ensures that, presuming that the both best hyperparameters for A3C and for UNREAL are within the explored intervals, the per-method best hyperparameters are found.\nI think one weakness of the paper (or rather, considering the number of things that can fit in a paper, crucially needed future work) is that there is very little experimental analysis of the effect of the auxiliary tasks appart from their (very strong) effect on performance. In the same vein, pixel/feature control seems to have the most impact, in Labyrinth just A3C+PC beats anything else (except UNREAL), I think it would have been worth looking at this, either in isolation or in more depth, measuring more than just performance on RL tasks.\n\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Reinforcement Learning with Unsupervised Auxiliary Tasks", "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning agents have achieved state-of-the-art results by directly maximising cumulative reward.

To answer your questions:\n\n- 10x less steps to train a model is great, but how much longer does each step take? Since you train on many things simultaneously, is there still a wall-time speedup?\n\nAn agent-environment step with UNREAL compared to A3C is 1.2 times slower in terms of wall-time with our unoptimised research code. The resulting wall-time speedup in learning is over 8x. We should stress that in many applications that we are interested in, it is the number of environment steps that is important to reduce, as the environment is the wall-time bottleneck.\n\n- It seems like feature control is almost the same thing as pixel control, but from the \"viewpoint\" of the \"hidden state\". Did you try having stacked recurrent layers and doing this feature control at each layer? If not, do you think it would be beneficial? \n\nYes, we see feature control as the equivalent of doing pixel control on higher-level visual features. One benefit of controlling spatial feature maps (or pixels directly) is that it\u2019s possible to take advantage of spatial correlations by using deconvolutional output layers. We agree that controlling other layers of the network could also be beneficial.\n\n- In the total absence of external rewards, the base policy would not learn anything meaningful. Did you attempt to do on-policy learning of some variants of pixel or feature control? Maybe as some kind of pretraining phase?\n\nWe have thought about acting with the pixel/feature control policies but we\u2019re leaving this for future work.\n\n- You used n=20-step return, what \\gamma value accompanies this?\n\nGamma was set to 0.99 for the behaviour policy and 0.9 for the pixel control policies."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Reinforcement Learning with Unsupervised Auxiliary Tasks", "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning agents have achieved state-of-the-art results by directly maximising cumulative reward.

Could you provide some intuition as to why maximizing the hidden unit activations would help learning? Also, from figure 5(c), it looks like this doesn't help much?\n2. Have you tried playing with the skewed sampling parameter (0.5)? We had experimented with a very similar scheme, prioritized sampling (Narasimhan et al., 2015), and found that tuning this parameter did give us some gains. \n\nReferences:\nKarthik Narasimhan, Tejas Kulkarni, Regina Barzilay.

Our agent significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on Atari, averaging 880\\% expert human performance, and a challenging suite of first-person, three-dimensional \\emph{Labyrinth} tasks leading to a mean speedup in learning of 10$\\times$ and averaging 87\\% expert human performance on Labyrinth.", "pdf": "/pdf/6bee0e41eb8794491f2941e5b90386f36ef1dba1.pdf", "paperhash": "jaderberg|reinforcement_learning_with_unsupervised_auxiliary_tasks", "keywords": [], "conflicts": ["google.com", "ox.ac.uk", "ucl.ac.uk"], "authors": ["Max Jaderberg", "Volodymyr Mnih", "Wojciech Marian Czarnecki", "Tom Schaul", "Joel Z Leibo", "David Silver", "Koray Kavukcuoglu"], "authorids": ["jaderberg@google.com", "vmnih@google.com", "lejlot@google.com", "schaul@google.com", "jzl@google.com", "davidsilver@google.com", "korayk@google.com"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "duedate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "tmdate": 1485287596129, "id": "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper386/public/comment", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["~"], "reply": {"forum": "SJ6yPD5xg", "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*|\\(anonymous\\)"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*|\\(anonymous\\)", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "value-dropdown": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/organizers", "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/ACs_and_organizers", "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/reviewers_and_ACS_and_organizers"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"order": 2, "description": "Your comment or reply.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,20000}"}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper386/reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper386/areachairs"], "cdate": 1485287596129}}}], "count": 24}
