However, one can easily circumvent this problem in cases where an upper bound N_max on ground set sizes is known: train a DppNet with ground set size N_max, and in all cases where N <= N_max, complete the missing items with placeholder 0 vectors. Algorithm 1 can be trivially modified to take this into account to ensure that these dummy items are not selected.\n\nEvaluation biased towards DppNets: our goal is to show that DppNet approximates DPP-like samples (much) better than other reasonable approximations. We did not originally include downstream tasks as DPP have been accepted as a state-of-the-art method for diverse sampling in ML applications (see e.g. recent work such as https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3272018 for real-world applications). However, as mentionned to Reviewer 1, we will include a downstream task (kernel reconstruction via the Nystrom method) to further support our claims.\n\nCost of evaluating the marginal probabilities: indeed, this is the costly part of our algorithm (which only impacts training time); this cost is mitigated by two aspects:\n- Given S, we can compute the probability P(S U {i} | S) for all i simultaneously with no overhead (Eq. 2)\n- When training a DppNet over varying ground sets, this cost is offset by the fact that we are not learning one but a whole class of DPPs simultaneously.\n\n* \u201cDPP Gao\u201d: This is a typo; it should read \u201cDPP Goal\u201d\n* K-medoids: Yes, we run the algorithm multiple times with different initializations.\n* Greedy sampling: Yes, we are stating that greedy sampling with DppNet yields realistic DPP samples, as evidenced by the high DPP log-likelihoods. This is a significant advantage over standard DPPs, since the greedy DPP mode algorithm is costly even with recent improvements [NIPS \u201818, Hulu].\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper723/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper723/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper723/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DppNet: Approximating Determinantal Point Processes with Deep Networks", "abstract": "Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) provide an elegant and versatile way to sample sets of items that balance the point-wise quality with the set-wise diversity of selected items.

The approach builds upon a proposed inhibitive attention mechanism and transformer networks.\n\nThe proposed approach and focus on sampling is original as far as I can tell. The problem is also important to parts of the community as DPPs (or similar distributions) are used more and more frequently. However, the applicability of the proposed approach is limited as it is unclear how to deal with varying ground set sizes \u2014 the authors briefly discuss this issue in their conclusion referring to circumvent this problem by subsampling (this can however be problematic either requiring to sample from a DPP or incurring high probability of missing \u201eimportant\u201c items).\n\nFurthermore the used evaluation method is \u201ebiased\u201c in favor of DppNets as numerical results evaluate the likelihood of samples under the DPP which the DppNet is trained to approximate for. This makes it difficult to draw conclusions from the presented results. I understand that this evaluation is used as there is no standard way of measuring diversity of a subset of items, but it is also clear that \u201eno\u201c baseline can be competitive. One possibility to overcome this bias would be to consider a downstream task and evaluate performance on that task. \n\nFurthermore, I suggest to make certain aspects of the paper more explicit and provide additional details. For instance, I would suggest to spell out a training algorithm, provide equations for the training criterion and the evaluation criterion. Please comment on the cost of training (constantly computing the marginal probabilities for training should be quite expensive) and the convergence of the training (maybe show a training curve; this would be interesting in the light of Theorem 1 and Corollary 1).\n\nCertain parts of the paper are unclear or details are missing:\n* Table 3: What is \u201eDPP Gao\u201c?\n* How are results for k-medoids computed (including the standard error)? Are these results obtained by computing multiple k-medoids solutions with differing initial conditions?\n* In the paper you say: \u201eFurthermore, greedily sampling the mode from the DPPNET achieves a better NLL than DPP samples themselves.\u201c What are the implications of this?

We develop an inhibitive attention mechanism based on transformer networks that captures a notion of dissimilarity between feature vectors.  We show theoretically that such an approximation is sensible as it maintains the guarantees of inhibition or dissimilarity that makes DPP so powerful and unique.  Empirically, we demonstrate that samples from our model receive high likelihood under the more expensive DPP alternative.", "keywords": ["dpp", "submodularity", "determinant"], "authorids": ["zelda@csail.mit.edu", "jsnoek@google.com", "yovadia@google.com"], "authors": ["Zelda Mariet", "Jasper Snoek", "Yaniv Ovadia"], "TL;DR": "We approximate Determinantal Point Processes with neural nets; we justify our model theoretically and empirically.", "pdf": "/pdf/00280754d08b102a91067f3ba3553bc9d89999a2.pdf", "paperhash": "mariet|dppnet_approximating_determinantal_point_processes_with_deep_networks", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nmariet2019dppnet,\ntitle={DppNet: Approximating Determinantal Point Processes with Deep Networks},\nauthor={Zelda Mariet and Jasper Snoek and Yaniv Ovadia},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1euhoAcKX},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper723/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234394441, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "B1euhoAcKX", "replyto": "B1euhoAcKX", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper723/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335788846, "tmdate": 1552335788846, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper723/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 10}
