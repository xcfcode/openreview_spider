This method requires a pre-generated template for each shape category. Several losses are specially designed to regularize the generation of the surface patches. Empirical results have demonstrated the performance of the proposed method in sketch-based shape reconstruction and 3D shape interpolation.\n\nPros:\n- The paper shows some good results on reconstructing some simple shapes, such as bottles, mugs, bathtubs, etc.\n- The idea of using parametric surface patches may reduce the parameter space that a network has to search and could potentially lead to smoother surfaces.\n\nCons:\n- It is not clear to me why such representation is advantageous over conventional polygonal mesh-based representation. \n1) Though the parametric surface patch can typically lead to smoother reconstruction, it may also suffer from the incapability of capturing fine geometric details.  \n2) Similar to the mesh-based approach,  the patch-based method still has to fight similar challenges, e.g. avoiding the intersections, undesirable shape distortions, etc. \n3) Editing-wise, the reconstructed polygonal mesh can be easily converted to parametric surface patches to ease the following editing workflow, by registering the pre-generated template of coon patches to the reconstructed shape. \n\n- There are no quantitative evaluations in the paper.  Also, the visual comparisons with other approaches are very limited -- only one or two examples are presented. Due to the lack of evaluations, it is difficult to determine the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n\n---- Final Rating ----\n\nThe revised version of the paper with additional experiments has addressed my concern on the limited advantage over prior deep 3D representation.  Fig.6 in the revised version has shown the potential of the proposed approach in generating directly usable representation in downstream applications, including CAD design and manufacturing. Hence, I would change my rating to positive.\n\nHowever, the paper still lacks quantitative and qualitative evaluations. I hope it could be properly addressed in the final version.\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper685/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper685/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Manifold Patch-Based Representations of Man-Made Shapes", "authorids": ["~Dmitriy_Smirnov1", "~Mikhail_Bessmeltsev1", "~Justin_Solomon1"], "authors": ["Dmitriy Smirnov", "Mikhail Bessmeltsev", "Justin Solomon"], "keywords": ["3D shape representations", "CAD modeling", "sketch-based modeling", "computer graphics", "computer vision", "deep learning"], "abstract": "Choosing the right representation for geometry is crucial for making 3D models compatible with existing applications.

It derives a way to build a proper template, uses a network to predict the patches' parameters, and proposes a union of different losses. The qualitative results of the method are shown in several different objects. \n\nPROS\n- Losses: I appreciated the effort of the authors in formulating an ensemble of losses for this specific representation. I think they will be useful for future works with similar representations.\n- Versatility: this representation permits working with a large variety of different classes of objects (also disconnected ones, but not topological changes), at an arbitrary resolution and predicts a small set of values. \n\nThe paper does not clearly state if the code and the data will be made publicly available, but since the code is attached to the submission I assume this is in the will of the authors, and this is also a contribution.\n\nFinally, the paper is well organized and I like the presentations.\n\nCONS\n- Quantitative analysis: the only quantitative evaluation is reported in the supplementary material. I think this is the major weakness of the paper. I would suggest having more experiments to analyze the performance of the method. In particular, the ablation is a critical part since many losses are involved; I would suggest providing some quantitative measures, for example showing how each loss improves a particular aspect (e.g. the distance from the ground truth, the difference between normals, the intersection area, ...).\n\nI would also suggest highlighting the output patches on some qualitative results.\n\nMinor fixes:\n- Equation 4, fix the pedix of $\\mathcal{U}_{\\[0,1\\]^2}$ \n- Equation 13 (Sup.Mat), fix the Integral limits locations\n- I think \"P2P-NET: Bidirectional Point Displacement Net for Shape Transform\"(Yin et al., 2018) worth a mention since solves (among the others) a similar problem\n\n\nPRE-REBUTTAL RATING\nI am favorable to accept the paper because it provides several tools that will be useful for future works, and I think it has interest points for the Computer Graphics community. For the acceptance I would recommend adding some more quantitative analysis, both for ablation and for the shown results.\n----------\nFINAL-RATING\n\nI read the other reviews and authors' replies carefully.\n\nFirst of all, I would acknowledge the effort of the authors in replying to reviewers' concerns.\n\nAbout my points, I agree with other reviewers that the quantitative analysis is a bit limited (I think it is also the main criticism), but the introduced ablation and the new Figure 6 (numerically comparing against other SOTA methods) are convincing. The authors solved also my other concerns, and so I raise my score; I think the study of this representation is interesting, and well fit the audience of ICLR.\n\nThanks to the author for their availability, and best of luck with their work!\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper685/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper685/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Manifold Patch-Based Representations of Man-Made Shapes", "authorids": ["~Dmitriy_Smirnov1", "~Mikhail_Bessmeltsev1", "~Justin_Solomon1"], "authors": ["Dmitriy Smirnov", "Mikhail Bessmeltsev", "Justin Solomon"], "keywords": ["3D shape representations", "CAD modeling", "sketch-based modeling", "computer graphics", "computer vision", "deep learning"], "abstract": "Choosing the right representation for geometry is crucial for making 3D models compatible with existing applications.

", "review": "I like the idea of this paper and think that finding new representations of 3D shapes in deep learning approaches is important and interesting. However I have a number of concern with respect the claims of this paper, and the lack of sufficient evidence backing them up: \n\n-> What does \"sampling uniformly from patches is difficult\" mean? Can you clarify this statement both here, and in the paper? \n\n-> You provide all these detail about how you make the chamfer distance and normal alignment work for patches, but then say you can triangulate the patches anyway. If you can triangulate the patches why can you not directly apply the chamfer distances and normal alignment to points uniformly sampled over these triangles?  See: \"GEOMetrics: Exploiting Geometric Structure for Graph-Encoded Objects\" or \"Point2Mesh: A Self-Prior for Deformable Meshes\" for detail on how this is done. Would this not be easier? This would probably also be true for the patch flatness regularizer, where instead you could condition adjacent faces to have low curvature such as in the smoothness loss of \"Neural 3D Mesh Renderer\". This is not to say that the approaches you have taken are wrong, but you are proposing alternatives to solutions that already exist, perform well, and are naturally applicable to your setting. I think is it very important that you compare your approaches to these in some way in the paper. An experiment to this effect would go a long way to increasing my score.\n\n\n-> The ablation you provide in the supplemental is not sufficient. Demonstrating the difference over a single model does not provide me a good understanding of the differences. You should provide a visual ablation over a larger number of  models, and in addition provide a quantitative ablation of your metrics( chamfer distance, normal alignment) over your whole test set. This is absolutely necessary. Again showing this here and in the paper will go a long way to increasing my score. \n\n-> You provide an explicit definition of patches, but no intuition as to what they are. A reader can go and look up coons patches independently, but it would be helpful to provide some help here. A diagram might be helpful to explain this. Patches seem to be quite similar to charts as referenced in \"AtlasNet: A Papier-M\u00e2ch\u00e9 Approach to Learning 3D Surface Generation\n\" and \"3D Shape Reconstruction from Vision and Touch\". It might be helpful to disambiguate this in the related work. I realize you touch lightly on this in the results section, though this it too late in the paper to establish the understanding on your approach. \n\n-> There is a lack of quantitative comparison in this paper. I see that you compare visually to Pixel2Mesh and AtlasNet, but this is only over a small number of models. A reader has no way to determine if these results have been hand picked to make your approach look superior. You need to provide a comparison to contemporary methods for 3D reconstruction from images. Here Pixel2Mesh and AtlasNet are probably not sufficient either as better performing methods have since been released. The comparison in the supplemental is not sufficient, It should be over a large number of categories, and methods. \n\n-> You write: \"Unlike meshes or voxel occupancy functions, this representation can easily be edited and tuned after 3D reconstruction\". Meshes are easily edited in 3D design software and also can be converted to NURBS. In addition voxels and occupancy functions can be converted into mesh representations and so also editable in these software as well. In fact I believe 3D deep learning frameworks exists which handle this conversion natively. I think you should be clear about these claims and make them less strong. \n\nI want to be convinced that the proposed approach works better that what is already available , or at least better in some specific domain.

We have uploaded a revision that addresses all of the concerns raised in the reviews and subsequent discussion. In particular, we made the following changes:\n\n### Qualitative results\n\nWe added many additional qualitative results for each of the eight shape categories in Sec. A.5. All of these models are rendered with patch boundaries so as to visualize the individual Coons patches.\n\n### New applications\n\nWe added a section (Sec. 4.4) with two new experiments and comparisons to state-of-the art methods. In particular, we demonstrate how our system is able to convert 3D surfaces into **compact** and **consistent** NURBS patch decompositions. We compare our patches to those generated automatically by Rhino 3D, a popular commercial CAD tool. Not only does our method yield an order of magnitude fewer patches, but also our patches are consistent across different models. This makes our representation significantly more usable for further editing.\n\nWe reiterate that conversion of triangulated surfaces into NURBS patches is an open problem, and most solutions are extremely time-consuming and manual. In fact, the Rhino 3D documentation [1] states:\n\n> This method converts each polygon face to a NURBS surface. It is not meant to convert entire mesh models to NURBS models and there is, in fact, no simple way to accomplish this.\n\nThere exist dedicated plug-ins to assist in such a conversion, but they require significant input from a trained user [2]. Our method produces a usable decomposition into patches automatically.\n\nAdditionally, in Sec 4.4, we show that a byproduct of our pipeline is a quad mesh of the input surface. Quad meshing is another popular computer graphics research problem, where successful quad meshes are those with few carefully-positioned singularities (vertices with valence not equal to four). By subdividing each of our predicted patches, we obtain a quad mesh whose number and position of singularities is entirely determined by the original template. Our resulting quad meshes have an order of magnitude fewer singularities than those generated using a modern specialized quad meshing algorithm [3].\n\n### Additional ablation\n\nWe added additional qualitative examples to our ablation, as well as a quantitative ablation study on two shape categories in Sec. A.3.\n\n### Minor improvements\n\nWe added a diagram of the control points and boundary curves that form a Coons patch to Fig. 3 for a more intuitive illustration of our representation.\n\nWe added the missing citations noted by R4 and R1.\n\nWe fixed the typos noted by R1.\n\nWe clarified our points regarding non-uniform sampling of Coons patches, as per the discussion with R3.\n\n---\n\n[1] https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/rhinoscript/mesh_methods/meshtonurb.htm\n\n[2] https://youtu.be/ubsm0GfNnAQ\n\n[3] Jakob et al. \u201cInstant Field-Aligned Meshes.\u201d SIGGRAPH Asia 2015."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper685/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper685/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Manifold Patch-Based Representations of Man-Made Shapes", "authorids": ["~Dmitriy_Smirnov1", "~Mikhail_Bessmeltsev1", "~Justin_Solomon1"], "authors": ["Dmitriy Smirnov", "Mikhail Bessmeltsev", "Justin Solomon"], "keywords": ["3D shape representations", "CAD modeling", "sketch-based modeling", "computer graphics", "computer vision", "deep learning"], "abstract": "Choosing the right representation for geometry is crucial for making 3D models compatible with existing applications.

We are committed to improving our paper and can easily address all concerns within the rebuttal period. Below, we address each comment and indicate in **bold** additional experiments that we will post within several days. We hope that these will allay any concerns about our work and convince the reviewer that it will be a welcome contribution to the ICLR community. **If there are additional experiments that we can perform to further support our case, please let us know.**\n\n> I still expect the authors to demonstrate the method\u2019s advantage in different tasks (not only sketch-modeling)\n\nComputing sparse and consistent patch-based representations of 3D shapes can benefit many modeling and design tasks. Beyond sketch-based modeling, single-view reconstruction, and interpolation, we will be glad to demonstrate additional applications. For instance, a classical problem in computer graphics is generating quad meshes or quad layouts for surfaces. Our method allows us to obtain a quad layout directly (by taking the boundary curves of our patches) and quad meshes trivially (by subdividing the layouts). **We will add an experiment that demonstrates this and compares to state-of-the-art procedural approaches.**\n\nThe patch-based representation---largely unique to our work---is also a key feature motivated by practical considerations in computer graphics and computer-aided design. While some algorithms exist for converting other representations to this one, they can be unreliable and inefficient. We achieve comparable or improved quality relative to past work while bypassing this conversion step.\n\n> different datasets (not just limited to rather small categories like Mugs),\n\nWe show results on a total of 8 ShapeNet categories, including airplanes (with over 4000 models) and cars (with over 7000 models).\n\n> It occurs to me that the paper requires human user to pre-defined templates using a set of cuboids for each set of shapes before it can start generate.\n\nWe would like to clarify a misunderstanding: our method **does not** require manually constructed templates. \n\nWhile our system can use a custom template if desired, in Section 3.1 we introduce a purely data-driven algorithm for automatically generating a template for a shape category, without user guidance.\n\nAdditionally, in Figure 5, we demonstrate all of our results with generic sphere templates. These templates are not shape- or category-specific but still produce high quality-results with only a small number (54) of patches.\n\n> There are potentially missing related works.\n\nWe will add these citations to our text.\n\nNote that [A] generates meshes, which are not sparse and are more difficult to edit than our patch-based representations. Additionally, [A] is **not self-supervised**---it requires ground truth mesh data for training, whereas our method can be trained using any explicit surface representation, including point clouds.\n\nThe reconstructions in [B] are obtained by optimizing the standard Chamfer distance and thus suffer from the sampling artifacts that our method addresses (see Section 3.2).

While the triangulation may not be uniform this does not matter as you can sample points from the triangles with respect to their relative surface area, which produces a uniform sampling of points on the surface of the shape( see the references I provided to see how this is done). Maybe I am missing something here though. To help clear this up could you provide an example of one of your predicted shapes, both before and after triangulation so I can see what you mean by \"the triangles themselves would not be uniformly distributed on the surface\"? Also is this triangulation differentiable?

We are committed to improving our paper and can easily address all concerns within the rebuttal period. Below, we address each comment and indicate in **bold** additional experiments that we will post within several days. We hope that these will allay any concerns about our work and convince the reviewer that it will be a welcome contribution to the ICLR community. **If there are additional experiments that we can perform to further support our case, please let us know.**\n\n> What does \"sampling uniformly from patches is difficult\" mean?\n\nSampling uniformly in the parameter space of a patch (the unit square) does not yield uniform samples on the surface (with respect to the area measure of the surface as a geometric object)---regions with higher curvature end up oversampled. A closed form arc-length parameterization does not even exist for a Bezier curve, and so a uniform parameterization for even a one-dimensional patch is difficult to compute. Many works try to address this issue by designing custom sampling procedures [1, 2, 3]. These schemes are typically computationally expensive and/or incompatible with a differentiable learning pipeline.\n\n> If you can triangulate the patches why can you not directly apply the chamfer distances and normal alignment to points uniformly sampled over these triangles? \n\nTriangulating the patches would result in the same non-uniform sampling. While we would be able to sample uniformly from each triangle, the triangles themselves would not be uniformly distributed on the surface. Thus, the sampling issue would simply be deferred to when we sample from the triangles, not circumvented.\n\n> You should provide a visual ablation over a larger number of models, and in addition provide a quantitative ablation of your metrics( chamfer distance, normal alignment) over your whole test set. \n\n**We will add both a quantitative ablation as well as more qualitative examples.**\n\n> You provide an explicit definition of patches, but no intuition as to what they are.\n\n**We will modify Fig. 3 to illustrate how control points define a Coons patch.** Unlike charts in AtlasNet, which are parameterized using neural networks, our patches are explicitly defined via a small number of control points. Additionally, while AtlasNet charts are free to overlap each other as long as they cover the surface, our patches are equipped with a topology, which ensures that adjacent patches meet along their boundary curves.\n\n> You need to provide a comparison to contemporary methods for 3D reconstruction from images. \n\nWe compare to Pixel2Mesh to demonstrate that our method is able to achieve similar reconstruction quality to a mesh-based method while using a significantly smaller number of elements (our number of patches is two orders of magnitude smaller than their number of faces), yielding a representation that is significantly more useful for modeling tools. We compare to AtlasNet as it is the only patch-based deep 3D reconstruction work that we are aware of. While newer reconstruction methods achieve better reconstruction results, we were unable to identify any papers that reconstruct shapes using a sparse set of editable elements. We respectfully ask the reviewer for specific pointers to methods that propose a similar representation.\n\n> Meshes are easily edited in 3D design software and also can be converted to NURBS.\n\nRepresenting surfaces using sparse collections of parametrically-defined patches has been a long open problem in the modeling and design literature (called \u201cthe holy grail of NURBS design\u201d [4]). While there have been many attempts to design procedural algorithms for converting triangle meshes to NURBS patches automatically, these suffer from many artifacts. **We will add experiments that compare our patches with those obtained automatically from a source mesh.**\n\n[1] Wang, Jiang, et al. \u201cIntelligent sampling for the measurement of structured surfaces.\u201d Measurement Science and Technology 2012.\n\n[2] Elkott, Elmaraghy, and Elmaraghy. \u201cAutomatic sampling for CMM inspection planning of free-form surfaces.\u201d International Journal of Production Research 2002.\n\n[3] Hernandez-Mederos and Estrada-Sarlabous. \u201cSampling points on regular parametric curves with control of their distribution.\u201d Computer Aided Geometric Design 2003.\n\n[4] https://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/auto-nurbs-surfacing-of-meshes"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper685/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper685/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Manifold Patch-Based Representations of Man-Made Shapes", "authorids": ["~Dmitriy_Smirnov1", "~Mikhail_Bessmeltsev1", "~Justin_Solomon1"], "authors": ["Dmitriy Smirnov", "Mikhail Bessmeltsev", "Justin Solomon"], "keywords": ["3D shape representations", "CAD modeling", "sketch-based modeling", "computer graphics", "computer vision", "deep learning"], "abstract": "Choosing the right representation for geometry is crucial for making 3D models compatible with existing applications.

Sets of patches from the same category will follow certain constrained defined by templates. The templates are generated from some abstract representation of the category of interested (i.e. sets of cubbies). \nThe authors evaluate the method qualitatively on sketch-to-shape task, and show that the methods allows generating meshes that\u2019s editable, interpretable, and with certain level of details.\n\nStrength:\n1. The representation of parametric patches have several advantages compared to prior works (whose patches are represented by neural networks). It can create sparse, compact, interpretable, and editable shapes that can be directly imported into many industrial design software.\n2. The parametric patches allow computing CD without uniformly sampling from the surface.\n\nWeakness:\n\n1. The paper\u2019s evaluation of the method is very limited. Even though the representation has many inherit advantages, I still expect the authors to demonstrate the method\u2019s advantage in different tasks (not only sketch-modeling), different datasets (not just limited to rather small categories like Mugs), and across baselines with different representations (such as implicit representation, etc)\n2.  A major weakness of the methods comes from the template generation. It occurs to me that the paper requires human user to pre-defined templates using a set of cuboids for each set of shapes before it can start generate. This makes it a little bit hard for the method to capture all topological variation of the category (which the author also mentioned in the last section). With this regard, the method requires additional information compared many prior methods (for example, implicit methods that can handle many topology and good details, and it doesn\u2019t take a template). \n3. There are potentially missing related works. Some of which I think the paper should compare with as baselines:\n\n[A] Nash, Charlie, et al. \"PolyGen: An autoregressive generative model of 3D meshes.\"\u00a0arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.10880\u00a0(2020).\n[B] Deng, Zhantao, et al. \"Better Patch Stitching for Parametric Surface Reconstruction.\"\u00a0arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.07021\u00a0(2020).\n\nWhile the paper\u2019s idea has its value as the representation could be useful for editing in many industrial software, but it requires more sophisticated evaluation (quantitative evaluation, more baselines, more tasks) in order to show-case the effectiveness of the representation. With that, I do not recommend the paper for ICLR.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper685/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper685/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Manifold Patch-Based Representations of Man-Made Shapes", "authorids": ["~Dmitriy_Smirnov1", "~Mikhail_Bessmeltsev1", "~Justin_Solomon1"], "authors": ["Dmitriy Smirnov", "Mikhail Bessmeltsev", "Justin Solomon"], "keywords": ["3D shape representations", "CAD modeling", "sketch-based modeling", "computer graphics", "computer vision", "deep learning"], "abstract": "Choosing the right representation for geometry is crucial for making 3D models compatible with existing applications.
