Even in the limited real-estate there is decent quantitative and visual experimental results. \n\nIn the appendix, it was interesting to see that there are very different results for different metrics for measuring disentanglement. It would be great to dive into this area in a longer paper. \n\nOne thing I didn't like much is the derivation of TCVAE. Intuitively it makes a lot of sense. However ELBO is the method for getting to the latents. The introduced parameters should have some meaning in the original model/auto-encoder. \n\nOne thing I would have loved to see is the practical impact of the new  technique.

This motivates our beta-TCVAE (Total Correlation Variational Autoencoder), a refinement of the state-of-the-art beta-VAE for learning disentangled representations without supervision. We further propose a principled classifier-free measure of disentanglement called the Mutual Information Gap (MIG). We show a strong relationship between total correlation and disentanglement.
