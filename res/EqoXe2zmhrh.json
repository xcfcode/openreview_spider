In particular, it argues that the contrastive based approach is too strict in the sense that it forces pairs of video and text to be far away only because they are not from the same instance without considering potential shared semantic. To address this, they propose to combine the contrastive loss with a generative loss that tries to generate the text from one video based only on *different* videos within the batch. Interestingly, adding this objective improves performance of retrieval.\n\n## Strengths\n\n* The paper is clearly written which makes it easy to understand\n* To me the fact that the Cross approach works best is not completely intuitive which makes the result quite interesting. This approach is novel to the best of my knowledge.\n* The ablation study is thorough and overall well conducted.\n* The final performance are quite impressive (albeit some difficulty to fully compare to previous work as explained in the weaknesses section). \n\n## Weaknesses\n\nThere are a few questions/concerns about the work that I hope can be answered in the rebuttal.\n\n**Is the support set idea always good?**: While this idea seems to work well on MSRVTT I wonder whether or not the same loss would work well on much larger scale and more diverse datasets. In particular the method seems to rely strongly on the fact that there are other semantically related videos/text in the batch. While this may be true for small scale datasets it might not always be the case. I see a few options to try to illustrate a bit more that point:\n\n* Is the support set idea also important when training on HowTo100M? Does it matter there? Does it hurt?\n* I would expect the support set size to depend on the dataset? Was this observed in practice? \n\n**What are zero shot performance when training on HowTo?** I would be curious to know what would be the ZS performance when just training on HowTo. In particular (related to the previous question) is the generation loss also important there at all?\n\n**Comparison to the state-of-the-art is not totally fair**: even though less features are used, the pretrained models are trained on different data (IG65M dataset), therefore it's not clear that the comparison is fair compared to MMT. Would it be possible to do the comparison using the same set of features? Currently its not clear if the best performance comes from the fact that the method is better or if the input features are better.\n\n**Technical questions about aggregation**:\n\n* For the text encoder, it does not seem to be standard to combine RNN with a Transformer. Was it really important? Similarly for the vision model, how important was it to add the convolution in the transformer?\n\n* Have you tried other options for $c_v$ (e.g. by averaging all the outputs instead of just taking the first? Asking since in that case it seems that no special [CLS] token was added so taking the first token looked arbitrary.\n\n* When averaging temporal representations of the different videos in equation (3), this somewhat assume that all videos are temporally aligned. However this is often not true. Is this a problem that the authors have considered?\n\n\n**Some details about the tables**:\n\n* In Table 1. e) why the numbers with batch size 64 do not match the other best numbers in the table (55.7 vs 55.2).\n* Table 1. d). What does inter+intra means? In particular for the intra does it mean you do a contrastive loss between video and video? Are there any augmentations that are used for that case? I might have missed this but I could not find the details of that in the paper.\n\n**Comment about the title + question**: when I first read the title I thought that visual features would also be learned end to end (due to the term representation learning). I wonder if representation learning is the best term to put in the title due to the potential confusion. Related to that, have you tried to also finetune the video networks? If yes, were there benefits? \n\n## Justification of rating\n\nThe paper presents a simple but effective idea for training joint text and video models. The paper is clearly written and the results are compelling and do support the claim of the paper. There are still some things that can be improved about the paper and I am expecting the authors to reply to my questions and concerns. \n\n## Post rebuttal comment\n\nThe authors have successfully answered my concerns and added the necessary experiments. I think the paper should be accepted as the support set idea is an important one to improve upon the simple contrastive idea (in particular to soften the set of positives). \n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper649/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper649/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Support-set bottlenecks for video-text representation learning", "authorids": ["~Mandela_Patrick1", "~Po-Yao_Huang1", "~Yuki_Asano1", "~Florian_Metze1", "~Alexander_G_Hauptmann1", "~Joao_F._Henriques1", "~Andrea_Vedaldi1"], "authors": ["Mandela Patrick", "Po-Yao Huang", "Yuki Asano", "Florian Metze", "Alexander G Hauptmann", "Joao F.

The source of pre-training data comes from YouTube video-ASR pairs. The main novelty is the adoption of a generative objective (i.e., video captioning) to refine the video encoder ($\\Psi''$) and the text encoder, given the paired data input. Further, the paper observes that sometimes videos belong to the same batch could share similar characteristics/semantics, and therefore traditional contrastive learning objectives that repel positive samples from these hard negative samples could potentially hurt the learned representation. To this end, this paper introduces an idea called support-set bottlenecks, which effectively alleviate this conflict through batch-wise attention.\n \nLike the review title indicated, the paper has demonstrated strong empirical results on some common benchmarks. The related work is mostly comprehensive. The method section is also described with good clarity. However, the main concerns include the somewhat weak motivation of the method and some overstated claims. The reasons are detailed as follows.\n\ni) The motivation behind using a support set is still unclear, besides the obvious reason of empirical gain. Compare to related techniques such as semi-hard negative mining, what are their relations and the advantage of the proposed approach? Also, since the idea is generic to the training objective, what is the rationale for not using it for the contrastive objective (but instead on the more complicated captioning objective)? Or if you have made attempts, what are the observations?\n\nii) The overall scope of the proposed method is somewhat overstated. Despite that the method is generic to learn video-text representation, the downstream tasks only involve a single type of problem (i.e., video-text retrieval), which raises concern on its effectiveness across a broader range of tasks. Besides, even for video-text retrieval, notable benchmarks such as [YouCook2](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/viewFile/17344/16367) and [MSVD](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P11-1020.pdf) are missing, not even in the related work section. Consider acknowledging these works.\n\niii) From Tab. 2, we know that the model variant \"Cross\" works the best. But chances are there, other videos from the same batch might be totally irrelevant to the video-of-interest (more pronounced when the batch is small). Could this potentially hurt the learned representation? Also, any insight on what intuitively makes \"Cross\" better than other model variants?\n\niv) The conclusion drawn on Contrastive Loss from this work (page six bottom) is opposite to existing works, that is, triplet loss works much better InfoNCE. Any insight or observation besides these mentioned in the paper would be appreciated.\n\nvi) Consider the relevance of [Prototypical Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04966.pdf) to this paper (also alleviate the over-discrimination/\"false negative\" issue on instance discrimination), please acknowledge the work in the related work section.\n\nMinor comments:\n\ni) Please check if the font style follows ICLR'21 guideline, for example, for the title and references.\n\nii) The green arrow between the positive pair is missing in Fig. 1b.\n\n=========================== Post-Rebuttal ===========================\n\nMy questions are well addressed in the rebuttal.

We did try this, and struggled with getting anywhere near our results that includes a contrastive loss. Our findings would also explain why VidTranslate (Korbar et al. 2020), which solely used only a captioning objective, does not work as well as ours for video-text retrieval even though they used a much bigger architecture than we do (T5-large). However, as an auxiliary task combined with contrastive learning, cross-captionining works really well to combat strictness of instance discrimination contrastive objective.

We appreciate that you find our paper very comprehensive and tackling an important issue in contrastive learning. \n\n**A pretrained T5 with 12-layer encoder and 12-layer decoder is used in the model. It is doubt that why the cross-instance captioning needs such a heavy decoder. How about a shallow decoder affect the performance?**\nThat is a good point. We are currently running this experiment and will update the manuscript (TO DO).\n\n**The caption results shown in the appendix demonstrate a weak advantage in generation tasks. Are there some reasons for the opposite performance compared with the retrieval tasks?**\nThe main focus of our paper is video-text alignment for video-text retrieval tasks. As such, we add a generative task only as a form of regularisation and do not optimize for it. In addition, current state-of-the-art captioning performance can require many tricks such as using a self-critic [1] that directly optimizes BLEU/METEOR, or many data augmentation techniques, as well as using many visual features. We consider improving both alignment and text generation jointly as our next step.\n\n**The model places the pretrained architectures after the initialized Transformer pooling head, which will affect the pretrained weights. What is the training strategy and learning rate to deal with such a problem?**\nWe used Transformer Pooling head after the pretrained backbone architecture, not before, as described in Sec 3.2.\n\n**What is the possible reason for the reconstruction bottleneck that both smaller and very large sizes degrading the performance? Besides, the performance is sensitive and high-impact with different sizes.**\nThe reason for this U-shape in performance precisely validates our hypothesis of the additional generative task acting as a bottleneck: if the support-set is too small, the generative task cannot work properly, while if it is too large, it is too easy and does not regularize the training.\n\n**There is a doubt that the MdR of T5-Small in Table 1 (c) is the same as that of T5-Base but R@1 and R@5 have a margin.**\nWe have double-checked and can confirm the accuracy of these values. Its because medR does not change as much and the recall scores are more sensitive.\n\n**What is the meaning of None in Table 2? Does it mean training without cross-instance captioning?**\nCorrect: None refers to training with the baseline: ie. using a contrastive loss only. \n\n**This paper sets the $\\alpha$ to 0.2 in Eq. (1). How about other numbers affect the results, e.g., 0.1 and 0.3? What is the value of temperature T in Eq. (3)?**\nFor the $\\alpha$ in triplet loss, we just use the setup as in VSE++ [2], same as in other video-text works. The value of temperature T is 0.1 as used in SimCLR [3]. Since both works have explored various settings for these parameters we simply adopt these.\n\n**Are there some zero-shot results for the pretrained model?**\nYes, we will zero-shot numbers to our revised version.\n\n**How about the performance of the video representation on other tasks, e.g., action recognition?**\nWhile the focus of this work lies in obtaining strong video-text text-video retrieval methods, we agree that our model *does* learn visual feature representation due to the transformer pooling weights being learned.\nWe will provide results on finetuning our visual encoder on two common video action recognition benchmarks HMDB-51 and UCF-101 in the updated version of our paper.\n\n**The support-set is the samples of the mini-batch. How to know which one semantically relates to the anchor?**\nThe \"relationship\" is determined by closeness in the embedding space via our dot-product attention mechanism. We then generate our caption as weighted combination of the samples in the support-set. Please check Fig3. for a visualization of sematic closeness.\n\n**Missing references: \nLinchao Zhu and Yi Yang. 2020. Actbert: Learning global-local video-text representations. In CVPR. 2).

We appreciate that you find our paper very clearly written, comprehensive and interesting, with impressive results. \n\n**Is the support set idea always good?: While this idea seems to work well on MSRVTT I wonder whether or not the same loss would work well on much larger scale and more diverse datasets. In particular the method seems to rely strongly on the fact that there are other semantically related videos/text in the batch. While this may be true for small scale datasets it might not always be the case. I see a few options to try to illustrate a bit more that point: Is the support set idea also important when training on HowTo100M? Does it matter there? Does it hurt?\nI would expect the support set size to depend on the dataset? Was this observed in practice?**\nWhile in the paper we already observe the support-set idea working well on a variety of datasets: VTT, VATEX (more diverse texts), ActivityNet (longer videos, and texts), we agree about the intuition. \nIndeed, the ideal support-set size might depend on the intrinsic diversity of the pretraining dataset and we will add an ablation in the updated manuscript showing the effect of cross-captioning when pretraining on HowTo100M.\n\n**What are zero shot performance when training on HowTo? I would be curious to know what would be the ZS performance when just training on HowTo. In particular (related to the previous question) is the generation loss also important there at all?**\nWe will update the manuscript with zero-shot numbers as requested.\n\n**Comparison to the state-of-the-art is not totally fair: even though less features are used, the pretrained models are trained on different data (IG65M dataset), therefore it's not clear that the comparison is fair compared to MMT. Would it be possible to do the comparison using the same set of features? Currently its not clear if the best performance comes from the fact that the method is better or if the input features are better.**\nCompared to MMT, which uses 7 expert features (motion, image, face-detections, speech, OCR, scene, audio), we use only 2 features (motion and image) and achieve superior performance. Although we agree that it would be ideal to have an apples-to-apples comparison with MMT, the features they use for pretraining have not been publicly released, and we believe the results shown in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method convincingly.\n\n**For the text encoder, it does not seem to be standard to combine RNN with a Transformer. Was it really important? Similarly for the vision model, how important was it to add the convolution in the transformer?**\nAs described in Sec 3.2, RNN+BERT embedding has been explored in previous works such as DualEncoder [1] and MIL-NCE [2]. CNNs have also been shown to be effective in DualEncoder as a proper N-gram-like prior. In our experiments we observed a 0.2~0.5 R@1 degradation in performance without them in our experiment.\n\n**When averaging temporal representations of the different videos in equation (3), this somewhat assume that all videos are temporally aligned. However this is often not true. Is this a problem that the authors have considered?**\nThe video clips during training are sampled iid and we do not assume they are temporally aligned.\n\n**In Table 1. e) why the numbers with batch size 64 do not match the other best numbers in the table (55.7 vs 55.2).**\nYes that was a typo, and we have updated the manuscript.\n\n**Table 1. d). What does inter+intra means? In particular for the intra does it mean you do a contrastive loss between video and video? Are there any augmentations that are used for that case? I might have missed this but I could not find the details of that in the paper.**\nYea intra+inter means we combine both cross-modal (video, text) and within-modal losses (video, video). We use temporal jitter augmentations, where we sample two clips from the same video when computing the intra-modality loss. No other data augmentations were used. \n\n**Comment about the title + question: when I first read the title I thought that visual features would also be learned end to end (due to the term representation learning). I wonder if representation learning is the best term to put in the title due to the potential confusion. Related to that, have you tried to also finetune the video networks? If yes, were there benefits?**\nR(2+1)-D and T5 are both large models, so finetuning both would be very expensive computationally. Furthermore, in VidTranslate[3], they show that using a linear layer while fixing the video backbone (aka pre-extract visual features) is sufficient.\n\n**References**\n[1] Dong et al.

Compare to related techniques such as semi-hard negative mining, what are their relations and the advantage of the proposed approach? Also, since the idea is generic to the training objective, what is the rationale for not using it for the contrastive objective (but instead on the more complicated captioning objective)? Or if you have made attempts, what are the observations?**\nAs explained in Section 3.1, the motivation for our additional loss is to address a shortcoming of contrastive learning and the fact that it may use \"incorrect\" negatives (being unaware of the semantics of the data). The point of our loss is in fact to pull together samples that share a similar caption and that are thus likely to share also similar semantics even though the contrastive loss would like to (incorrectly) push them apart. This is also why our formulation requires the captions -- an extra modality with good semantic information is needed to achieve this relation. So, while applying this idea to a pure contrastive objective is a good goal for future work, the current formulation does not allow it.\n\n**ii) The overall scope of the proposed method is somewhat overstated. Despite that the method is generic to learn video-text representation, the downstream tasks only involve a single type of problem (i.e., video-text retrieval), which raises concern on its effectiveness across a broader range of tasks. Besides, even for video-text retrieval, notable benchmarks such as YouCook2 and MSVD are missing, not even in the related work section. Consider acknowledging these works.** \nWe focus on video-text *and* text-video retrieval in the experiments because, since these are the two modalities used for training, we expect the biggest gains there and these are important problems in their own right. We welcome the feedback and added citations to MSVD and YouCook2 to the related work section. In addition, we will add experimental results of our method applied to the MSVD dataset in the revised paper.\n\n**iii) From Tab. 2, we know that the model variant \"Cross\" works the best. But chances are there, other videos from the same batch might be totally irrelevant to the video-of-interest (more pronounced when the batch is small). Could this potentially hurt the learned representation? Also, any insight on what intuitively makes \"Cross\" better than other model variants?**\nAs shown in Table 1e, there is indeed a negative effect if the batch-size is too small and does not contain relevant samples. Our method performs best when the support-set is medium-sized, thus acting as a bottleneck. We provide an intuition of why \"Cross\" is best in Table 2 at the bottom of Page 6: this forces videos to \"caption each other\", thus pulling them together more stringently --- in other words, this is the version of the method that is most extreme in applying our regularization and it is also the one that works the best, indicating that our hypothesis is likely correct.\n\n\n**iv) The conclusion drawn on Contrastive Loss from this work (page six bottom) is opposite to existing works, that is, triplet loss works much better InfoNCE. Any insight or observation besides these mentioned in the paper would be appreciated.**\nA possible reason is that we are testing retrieval performance where triplet-loss training is usually optimal even in the non-video setting (as opposed to, say, classification, where InfoNCE can be expected to be better).\nHowever, we are now rerunning the InfoNCE experiments trying to optimize them further to check if it is indeed possible to bring their performance closer to that of the triplet loss.\n\n**v) Consider the relevance of Prototypical Contrastive Learning to this paper (also alleviate the over-discrimination/\"false negative\" issue on instance discrimination), please acknowledge the work in the related work section.**\nWe agree that the clustering can also alleviate the strictness of the instance discrimination task, and will update the manuscript to include PCL and other recent relevant works (SwAV) to our related works section.\n\n**Please check if the font style follows ICLR'21 guideline, for example, for the title and references.**\nThank you for pointing this out, we will update the manuscript.\n\n**The green arrow between the positive pair is missing in Fig. 1b.**\nThank you for finding this! We will fix this for the revised version."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper649/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper649/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Support-set bottlenecks for video-text representation learning", "authorids": ["~Mandela_Patrick1", "~Po-Yao_Huang1", "~Yuki_Asano1", "~Florian_Metze1", "~Alexander_G_Hauptmann1", "~Joao_F._Henriques1", "~Andrea_Vedaldi1"], "authors": ["Mandela Patrick", "Po-Yao Huang", "Yuki Asano", "Florian Metze", "Alexander G Hauptmann", "Joao F.

In particular, the model will push away the representations of all negative pairs although these samples sometimes are semantically related. To alleviate this problem, the authors develop a generative model to push these related samples together by reconstructing the caption from the weighted feature of support samples. Overall, the insight of semantically related pairs in negative sampling is interesting for me. My major concern is about the architecture of the proposed model, the performance on other tasks, and some additional ablation studies (see below).\n\nPros: \n1. The paper takes an important issue in contractive learning: semantically related samples in negative sets.\n2. The paper proposes the cross-instance captioning to alleviate the discouraging concept sharing among samples. The comprehensive experiments on retrieval tasks show SOTA results with a margin.\n\nCons: \n1. A pretrained T5 with 12-layer encoder and 12-layer decoder is used in the model. It is doubt that why the cross-instance captioning needs such a heavy decoder. How about a shallow decoder affect the performance? \n2. The caption results shown in the appendix demonstrate a weak advantage in generation tasks. Are there some reasons for the opposite performance compared with the retrieval tasks?\n3. The model places the pretrained architectures after the initialized Transformer pooling head, which will affect the pretrained weights. What is the training strategy and learning rate to deal with such a problem?\n4. What is the possible reason for the reconstruction bottleneck that both smaller and very large sizes degrading the performance? Besides, the performance is sensitive and high-impact with different sizes.\n5. There is a doubt that the MdR of T5-Small in Table 1 (c) is the same as that of T5-Base but R@1 and R@5 have a margin. \n6. What is the meaning of `None` in Table 2? Does it mean training without cross-instance captioning?\n7. This paper sets the $\\alpha$ to 0.2 in Eq. (1). How about other numbers affect the results, e.g., 0.1 and 0.3? What is the value of temperature T in Eq. (3)?\n8. Are there some zero-shot results for the pretrained model?\n9. How about the performance of the video representation on other tasks, e.g., action recognition?\n10. The support-set is the samples of the mini-batch. How to know which one semantically relates to the anchor? \n\n11. Missing references:\n1). Linchao Zhu and Yi Yang. 2020. Actbert: Learning global-local video-text representations. In CVPR.\n2).
