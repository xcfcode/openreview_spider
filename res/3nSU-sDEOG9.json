We will carefully revise the wording.\n\nQ1. Are #N_ident# and  #N_sufficient# number of rounds or a number of samples?\n\nWe introduce the definition in section 3.4. We set the number of rounds that include identified states as N_ident, and let N_sufficient denote the number of rounds that contain identified empirical sufficient states and lead to R_positive. \n\nQ2. What does it mean \u201cwe maximize Precision with complete #R_negative# samples\u201d?\n\nThe later paragraph after that sentence in section 3.4 explains the details and process. In phase two, the classifier only updates with R_negative samples. And the purpose is excluding all states insufficient to get the rewards. Once the recall of R_negative samples reaches 1, the samples recognized as R_positve could only be empirical sufficient samples to get the rewards (real R_positive).\n\nQ3. Is the phase 1 and 2 done in sequence or in parallel as Eq 6 suggests? In the latter case, is this the same as increasing the loss for the negative class?\n\nPhase 1 and 2 are done in sequence. As we train the binary classifier with R_positive samples in phase-one, and some R_positive samples and R_negative samples share the same space. The parallel training would result in endless training, where recall of R_negative might never reach 1.\nThe latter case in Eq 6 does calculate the loss for the negative class.\n\nQ4. In Table 2, what is the difference between the red trace in the top and bottom row?\n\nWe give the specific details in section 4.4 and description of Table 2, In the top row, the calibrated reward coefficient is set to 0.3 and the environmental reward coefficient is 1. For the bottom row, the training fully relies on calibrated rewards, where the calibrated reward coefficient is set to 1 and the environmental reward coefficient is 0.\n\nQ5. I\u2019m not sure the Atari levels selected for the experiments have a particularly delayed reward. With the possible exception of Bowling, the other levels usually have a short period between action and reward. Some levels that could be more interesting for testing credit assignment could be Skiing, Seaquest, Solaris or Venture.\n\nWe agree that the environmental feedbacks in most Atari games are not severely delayed, and this is the reason we establish hindsight reward scenarios. We previously looked at Skiing, Seaquest, etc, the delays are similar to the environments we select. Besides, we think that rewards sparsity problems have got enough attention, but rewards delay is not. There are not many eligible environments to explore the rewards delay problem, even if we do not mention this point in our paper.\n\nQ6. The results are not particularly strong. From Table 2, it seems that the only significant improvement is made on FishingDerby. Is this because of the choice of levels? I would have expected a positive result in Bowling. Could the authors include a comment on why this is not the case?\n\nThere might be two reasons that the results are not significant.\nFirstly, we design ESCE as an independent network without Lstm, this is because we hope to update the ESCE network with mini-batches of unsequenced states. The adopting of mini-batches would be sensible with calculating accuracy of prediction, however, this restricts using sequenced data into the network (RNN). Proverbially, Lstm has the advantages of carrying prior information to later states. On the contrary, ESCE could only output predictions based on feature grasping on current states.\nSecondly, in actor-critic algorithms, the gradient descent of policy relies on the scalar of the estimated value. Note the two values generated (red and green in Figure 3 (a)) on key states are similar, we believe this is the reason why experiments on the original 6 games did not make much progress.\n\nQ7. How does this method cope with intermediate (distracting) rewards in between the key action and the ultimate reward?\n\nWe actually briefly explored the intermediate rewards, and the results are bad as expected. It is clear that the objective for credit assignment is assigning the high credits to the crucial states, then the intermediate rewards could be considered as delayed rewards as well.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1435/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1435/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Empirical Sufficiency Featuring Reward Delay Calibration", "authorids": ["~Yixuan_Liu1", "~Hu_Wang1", "xiaowei.wang01@student.adelaide.edu.au", "a1782027@student.adelaide.edu.au", "liuyue.jiang@adelaide.edu.au", "jason.xue@adelaide.edu.au"], "authors": ["Yixuan Liu", "Hu Wang", "Xiaowei Wang", "Xiaoyue Sun", "Liuyue Jiang", "Minhui Xue"], "keywords": ["Deep Reinforcement Learning", "Reward Calibration", "Empirical Sufficiency", "Overfitting."], "abstract": "Appropriate credit assignment for delay rewards is a fundamental challenge in various deep reinforcement learning tasks.

We do realize the idea is not sufficiently presented.\n\nQ1. The use of binary classification seems most appropriate for environments with sparse rewards (both positive and negative). (While the reviewer can imagine a policy improvement scenario where much-better-or-worse-than-the-baseline is related to desirable/undesirable, this is not discussed.) \n\nThe method actually helps with the reward delay problem, but not reward sparsity problems. We introduce the desired and undesired signals in section 3.2, where desired environmental signals include positive rewards, and undesired signals include negative rewards, agent\u2019s deaths, game endings, etc. The priority in our experiment is establishing an integrated architecture, and fairly proving the theory. In our experiments, the defining of desired / undesired signals basically is inherited from the initial purpose, which is maximizing environmental rewards. \n\nQ2. Under what conditions does a logistic binary classifier output a probability which is close to the true Q-value (e.g., with very sparse reward rollouts)? Or alternatively under what conditions does the classifier induce a policy gradient [equation (1)] which is a descent direction?\n\nThis is an interesting question, we will give more details in the future. So far, we find the sufficiency extraction relies on the successes of grasping on key features and the stability of environments. Once both conditions are met, ESCE would be able to estimate a convincing probability. Also, it is worth discussing what is the true value of a state. \nIn actor-critic algorithms, the gradient descent of policy relies on the scalar of the estimated value.

The method is based on building a classifier that can detect states that will lead to environmental rewards in the future and assigning an additional reward to these detected states. \n\n**Pros:**\n- The overall idea is simple and intuitive.\n- The visualizations in Fig 2 and 3 are clear and give good intuitions about the model.\n- The results in Table 1 significantly improve over the baseline.\n\n**Cons:**\n1. The paper is not particularly easy to read. Here are some of the elements that caused me confusion and could be improved:\n\n- Many terms introduced in the paper are not defined clearly enough (e.g. Empirical Sufficiency, Policy-based Empirical Sufficient Distribution,  Task-Specific Empirical Sufficient Distribution, Sensitive Sampling). I would suggest minimizing the introduction of new terms to the ones really required to explain the method.\n\n- Other terms are slightly vague (e.g. pure distribution, dominant probability). \n\n- Some terms have names that are not very intuitive (e.g. rounds, overfitting mechanism). \n\n- Related to the previous point. In what sense is the word calibration used here? This term has a particular definition in the literature that should be refer to and justified.\n\nIn the section on Overfitting training:\n- Equation (4) is not clear enough. Please define $L_E^one(\\hat r_pos, r_pos) + (\\hat r_neg, r_neg)$\n- Are $N_{ident}$ and $N_{sufficient}$ number of rounds or a number of samples?\n- What does it mean \u201cwe maximize Precision with complete $R_{negative}$ samples\u201d?\n- Is the phase 1 and 2 done in sequence or in parallel as Eq 6 suggests? In the latter case, is this the same as increasing the loss for the negative class?\n\nIn the Results section:\n- Result order: The modified environment result is presented before the regular one, although in the first paragraph of the results the order is swapped.  \n\n- In Table 2, what is the difference between the red trace in top and bottom row?\n\n2. I\u2019m not sure the Atari levels selected for the experiments have a particularly delayed reward. With the possible exception of Bowling, the other levels usually have a short period between action and reward. Some levels that could be more interesting for testing credit assignment could be Skiing, Seaquest, Solaris or Venture (justified in e.g. Arjona-Medina et al. 2019 or Puigdom\u00e8nech Badia 2020). It would be interesting to include the justification for this particular selection of levels in the paper.\n\n3. The results are not particularly strong. From Table 2, it seems that the only significant improvement is made on FishingDerby. Is this because of the choice of levels? I would have expected a positive result in Bowling. Could the authors include a comment on why this is not the case? The results are positice in Table 1, in the modified environments, but I would like to see results in an original level with more delayed rewards (which already exist in Atari). \n\n4. How does this method cope with intermediate (distracting) rewards in between the key action and the ultimate reward? (as in Hung et al., 2018). Is the way of selective states for the positive pools a problem to learn this type of credit assignment?\n\nMinor: \n- Tables 1 and 2 should be Figures.\n- Fig3. caption \u201c The calibrated rewards and environmental rewards are encoded in red and yellow\u201c  should be blue?\n- \u201cresonate with human cognition\u201d seems a bit over-claimed to me. I would say that the visual inspections make intuitive sense. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1435/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1435/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Empirical Sufficiency Featuring Reward Delay Calibration", "authorids": ["~Yixuan_Liu1", "~Hu_Wang1", "xiaowei.wang01@student.adelaide.edu.au", "a1782027@student.adelaide.edu.au", "liuyue.jiang@adelaide.edu.au", "jason.xue@adelaide.edu.au"], "authors": ["Yixuan Liu", "Hu Wang", "Xiaowei Wang", "Xiaoyue Sun", "Liuyue Jiang", "Minhui Xue"], "keywords": ["Deep Reinforcement Learning", "Reward Calibration", "Empirical Sufficiency", "Overfitting."], "abstract": "Appropriate credit assignment for delay rewards is a fundamental challenge in various deep reinforcement learning tasks.

For example, the term \"overfitting classifier\" exhibits cognitive interference with standard usage without explanation.\n\nThe use of binary classification seems most appropriate for environments with sparse rewards (both positive and negative).  Otherwise the concept of \"desired environmental signals\" and \"undesirable environmental signals\" from section 3.2 is ill-specified.  (While the reviewer can imagine a policy improvement scenario where much-better-or-worse-than-the-baseline is related to desirable/undesirable, this is not discussed.)  The experimental section is not informative with respect to the issue of defining desirable or undesirable.\n\nA better version of this paper would justify the technique analytically.  For instance, the optimal critic would provide the true Q-values as reward.  Under what conditions does a logistic binary classifier output a probability which is close to the true Q-value (e.g., with very sparse reward rollouts)?  Or alternatively under what conditions does the classifier induce a policy gradient [equation (1)] which is a descent direction?\n\nThe experiment section at the moment is structured as \"it works on these 6 atari games\", but this reviewer does not find this compelling (e.g., what about the other games?  do these 6 games have an obvious desirable/undesirable reward boundary?).

In the experiments (neither in section 4 nor in A.1 or A.2) the state representation is not clear. \n    - The approach presented in this paper seems to be ad-hoc, and it lacks rigorous experimentation to validate the contribution of building blocks of the architecture. In particular, **ablation tests** are very much necessary to clarify the contribution of different components in the proposed architecture, but no such study has been provided in the paper. Further, there is little theoretical backup and intuition behind the proposed idea. \n    - The authors define Empirical Sufficiency (Definition 3.1) but do not specify the structure of the space. Specifically, it is not clear what is the underlying set, and if there is a metric associated with it? Now, depending on the structure of the space, it could give rise to many topological properties. Hence, the definition is not complete. Further, the intuitive explanation presented in the paper is not sufficient.\n    - The proposed method is not rigorously compared against the existing well-known DRL techniques. The authors indeed present some experiments to highlight the improvement accomplished by their architecture w.r.t. to some hind-sight results (Table 1). However, the end-goal of solving a task (e.g. playing games) is to maximise the total reward. Hence, it is essential to compare the total reward obtained by the proposed method with that obtained by the latest DRL based algorithms, and it is missing in this paper.\n\n**Overall impression**\nThe paper attacks an exciting problem but lacks rigorous experimentation and theory to validate the proposed method.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1435/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1435/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Empirical Sufficiency Featuring Reward Delay Calibration", "authorids": ["~Yixuan_Liu1", "~Hu_Wang1", "xiaowei.wang01@student.adelaide.edu.au", "a1782027@student.adelaide.edu.au", "liuyue.jiang@adelaide.edu.au", "jason.xue@adelaide.edu.au"], "authors": ["Yixuan Liu", "Hu Wang", "Xiaowei Wang", "Xiaoyue Sun", "Liuyue Jiang", "Minhui Xue"], "keywords": ["Deep Reinforcement Learning", "Reward Calibration", "Empirical Sufficiency", "Overfitting."], "abstract": "Appropriate credit assignment for delay rewards is a fundamental challenge in various deep reinforcement learning tasks. To tackle this problem, we introduce a delay reward calibration paradigm inspired from a classification perspective. We hypothesize that when an agent's behavior satisfies an equivalent sufficient condition to be awarded, well-represented state vectors should share similarities. To this end, we define an empirical sufficient distribution, where the state vectors within the distribution will lead agents to environmental reward signals in consequent steps. Therefore, an overfitting classifier is established to handle the distribution and generate calibrated rewards. We examine the correctness of sufficient state extraction by tracking the real-time extraction and building hybrid different reward functions in environments with different levels of awarding latency. The results demonstrate that the classifier could generate timely and accurate calibrated rewards, and the rewards could make the training more efficient.
