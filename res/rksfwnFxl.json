Also, thank you for appreciating the advantage of our approach in terms of portability, which is a key issue in the problem this paper is trying to address.\n\nNonetheless, regarding your \u201ccon side\u201d comments, I have to point out that this paper is NOT on NIDS. This paper is host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS), which is different from NIDS in multiple aspects. I am afraid that the reviewer may have started with this misunderstanding of the topic of this paper, leading to further confusions about our contributions.\n\nRecently, many successful applications of LSTMs and other memory-equipped RNN units are being reported in various domains. In many cases, LSTM-based algorithms are not trivial to develop, especially when one targets at beating the previous state-of-the-art results. Moreover, using deep networks allows us to discover new insights into the problem that would otherwise be difficult to uncover using conventional \u201cshallow\u201d methods. Often, such additional insights are related to the representation learning capability of deep networks. Therefore, it is rather difficult to agree with your opinion that using LSTMs to solve a novel application does not deserve an ICLR paper. Our LSTM-based solution to HIDS also required a non-trivial process for its development and provides the above advantages of deep learning, including its representation learning capability (e.g., see Figure 5, which shows the representation of system calls). Furthermore, our method employs a ensemble method for robustly complementing the LSTM component. We did not simply apply LSTM units to HIDS and claim a contribution. We thoroughly analyzed the problem, formulated an LSTM-based solution in a language-modeling framework, blended it with an ensemble method for robustness, and validated our method with well-known benchmarks. I believe that machine learning researchers will be interested in knowing how using an LSTM-based approach can solve a new application in security, even without tedious pre-processing and feature engineering.\n\nRegarding your citation of the two previous papers on NIDS, I appreciate your mentioning them, but, again, some of them are more on NIDS. Furthermore, your mentioning \u201cThe idea of using LSTMs for NIDS is published [2].\u201d is wrong, I suppose. I perused this paper but could not find any mentioning about LSTM at all. Still, I appreciate your mentioning these papers and will try to revise the manuscript with comparisons with them.\n\nAdditionally, you mentioned that \u201cpre-processing does not seem \u201cheavy\u201d to me,\u201d but this is also very difficult to agree with. According to our experience in industrial projects with  data centers, the burden of pre-processing is typically very high. Terabytes of log streams are being produced every day, and it typically takes a vast amount of time and human efforts to pre-process them for downstream analyses based on traditional methods. One of our key contributions is to apply deep-network approach to relieve this burden of pre-processing of logging data. In the revision, I will also try to mention the difficulty of pre-processing in terms of HIDS, emphasizing the benefits of removing it.\n\nPlease post additional questions and comments if some arises. I will be more than happy to answer them. Thank you again for your reviewing efforts.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "LSTM-Based System-Call Language Modeling and Ensemble Method for Host-Based Intrusion Detection", "abstract": "In computer security, designing a robust intrusion detection system is one of the most fundamental and important problems.

Completely avoiding a general form of mimicry attack remains an open problem, but as we briefly mentioned in the Conclusion section, we are planning to consider the possibility of applying our LSTM-based language modeling approach to such attacks. Using our LSTM-based method allows us to estimate the likelihood of long system-call sequences, which may be helpful for analyzing the capability of handling mimicry attacks to some extent. However, there is currently no public benchmark or dataset for testing mimicry attacks, and in-depth analysis of an algorithm to detect mimicry attacks will be very challenging.

As many other recent applications of deep learning, no feature extraction was needed in our work to match the performance of the ELM approach that requires heavy feature extraction efforts. It is true that RNN training takes (mostly computing) time, but it would often take more time (and often creativity by experts) to extract a good set of features that lead to satisfactory downstream performance. Consequently, for ELM-style approaches, it would take nontrivial efforts to develop a new set of additional features that can cope with new types of attacks. Furthermore, various assumptions need to be made in order to use ELM features unlike our LSTM-based end-to-end framework that does not need such assumptions. Taken together, our approach can be adapted to new attacks more easily since it requires no feature extraction and strong assumptions. Another important point is that our methodology is not orthogonal to existing feature-based IDS algorithms but can evolve together by reflecting the features known to the community as absolutely useful features, although the current paper emphasized more on deep learning aspects in order to clearly deliver the advantages of LSTM-based methodology to the readers.\n\nQ3) How to choose LSTM parameters?\nA3) We set aside test data first and used the remaining data for training and cross validation to determine the best (most importantly in terms of perplexity) set of parameters on the grid of parameters.

The proposed system-call language model has various advantages leveraged by the fact that it can learn the semantic meaning and interactions of each system call that existing methods cannot effectively consider. Through diverse experiments on public benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, we show that our model possesses high portability, which is one of the key aspects of realizing successful intrusion detection systems.", "pdf": "/pdf/fe56e36cd82b26a03c7f34c4530924ff1a0c36f8.pdf", "paperhash": "kim|lstmbased_systemcall_language_modeling_and_ensemble_method_for_hostbased_intrusion_detection", "conflicts": ["snu.ac.kr"], "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gyuwan Kim", "Hayoon Yi", "Jangho Lee", "Yunheung Paek", "Sungroh Yoon"], "authorids": ["kgwmath@snu.ac.kr", "hyyi@snu.ac.kr", "ubuntu@snu.ac.kr", "ypaek@snu.ac.kr", "sryoon@snu.ac.kr"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "duedate": 1480741199000, "tmdate": 1480959445192, "id": "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper135/pre-review/question", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper135/reviewers"], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper135/AnonReviewer3"], "reply": {"forum": "rksfwnFxl", "replyto": "rksfwnFxl", "writers": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper135/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper135/AnonReviewer[0-9]+", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "description": "Brief summary of your question.", "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "question": {"order": 2, "description": "Your question", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}}}, "nonreaders": [], "expdate": 1488517199000, "cdate": 1480959445192}}}], "count": 12}
