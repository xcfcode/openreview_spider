This is completely unsurprising, and there is no mention at all of class imbalance, or of the very large body of literature that exists on this topic. The point here, I realize, is not fancy new methods per se, but the authors also fail to make a compelling case regarding how this technology would be used. \n\nTo address relatively severe class imbalance, the paper includes a 'data augmentation' strategy, which entails fitting a mixture model over a subset of the data, although I think specification of this in Alg 1 is a bit vague. In particular, Z is drawn from \"{X_{pos}, X_{neg}} suuch that |Z| = min(|X_{pos}|, |X_{neg}|)\" -- this notation is unclear. Is Z a balanced sample? A simple IID sample of size Z? Regardless, the idea is to use this to generate pseudo-positive instances, thereby balancing the dataset. This seems very much like a probabalistic version of SMOTE, although the authors --- unfortunately --- do not mention this approach. \n\nMore should have been said about the features used here: A table describing these would be welcome. This is especially true given the focus on the application. Figure 1 is meaningless without description of the features.\n\nIn any case, it is not clear to me what the 'attention' layer is doing here. Attentive conditioned on what? What is the attention distribution induced over? If just the input features, isn't this just a linear layer? \n\nCuriously, the authors do not compare against a simple logistic regression baseline trained in a way that accounts for imbalance (via down or upsampling, or SMOTE, or even class weighting, all standard tricks; the authors could also compare to the proposed strategy of course).", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Classify Contaminated Blood Tests: A Neural Approach", "abstract": "Automated laboratories analyze thousands of blood tests every day.
