This question has been studied before in an empirical manner (for multi-layer networks), but this paper is the first to give a simple linear algebraic answer.\n\nThe central construction of the paper is a basis e_i that has the property e_i^T w_j = delta(i,j): that is, e_i is orthogonal to all weight vectors w_j except w_i. Although it is not often taught in linear algebra courses, this is a well known concept called the dual basis of w. Since the paper uses quite a lot of space to explain the idea, it may be more efficient to simply state that every basis has a unique dual basis (with said property) and then continue to work with it, providing a reference to the reader who is interested in learning more about the concept and how one might compute a dual basis efficiently.\n\nThe analysis seems to be mostly correct for the case where W is a square, invertible matrix. This and other assumptions should be clearly stated. If W is not square or not invertible, many complicated phenomena may occur (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrangement_of_hyperplanes).\n\nSince it is immediately clear that the pre-image of a relu net must be piecewise linear, the value of this paper is in a precise characterization of this linear manifold. To do this thoroughly, we cannot ignore the fact that e.g. not all layers in a neural network have the same dimensionality (although the full rank assumption may be reasonable for dimension-increasing layers).\n\nOne issue I'm slightly uncertain about is the role of the bias, which is sometimes ignored in the paper. Looking at the equation w_j^T x = ... on page 2, I think the constraints on alpha_i should involve b_i.\n\nThe question of preimages of multi-layer networks is treated very briefly at the end. I think the paper could be much more significant if you used some of the space used to explain the dual basis to go into greater depth on this question. E.g. how can we parameterize the piecewise linear manifold of a multi-layer net, given some values for the weights of the network?\n\nI think the equation for Pi_i on page 1 should read:\nPi_i = {x : w_i^T x + b_i = 0}   (i=1..n)\n\nThe paper contains many typos and missing periods:\nexplicitely\nthe matrix W . and bias\n\"sets of hyperplanes\" -> hyperplanes\neasily using by just\nintersection For\n= 1 The\na_j <= 0 By\ne_i Any\na_i >= 0 The\nregion they will \ncan therefore me considered", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "THE PREIMAGE OF RECTIFIER NETWORK ACTIVITIES", "abstract": "We give a procedure for explicitely computing the complete preimage of activities of a layer in a rectifier network with fully connected layers, from knowledge of the weights in the network.
