This paper presents a provably efficient model-based framework MobILE to solve the ILFO problem. MobILE uses self-supervision towards (a) training a dynamics model and (b) designing an intrinsic reward signal for exploration. Using these ideas, MobILE carefully trades off exploration against imitation by integrating the idea of optimism in the face of uncertainty into the distribution matching imitation learning (IL) framework. We provide a unified analysis for MobILE, and demonstrate that MobILE enjoys strong performance guarantees for classes of MDP dynamics that satisfy certain well studied notions of complexity. We also show that the ILFO problem is strictly harder than the standard IL problem by reducing ILFO to a multi-armed bandit problem indicating that exploration is necessary for ILFO. We complement  these theoretical results with experimental simulations on benchmark OpenAI Gym tasks that indicate the efficacy of MobILE.", "pdf": "/pdf/9908187d119837f24d4f31408f7d7beaeb1fbb88.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|optimism_is_all_you_need_modelbased_imitation_learning_from_observation_alone", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021optimism,\ntitle={Optimism is All You Need: Model-Based Imitation Learning From Observation Alone},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to Self-Supervision for Reinforcement Learning Workshop - ICLR 2021},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=GNK8tC97j8n},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615310247528, "tmdate": 1615313016556, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
