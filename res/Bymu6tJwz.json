The method takes inspiration from Shake-Shake and Stochastic Dropout to develop an approach that works well for single branch ResNets.  This approach multiplies the residual by a random weight coefficient to add multiplicative noise to the system.  Alone, this added term destabilizes training.  To address this issue, random weighting itself is randomly sampled otherwise the standard residual term is used.  \n\nThere is an interesting interplay between the random sampling of the random weight coefficients. It appears to the reviewer, that the combination is a random variable that is biased to sample \\alpha and \\beta equal to one.  The author's should explore their formulation more thoroughly to see if there is some underlying phenomena at play. \n\nThe paper is motivated from Shake-Shake, but while Shake-Shake's intent is for data augmentation through interpolation, ShakeDrop appears to learn robust, scale invariant features.  This should be emphasized in the text.\n\nOverall, the paper presents an sufficiently novel idea with strong empirical results, which supports publication at a workshop.\n\nComments:\nThe reviewer assumes b_l for ShakeDrop is derived as for Stochastic Dropout (as referenced at the beginning of the paper) and \\alpha and \\beta are sampled from a uniform distribution as from Shake-Shake. If this is not the case, please clarify in the paper.\n\nYou note that \\alpha = [-1, 1] performing better than [0, 1] was surprising.
