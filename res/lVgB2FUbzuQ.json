PCT is aimed at detecting an individual's infectivity given locally observed information (and history), as can be carried on say a mobile device. As the name suggests, being able to estimate infectivity given this local information is useful in large part due to the fact that individuals can be asymptomatic, or they can have significant infectivity before demonstrating symptoms if they are to be symptomatic. Proactively estimating infectivity levels thus provides another tool in combatting viral spread through proper containment protocols. \n\nThe core methodology behind PCT lies in training a deep neural network offline with viral simulation data to estimate this very infectivity given local information / history. The purpose of this offline training is to preserve privacy of users, as they would only need to locally run the computation of their infectivity estimates (rather than send information to a centralised server for example for training). Furthermore, these infectivity estimates in practice can be used for containment strategies. The authors propose truncating the infectivity values to 4 bits, and using this information by a centralised agent to recommend different distancing for agents. \n\nFinally, the authors back their results with simulations where they show that under some (unspecified) containment regime, the use of PCT can provide real gains over current contact tracing methods in terms of minimising the spread of the virus while simultaneously minimising the amount of containment required of a population. \n\n\nReasons for score: \n\nI think this work is well motivated and of great potential use to policymakers in what will be a long fight against COVID. In addition, the care given to preserving privacy (in terms of the messages sent from devices to centralised agents) is of utmost importance, and these very constraints are necessary in the solution space the authors are navigating.\n\n\nGeneral questions / Points to address:\n\n-I would like the authors to give more clarity on what the nature of the containment protocol they propose is. They mention that as a function of $y_i$, a centralised agent will propose $\\zeta_i$, a containment measure for an agent, but I am curious what this entails. Is it the case that an agent is isolated for a certain amount of time? Do they reduce their number of contacts by a proportional amount? The reason I ask this is that contact tracing measures are only as useful as the containment protocol that they are paired with.\n-I am also still a bit unclear as to what the infectivity is modelling specifically. The authors mention that $y_i$ is a positive real number, but what does this equate to in the underlying models used to train the DNN? I'm guessing this is an intrinsic parameter to the model generating data, but it would be useful to perhaps get an overview of the model itself if there is space. \n-Have the authors considered how the upcoming flu season might affect PCA, especially if there are common symptoms between diseases? In other developing countries, such as central Mexico, Dengue season is also just beginning, and the co-infection of diseases is an issue that local authorities are grappling with for their contact tracing applications\n-I also wonder if the authors have considered using the heterogeneity of the population to their advantage in terms of the underlying proposed containment protocol. Ultimately PCT is studying an individuals exposure data (albeit locally), and this very data can help understand the effictiveness of a proposed containment policy given their infectivity (such as an individuals propensity to listen to proposed containment, or whether this individual has a high baseline exposure to other individuals, and hence a possibility of spreading to many if they are infected). Recent work has focused on using heterogeneous population information to optimise pandemic policy (https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/socioeconomic-network-heterogeneity-and-pandemic-policy-response/), which could be of interest to the authors.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2637/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2637/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Predicting Infectiousness for Proactive Contact Tracing", "authorids": ["~Yoshua_Bengio1", "~Prateek_Gupta2", "~Tegan_Maharaj1", "~Nasim_Rahaman1", "~Martin_Weiss4", "~Tristan_Deleu1", "~Eilif_Benjamin_Muller1", "~Meng_Qu2", "victor.schmidt@mila.quebec", "~Pierre-luc_St-charles1", "halsdurf@uottawa.ca", "~Olexa_Bilaniuk1", "david.buckeridge@mcgill.ca", "gaetan.marceau.caron@mila.quebec", "pierre.luc.carrier@mila.quebec", "~Joumana_Ghosn1", "satya.ortiz-gagne@mila.quebec", "~Christopher_Pal1", "~Irina_Rish1", "~Bernhard_Sch\u00f6lkopf1", "abhinav.sharma@mcgill.ca", "~Jian_Tang1", "andrew.williams@umontreal.ca"], "authors": ["Yoshua Bengio", "Prateek Gupta", "Tegan Maharaj", "Nasim Rahaman", "Martin Weiss", "Tristan Deleu", "Eilif Benjamin Muller", "Meng Qu", "victor schmidt", "Pierre-luc St-charles", "hannah alsdurf", "Olexa Bilaniuk", "david buckeridge", "gaetan caron", "pierre luc carrier", "Joumana Ghosn", "satya ortiz gagne", "Christopher Pal", "Irina Rish", "Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf", "abhinav sharma", "Jian Tang", "andrew williams"], "keywords": ["covid-19", "contact tracing", "distributed inference", "set transformer", "deepset", "epidemiology", "applications", "domain randomization", "retraining", "simulation"], "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly worldwide, overwhelming manual contact tracing in many countries and resulting in widespread lockdowns for emergency containment.

The proposed method is based on locally processed information collected on the mobile app. Unlike the most commonly used digital tracing approach that sends quarantine recommendations to all recent contacts of a newly diagnosed person, the developed method in this paper considers all the information related to the users and the ones who have been in contacts with them in order to make user specific recommendations. This is not an easy problem because of different conflicting factors involving in making recommendation decisions, i.e. user privacy, mobility restrictions, and public health. The proposed method, called proactive content tracing, is a set-based architecture (that uses attention) and perform distributed inference to preserve privacy.\n\nThe authors utilized a simulator called COVIsim (not sure whether it is COVAsim or COVIsim) to train the proposed deep learning model and showed that their proposed method outperforms two baselines on multiple different metrics. The use of simulated data is well-justified given how difficult it is to obtain relevant COVID19 tracing data. This paper advances the current digital contact tracing significantly and is a great contribution to the field.
