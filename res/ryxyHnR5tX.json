The key idea is that if the measurement matrix is normalized, then the k-sparse thresholding of the gradient update can be viewed as solving a k-nearest neighbor problem. Therefore, one can presumably use fast k-NN methods instead of exact NN methods. Specifically the authors propose to use the prioritized DCI method of Li and Malik.\n\nPros: \nreasonable idea to use fast (sublinear) NN techniques in the k-sparse projection step.\n\nCons: \n* It appears that the running time improvement over the baseline IHT (which has Otilde(mn) complexity) heavily depends on the intrinsic dimensionality of A. However, the authors do not characterize this.\n* The authors neglect to mention in the paper that prioritized DCI has a pre-processing time of O(mn), so the final algorithm isn't really asymptotically faster.\n* I cannot parse Theorem 1 (especially, the second sentence). Is epsilon the failure probability of DCI?\n* Experimental results are far too synthetic. In real-life problems k itself is big, so there may be other bottlenecks (least squares, gradient updates, etc) and not necessarily the hard thresholding step.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1503/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Accelerated Sparse Recovery Under Structured Measurements", "abstract": "Extensive work on compressed sensing has yielded a rich collection of sparse recovery algorithms, each making different tradeoffs between recovery condition and computational efficiency.
