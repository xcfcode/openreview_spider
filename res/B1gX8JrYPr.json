We\u2019d like to clarify that this paper aims to reformulate the various algorithms and distill them into a single common formulation. The common formulation is governed by the reward function and two weight hyperparameters, and thus defines a *family* of sequence prediction algorithms. Changing the specifications of the three factors (i.e., reward and weights) leads to different specific algorithms. It\u2019s indeed novel and non-trivial to reformulate these apparently distinct algorithms and discover the common underlying formulation. We will update the presentation (as also suggested by R#1) accordingly to make this contribution clearer.\n\nThe interpolation algorithm is an immediate production of the discovered common formulation, as it\u2019s a natural idea, once we see the common formulation, to anneal the three governing factors to \u201cinterpolate\u201d between the specific algorithms in the family. We add the discussion of the annealing settings in the main paper. It\u2019s also worth noting that the interpolation algorithm is just one of the many possible ways of taking advantage of the common formulation. For example, another natural idea would be to find (e.g., through hyperparameter optimization) the best configuration of the three governing factors in the common formulation, which is equivalent to finding the best optimization algorithm in the whole family and use it to learn sequence prediction. This shows the advantages of having the common formulation. We will make this clearer in the revised version.\n\nThis paper is the first to discuss the extensive set of algorithms (MLE, RAML, Data Noising, policy gradient, etc) jointly and find their common denominator. The resulting interpolation algorithm can also be seen as a generalization of previous approaches, such as MIXER, that \u201cuses MLE and RL collaboratively\u201d. (As discussed in the paper, MIXER can be seen as using a restricted annealing strategy in the proposed interpolation algorithm). The generalized interpolation algorithm also outperforms MIXER.\n\nWe will fix all typos and do proofread.

The average output length in the machine translation dataset is 18.5. That is, each target sequence contains 18.5 tokens on average. In contrast, the length is 8.2 in the text summarization dataset. We speculate these different output lengths lead to the different variances and improvement --- the proposed approach by design brings more benefits when the output sequences are longer (e.g., MT) by combating the compounding error. The approach thus gets relatively significant improvement and lower variance compared to the other methods on MT; while on summarization, the approach achieves moderate improvement and does not reduce the variance. We will add more analysis and discussions in the revised version.\n\n(2) Thanks for the suggestion! As above, the improvement on the summarization task is moderate due to the short output sequences in the dataset.

MLE and RL are special cases of this training paradigm. Paper is well written, and the experimental results are convincing enough.  \nHowever, there are still some minor problems in the paper. For the optimization framework ERPO (shown in Equation 1), it consists of three parts, a cross-entropy term (Shannon entropy), a $p,q$ KL divergence term, and a reinforcement learning reward loss item. From the framework point of view, it is not like the author claim that is supposed to present a general optimization framework, including various optimization algorithms. Instead, it is just a combined loss through weight control and the selection of corresponding functions. It may not really theoretically work to unify various types of optimization algorithms for general cases, let alone claiming that this is a general optimization algorithm framework. \n\nFor the interpolation algorithm (I regard this is the true technical contribution of this paper), the authors used an annealing mechanism to use different weights and functions at different stages of training. The essence is that after MLE pre-training, different optimization algorithms are used in different stages, and this should be the focus of the article. The annealing settings used is only introduced in the appendix simply. Without more comparison experiments, we cannot clearly get the conditions for the annealing algorithm to be effective and ineffective. \n\nFor the title of connecting the dots between MLE and RL, this paper did not do so, MLE and RL are only used collaboratively, and this has also been mentioned in previous work.\n\ntypo\nPage 6 Paragraph \u201cOther Algorithms & Discussions\u201d: We We show in the appendix\u2026 -> We show in the appendix\u2026\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1723/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1723/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["bwkevintan@gmail.com", "zhitinghu@gmail.com", "yangtze2301@gmail.com", "rsalakhu@cs.cmu.edu", "epxing@cs.cmu.edu"], "title": "Connecting the Dots Between MLE and RL for Sequence Prediction", "authors": ["Bowen Tan", "Zhiting Hu", "Zichao Yang", "Ruslan Salakhutdinov", "Eric Xing"], "pdf": "/pdf/56c20197d5210fad94a8e875149cc7e792c9a359.pdf", "TL;DR": "An entropy regularized policy optimization formalism subsumes a set of sequence prediction learning algorithms.

Unfortunately this submission has two issues 1) presentation and 2) experimental validation. \n\nI find it peculiar that an objective function that features ML and variants of RL as special cases called ERPO is proposed by statement. I find it more likely that it came out by analysing ML, the variants of RL and other commonly used objective functions, noticing similarities between them and then formulating a function that would render all above as special cases. Had the order been different this submission would have been much more analytical and interesting to read. \n\nI find experimental results a bit limited and not entirely conclusive as it seem that MT provides the only strong experimental evidence.
