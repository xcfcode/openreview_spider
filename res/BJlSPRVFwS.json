In our updated implementation, concurrent processes get equal opportunity to benefit from the high-performance data processing of a multi-GPU system. Now, on comparing the end-to-end convergence speedup with respect to wall-clock-time, the proposed PASSM method outperforms the compared existing methods. \n\n-- Specification of the updates: \n  The updated implementation of the asynchronous methods works as the following: each of the concurrent processes performs both the forward and the backward passes in a data-parallel way utilizing all the available GPUs, thereby taking advantage of a multi-GPU system and the parallelization offered therein. It effectively simulates a shared-memory system over a \"distributed\" memory setting.\n\n-- Mini-batch-size and other hyperparameters:\n  Data-parallel SGD could process a larger mini-batch size utilizing a larger amount of parallel resources at disposal resulting in a reduction of variance. However, this will be a bit unfair to the asynchronous methods which would remain devoid of this statistical advantage while employing concurrent processes. For fairness\u2019 sake, we used identical hyper-parameters for each of the methods. Examining closely, SGD will actually have a smaller processing time per mini-batch as it would use more CUDA threads for an identically sized mini-batch compared to its asynchronous counterparts. Please note that Goyal et al., \"ImageNet in 1 hour\" explore the advantage of larger mini-batch processing that could significantly save on the communication cost. In our case, it is a shared-memory setting which does not consider communication cost. In particular, in the updated implementation, we did not allow the concurrent processes to perform their iterations in isolation on separate GPUs, for they exploit data-parallelization as much as SGD. Counting the total number of mini-batches processed, now all the processes are almost at an equal footing on the count of cross-GPU communication costs.\n\n-- Load-balancing for back-propagation:\n It is imperative that there will be a difference in terms of time taken for a forward and a backward pass by different processes depending on the proximity of their respective assigned blocks to the output layer. However, note that the multi-GPU setting would provide the concurrent processes with the utilization of the available parallel resources depending on the number of tensors that it needs to process, effectively resulting in almost a load-balancing. Nevertheless, we assigned blocks containing $s_i \\ge \\lceil{L/p}\\rceil$ parameter components,  where $L$ is the model size and $p$ is the number of processes, to the processes $P_i$ computing stochastic sub-gradients corresponding to layers closer to output. Whereas, the process that computes sub-gradient of the layer-block closest to the input is assigned a block containing less than $\\lfloor{L/p}\\rfloor$ parameter components. The assignments $s_i$ aim to balance computation load, however, it varies across layers depending on the size of the assigned leaves in terms of parameter component. However, we observed an insignificant difference in average processing time for the same number of epochs irrespective of switching off the requires_grad flag inferring that a blocked architecture such as ResNet does not allow much scope of computation-cost saving on this count. We did not emphasize on assigning the weight and bias tensors of layers to the same process mainly to avoid unnecessary \"load im-balance\" when they all are using data-parallel resources. In any case, $p$ is much smaller than $L$ so there would not be more than just a few cases of tensors of a layer landing on different processes.\n\n-- On momentum:\n Finally, now we have a specific set of benchmarks that highlight the significance of momentum. In particular, it shows that the asynchronous methods take better advantage of momentum correction which was also observed by Mitliagkas et al, \u201cAsynchrony begets momentum\u201d 2017.\n\nWe have significantly updated the draft clearly highlighting the above-mentioned points."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1174/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1174/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["vyacheslav.kungurtsev@fel.cvut.cz", "malcom.egan@insa-lyon.fr", "bapi.chatterjee@ist.ac.at", "dan.alistarh@ist.ac.at"], "title": "Asynchronous Stochastic Subgradient Methods for General Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization", "authors": ["Vyacheslav Kungurtsev", "Malcolm Egan", "Bapi Chatterjee", "Dan Alistarh"], "pdf": "/pdf/4dff97e516926f5e2e27fb8b11ae5088481a443e.pdf", "TL;DR": "Asymptotic convergence for stochastic subgradien method with momentum under general parallel asynchronous computation for general nonconvex nonsmooth optimization", "abstract": "Asynchronous distributed methods are a popular way to reduce the communication and synchronization costs of large-scale optimization.

The convergence theory does show that indeed although the gradient estimates are based on delayed information, and furthermore in the read-lock-free setting, they can be estimates at points which never ever existed in memory altogether (but their components did, at different times/iterations), the basic stochastic subgradient algorithm does converge. \n\nSo in answer to the main question, the assumptions of the theory is general enough to include the worst possible scenarios in delayed inaccurate subgradient estimates. Of course, we'd like to also offer some guidance in finding the intuition in the theory so as to help explain how it is taken care of, in reference to the convergence theory on page 13.\n\nAn essential element here is the gradual stepsize decrease together with a maximum possible delay. Asymptotically, due to the decreasing stepsize, the iterates get closer and closer together, so the delayed gradients become an ever better approximation to the current ones. Eventually they are accurate enough that the error associated with the delays is outweighed by the progress in minimizing the function associated with the subgradient."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1174/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1174/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["vyacheslav.kungurtsev@fel.cvut.cz", "malcom.egan@insa-lyon.fr", "bapi.chatterjee@ist.ac.at", "dan.alistarh@ist.ac.at"], "title": "Asynchronous Stochastic Subgradient Methods for General Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization", "authors": ["Vyacheslav Kungurtsev", "Malcolm Egan", "Bapi Chatterjee", "Dan Alistarh"], "pdf": "/pdf/4dff97e516926f5e2e27fb8b11ae5088481a443e.pdf", "TL;DR": "Asymptotic convergence for stochastic subgradien method with momentum under general parallel asynchronous computation for general nonconvex nonsmooth optimization", "abstract": "Asynchronous distributed methods are a popular way to reduce the communication and synchronization costs of large-scale optimization.

Stochastic sub-gradient asynchronous methods are of particular challenging when coupled with complicated hardware behavior of modern NUMA architecture. To validate the analysis, and study the impact of momentum, variable partitioning, numerical experiments on deep learning training are given.\n\nA major concern to me is that the assumptions made in the analyze may be too restrictive. For example, Assumption 3.1.1 regarding the unbiasedness of the stochastic sub-gradients may not hold for since the Clarke sub-differentiation is not additive. The Clarke sub-differentiation of |x| and -|x| are not included in their average which is zero, therefore the Assumption 3.1.1 is not true for tame functions (as cited in the paper) . If this assumption were not true, all the proof arguments based on Martingale differences may not be follow to prove Theorem 3.1. \n\nThere are a few typos which make the paper hard to understand. Is the momentum variable  u_i^kc in Algorithm 1 a central variable, as x_i? It seems to be yes since the update needs a lock. But why there is an kc on its index, which is not the case for x_i? \n\nIn terms of numerical results, the system specification is not so clear to me why it includes a diverse asynchronous system settings. Even though Figure 1 shows convergence in terms cross-entropy loss, which is not directly related to validate Theorem 3.1 since it is not clear what is going on with x_t.\n\nThe paper would be of great interest if the global shared memory asynchronous model is made more precise in the main body of the paper. At a first glace, it is not clear what is the benefit (or what insights) using this model to analyze these algorithms, compared to simplistic models in literature.

Studying stochastic subgradient methods in the nonsmooth nonconvex setting is already very challenging. Throwing asynchronous updates into the mix further complicates the analysis. This is overcome by proposing a model for asynchrony which captures the salient features of computation platforms, while being amenable to analysis.\n\nThe main drawback of this paper is that the experiments seem to suggest that, although asynchronous methods do a good job optimizing training metrics (loss, accuracy), the models they train do not generalize as well as using synchronous SGD. This demotivates the need for the theory developed in this paper - rather, the theory is ahead of it's time. The paper could be significantly strengthened by reporting an example application where using an asynchronous stochastic subgradient method is advantageous for training deep networks.\n\nThe notation and discussion in Sec 3.1 is pretty heavy. Can you explain how this model differs from other models of asynchrony, e.g., as put forward in the well-known book by Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis on Parallel and Distributed Computation?\n\nThe main convergence result (Theorem 1) holds for a continuous-time process, following the typical analysis of stochastic approximation algorithms. However, practitioners rarely use a diminishing step size, especially for training deep networks. Is it possible to quantify the effect of using a constant step size? (E.g., in stochastic approximation analyses for smooth functions, one typically gets a \"law of large numbers\" which ensures convergence of the average, and a \"central limit theorem\" which bounds the distance of any realization of the process to its mean. Is there an analogous CLT for this setting?)\n\nIn the experiments, the SGD with DataParallel is effectively using a mini-batch size that is 3-5x larger than that of a single worker. In this case one would expect to be able to use a larger learning rate too (since there is less noise). Evidence for this is provided in Goyal et al., \"ImageNet in 1 hour\". Did you try tuning the learning rate separately for each method?\n\nHow were the parameters of the deep CNNs used in the experiments divided into blocks? This choice should affect the average time to evaluate a block gradient, right? Computing the gradient of parameters in the lowest layer requires doing a full forward and backward, while computing the gradient of higher layers should be faster since it doesn't require a full backward pass. Did you measure the average time to compute a block gradient, and could you report it in the paper? Did you divide into blocks based on layer? Are all parameters within the same block part of the same filter at a given layer?\n\nThe last paragraph of Sec 4 talks about the necessity of momentum, but it isn't clear what evidence this claim is based on.\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1174/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1174/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["vyacheslav.kungurtsev@fel.cvut.cz", "malcom.egan@insa-lyon.fr", "bapi.chatterjee@ist.ac.at", "dan.alistarh@ist.ac.at"], "title": "Asynchronous Stochastic Subgradient Methods for General Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization", "authors": ["Vyacheslav Kungurtsev", "Malcolm Egan", "Bapi Chatterjee", "Dan Alistarh"], "pdf": "/pdf/4dff97e516926f5e2e27fb8b11ae5088481a443e.pdf", "TL;DR": "Asymptotic convergence for stochastic subgradien method with momentum under general parallel asynchronous computation for general nonconvex nonsmooth optimization", "abstract": "Asynchronous distributed methods are a popular way to reduce the communication and synchronization costs of large-scale optimization.
