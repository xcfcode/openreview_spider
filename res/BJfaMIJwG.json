From proposition D.1 and (6), it seems that there are k choices for each point x_i, so a greedy search would have a complexity of k^K=O(\\log^K N), instead of O(\\log^2 N) as in Section 2.1 (they are equivalent unless K=2, but I assume that K should be a large number)?\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Weighted Geodesic Distance Following Fermat's Principle", "abstract": "We propose a density-based estimator for weighted geodesic distances suitable for data lying on a manifold of lower dimension than ambient space and sampled from a possibly nonuniform distribution.

Usually these two methods are not considered interchangeable, as far as I know. \nThe clustering application somehow calls for a comparison with commute time distances and similar concepts, which are typically used (implicitly) in Laplacian eigenmaps and spectral clustering.\n\nAll in all, the paper is extremely difficult to assess.\nWhile the proposed idea could be interesting, there are key questions that arise and that are not answered in this short format.
