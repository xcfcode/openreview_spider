However, I think a evaluation with respect to standard metrics is a must for an experimental GAN paper. \n\n- I would have liked to see a comparison to using the exact Wasserstein distance, as it also scales roughly like n^3. For example, the recent paper \"Wasserstein GAN with Quadratic Transport Cost\" computes the exact distance using linear programming, and there it is shown to yield good results w.r.t. FID.  \n\nMinor comments I noticed during reading (no impact on my rating):\n\n- In Eq. 1, the maximization over D is confusing given that in the following Eq. 2 the primal form of the Wasserstein distance is shown.\n\n- The number of possible joint distributions is a continuum, and not a discrete quantity that increases factorially. Anyway if both distributions are discrete, then the problem can be reduced to a discrete optimization problem with factorially many candidate solutions, but this is very misleading as there are polynomial time algorithms. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1933/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1933/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Greedy Approach to Max-Sliced Wasserstein GANs", "authors": ["Andr\u00e1s Horv\u00e1th"], "authorids": ["horvath.andras@itk.ppke.hu"], "keywords": ["GEnerative Adversarial Networks", "GANs", "Wasserstein distances", "Sliced Wasserstein Distance", "Max-sliced Wasserstein distance"], "TL;DR": "We apply a greedy assignment on the projected samples instead of sorting to approximate Wasserstein distance", "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks have made data generation possible in various use cases, but in case of complex, high-dimensional distributions it can be difficult to train them, because of convergence problems and the appearance of mode collapse.\nSliced Wasserstein GANs and especially the application of the Max-Sliced Wasserstein distance made it possible to approximate Wasserstein distance during training in an efficient and stable way and helped ease convergence problems of these architectures.\n\nThis method transforms sample assignment and distance calculation into sorting the one-dimensional projection of the samples, which results a sufficient approximation of the high-dimensional Wasserstein distance. \n\nIn this paper we will demonstrate that the approximation of the Wasserstein distance by sorting the samples is not always the optimal approach and the greedy assignment of the real and fake samples can result faster convergence and better approximation of the original distribution.", "pdf": "/pdf/fe79005555f3de3cef678c793aeb3db7f526094b.pdf", "code": "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zwEQ9lukoIeHBOLnxKE4MoiiYOqWCQii", "paperhash": "horv\u00e1th|a_greedy_approach_to_maxsliced_wasserstein_gans", "original_pdf": "/attachment/fe79005555f3de3cef678c793aeb3db7f526094b.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nhorv{\\'a}th2020a,\ntitle={A Greedy Approach to Max-Sliced Wasserstein {\\{}GAN{\\}}s},\nauthor={Andr{\\'a}s Horv{\\'a}th},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJgRsyBtPB}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).

They are based on the authors\u2019 claim that there is a \u201cflaw\u201d in the Wasserstein-1 distance between probability distributions on the one-dimensional space. Briefly, the authors\u2019 argument says that the \u201cflaw\u201d is that the optimal transport may not be unique, some of which are better for network learning than others. One proposal, described in Section 2.2, is to find a plausible transport plan in a greedy manner. The other proposal, described in Section2.3, is a hybrid of the greedy approach in Section 2.2 and the original sliced Wasserstein distance.\n\nThe working hypothesis in this paper, that the above \u201cflaw\u201d is indeed problematic in learning in max-sliced Wasserstein GANs, has not been confirmed in any sense in this paper. Algorithm 1 is meant to explain one of the proposal, the greedy approach, but I found that several undefined symbols are used there, so that it seems hard to understand it. Numerical experiments in Section 3 are not well described. Because of these, I would not be able to recommend acceptance of this paper.\n\nAlgorithm 1 seems to heavily rely on Algorithm 1 in Deshpande et al., 2019. This paper does not provide any explanation about why one should sample n data for each i running from 1 to n (line 3), what the \u201csurrogate loss\u201d is (line 4), what \u00a5omega is (line 4), why one should care about the surrogate loss between ith data and ith generated sample (line 4), as well as what D^i_k means (line 11).\n\nI do not understand how the Pearson correlation coefficient between the generator (or fake) distribution and the real distribution in Section 3. As far as my understanding, fake samples and real samples are sampled independently, so that correlation coefficient should ideally vanish in any case. Also, the KL divergence is not symmetric, so that whether KL(P_F,P_R) or KL(P_R,P_F) was evaluated has to be explicitly stated. Furthermore, recalling that the Wasserstein distance has originally been introduced to the GAN literature in order to alleviate the problems associated with the KL-based divergence (Jensen-Shannon), I do not understand either why the authors chose to use the KL divergence in their performance comparison.\n\nThe \u201cflaw\u201d argued in this paper does not apply to the Wasserstein distance in general, but specifically to the Wasserstein-1 distance between one-dimensional distributions.
