But this is not the case that we claimed to be extendable. We want to clarify that we believe it\u2019s relatively straightforward to extend our current analysis, which is based on the batch gradient, to the incremental gradient, in which cases all mini-batches are loaded sequentially instead of stochastically. The unified analysis framework Bertesekas[1] has for the incremental gradient can be applied and extended to our analysis.\n\n(3) Assumption 6 in the paper is the only assumption we need for the activation function for our analysis. As we have pointed out in the paper, a lot of common choices satisfy this assumption, like ReLU or LeakReLU. In our proof, we are first showing that the batch normalization parameters (\\mu and \\sigma) within the dense layer converge as Cauchy sequences. For the multiple layer cases, we would be able to first show that the batch normalization parameters within the first layer converge. Given \\mu and \\sigma in the first layer converge, we would be able to show that the \\mu and \\sigma values in the second layer converge. Then we would be able to follow the current analysis to show that the entire algorithm converges. The individual steps identified above follow the mathematics in the two-layer setting. The notation would have to be substantially augmented, but the proof would not yield new ideas. \n\n(5) One should really think about our assumption to be that in each iteration the produced vectors are bounded. We will change the wording of our assumption to reflect this interpretation. \nWe also like to point out that many other papers make the same assumption, e.g., [2], [3], [4], [5] and [6] .

Please allow us to try to address your remarks below:\n\n1) We believe it is possible to extend the current analysis to a mini-batch setting by reusing most of the present analysis. We point out that in numerical experiments we use mini-batches.\n\n2) Our analysis does not draw any conclusion regarding the convergence rate. This is an exciting future direction. \n\n3) We agree that having more layers makes the problem more complicated. However, the analysis would essentially be the same except that the notation would be substantially more complex (but the proof ideas remain the same). \n\n4) Although the function in (9) takes lambda as part of the input, the derivative notation we use here is only with respect to theta (and not including lambda). We actually note in the line before (2) that all of the derivatives in this work are taken with respect to theta not lambda. We should claim this again at (9) as a clarification.  \n\n5) We are not showing that the algorithm is converging to a local minimum but a point with the norm of gradient being zero. This is by definition a stationary point. It is unclear what happens with functions that do not satisfy Assumption 2 (bounded parameters) and 5 (stationary point existence).\n\n6) Our analysis requires the parameters to be bounded within a compact set instead of any arbitrary constraints on parameters. Bounded parameters are required in the analysis to bound their norms. In practice, clipping is performed which is equivalent. Even in much simpler cases the proofs in an unbounded case are very complicated. The vast majority of convergence proofs in optimization assume bounded parameters. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper19/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper19/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper19/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Diminishing Batch Normalization", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a generalization of the BN algorithm, diminishing batch normalization (DBN), where we update the BN parameters in a diminishing moving average way.

To my understanding, the main effort in the analysis is to show that the sequences of interest are Cauchy. Some numerical results are reported to demonstrate that the proposed variant of BN slightly outperforms BN with careful adjustment of some hyper parameter. The proposed approach is incremental, and the theoretical results are somewhat weak.\n\nThe most important issue is that the zero gradient of the objective function does not imply that it attains an (even local) minimum point. As for the 2-layer case, the objective function can be nonconvex in terms of the weight parameters with stationary points being saddle points, it is crucial to understand whether an iterative algorithm (GD or SGD) converges to a minimum point rather a saddle point. Thus, the first order criterion alone is not enough for this purpose, which is why extensive studies are carried out for nonconvex optimization (e.g., using both first and second order criteria for convergence [1]) and considering the specific structure of neural nets [2].\n\nThe analysis is somewhat confusing. The authors assume that the objective of interest have stationary points (\\theta*, \\lambda*), and also show that the sequence of the norm of gradient convergence to zero, with the \\lambda^(m) converges to \\bar{\\lambda}. What is the relationship between \\lambda* and \\bar{\\lambda}? It is not clear whether they are the same point or not. Moreover, since there is no converge of the parameter, it is not clear what the convergence for the \\lambda imply here, as we also discussed above that the zero gradient itself may mean nothing.\n\nIn addition, the writing need improvements. Some statements are not accurate. For example, on page 3, after equation (2), the authors state \u201cThe deep network \u2026\u201d, though they mentioned it is for a 2-layer net. Also, more explicit explanation and definitions are necessary for notations. For example, it is clearer to define explicitly the parameters with \\bar (e.g., for \\lambda) as the limit point. \n\n[1] Ge et al.

", "review": "\nIn this work, the authors propose a generalization of the batch normalization (BN) technique often used in training neural networks, and analyzed this convergence. In particular, a one hidden layer and one BN hidden layer fully connected network is considered, and a deterministic gradient descent algorithm with certain kind of BN has been considered in this work. The proposed \u201cgeneralized\u201d BN strategy is devised on the deterministic setting, but it is a slight generalization of the original BN by introducing a moving average operation. Classical results of Bertsekas is leveraged to show the asymptotic convergence of the algorithm. \n\nI have the following three main comments about the paper. \n1)\tOnly deterministic setting is considered, but in this case every time the entire data set will be used to perform the averaging, it appears to be much easier to analyze than the stochastic setting. Further the reviewer has doubt on whether the resulting deterministic algorithm has any practice value. \n2)\tBecause the authors have used the Bertsekas/Tsitsiklis (B/T) argument, only asymptotic convergence is shown. It is not clear, even in the deterministic case, whether some kind of sublinear convergence rate can be obtained. \n3)\tOnly one hidden layer of neural network with one BN operation is considered. It is not clear whether the analysis can be extended to multiple layers, despite the statement of the author saying that \u201cthe technique presented can be extended to more layers with additional notation\u201d. In particular, when there are multiple layers, the BN layers will be further composite together across multiple nonlinear operations. \n4)\tThe authors have mentioned that the derivative is always taking w.r.t. theta. However, in (9) is appears that the derivative is taken with respect to lambda, in order to get the Lipschitz condition on \\lambda. This is a bit confusing. Also it is not clear how the gradient in Assumption 5 is defined. \n5)\tAssumption 5 does not make sense. Problem (1) is a constrained problem with both variables being confined in compact feasible sets. And this condition is important in Assumption2. Now the authors say that at stationary solution the gradient is zero? Please specify functions when this will happen. I will suggest that the authors use a proper definition of stationarity solution for constrained problems. \n6)\tFollow up on the previous point. The analysis builds upon B/T argument for unconstrained optimization. However it is not suitable for the constrained problems that the authors started out at the beginning of the paper. The authors may consider develop new analysis tools to understand the problem at hand, rather than assuming away the difficulties. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper19/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Diminishing Batch Normalization", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a generalization of the BN algorithm, diminishing batch normalization (DBN), where we update the BN parameters in a diminishing moving average way.
