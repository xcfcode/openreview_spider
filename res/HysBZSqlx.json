The authors focus on Super Nintendo but claim that the interface supports many others (including ALE). Benchmark results are given for standard algorithms in 5 new Super Nintendo games, and some results using a new \"rivalry metric\".\n\nThese environments (or, more generally, standardized evaluation methods like public data sets, competitions, etc.) have a long history of improving the quality of AI and machine learning research. One example in the past few years was the Atari Learning Environment (ALE) which has now turned into a standard benchmark for comparison of algorithms and results. In this sense, the RLE could be a worthy contribution to the field by encouraging new challenging domains for research.\n\nThat said, the main focus of this paper is presenting this new framework and showcasing the importance of new challenging domains. The results of experiments themselves are for existing algorithms. There are some new results that show reward shaping and policy shaping (having a bias toward going right in Super Mario) help during learning. And, yes, domain knowledge helps, but this is obvious. The rivalry training is an interesting idea, when training against a different opponent, the learner overfits to that opponent and forgets to play against the in-game AI; but then oddly, it gets evaluated on how well it does against the in-game AI! \n\nAlso the part of the paper that describes the scientific results (especially the rivalry training) is less polished, so this is disappointing. In the end, I'm not very excited about this paper.\n\nI was hoping for a more significant scientific contribution to accompany in this new environment. It's not clear if this is necessary for publication, but also it's not clear that ICLR is the right venue for this work due to the contribution being mainly about the new code (for example, mloss.org could be a better 'venue', JMLR has an associated journal track for accompanying papers: http://www.jmlr.org/mloss/)\n\n--- Post response:\n\nThank you for the clarifications. Ultimately I have not changed my opinion on the paper. Though I do think RLE could have a nice impact long-term, there is little new science in this paper, ad it's either too straight-forward (reward shaping, policy-shaping) or not quite developed enough (rivalry training).", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Playing SNES in the Retro Learning Environment", "abstract": "Mastering a video game requires skill, tactics and strategy.

Also the part of the paper that describes the scientific results (especially the rivalry training) is less polished.. \n\nA: In our second experiment, the goal was to train an agent to achieve a better score vs the in-game AI. Since the trained agent (D-DDQN) beats the in-game AI (as seen in section 4.1.1), we assume that by adding several training episodes against the trained D-DDQN agent results will improve. \nThe fact that the agent overfits that badly to its opponent policy was somewhat surprising, especially since we used the exact same setting for the additional training episodes. The only difference was the rivals policy - we maintained the same characters, same levels and random initialization.\nAn additional experiment we conducted, and incorporated to a later revision, takes this one step further and combines training by alternating the rival's policy in each episode, switching between the in-game AI, a vanilla DQN agent and D-DDQN agent.\nThis indeed lead to a more generalized policy which achieves much better results when evaluate against a new policy (i.e., same game higher difficulty setting. See Section 4.1.2).\n\nThank you for your honest evaluation and reference to other 'venue'."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Playing SNES in the Retro Learning Environment", "abstract": "Mastering a video game requires skill, tactics and strategy.

The first supported platform is the SNES, with 5 games (more consoles and games may be added later). Authors argue that SNES games pose more challenges than Atari\u2019s (due to more complex graphics, AI and game mechanics). Several DQN variants are evaluated in experiments, and it is also proposed to compare learning algorihms by letting them compete against each other in multiplayer games.\n\nI like the idea of going toward more complex games than those found on Atari 2600, and having an environment where new consoles and games can easily be added sounds promising. With OpenAI Universe and DeepMind Lab that just came out, though, I am not sure we really need another one right now. Especially since using ROMs of emulated games we do not own is technically illegal: it looks like this did not cause too much trouble for Atari but it might start raising eyebrows if the community moves to more advanced and recent games, especially some Nintendo still makes money from.\n\nBesides the introduction of the environment, it is good to have DQN benchmarks on five games, but this does not add a lot of value. The authors also mention as contribution \"A new benchmarking technique, allowing algorithms to compete against each other, rather than playing against the in-game AI\", but this seems a bit exaggerated to me: the idea of pitting AIs against each other has been at the core of many AI competitions for decades, so it is hardly something new. The finding that reinforcement learning algorithms tend to specialize to their opponent is also not particular surprising.\n\nOverall I believe this is an ok paper but I do not feel it brings enough to the table for a major conference. This does not mean, however, that this new environment won't find a spot in the (now somewhat crowded) space of game-playing frameworks.\n\nOther small comments:\n- There are lots of typos (way too many to mention them all)\n- It is said that Infinite Mario \"still serves as a benchmark platform\", however as far as I know it had to be shutdown due to Nintendo not being too happy about it\n- \"RLE requires an emulator and a computer version of the console game (ROM file) upon initialization rather than a ROM file only. The emulators are provided with RLE\" => how is that different from ALE that requires the emulator Stella which is also provided with ALE?\n- Why is there no DQN / DDDQN result on Super Mario?\n- It is not clear if Figure 2 displays the F-Zero results using reward shaping or not\n- The Du et al reference seems incomplete", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Playing SNES in the Retro Learning Environment", "abstract": "Mastering a video game requires skill, tactics and strategy.

If so, the statement in the intro is misleading.\n\nFrom 4.3: \"The second use was to initially train two agents against the in-game AI, and then resuming training while rivaling one another, and evaluating against the in-game AI separately.\" Can you elaborate on \"resuming training while rivaling one another\": won't this only work in multiplayer games where a second agent is controllable by DQN? For example, what is the \"in-game AI\" for Super Mario?\n\nIn 4.3.1, all that's listed is win ratios but not the score each obtained against the other: what are the scores? In this second rivalry training: has the objective changed (i.e. maximize probability of winning).. or are the agents still trying to maximize reward? \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Playing SNES in the Retro Learning Environment", "abstract": "Mastering a video game requires skill, tactics and strategy.
