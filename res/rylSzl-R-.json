I think the explanation of non-saturating vs saturating objective is nice, and I've increased the score.\n\nNote though: I absolutely expect a revision at camera-ready if the paper gets accepted (we did not get one).\n\nOriginal review:\nThe paper is overall a good contribution. The motivation / insights are interesting, the theory is correct, and the experiments support their claims.\n\nI\u2019m not sure I agree that this is \u201cunifying\u201d GANs and VAEs, rather it places them within the same graphical model perspective. This is very interesting and a valuable way of looking at things, but I don\u2019t see this as reshaping how we think of or use GANs. Maybe a little less hype, a little more connection to other perspectives would be best. In particular, I\u2019d hope the authors would talk a little more about f-GAN, as the variational lower-bound shown in this work is definitely related, though this work uniquely connects the GAN lower bound with VAE by introducing the intractable \u201cposterior\u201d, q(x | y).\n\nDetailed comments:\nP1: I see f-GAN as helping link adversarial learning with traditional likelihood-based methods, notably as a dual-formulation of the same problem. It seems like there should be some mention of this.\n\nP2:\nwhat does this mean: \u201cgenerated samples from the generative model are not leveraged for model learning\u201d. The wording is maybe a little confusing.\n\nP5:\nSo here I think the connection to f-GAN is even clearer, but it isn\u2019t stated explicitly in the paper: the discriminator defines a lower-bound for a divergence (in this case, the JSD), so it\u2019s natural that there is an alternate formulation in terms of the posterior (as it is called in this work). As f-GAN is fairly well-known, not making this connection here I think isolates this work in a critical way that makes it seem that similar observations haven\u2019t been made.\n\nP6:\n\"which blocks out fake samples from contributing to learning\u201d: this is an interesting way of thinking about this. One potential issue with VAEs / other MLE-based methods (such as teacher-forcing) is that it requires the model to stay \u201cclose\u201d to the real data, while GANs do not have such a restriction. Would you care to comment on this?\n\nP8:\nI think both the Hjelm (BGAN) and Che (MaliGAN) are using these weights to address credit assignment with discrete data, but BGAN doesn\u2019t use a MLE generator, as is claimed in this work. \n\nGeneral experimental comments:\nGenerally it looks like IWGAN and AA-VAE do as is claimed: IWGANs have better mode coverage (higher inception scores), while AA-VAEs have better likelihoods given that we\u2019re using the generated samples as well as real data. This last one is a nice result, as it\u2019s a general issue with RNNs (teacher forcing) and is why we need things like scheduled sampling to train on the free-running phase. Do you have any comments on this?\n\nIt would have been nice to show that this works on harder datasets (CelebA, LSUN, ImageNet).", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "On Unifying Deep Generative Models", "abstract": "Deep generative models have achieved impressive success in recent years.

Starting from the \u2018non-saturated\u2019 GAN loss the key result (lemma 1) shows that GANs minimizes the KL divergence between the generator(inference) distribution and a posterior distribution implicitly defined by the discriminator. I found the paper IWGAN and especially the AAVAE experiments quite interesting.  However the paper is also very dense and quite hard to follow at times - In general I think the paper would benefit from moving some content (like the wake-sleep part of the paper) to the appendix and concentrating more on the key results and a few more experiments as detailed in the comments / questions below.\n\nQ1) What would happen if the KL-divergence minimizing loss proposed by Huszar (see e.g http://www.inference.vc/an-alternative-update-rule-for-generative-adversarial-networks/) was used instead of the \u201cnon-saturated\u201d GAN loss - would the residial JSD terms in Lemma 1 cancel out then?\n\nQ2) In Lemma 1 the negative JSD term looks a bit nasty to me e.g. in addition to KL divergence the GAN loss also maximises the JSD between the data and generative distributions. This JSD term acts in a somewhat opposite direction of the KL-divergence that we are interested in minimizing. Can the authors provide some more detailed comments / analysis on these two somewhat opposed terms - I find this quite important to include given the opposed direction of the JSD versus the KL term and that the JSD is ignored in e.g. section 4.1? secondly did the authors do any experiments on the the relative sizes of these two terms? I imagine it would be possible to perform some low-dimensional toy experiments where both terms were tractable to compute numerically?\n\nQ3) I think the paper could benefit from some intuition / discussion of the posterior term q^r(x|y) in lemma 1 composed on the prior p_theta0(x) and discriminator q^r(y|x). The terms drops out nicely in math however i had a bit of a hard time wrapping my head around what minimizing the KL-divergence between this term and the inference distribution p(xIy). I know this is a kind of open ended question but i think it would greatly aid the reader in understanding the paper if more \u2018guidance\u2019 is provided instead of just writing \u201c..by definition this is the posterior.\u2019\n\nQ4) In a similar vein to the above. It would be nice with some more discussion / definitions of the terms in Lemma 2. e.g what does \u201cHere most of the components have exact correspondences (and the same definitions) in GANs and InfoGAN (see Table 1)\u201d mean? \n\nQ5) The authors state that there is \u2018strong connections\u2019 between VAEs and GANs. I agree that both (after some assumptions) both minimize a KL-divergence (table 1) however to me it is not obvious how strong this relation is. Could the authors provide some discussion / thoughts on this topic?\n\nOverall i like this work but also feel that some aspects could be improved: My main concern is that a lot of the analysis hinges on the JSD term being insignificant, but the authors to my knowledge does but provide any prof / indications that this is actually true. Secondly I think the paper would greatly benefit from concentration on fewer topics (e.g. maybe drop the RW topic as it feels a bit like an appendix) and instead provide a more throughout discussion of the theory (lemma 1 + lemma 2) as well as some more experiments wrt JSD term.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On Unifying Deep Generative Models", "abstract": "Deep generative models have achieved impressive success in recent years.

We will revise the title to avoid confusion.  \n\nP1 & P5:\nWe have discussed f-GAN (Nowozin et al., 2016) in the related work section. f-GAN and most previous works that analyze GANs are based on the `saturated` objective of GANs, i.e., min_G log(1-D(G(z))). In particular, f-GAN and a few other works showed that with this objective, GANs involve *minimizing a variational lower bound* of some f-divergence (Nowozin et al., 2016) or mutual information between x and y (the real/fake indicator) (Huszar et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016). \n\nIn contrast, our work is based on the `non-saturated` objective of the original GAN, i.e., max_G log D(G(z)). The two objectives have the same fixed point solution, but the `non-saturated` one avoids the vanishing gradient issue of the `saturated` one, and is more widely-used in practice. However, very few formal analysis (e.g., Arjovsky & Bottou, 2017) has been done on the `non-saturated` objective. Our results in Lemma.1 is a generalization of the previous theorem in (Arjovsky & Bottou, 2017) by allowing non-optimal discriminators in the analysis (please see the last paragraph of P5 for more details). \n\nWe will make these clearer in the revised version.\n\nP2 & P6:\nThe sentence \u201cgenerated samples from \u2026 learning\u201d in P2 meant the same as \u201cblocks out fake samples from contributing to learning\u201d in P6 as the reviewer noted. We will polish the statement. Thanks for pointing it out.\n\nBy the analysis in the paper and common empirical observations, GANs (which involve min KL(Q||P) ) suffer from mode missing issue. That is, the learned generation distribution tends to concentrate to few large modes of the real data distribution. In contrast, VAEs and other MLE-based methods (which involve min KL(P||Q) ) suffer from the issue of covering all data modes as well as small-density regions in-between. In this sense, GANs in practice are more \u201crestricted\u201d to stay close to data modes, and generate samples that are generally less diverse and more plausible.\n\nP8:\nBGAN for discrete data rephrases generator G as conditional distribution g(x|z), and evaluates the explicit conditional likelihood g(x|z) for training. BGAN for continuous data does not have such parameterization. We will update the statements to fix the issue. Thanks for pointing this out.\n\nExperiments:\nIt can be very interesting to apply the techniques in AA-VAE to augment the MLE training of RNNs, which has not been explored in this paper. A related line of research is adversarial training of RNNs which applies a discriminator on the RNN samples. To our knowledge, such approaches suffer from optimization difficulty due to, e.g., the discrete nature of samples (e.g., text samples). In contrast, AA-VAE avoids the issue as generated samples are used in the same way as real data examples by maximizing the \u201clikelihood\u201d of good samples selected by the discriminator. We are happy to explore more in this direction in the future.\n\nThis paper focuses mainly on establishing formal connections between GANs, VAEs, and other deep generative models through new formulations of them. Technique transfer between research lines, e.g., IWGAN and AA-VAE, serves to showcase the benefit of the unified statistical view. We will validate the new techniques on harder datasets as suggested, and show the results soon."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On Unifying Deep Generative Models", "abstract": "Deep generative models have achieved impressive success in recent years.

We have cited and briefly discussed this work (S\u00f8nderby et al., 2017) in the related work section. As with most previous studies, the analysis of the combined loss in the blog and (S\u00f8nderby et al., 2017) is based on the assumption that the discriminator is near optimal. With this assumption, Lemma.1 is simplified to Eq.(8), and the residual JSD term cancels out with the combined loss. However, as discussed in the paper, Lemma.1 in general case (Eq.6) does not rely on the optimality assumptions of the discriminator which are usually unwarranted in practice. Thus, Lemma.1 can be seen as a generalization of previous results (S\u00f8nderby et al., 2017; Arjovsky and Bottou, 2017) to account for broader situations. Also, the JSD term does not cancel out even with the combined loss.\n\nQ2) We will update the paper to add more analysis of the JSD term. In particular, from the derivation of Lemma.1 in section C of the supplements, we can show the relative sizes of the KL and JSD term follow: JSD <= KL. Specifically, if we denote the RHS of Eq.(20) as -E_p(y) [ KL - KL_1 ], then from Eq.(20) we have KL_1 <= KL. From Eqs.(22) and (23), we further have JSD <= KL_1. We therefore have JSD <= KL_1 <= KL. That is, the JSD is upper-bounded by the KL, and intuitively, if the KL is sufficiently minimized, the magnitude of JSD will also decrease.\n\nNote that we did not mean that the JSD term is negligible. Indeed, most conclusions in the paper have taken into account the JSD. For example, JSD is *symmetric* (rather than insignificant) and will not affect the mode missing behavior of GANs endowed by the asymmetry of the KL. We have also noticed in the paper that the gradients of the JSD and the KLD cancel out when discriminator gives random guesses (e.g., when p_g=p_data). In the derivations of IWGAN in sections 4.1 and G, inspired from the JSD term in Lemma.1, we also subtracted away the 2nd term of RHS of Eq.(38) which equals the JSD when k=1. The approximation is necessary for computational tractability.\n\nQ3) Figure.2 and the second point (\u201cTraining dynamics\u201d) under Lemma.1 give an intuitive illustration of the posterior distribution q^r(x|y). Intuitively, the posterior distribution is a mixture of p_data(x) and p_{g_\\theta0}(x) with the mixing weights induced from the discriminator distribution q^r(y|x). Figure.2 illustrates how minimizing the KL divergence between the inference distribution and the posterior can push p_g towards p_data, and how mode missing can happen. \n\nQ4) We will add more definitions and explanations of the terms in Lemma.2. The key terms are listed in Table.1 to allow side-by-side comparison with the corresponding terms in GANs and InfoGANs. For example, the distribution q_\\eta(z|x,y) in Lemma.2 precisely corresponds to the distribution q_\\eta(z|x,y) in InfoGAN (defined in the text of Eq.(9)). We will make these clearer in the revised version. Thanks for the suggestion.\n\nQ5) By \u201cstrong\u201d we meant the connections reveal multiple new perspectives of GANs and VAEs as well as a broad class of their variants. Most of the discussions are presented in section 3.4. For example, the reformulation of GANs links the adversarial approach to the classic Bayesian variational inference (VI) algorithm, which further opens up the opportunities of transferring the large volume of extensions of VI to the adversarial approach for improvement (e.g., the proposed IWGAN in the paper). Section 3.4 provides four examples of such new perspectives inspired by the new formulations and connections, each of which in turn leads to either an existing research direction or new broad discussions on deep generative modeling (e.g., section A). We hope this work can inspire even more insights and discussions on, e.g., formal relations of adversarial approaches and Bayesian methods, etc. "}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On Unifying Deep Generative Models", "abstract": "Deep generative models have achieved impressive success in recent years.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), as powerful frameworks for deep generative model learning, have largely been considered as two distinct paradigms and received extensive independent studies respectively. This paper aims to establish formal connections between GANs and VAEs through a new formulation of them. We interpret sample generation in GANs as performing posterior inference, and show that GANs and VAEs involve minimizing KL divergences of respective posterior and inference distributions with opposite directions, extending the two learning phases of classic wake-sleep algorithm, respectively. The unified view provides a powerful tool to analyze a diverse set of existing model variants, and enables to transfer techniques across research lines in a principled way. For example, we apply the importance weighting method in VAE literatures for improved GAN learning, and enhance VAEs with an adversarial mechanism that leverages generated samples. Experiments show generality and effectiveness of the transfered techniques.
