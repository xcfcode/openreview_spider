PCP & PETS: We directly compared PCP and PETS using the same CEM settings and found the PETS performance to be poor (1350 reward instead of 4600). This is because our CEM implementations differ in details; most significantly, we warm start our planner with the plans from the previous timestep, similar to [1]. This means our CEM yields significantly better results with a smaller number of planning trajectories. Given this difference in methods we feel the most fair comparison is to evaluate their method with the hyperparameters from their paper. \n\nThe Clavera et al. paper was released less than 2 weeks before the ICLR deadline.

Such a model would need the ability to produce complex multimodal distributions of outcomes. As our goal in this work was to understand why existing methods failed even on deterministic tasks, we leave it to future work to propose classes of multi-step models appropriate for stochastic environments.\n\n\"This work uses simply the reward at the end\": In fact, our model is able to use reward at intermediate time steps. To do this, we can use the variable-action-length version of our model, as used for visualization (mentioned in Section 2.2 paragraph 2 of the original version). We also use this version in Fig 5. to evaluate prediction error as a function of timesteps in the future. We have added Section 2.2.1 to clarify this.\n\nIn our main experiments we use a transformed version of the reward function to select trajectories which have an outcome with the greatest x-axis position. This is approximately equal to the sum of the rewards obtained along the trajectory under the original reward function, which provides a reward at each timestep proportional to the forward progress at that timestep. We have updated Section 2.3.1 to better reflect this.\n\nWe apologize for not making these points more clear in the paper.\n\n\"single-step models that are trained using multi-step prediction losses\": Yes, we agree that other models which directly minimize long-term prediction error will also produce better predictions that single-step models. However, the main goal of this work is to point out the deficiencies of the single-step class of models typically used in the field. As such, we simply chose one simple member of the class of multistep models to illustrate our point.\n\nWe have since run experiments to evaluate the potential of recurrent training of single-step models with multi-step loss functions. While using a multi-step loss provides significant improvement over a single-step loss, the PCP remains somewhat more accurate. We have updated Figure 5 and the related text with this result. \n\nWe furthermore have run these RNN models on the full bootstrapped planning task.

The proposed model maps from current state and a sequence of actions to the state after taking those actions. The paper demonstrates on 2 tasks that in a model-predictive control loop combined with planning by cross-entropy method, this can yield better asymptotic performance than using single-step models.\n\nThe insight of using multi-step prediction models is certainly appealing and makes a lot of sense in deterministic tasks. A systematic empirical comparison of multi-step deep models in RL is of interest, which this paper does provide to some extent.\n\nAn obvious limitation of the proposed deterministic multi-step forward model is the restriction to deterministic systems. One would expect that the performance deteriorates quickly as the system becomes more stochastic. An extension to the stochastic case along the lines of Chua et al, 2018 is non-trivial as capturing the stochasticity is typically more challenging in long-term predictions. Yet, the paper makes an additional assumption that is less clearly communicated: To be able to plan with a R-step model, one needs to be able to evaluate or approximate the sum of R rewards just from the first and last state in that R-long sequence. This work uses simply the reward at the end r(s_{t+R}) as a proxy which works well in these MuJoCo tasks but can fail horribly in others. One can imagine that a model not only outputs s_{t+R} but also the sum of R rewards given s_t and a_{t:t+R} which could work in more general settings but this is not explored in this paper. The contribution in this paper limited as the proposed approach as well as the experimental comparison is restricted to a relatively specific class of problems and no attempts to generalize are made.\n\nThe experiments nicely compare against using single-step dynamics models and the results show that using the multi-step models for MPC performs better in the two considered tasks. However, as fas as I understand both the ACP and Chua et al baseline using the single-step prediction accuracy to train their models. The paper is missing a comparison to single-step models that are trained using multi-step prediction losses (\"backprop through time\" as in Learning Nonlinear Dynamic Models by Langford et al 2009). These models should be much more robust to error blow-up for multi-step prediction and do not require the specific reward structure assumed in this paper.\n\nThe proposed R-step model-based RL approach could be connected to the use of options (the planner and model operate on R-step options, but the MPC does update the policy after every time step). It would be interesting to discuss this potential connection in the paper. The paper does a good job of discussing existing recent work in the deep RL literature but it would also be good to also discuss earlier work on multi-step prediction (e.g. in time-series modeling).\n\nAll in all, I think the paper makes a small contribution demonstrating that multi-step models are useful for model-based RL in specific domains -- which is interesting but certainly not surprising. Unfortunately the paper stops somewhat early by not comparing to relevant baselines (single-step models trained with multi-step losses) and by not considering tasks where the benefit of multi-step planning would be less clear.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper571/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Understanding the Asymptotic Performance of Model-Based RL Methods", "abstract": "In complex simulated environments, model-based reinforcement learning methods typically lag the asymptotic performance of model-free approaches.

The model is then used for standard model predictive control. The authors find numerically that their method, termed Plan-Conditional Predictor (PCP), performs better over long horizon times (~100 time steps), than other recent model-based and model-free algorithms. This because for long horizon time scales, the model predicting the state for the next time step accumulates error when used recursively.\n\nThe key idea is to use a model that directly predicts multiple time steps into the future. While seemingly an obvious extension, it does not appear to have been used in current algorithms. A main issue that I find with this approach is: since only the state after R steps is predicted, reward r(s_t,a_t) can only be used every R steps, not at every step. The authors gloss over this issue because for both MuJoCo environments that they tested, they only need to consider reward at the end of the planning horizon. Thus to make their algorithm generally applicable, the authors also need to show how or whether their method can deal with rewards that may appear at any time step.\n\nFurther, rather than speculate on the cause of the difference between their PCP and PETS (Chua et al 2018) on half-cheetah to be their different settings for CEM optimization (Fig 7b), the authors should just use the same settings to compare. Possibly the authors ran out of time to do this for the current submission, but should certainly do it for the final version.\n\nWhile the authors have already compared to other algorithms with similar aims, eg Chua et al 2018, they may also wish to compare to a recent preprint Clavera et al Sep 2018, which also aims to combine the sample efficiency of model-based methods while achieving the performance of model-free ones, by using an ensemble of models, over a 200 time step horizon. However, given the recency of this algorithm, I don't consider this essential.\n\nOverall, I feel that the authors idea of an R-step model is worth spreading in the community, if the above two main points are addressed.
