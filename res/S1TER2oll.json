The basic idea is that convolution should be applied to input feature dimensions that are highly correlated in order to detect rare events. For example, adjacent pixels in images are correlated and edges are rare events of interest to be detected. Authors argue that square filters are therefore appropriate in images. However, in data such as bird songs high correlations might exist between non-adjacent harmonics and a convolution filter should take a weighted summation over these input feature dimensions. Such an operation can thus be thought of computing data-dependent dilated convolutions.\n\nPaper theoretically motivates this choice using the idea of Gaussian complexity of the learner (i.e. a CNN in this case). The main idea being that choosing convolution filters that sum over correlated features results in lower Gaussian complexity and thus the learner has higher ability to generalize. While I am no expert in theoretical analysis of learning algorithms \u2013 there are parts of proof that look sound, but there are parts that are rather hand wavy (for eg, extension to networks using max-pooling from average pooling). Also, the theory is not directly applicable to choosing filters when number of layers are more than 1. I am willing to overlook the paucity in rigor in some parts of the theoretical arguments because the empirical evidence looks convincing. \n\nThe method of choosing the filter shape can be briefly summarized as:\n(a)\tThe covariance matrix of the input features is computed. \n(b)\tUsing the covariance matrix, feature dimensions with highest correlations are determined by solving equation (7). A hard limit on maximum number of filter dimensions is imposed (typically ~ 10-15).  This leads to choice of a single design for all filters in the layer. \n(c)\tAuthors extend the framework to work with multiple layers in the following way: A subset of feature dimensions cannot account for all variance in the inputs and there is some residual variance. The filter design of the next layer attempts to minimize this residual variance. This process is repeated iteratively by solving eq (8) to obtain filter designs for all the layers. \n\nIdeally for determining filter designs of different layers \u2013 one should have computed the covariance statistics of outputs of the previous layer. However this assumes that filters of the previous layer are already known and this is not computationally feasible to implement. Authors instead use the method described in (c).\nA question which comes to my mind is \u2013 a single feature design is chosen for each layer. Have the authors considered using the process in (c) to chose different filter designs for different filters in the same layer as opposed to using the same filter design for all the filters? \n\nRegarding baselines:\nB1. It would be great to see a comparison with randomly chosen filter designs. Two comparisons could be made \u2013 (1a) A single random design is chosen for each layer. (1b) The design of each filter is chosen randomly (i.e. allowing for different designs of filter within each layer). \n\nB2. Since the theory is not really applicable to CNNs with more that one layer \u2013 I wonder how much of the benefit is obtained by choosing the filter design just in a single layer v/s all the layers. A good comparison would be when filter design of the first layer are chosen using the described method and filters in higher layers are chosen to be square. \n\nB3. Authors mention the use L1 regularization in the baselines. Was the L1 penalty cross-validated? If so, then upto what range? \n\nSomethings which are unclear:\n-\t\u201cexclude data that represent obvious noise\u201d\n-\tDFMax mentioned in the supplementary materials\n\nOverall I think this is very interesting idea for filter design. The authors have done a fair set of experiments but I would really like to see results of B1, B2 and the answer to question in B3.  I have currently set my rating to a weak reject, but I am happy to raise my ratings to \u2013 \u201cGood paper, accept\u201d if the authors provide results of experiments and answers to questions in my comments above. \n\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "FILTER SHAPING FOR CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS", "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are powerful tools for classification of visual inputs.

Please see our responses below:\n\nA question which comes to my mind is \u2013 a single feature design is chosen for each layer. Have the authors considered using the process in (c) to chose different filter designs for different filters in the same layer as opposed to using the same filter design for all the filters? \nIn an ongoing journal extension to the paper we are trying to design different filter shapes within each layer. Specifically, we computed the correlation images from each audio file separately, clustered them, and derived different filter shapes from the center of each cluster. For the moment, this approach achieved 1% better validation accuracy than our proposed method on the bird song data.\n\nRegarding baselines:\nB1. It would be great to see a comparison with randomly chosen filter designs. Two comparisons could be made \u2013 (1a) A single random design is chosen for each layer. (1b) The design of each filter is chosen randomly (i.e. allowing for different designs of filter within each layer). \nThanks for the suggestion. We tried both (1a) and (1b) on the bird song data by randomly activating 9 locations within each 5x5 CNN filter, and perform 5-fold cross validation for each setting. For (1b) we tried two different random shapes of filters for each layer with equivalent number of filters for each shape. We repeated each setting 5 times. For (1a), the mean validation accuracy is 77.28%, and the standard deviation is 0.0094. For (1b), the mean validation accuracy is 77.22%, and the standard deviation is 0.0136. For comparison, our proposed method achieved 80.3% validation accuracy, and the 3x3 baseline achieved 75.0%.\n\nB2. Since the theory is not really applicable to CNNs with more that one layer \u2013 I wonder how much of the benefit is obtained by choosing the filter design just in a single layer v/s all the layers. A good comparison would be when filter design of the first layer are chosen using the described method and filters in higher layers are chosen to be square. \nWe tried to only customize the shape of first CNN layer and conduct 5 fold cross validation on winbeats data and bird song data, and achieved 65.8%(3x3 baseline: 66.9%, our approach: 71.1%), and 80.03% (3x3 baseline: 75.01%, our approach: 80.3%), respectively. Inspecting the filter shapes for the two datasets, we notice that the first layer filter for the Wingbeat data captures only local correlations, and the important global harmonic structure is only captured by later layers. As a result, only customizing the first layer leads to performance similar to the 3 x 3 baseline. In contrast, the vertical structure of the bird song data was well captured by the first layer, leading to a performance comparable to using customized filters for all layers.\n\nB3. Authors mention the use of L1 regularization in the baselines. Was the L1 penalty cross-validated? If so, then upto what range? \nYes, L1 penalty cross-validation was performed on the same splits. We tested some parameters and chose the best one by the time of submission, but didn't do a thorough swiping. Now we did a thorough swiping between 1e-3 and 1e-10. At 1e-3 the algorithm obviously didn\u2019t fit the training data so we didn\u2019t try larger parameter values. The best cross-validation accuracy of 75.6% on the bird song data (our approach: 80.3%, 3*3 baseline: 75.1%) was achieved when lambda equals 1e-7 or 1e-9. Plus, the best cross-validation accuracy of 68.4% on the wingbeats data (our approach: 71.1%, 3*3 baseline: 66.9%). We will revised them in our paper. \n\n\nB4, -\t\u201cexclude data that represent obvious noise\u201d\nPlease see our previous answers to reviewer 3.\n\nB5, -\tDFMax mentioned in the supplementary materials\nPlease see our previous answers to reviewer 3."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "FILTER SHAPING FOR CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS", "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are powerful tools for classification of visual inputs.

CNNs for images almost invariably feature small square filters (e.g. 3x3, 5x5, ...) and this paper provides an algorithm to optimise this aspect of the model architecture (which is often treated as fixed) based on data. It is argued that this is especially useful for data modalities where the assumption of locality breaks down, as in e.g. spectrograms, where correlations between harmonics are often relevant to the task at hand, but they are not local in frequency space.\n\nImproved performance is demonstrated on two tasks that are fairly non-standard, but I think that is fine given that the proposed approach probably isn't useful for the vast majority of popular benchmark datasets (e.g. MNIST, CIFAR-10), where the locality assumption holds and a square filter shape is probably close to optimal anyway. Fig. 1 is a nice demonstration of this.\n\nThe paper spends quite a bit of space on a theoretical argument for the proposed method based on Gaussian complexity, which is interesting but maybe doesn't warrant quite so much detail. In contrast, section 3.3 (about how to deal with pooling) is quite handwavy in comparison. This is probably fine but the level of detail in the preceding sections makes it a bit suspicious.\n\nI'm also not 100% convinced that the theoretical argument is particularly relevant, because it seems to rely on some assumptions that are clearly untrue for practical CNNs, such as 1-norm weight constraints and the fact that it is probably okay to swap out the L1 norm for the L2 norm.\n\nI would also like to see a bit more discussion about Fig. 4, especially about the fact that some of the filter shapes end up having many fewer nonzeros than the algorithm enforces (e.g. 3 nonzeros for layers 6 and 7, whereas the maximum is 13). Of course this is a perfectly valid outcome as the algorithm doesn't force the solution to have an exact number of nonzeros, but surely the authors will agree that it is a bit surprising/unintuitive? The same figure also features an interesting phase transition between layers 1-4 and 5-8, with the former 4 layers having very similar, almost circular/square filter shapes, and the later having very different, spread out shapes. Some comments about why this happens would be welcome.\n\nRegarding my question about computational performance, I still think that this warrants some discussion in the paper as well. For many new techniques, whether they end up being adopted mainly depends on the ratio between the amount of work that goes into implementing them, and the benefit they provide. I'm not convinced that the proposed approach is very practical. My intuition is that creating efficient implementations of various non-square convolutions for each new problem might end up not being worth the effort, but I could be wrong here.\n\n\nMinor comments:\n\n- please have the manuscript proofread for spelling and grammar.\n\n- there is a bit of repetition in sections 2 and 3, e.g. the last paragraphs of sections 2.1 and 2.2 basically say the same thing, it would be good to consolidate this. \n\n- a few things mentioned in the paper that were unclear to me (\"syllables\", \"exclude data that represent obvious noise\", choice of \"max nonzero elements\" parameter) have already been adequately addressed by the authors in their response to my questions, but it would be good to include these answers in the manuscript as well.\n\n- the comparison in Fig. 5 with L1 regularisation on the filter weights does not seem entirely fair, since the resulting shape would have to be encompassed in a 5x5 window whereas Fig. 4 shows that the filter shapes found by the algorithm often extend beyond that. I appreciate that training nets with very large square filters is problematic in many ways, but the claim \"L1 regularization cannot achieve the same effect as filter shaping\" is not really convincingly backed up by this experiment.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "FILTER SHAPING FOR CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS", "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are powerful tools for classification of visual inputs.

Or is it that this method basically finds spatial clusters in the input data? (E.g. to perform pattern matching) \nYour intuition is in line with Theorem 2 in the paper. Theorem 2 says that if more correlated values are chosen in each convolutional filter, the upper bound on Gaussian complexity would be smaller -- which intuitively means less complex hypothesis space (hence less discriminative power). However, machine learning theory tells us that the less complex the hypothesis space is, the better out-of-sample generalization we can expect (e.g. [Bartlett and Mendelson 2002] Lemma 4, Theorem 7). On the extreme end, if one chooses a hypothesis space so that there exists a function that would always be able to assign any list of binary labels to any training set, it has maximal Gaussian complexity and no out-of-sample generalization capability at all.\n\n\n2, How would this compare to other unsupervised methods, such as PCA Net? [1]\nPCANet is a different approach in that it tries to sample local patches and compute PCA directions from the patches as the convolutional filters. It would not be able to capture non-local dependencies, such as the harmonic structures as in this paper, unless a very large patch size is used. However, conventional deep learning wisdom tells us larger filters usually lead to suboptimal performance.\n\n\n3, Even though the method is unsupervised, have you tried to find the filter shapes only on the training set in the cross validation?

This aspect is not really touched upon at all, so I was wondering if the authors could comment on this. Of course it matters less for small datasets, but if I have a given computational budget and this is much slower, I might simply opt to stick with square filters and make the network bigger. That's quite likely to improve performance as well (although admittedly it might require additional regularisation).\nFirst, our approach wouldn\u2019t hinder parallel algorithms such as Winograd, since the basic principles of convolution is still there. The principle that Winograd uses, such as saving multiplications using re-parameterizations of convolutions, are still applicable. Admittedly it wouldn\u2019t be as straightforward to develop as a fixed square filter, but given a useful shape a particular Winograd scheme can be either hand-developed or automatically developed (which could be interesting future research). There may be some potential memory performance hit due to non-sequential access of the memory in a customized filter, but we believe it\u2019s relatively minor when a large enough patch is prefetched to the cache.\n\nSecond, making the network bigger does not necessarily increase the performance, especially in small sample settings. For all the baselines in the paper we reported the optimal network sizes. Performance is generally the same or slightly worse with bigger networks. Even on large datasets, \u201cthe more the better\u201d does not hold in terms of performance see e.g. Chatfield et al. Return of the Devil in the Details: Delving Deep into Convolutional Nets. BMVC 2014.\n\n2, top (Section 1): \"global filters could capture the relationships between different harmonics and syllables\", what is meant here by \"syllables\"?\nEach syllable indicated a single utterance of a bird. We have added it to our paper.\n\n3. bottom (Section 2.1): \"We also exclude data that represent obvious noise in the computation, such as background white noise in the spectrogram data\", this is quite vague and raises several questions: how is this data excluded? How is it selected, by hand or with an automated criterion? What types of noise qualify as \"obvious\"?\nFor each pixel in the spectrogram,  we calculate its power ratio in decibels (db). When calculating correlation between a pair of pixels, if any pixel has the power ratio that is less than 50 db,  we will skip this pair. Based on U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,  suburban areas usually experience approximately 45-50 dB background noise level. Please refer the link http://www.noisequest.psu.edu/noisebasics-basics.html for more details. Noise level may vary between different locations, it is also a good practice to analyze the noise level based the knowledge of acoustic engineering.\n\n4. p.7, top (Section 6.1): \"We set the max nonzero elements to 13 for wingbeat data, 9 for the bird-song data and the gene sequencing data.\", how where these numbers determined? This seems like a pretty important hyperparameter that should probably be cross-validated. Also, given these maxima, why does the algorithm end up selecting patterns with only 3 nonzero elements for layers 6 and 7 (in Figure 4)? This seems quite counter-intuitive and warrants some discussion in the paper.\nDFmax is an upper limit on the non-zero elements in the LASSO solution. The actual solution often has fewer non-zero elements. For all datasets, we selected the DFmax values from 9, 11 and 13, and picked the smallest value that allowed for non-degenerate filters across all layers. For example, DFmax=11 for the wingbeat data produced a 1 by 1 filter at the sixth layer. A stability test for a wider range of DFmax values (3-15) was conducted and the result was shown in Figure 10 in the appendix. \n\nThe solutions came from LASSO depending on the several variant terms, we can only limit the max number of nonzero solutions.  The smaller value of DFmax tend to make the shape of resultant filters smaller. That is why we tend to set it as 13. 13 is not a magic number and we have conducted stability test for a wide range of DFmax as shown in the appendix.\n\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "FILTER SHAPING FOR CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS", "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are powerful tools for classification of visual inputs.
