The novelty is the extension to a new distribution: multinomial logistic-normal distribution. This is achieved by using the Isometric log-ratio (ILR) transform. While prior results were derived analytically, this paper provides (only) empirical evidence for the claim regarding the multinomial logistic-normal distribution. \n\nOverall, I don\u2019t find that the provided experiments provide convincing support of  the claim of the paper, namely that VAEs are able to learn the principle components for the multinomial logistic-normal distribution.\n\nWhile the proposed approach yields better results than alternative approaches in Figure 1, it is not clear to me why the shown results indicate that the VAE was actually able to learn the principal components: based on my understanding of the used metrics (for instance,  axis-alignment of 0 indicates perfect results, and 1 is the worst): the proposed approach achieves 0.8 on 200 dimension and 0.95 on 1000 dimensions. When a deeper model is used in Figure 1, the metrics go down, which is good, but they still stay above 0.5, i.e., far away from 0. Based on my understanding of the used metrics, I am not sure why this would provide empirical support of  the claim in this paper that the principal components can be recovered. \n\nIn the definition of axis alignment in the appendix, it seems like the enumerator is missing a square, compared to the original definition in the referenced paper [14].\n\nThe authors also claim that Figure 2 shows that the learned embedding dimensions are orthogonal to each other. While I can believe this in the right plot, I am not convinced by the left plot, where a different scaling is used (as mentioned by the authors), and hence the diagonal does not seem so much larger than the off-diagonals to me.\n\nThe paper also proposes a batch-correction as additional improvement, but Table 1 shows that it makes results  actually worse. \n\nApart from that, Table 1 would also benefit from adding some state-of-the-art baseline models, e.g., as discussed in the related works section. Simply applying KNN to the raw counts seems like a very basic baseline.\n\nApart from that, the writing of the paper could be improved a lot.  I found it very confusing to come across references to Figure 5 etc,  and then not finding them in the paper ... eventually I realized that they were in a separate supplement. This could be made clearer in the paper. Moreover, there are also several typos in the paper (e.g., \u201cthethe\u201d), and some grammatically incorrect sentences. Also,  in the related works section, the authors refer to work by  \u201cLuca et al\u201d without a citation--does it  refer to Lucas (with an s) [4] ?\n\t\t\n++++ updates after discussion period ++++\n\nWhile the initial paper provided empirical evidence  for the claims of the paper, based on the reviews an appendix of about 9 pages was added in the revised version, and the focus now seems on providing theoretical support of the claims in the paper. Also several experimental results were added in the main paper in response to the reviews. I feel like all these (quite major) changes indicate that this paper is not mature enough for publication at this point.

As a result, these two methods are very different, yielding completely different interpretations.  That being said, we are able to benchmark their representations in the classification benchmark (see Table 1). \n\nThe Multinomial PCA and Correlated topic models are quite different models.  If applied to documents, Multinomial PCA would infer word-word co-occurrences from the covariance matrix, whereas Correlated Topic models utilizes the covariance matrix to infer topic covariances.  It is possible to force a Correlated Topic model to fit the structure described in our paper, but it would require there to be an equal number of topics as words, and each topic only assigned to 1 word.  This is an edge case that cannot be handled with the current software packages.\n\nThe innovation here is that we have provided a means to enable Multinomial PCA at scale, and have shown this model has stronger explanatory power than LDA in terms of held-out predictive log-likelihood and classification accuracy.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2642/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2642/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Inferring Principal Components in the Simplex with Multinomial Variational Autoencoders", "authorids": ["~James_Morton1", "jsilve24@gmail.com", "gleb.tikhonov@aalto.fi", "~Harri_L\u00e4hdesm\u00e4ki1", "rbonneau@flatironinstitute.org"], "authors": ["James Morton", "Justin Silverman", "Gleb Tikhonov", "Harri L\u00e4hdesm\u00e4ki", "Rich Bonneau"], "keywords": ["Multinomial variational autoencoders", "variational autoencoders", "ILR transform", "compositional PCA", "probabilistic PCA", "multinomial logistic normal"], "abstract": "Covariance estimation on high-dimensional data is a central challenge across multiple scientific disciplines.

They show that similar work on PPCA are limited to Gaussian data, and non-easily applicable to bag-of-words. Analysis on real-world biomedical data sets are promising.\n\n### Reasons for score\nI fail to grasps the novelty with respect to the state of the art. The authors cite numerous of similar works, such as mixture modelling (LDA). The authors mention that such techniques rely on Dirichlet distributions, but that is not always the case (such as in [1] and [2]), where they show it can be approximated with a Logistic Normal. It seems such models can be used in the applications mentioned by the authors. However, since there are no comparison in the paper, I fail to understand the benefit of one with respect to the others.\n\n### Pros\n- ILR transform to deal with identifiability of softmax\n- Analysis on synthetic and real data sets\n\n### Cons\n- Technical details can be improved. For example, it is not straightforward to understand what the encoder / decoder parameters refer to (is the type of activation functions at each layer? dimension of layers? number of layers?) \n- There is no comparison with mixture models that infer covariance matrices (like [1] and [2]).

The authors claim that existing solutions are not scalable. The paper is clearly written with a few minor typos. I have 2 complaints: \n1) The benchmarking analysis reports only relative performance across other VAEs. There are no other methods even considered and it would be nice to have some sense of what a \"good\" result looks like in an absolute sense (eg. what's a good score on subspace distance for 200 or 1000 input dimension problem? What would you get if you didn't use the VAE approach?).  \n2) Could the authors comment more on the scalability problems they are talking about? There appear to be a number of scalable PCA techniques available where the full covariance matrix need not be formed and decomposed in memory. Would none of those approaches  be adaptable the their problem?\n\n## minor note\nThe authors mention a few papers where MCMC was proposed as a means to obtain a posterior over the latent variables but these ventures were dismissed as suffering from the curse of dimensionality (or something to the effect of that argument). One outstanding oversight to this collection of papers is [Linderman et al.](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5660-dependent-multinomial-models-made-easy-stick-breaking-with-the-polya-gamma-augmentation) wherein the stick-breaking construction of the multinomial is coupled with Polya-gamma augmentation to offer a highly efficient sampling procedure for precisely the model the authors are proposing.

It relies on recent techniques such as connection between VAE and PPCA, ILR transformation, and presents an augmented VAE to obtain MAP estimates on multinomially distributed data. Such setting has direct application potential in many bioinformatics problems. The methodology is quite dense which reads look to me (though not in every detail). \n\nThe only chance it gets rejected is its relatively narrow audience group in ICLR. \n\n1. the notation can be improved to fit community convention: say P(z|\\theta, x), it's better to read P(z|x; \\theta) since \\theta are only parameters, not the target random variable.\n2. Clarity can be improved on the part elaborating Algorithm 1, to clarify conclusive statements, eg justification on complexity, and put aside technical details. Readers may have confusions on how ILR transformation is used here: maybe Section 4.2 can hint on the exact use case and the part after Algorithm 1 can be better organized.\n3. Experiments part should have more clear intro on machine learning abstracted versions of the problems, which better fit general audience in ICLR.\n4. Some minor typos, eg Section 4.1 Equation (2) should be I_{d-1} instead of I_d.\n\nHope this paper gets attention and wide adoptions on related biological applications.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2642/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2642/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Inferring Principal Components in the Simplex with Multinomial Variational Autoencoders", "authorids": ["~James_Morton1", "jsilve24@gmail.com", "gleb.tikhonov@aalto.fi", "~Harri_L\u00e4hdesm\u00e4ki1", "rbonneau@flatironinstitute.org"], "authors": ["James Morton", "Justin Silverman", "Gleb Tikhonov", "Harri L\u00e4hdesm\u00e4ki", "Rich Bonneau"], "keywords": ["Multinomial variational autoencoders", "variational autoencoders", "ILR transform", "compositional PCA", "probabilistic PCA", "multinomial logistic normal"], "abstract": "Covariance estimation on high-dimensional data is a central challenge across multiple scientific disciplines. Sparse high-dimensional count data, frequently encountered in biological applications such as DNA sequencing and proteomics, are often well modeled using multinomial logistic normal models.  In many cases, these datasets are also compositional, presented item-wise as fractions of a normalized total, due to measurement and instrument constraints. In compositional settings, three key factors limit the ability of these models to estimate covariance: (1) the computational complexity of inverting high-dimensional covariance matrices, (2) the non-exchangeability introduced from the summation constraint on multinomial parameters, and (3) the irreducibility of the component multinomial logistic normal distribution that necessitates the use of parameter augmentation, or similar techniques, during inference.
