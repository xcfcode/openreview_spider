E.g., authors described that the engine ignores the binary operations that could not be executed at the time. But in my thought, such operations should not be included in the set of candidate operations, i.e., the set of candidates should be constrained directly by the state of the stack.\nAlso, including repeating \"identity\" operations (in the candidates of attention operations) seems that some unnecessary redundancy is introduced into the search space. The same expressiveness could be achieved by predicting a special token only once at the end of the sequence (namely, \"end-of-sequence\" token as just same as usual auto-regressive RNN-based decoder models).\n\nComparison in experiments looks meaningless. Score improvement is slight nevertheless authors paid much computation cost for searching accurate network structures. The conventional method (Zoph&Le,17) in row 3 of Table 1 looks not comparable with proposed methods because it is trained by an out-of-domain task (LM) using conventional (tree-based) search space. Authors should at least show the result by applying the conventional search space to the tasks of this paper.\nIn Table 2, the \"our baseline\" looks cheap because the dot product is the least attention model in those proposed in past studies.\n\nThe catastrophic score drop in the rows 5 and 7 in Table 1 looks interesting, but the paper does not show enough comprehension about this phenomenon, which makes the proposed method hard to apply other tasks.\nThe same problem exists in the setting of the hyperparameters in the reward functions. According to the footnote, there are largely different settings about the value of \\beta, which suggest a sensitivity by changing this parameter. Authors should provide some criterion to choose these hyperparameters.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "EXPLORING NEURAL ARCHITECTURE SEARCH FOR LANGUAGE TASKS", "abstract": "Neural architecture search (NAS), the task of finding neural architectures automatically, has recently emerged as a promising approach for unveiling better models over human-designed ones.

According to the latest leaderboard [2], their baseline model, BiDAF from a year ago, is ranked 34th, and their improved model would be 24th (the same as the new BiDAF simple baseline, and 5.4 F1 points below SOTA). Perhaps you should include some more results here to more accurately represent your findings.\n\nCan you give a meaningful comparison of the compute for your NAS versus the amount used for the GNMT baseline? All I see is a mention of using 100-200 GPUs for some unspecified period of time. If you're using more compute than GNMT, can you take that into account for that to produce a meaningful comparison?\n\n[1] https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByJHuTgA-\n[2] https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "EXPLORING NEURAL ARCHITECTURE SEARCH FOR LANGUAGE TASKS", "abstract": "Neural architecture search (NAS), the task of finding neural architectures automatically, has recently emerged as a promising approach for unveiling better models over human-designed ones.
