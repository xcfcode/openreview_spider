A projected sub-gradient descent algorithm is used. The UPS optimizer by itself is not new.\n\nGraph Polynomial Signal (GPS) neural network is proposed to address two shortcomings of GSP using linear polynomial graph filter. First, a nonlinear function sigma in (8) is used, and second, weights are shared among neighbors of every data points. There are some concerns about this network that need to be clarified:\n1. sigma is never clarified in the main context or experiments\n2. the shared weights should be relevant to the ordering of neighbors, instead of the set of neighbors without ordering, in which case, the sharing looks random.\n3. another explanation about the weights as the rescaling to matrix A needs to further clarified. As authors mentioned that the magnitude of |A| from L1 norm might be detrimental for the prediction. What is the disagreement between L1 penalty and prediction quality? Why not apply these weights to L1 norm as a weighted L1 norm to control the scaling of A?\n4. Authors stated that the last step is to build a mapping from the GPS features into the response Y. They mentioned that linear fully connected layer or a more complex neural network can be build on top of the GPS features. However, no detailed information is given in the paper. In the experiments, authors only stated that \u201cwe fit the GPS architecture using UPS optimizer for varying degree of the neighborhood of the graph\u201d, and then the graph is used to train existing models as the input of the graph. Which architecture is used for building the mapping ?\n\nIn the experimental results, detailed definition or explanation of the compared methods and different settings should be clarified. For example, what is GPS 8, GCN_2 Eq. 9 in Table 1, and GCN_3 9 and GPS_1, GPS_2, GPS_3 and so on.

Individual responses are provided as comments to your reviews. Unfortunately, we have not yet finished the revision of the manuscript as we are working on a more methodological way to assess the role of the input graph in the cases of ChebNet and ConvNet. In the case of 20news groups data, we have experimented with different node degree distributions for generating a random graph (at fixed sparsity level). Additionally, we considered an extreme case of a graph with a randomly chosen subset of vertices forming a fully connected component, while all other vertices are mutually disconnected. We observed that non of that (even the extreme scenario) altered the behavior of neither ChebNet nor ConvNet. This can be explained by the usage of too many learnable parameters in the ChebNet and ConvNet architectures, making it possible for them to adjust to any input graph in high-dimensional setting. We are currently working on exploring a lower dimensional scenario via simulation experiments. GPS architecture (with a fixed graph) performed noticeably worse in the extreme scenario of random graph generation.

Below are the answers to some of your question\n\n--> 1. sigma is never clarified in the main context or experiments\n\nSigma is a ReLU in our experiments.\n\n--> 2. the shared weights should be relevant to the ordering of neighbors, instead of the set of neighbors without ordering, in which case, the sharing looks random.\n\nOrdering of neighbors is fixed to be in alignment with the order of vertices in the graph adjacency matrix. Computationally, this is easily achievable by taking the inner product of a row of a graph adjacency matrix and a weight vector (weight vector is shared across rows).\n\n--> 3. another explanation about the weights as the rescaling to matrix A needs to further clarified. As authors mentioned that the magnitude of |A| from L1 norm might be detrimental for the prediction. What is the disagreement between L1 penalty and prediction quality? Why not apply these weights to L1 norm as a weighted L1 norm to control the scaling of A?\n\nL1 penalty acts as a regularizer, so the optimization approach will favor a sparser graph at a cost of sacrificing some of the performance. Same phenomena is observed in linear regression - coefficients learned with LASSO penalty are biased and refitting the regression with only selected variables generally improves the predictive performance. If we apply weights to the L1 norm of the graph adjacency and try to optimize for these weights, it will blow up the objective function (\"optimal\" weights will go to minus infinity).\n\n--> 4. Authors stated that the last step is to build a mapping from the GPS features into the response Y. They mentioned that linear fully connected layer or a more complex neural network can be build on top of the GPS features. However, no detailed information is given in the paper. In the experiments, authors only stated that \u201cwe fit the GPS architecture using UPS optimizer for varying degree of the neighborhood of the graph\u201d, and then the graph is used to train existing models as the input of the graph. Which architecture is used for building the mapping ?\n\nWe used linear mapping from GPS features to Y in the experiments.\n\n--> In the experimental results, detailed definition or explanation of the compared methods and different settings should be clarified. For example, what is GPS 8, GCN_2 Eq. 9 in Table 1, and GCN_3 9 and GPS_1, GPS_2, GPS_3 and so on. More explanations of Figure 2 and the visualization method can be great helpful to understand the advantages of the proposed algorithm.\n\nIn GPS 8 and GCN 9, 8 and 9 are the corresponding equation references. Subscript numbers correspond to the number of layers for the GCN and maximum degree of the adjacency matrix polynomial for the GPS.
