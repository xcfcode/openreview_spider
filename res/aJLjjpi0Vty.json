It seems to me that the authors tried to model user preferences with smooth functions for collaborative filtering and results on two Movielens datasets showed that the proposed method is comparable to several baseline methods. \n\nPros:\n1.\tThe idea of capturing frequency domain information for collaborative filtering seems interesting to me, although I did not quite understand how this information is obtained in this work.\n2.\tThe authors mentioned that their method can be interpretable, which may be more interesting if they can provide some case studies for explaining recommendations using the proposed method.\n\nCons:\n1.\tThe motivation is not clear to me, i.e., why smooth functions are important in modelling user preferences in collaborative filtering is not well explained. \n2.\tThe authors seem to have a narrow understanding of collaborative filtering. For instance, the authors mentioned that \u201cthe utilization of deep architectures is limited to shallow networks\u201d in exiting CF literature. However, there are a lot of recent works building upon state-of-the-art deep learning techniques as far as I know. \n3.\tThe idea of this paper is very similar to a recent work (Harald Steck, Embarrassingly Shallow Autoencoders for Sparse Data, WWW \u201919). The main difference may be that this work adopted clustering of users instead of individual user when modelling user interests.\n4.\tThe experimental results are not encouraging. The proposed method is actually much worse than Bayesian TimeSVD++ (Rendle et al., 2019) and IGMC (Zhang & Chen, 2019). So, it is hard to understand why this alternative method is promising in the area.\n5.\tThe presentation could be improved.

The paper\u2019s scope (\u201csmooth reconstruction functions\u201d) gets immediately narrowed down to Fourier transforms--it would be nice to provide some motivation for this choice over alternative smooth functions. The paper then clusters the users as a way to reduce the number of parameters in the model, given that the Fourier transform itself does not reduce it. As a further step, the clustering is replaced by a soft-clustering learned by a neural network. In the experiments, the RMSE of the rating prediction problem is worse than some baselines and better than others. \n\nBesides these technical steps, from a more big-picture perspective, I am not sure if the problem of rating prediction as cast in this paper, misses a key point. The key point I am concerned about is that the observed ratings are missing not at random [a]. For this reason, the collaborative-filtering literature abandoned the minimization of RMSE on the OBSERVED ratings ten years ago. Two different avenues have been pursued since then: most of the papers switched to ranking the entire catalog of items, e.g, see [b] to get started. A few papers continued with rating prediction, but stated the problem correctly by taking into account the fact that the ratings are missing not at random, eg., [c,d].\n\nIn this submission, the problem statement at the top of page 4, and Eq. 6, was not clear to me: while s was defined clearly in the Fourier transform earlier in the paper,  I did not find a definition of s_u in Eq 6 in the context of rating prediction, i.e., is this the vector of ratings of user u? Only the observed ratings? How are the unobserved/missing ratings of user u treated in the proposed approach? \n\nGiven the RMSE-values in the experiments, my best guess is that the model was trained on the observed ratings only, ignoring the key problem that the ratings are missing not at random. \n\nI feel like a rating-prediction paper that ignores the key problem of collaborative filtering, i.e., the fact that ratings are missing not at random cannot be accepted (and should actually be desk-rejected). \n\nI encourage the authors to modify the approach to account for this key problem of collaborative filtering. Alternatively, this approach may be useful for different applications, like compressive sensing problems where the observations are truly random.\n\n[a] Collaborative Prediction and Ranking with Non-Random Missing Data\nby B.

They proposed two approaches for smoothly reconstructing the preference function of users and conducted experiments on both a synthetic dataset and two benchmark datasets (ml-100k and ml-1m). However, there are still some technical issues in this article, such as unconvincing experiments and confusing descriptions. As a result, I suggest the paper should be rejected.\n\nDetailed Comments\uff1a\n\nWith respect to the problem of rating predictions in collaborative filtering, this work proposed to estimate the predictions by assuming an underlying smooth preference function for each user, the quantization at each given vector yields the associated rating. Then, they developed two methods including k-representation motivated by k-means and reconst-net, a feed-forward neural network, to do this. The authors also conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets (ml-100k and ml-1m) to test the performance of proposed algorithms.\n\nThe key strengths:\n- The perspective of reconstructing the user preference functions is novel.\n- They proposed two effective methods to estimate the preference functions.\n- An alternating optimization method is proposed that effectively optimizes a non-convex loss function and extracts user and item representations.\n\nReason to Reject: \n\n- The contribution of \u201cthe reconstruction of user preference functions\u201d is overclaimed. Much literature in the area of CF regards the rating prediction problem as a reconstruction problem, such as Matrix Factorization (MF) based algorithms [1,2]. The authors should include these methods and elaborate on the difference between them.\n- In the introduction, the authors pointed out that the contemporary deep network in RS is merely limited to shallow networks and they addressed this problem in this work. However, the reconst-net only involves three trainable layers. It is not clear how do you solve the \u201cshallow\u201d problem?\n- The experiments are not convincing. The authors claimed that \u201ctheir performance on benchmark datasets is remarkable\u201d, but in experiments, we see that the performance of the proposed model is not competitive, e.g., the performance gap on ml-1m is about 5%. In addition, the authors did not dive into these results and analyze them. They should also include some MF-based methods for rating prediction problem, such as [1,2]\n- Many details and explanations are missing and confusing. For example, the intuitions of figure 1 and figure 2 are not clear, and the authors should give more explanations with respect to these figures.

In this paper, we consider a mapping of the items into a vector space and study the prediction problem by assuming an underlying smooth preference function for each user, the quantization at each given vector yields the associated rating. To estimate the preference functions, we implicitly cluster the users with similar ratings to form dominant types. Next, we associate each dominant type with a smooth preference function; i.e., the function values for items with nearby vectors shall be close to each other. \nThe latter is accomplished by a rich representation learning in a so-called frequency domain. In this framework, we propose two approaches for learning user and item representations. First, we use an alternating optimization method in the spirit of $k$-means to cluster users and map items. We further make this approach less prone to overfitting by a boosting technique. \nSecond, we present a feedforward neural network architecture consisting of interpretable layers which implicitely clusters the users. The performance of the method is evaluated on two benchmark datasets (ML-100k and ML-1M).
