We have adjusted our wording to emphasize ``efficiency\u2019\u2019 rather than ``scalable to large-scale datasets\u2019\u2019,  . This is moved this argument to the \u201cLearning To Rank\u201d section for clarity (\u201cFurthermore, compared to methods...\u201d).\n\nQ: On \u201cfolding-in\u201d for fast inference on new users: \nA: Thank you, we were unaware of this procedure at the time of writing. \nWe have adjusted the \u201cAdvantages of VAEs\u201d section to focus on that VAEs has the two advantages *simultaneously*: (1) expressive representation power as a non-linear model; (2) the number of parameters being independent of the number of users. Not all MF methods has both advantages simultaneously.\n\nQ: On claims of SoTA: \nA: While the survey \u201cA worrying analysis of Recent Neural Recommendation Approaches\u201d does reference these baselines, it\u2019s worth noting that MultiVAE and MultiDAE are reported as exceptions to this trend of poor performance and reproducibility in deep recommender systems. However, we agree that there are strong methods which we do not compare to, and have changed many of the comparative statements to reflect that \u201cRaCT improves strong baselines, rather than achieving SoTA\u201d.\n\nThanks for pointing out the papers on SVD and others. This is very informative.  We are glad to cite all of them.  In the revision,  we have added (1) a paragraph at the end of the main paper to discuss this; (2) the connection on the importance of user behavior statistics in our critic model to the scaling trick in SVD [Nikolakopoulos 2019].\n\nQ: On the limitation of LVMs: \nA: We clarify that we view increasing the expressivity of LVMs as an important direction of research, although \u201cNeural Collaborative Filtering\u201d is not necessarily an excellent example of this. Therefore, we have reworded our first introductory paragraph to focus on the motivation for applying more expressive models as opposed to making specific performance claims.\n\n\n\u201cOther comments\u201d\n1) We agree that with a sparse similarity matrix inference can be drastically sped up. However, we are mainly addressing the superior performance of EASE on certain large datasets, which learns a dense representation of the similarity matrix. We have revised this statement for clarity: ``EASE requires to compute a dense item-to-item similarity matrix, making its inference on MSD roughly 30 times more expensive than for VAE or RaCT.\u2019\u2019\n2) Fixed, thank you.\n3) Thanks for pointing out the connections to two-level methods and MAB. In the revision, we add a brief discussion in the related work section: ``The proposed actor-critic method belongs to the general two-level architectures for recommendation systems, where a coarse to fine prediction procedure is used.\u2019\u2019\n4) Fixed, thank you.\n5) We re-ran the experiments for both VAE and RaCT on the ml-20m dataset with 5 random seeds and found they are both very stable -- the standard deviation of test-set NDCG is roughly 0.0005 for both methods.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1058/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1058/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "RaCT: Toward Amortized Ranking-Critical Training For Collaborative Filtering ", "authors": ["Sam Lobel*", "Chunyuan Li*", "Jianfeng Gao", "Lawrence Carin"], "authorids": ["samuel_lobel@brown.edu", "chunyuan.li@microsoft.com", "jfgao@microsoft.com", "lcarin@duke.edu"], "keywords": ["Collaborative Filtering", "Recommender Systems", "Actor-Critic", "Learned Metrics"], "TL;DR": "We apply the actor-critic methodology from reinforcement learning to collaborative filtering, resulting in improved performance across a variety of latent-variable models", "abstract": "We investigate new methods for training collaborative filtering models based on actor-critic reinforcement learning, to more directly maximize ranking-based objective functions.

First, we apologize for the confusing example of NLL vs NDCG \u2014 we have updated the PDF to improve clarity. We replaced the figure with an example that demonstrates NLL assigning a better score to imperfectly-ranked items than to perfectly-ranked ones. In contrast, the ranking-based metrics such as NDCG aligns well with the scoring of items.\n\nGradient estimation in REINFORCE usually requires a sufficiently large number of samples from the action space, which in our case is a continuous 10K-dimensional distribution. This requires a prohibitively high number of samples to make a reliable gradient update.  Please see the \u201cDiscussion and Related Work\u201d section of [*] for good exposition of this point. In contrast, the proposed RaCT is inspired by actor-critic, a well-trained critic can circumvent the high variance problem, by learning an explicit relationship between NDCG and item-score, We have updated the citation in our paper to reflect this more informative source.\n\n[*] Silver, David, et al. \"Deterministic policy gradient algorithms.\" 2014.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1058/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1058/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "RaCT: Toward Amortized Ranking-Critical Training For Collaborative Filtering ", "authors": ["Sam Lobel*", "Chunyuan Li*", "Jianfeng Gao", "Lawrence Carin"], "authorids": ["samuel_lobel@brown.edu", "chunyuan.li@microsoft.com", "jfgao@microsoft.com", "lcarin@duke.edu"], "keywords": ["Collaborative Filtering", "Recommender Systems", "Actor-Critic", "Learned Metrics"], "TL;DR": "We apply the actor-critic methodology from reinforcement learning to collaborative filtering, resulting in improved performance across a variety of latent-variable models", "abstract": "We investigate new methods for training collaborative filtering models based on actor-critic reinforcement learning, to more directly maximize ranking-based objective functions.

The core of this solution is the actor-critic approach, where the critic (motivated by ideas from RL) tries to directly approximate a ranking-based metric using as an input prediction from the actor (VAE framework) and the ground truth knowledge from an Oracle. Both actor and critic require a pre-training step, after which the critic is set to propagate adjustments to actor parameters. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of such approach over competing methods.\n\nThe work presents an interesting idea of feature-based critic for learning a better ranking. The choice of features is surprisingly effective considering how simple they are \u2013 just basic statistics. On the other hand, the motivating example with NLL vs NDCG is not convincing. Comparing to much simpler linear SOTA methods, the improvement over multinomial VAE is not impressive. This is probably due to VAE being not a real SOTA in the first place, however other possible candidates for actor were not demonstrated. Anyway, I believe that this is an important direction for research and can be considered for acceptance if the authors adjust the text according to the comments below. \n\nMain arguments\nThe text is well structured, easy to read. Key concepts are explained carefully with the appropriate level of details. Open-source repository with the source code is definitely a plus. However, there\u2019s a number of inaccuracies, which should be addressed.\n\nIn the example demonstrating VAE's pitfalls, it is stated that prediction A is intuitively better than prediction B. I\u2019d argue with that intuition. For me, B looks more consistent as there\u2019s a smaller gap between predictions for positive targets. In A one of the predictions is much lower, whcih seems more like an outlier. Moreover, shouldn\u2019t NDCG be 1 in both cases? The ordering of positive examples is the same in both cases. Please, consider addiing more explanations to clarify your intuition or replace the example with something less contradicting. \n\nThe  statement \u201cmaking RaCT scalable to large-scale datasets\u201d is arguable from the technical viewpoint. As far as I know, there\u2019s still no good support for sparse calculations in NN frameworks. When you take user mini batch you have to convert it to a dense matrix with explicitly stored zeros. It\u2019s not a problem for the datasets tested in the paper (with <100K items). However, consider 100M items. What will be the size of user batch that will fit GPU memory? Will it be still large enough and effective from the learning viewpoint (smaller batches are likely to reduce generalization)? As it will mostly contain zeroes (few know interactions vs ~100M unknown), efficiency of calculations with this batch will also be low comparing to operations in sparse format. In that sense the datasets used in the paper are not really large scale.\nAnother false statement: \u201cThis is much more ef\ufb01cient than most traditional latent factor collaborative \ufb01ltering models \u2026, where a time-consuming optimization procedure is typically performed to obtain the latent factor for a user who is not present in the training data\u201d. All factorization models admit folding-in procedure, which doesn\u2019t depend on the size of the problem (i.e., the number of users or items) and depends only on the rank of decomposition (the number of latent variables). This is among the reasons why MF is so popular in industrial applications.\n\nFurthermore, SVD-based models (I\u2019m talking about the real SVD, not MF models like SVD++) are absolute winners here as they do not even require running any additional optimization steps. Due to the orthogonality property, the solution for folding-in has an analytical form in the case of SVD, e.g., given a low-rank item embeddings matrix V with orthonormal columns, the folding-in solution (vector of predicted item scores for a user) is simply given by an orthogonal projector\nr = VV^T p,\nfor any vector of user preferences p, be it a known user or a new one (i.e., not present in the training data). It is basically a simple encoder-decoder architecture with a single linear layer. Training SVD-based models can also very efficient and can be scaled to almost billion-size problems, e.g. https://github.com/criteo/Spark-RSVD. Moreover, one can significantly improve standard PureSVD model [Cremonesi, Koren, Turrin 2010] by a simple scaling trick as it is shown in the EigenRec model [Nikolakopoulos 2019], you can also see more details on this in the blog https://www.eigentheories.com/blog/to-svd-or-not-to-svd. I also find it interesting that the scaling trick in SVD partially intersects with the idea of importance of user behavior statistics in the critic model,  as it also depends on how many clicks a user has made.\n\nI ran my own experiments with VAE and SVD in google colab (I can provide a link to the notebook if needed). With a proper tuning the SVD-based solution gives NDCG=0.415, which is within 3% difference of the Mult-VAE\u2019s best result on the ML-20M dataset. It takes around 200s to train the SVD model of rank 600 on the CPU in the google colab. For comparison, one epoch of VAE training takes 26s in the same google colab environment (which I believe is using Tesla K80 GPU). The same NDCG level is achieved by Mult-VAE after approximately 20 epochs, which amounts to more than 500s of training time, twice longer than SVD. Speaking about practicality, even a student will have a decent CPU nowadays, but not everyone will have Tesla K80. SVD merely requires doing `from scipy.sparse.linalg import svds` in most cases. Moreover, there are even better solutions than SVD (in terms of accuracy), still linear, not even based on MF, e.g., RecWalk [Nikolakopoulos and Karypis 2019] and even better one - Personalized Diffusions model [Nikolakopoulos, Berberidis, Karypis, Giannakis 2019] - that are shown to significantly outperform VAE models.\n\nThe general conclusion is that even though you improve VAE, you are actually starting from not the best model and there\u2019s much more room for improvement (demonstrated by much simpler models) than you show in your work. Please consider this fact and adjust wording in your text accordingly. Especially in the statements like \u201cVAEs signi\ufb01cantly outperform many state-of-the-art methods\u201d or \u201cthe proposed RaCT also signi\ufb01cantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, including VAE, CDAE, WMF and SLIM\u201d as it is really about outperforming strong baselines not real SOTA.\nIn addition to that, recent studies show that many modern neural networks-based approaches underperform even simple KNN-based models, see work by [Dacrema, Cremonesi, Jannach 2019] on \u201cA Worrying Analysis of Recent Neural Recommendation Approaches\u201d. It includes VAE, DAE and NeuCF that you reference in your paper. \n\nIn spite of that, the statement \u201c[LVM]\u2026 may yield suboptimal performance, especially for large datasets (He et al., 2017)\u201d is at best questionable and requires more investigation as the referenced here paper is about NeuCF. This also makes me doubt in the claims, where you talk about approximation of the real ranking measure by the critic. Examples with RecWalk and PersDiff show that even without optimizing any ranking metric you can get a decent quality in terms of NDCG. Even though I find the general explanation in the text intuitive and appealing, I believe, more rigorous research should be done before we can have something reliable to say about ranking metric approximation. I\u2019d suggest being more careful with such statement in the text. Even in your own experiments a simple EASE model is sometimes better, even though it has nothing to do with approximating any elaborate ranking metric (it's closer to the nearest neighbours search).\n\n\nOther comments\n1)\t\u201cperformance comes at a computational cost, as inference requires multiplication with an unfactored M \u00d7M matrix\u201d is arguable to a certain extent. In the case of SLIM there\u2019s a sparse matrix with zero diagonal, so once it\u2019s computed and stored in a sparse format, it\u2019s not really a problem to do calculations with it (the training is expensive, though).\n2)\t \u201cwhich is argued to be a close proxy to ranking loss\u201d a reference required here.\n3)\tThe two-level architectures are very popular in general. At the first level, a compact list of candidates is generated by a quick to compute algorithm like MF,  then the second-level algorithm based on decision-trees or multiarmed bandits (MAB) is trained on a much smaller output space. Comparing with such approaches (especially with MAB as they are widely used in industry, probably the second popular approach after MF) would make the work more complete.\n4)\t\u201cPrevious work on learning-to-rank has been explored this question\u2026\u201d something is not right here.\n5)\tUnfortunately, a lot of prior studies do not report confidence intervals, and this paper is not an exception. It makes it hard to reason about statistical significance of the results and about generalization capabilities of the approach.\n\nReferences:\nCremonesi, Paolo, Yehuda Koren, and Roberto Turrin. \"Performance of recommender algorithms on top-n recommendation tasks.\" In Proceedings of the fourth ACM conference on Recommender systems, pp. 39-46.

While variational autoencoders allow convenient construction of nonlinear LVMs, they are trained by maximizing the multinomial likelihood for the items selected.  Thus the training objective is not perfectly matched to the evaluation objective, which is typically something like NDCG @N or RECALL @N, neither of which is differentiable.  This paper proposes an actor-critic RL approach to train the nonlinear LVM directly for the NDCG loss.  The idea is to create a critic model that learns to approximate NDCG, and to train the actor to optimize this approximate objective.  However, they find that they are unable to build an effective critic when taking the predictions and ground truth directly.  However, they find that with a simple set of 3-features, they can build an effective critic that gives improved or competitive performance on several metrics on 3 large-scale datasets.  When their method (RaCT) is not the best, it is beaten by EASE, which is computationally much more expensive.\n\nThis work seems to fit naturally into the line of work on nonlinear LVMs.  While porting MLE training to RL training is a standard operation these days, in this case it wasn't entirely trivial -- one couldn't just use REINFORCE and be done.  Introducing features and an actor/critic setup isn't an amazing innovation, but the method works well, has computational benefits, and has compared to many other models on 3 datasets.  The paper is very polished and nice to read so that somebody can really learn from it. I vote for accepting this paper.\n\nSome specific questions and comments:\n- In the 'Pitfals of VAEs' section, it says \"A preserves the ranking order of the target, while B does not.\"  I'm seeing that A and B give the same rankings, so I don't understand the comment.\n- I don't quite understand the explanation for why REINFORCE wouldn't be effective.  I'm more convinced by the fact that the critic failed to learn when given the full prediction set and ground truth."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1058/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1058/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "RaCT: Toward Amortized Ranking-Critical Training For Collaborative Filtering ", "authors": ["Sam Lobel*", "Chunyuan Li*", "Jianfeng Gao", "Lawrence Carin"], "authorids": ["samuel_lobel@brown.edu", "chunyuan.li@microsoft.com", "jfgao@microsoft.com", "lcarin@duke.edu"], "keywords": ["Collaborative Filtering", "Recommender Systems", "Actor-Critic", "Learned Metrics"], "TL;DR": "We apply the actor-critic methodology from reinforcement learning to collaborative filtering, resulting in improved performance across a variety of latent-variable models", "abstract": "We investigate new methods for training collaborative filtering models based on actor-critic reinforcement learning, to more directly maximize ranking-based objective functions. Specifically, we train a critic network to approximate ranking-based metrics, and then update the actor network to directly optimize against the learned metrics. In contrast to traditional learning-to-rank methods that require re-running the optimization procedure for new lists, our critic-based method amortizes the scoring process with a neural network, and can directly provide the (approximate) ranking scores for new lists.\n\nWe demonstrate the actor-critic's ability to significantly improve the performance of a variety of prediction models, and achieve better or comparable performance to a variety of strong baselines on three large-scale datasets.\n", "pdf": "/pdf/4cb3e9e73f04059794a59c7df1a752c08b2d9f0b.pdf", "code": "https://github.com/samlobel/RaCT_CF", "paperhash": "lobel|ract_toward_amortized_rankingcritical_training_for_collaborative_filtering", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nLobel*2020RaCT:,\ntitle={RaCT: Toward Amortized Ranking-Critical Training For Collaborative Filtering },\nauthor={Sam Lobel* and Chunyuan Li* and Jianfeng Gao and Lawrence Carin},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJxR7R4FvS}\n}", "full_presentation_video": "", "original_pdf": "/attachment/655d3be59f86e39fc62f94dcc7d2fd21dc76385e.pdf", "appendix": "", "poster": "", "spotlight_video": "", "slides": ""}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
