But, I am still not very convinced with the proposed results. For CIFAR-100 (0%), you get about 0.2% gain, for ImageNet (0%), you get about 0.2% loss in top-5 accuracy, and for WebVision, you get about 0.3% gain. I am not sure whether you can call these as statistically significant gains. I believe such gain/loss can be obtained with many other tweaks, such as the learning rate scheduling, as the authors have done. \n\nI believe extensive testing the proposed method on many real noisy datasets, not the synthetically generated ones, and showing the consistent gains would much strengthen the paper. But, at the current version, the only such result is Table 5, which is, again, not very convincing to me. \n\nSo, I still keep my rating. \n\n=======\n\nSummary:\n\nThe authors propose a simple empirical method for cleaning the dataset for training. By using the implicit regularization property of SGD-based optimization method, the authors come up with a method of setting a threshold for the training loss statistics such that the examples that show losses above the threshold are regarded as noisy examples and are discarded. Their empirical results show that ODD (their method) can outperform other baselines when artificial random label noise is injected. They also show ablation studies on the hyperparameters and show the final result seems to be robust to those parameters. \n\nPros:\n- The method is very simple\n- The empirical results, particularly on the synthetic noisy training data, seems to be encouraging.\n- The ablation study argues that the method is robust to the hyperparameters, p, E, and h.\n\nCons:\n- I think the results remains to be highly empirical. While it is interesting to see the division of the loss statistics in Figure 2, I am not very convinced about the real usage of the proposed method. The result in Table 5 shows that ODD can outperform ERM for real world datasets, but the improvement seems to be marginal. Moreover, the hyperparameter p was set to 30 for that experiment, but how did the authors choose that parameter? Clearly, if you choose wrong p, I think the performance will degrade, and it is not clear how you can choose p in real applications. The ablation studies are only with synthetic noisy label data, so I think the result is somewhat limited. \n- \n\nI think the paper shows interesting results, but my concern is that it seems to be quite empirical. The positive results are particularly on the synthetic data case. \n\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper365/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Better Generalization with On-the-fly Dataset Denoising", "abstract": "Memorization in over-parameterized neural networks can severely hurt generalization in the presence of mislabeled examples.

The recall values are around 0.87 where as the precision values range from 0.88 to 0.92.

However, our results show that MentorNet can be outperformed by switching to a cosine learning rate schedule alone. Other related methods are already outperformed by MentorNet from the comparisons in the MentorNet paper.\n\nMentorNet requires tuning of a wide range of hyperparameters, including the pretrained denoising schedule, the architecture of the Mentor network, and even the individual dropout ratio for each epoch of training. This is much more complicated compared to ODD, which makes little changes to standard ERM training, and only introduces a few hyperparameters that are interpretable and easy to tune. \n\nTherefore, we believe that ODD can serve as a simple but effective baseline for future work in robust supervised deep learning. Future work in this direction can benefit from the implicit regularization principles found in this paper.\n\nQ1: What if the actual noise model is not uniformly random?\n\nThanks for mentioning this! In real applications, the actual noise model is unlikely to be uniformly random; in fact, we have no information about the noise model at all! ODD makes no assumptions about the noise transition matrix or the amount of noise.\n\nWe assume uniformly random noise because of two reasons. First, this case is very easy to analyze and simulate, and we can evaluate the performance easily across multiple noise levels. Second, this noise has higher entropy than any other type of noise, making it easier to separate than clean labels. We use this analysis to select suitable threshold values that balances precision and recall reasonably as controlled by hyperparameter p.\n\nQ2: Clarify the rationale for such analysis\n\nSection 4.1.3 evaluates ODD\u2019s performance when the dataset inputs are imbalanced, which is very common in real-world datasets (such as WebVision). By combining several labels into one, we prevent any method that tries to balance the dataset simply by counting the number of labels. CIFAR50 considers randomly merging the labels, and CIFAR20 considers merging the labels that are semantically related. Our positive results demonstrate that ODD is capable of dealing with unbalanced datasets as well.\n\nSection 4.4 evaluates ODD\u2019s sensitivity to the hyperparameters (p, E) as well as the portion of uniform noise in the dataset. We demonstrate that ODD is generally insensitive to changes of hyperparameters, and that ODD performs well under all the uniform noise levels. This suggests that we could bypass the process of estimating the amount of noise (which is unknown in realistic cases) in the dataset and tune (p, E) directly for ODD. While uniform noise is unrealistic, the amount of data subject to this type of noise can be controlled, unlike real-world noise.\n\nQ3: Why not use large learning rate and decay? Why not decouple E and learning rate?\n\nIn Figure 3 and Table 7, we demonstrate the performance of the stepwise learning rate schedule. For the stepwise learning rate schedule, we used a large learning rate at first, and set E to the epoch where we first decrease the learning rate. From Figure 3, the smaller learning rate will start to overfit immediately if ODD is not performed. This forces E to be related to the learning rate schedule for the stepwise case. Moreover, the results from cosine outperform stepwise consistently, so we use cosine as a strong baseline to compare with.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper365/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper365/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper365/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Better Generalization with On-the-fly Dataset Denoising", "abstract": "Memorization in over-parameterized neural networks can severely hurt generalization in the presence of mislabeled examples.

Moreover, the entropy of this label noise is highest, so any other type of label noise would have smaller entropy. As a consequence, they are harder to separate than uniform label noise. Therefore, the threshold for other types of noise (including real world ones), should be higher than the 1/K-th percentile of \u201cp_n(\\ell)\u201d, where K denotes the number of labels (to reduce false positives), motivating the percentile hyperparameter \u201cp\u201d.\n\nQ: Why does the method generalizes to other types of noise?\nIn our analysis, we assume a label is either \u201ccorrect / clean\u201d or \u201cincorrect / noise\u201d.

The goal of our paper is to show that in the case of deep learning with noisy supervision, a simple method, ODD, can significantly outperform sophisticated alternatives, such as MentorNet and Ren\u2019s Meta Validation Optimization (both in ICML18). We believe ODD can serve as a drop-in replacement for ERM for robust deep learning, and the findings could lead to more theoretical insights.\n\nQ: Improvement on real datasets seems marginal.\n\nWe respectfully disagree: while the improvement on ODD over ERM on WebVision seems marginal (around .5% top-1 error), the improvement of Inception ResNet-v2 over ResNet-50 is also only 1-2%. However, Inception ResNet-v2 increases training time from 2 days to 6 days (with 8 V100 GPUs). ODD, on the other hand, drops about 15% of the data and thus saves training time for both models. \n\nODD can also be easily implemented, making it appealing to practitioners who train their models on real-world datasets. These datasets can contain an unknown source of label noise which can hurt generalization.\n\nDespite its simplicity, ODD outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods on datasets with various types of label noise, and is competitive to the state-of-the-art on clean datasets. This includes CIFAR100 (\u201cclean\u201d version) as well as WebVision (a dataset based on noisy web supervision). ODD also demonstrates that even datasets which are assumed to be \u201cclean\u201d, such as CIFAR100, actually contain a lot of mislabeled examples. Our method could alleviate the process of tedious label cleaning, as a lot of the noisy labels are automatically detectable.\n\n\nQ: How to choose p?\nIn Table 11 (appendix), we show that the performance of ODD is not much affected for various settings of p = 10, 30, 50, 80 on WebVision; similar arguments could be made for clean ImageNet. Even as ODD requires tuning p, it bypasses the more sophisticated hyperparameters, such as the amount of noise / weight between different objectives / extra MentorNet architecture proposed by previous methods. In practice we find that p ranging from 10 to 50 gives reasonable results.\n\nQ: Ablation studies only with synthetic noisy label data.\n\nTable 11 & 12 show results for various settings of p on WebVision - a real-world dataset with noisy labels. It would be impossible to measure the amount of \u201creal-world noise\u201d let alone control the amount in an ablation study. We therefore conducted experiments on synthetic data in order to precisely control the amount of noise. The same methodology is used in both the MentorNet paper and Ren\u2019s ICML18 paper.\n\nTherefore, we believe that practitioners can apply ODD as a drop-in replacement for ERM for their (potentially noisy) datasets, so it should be of interest to ICLR. The implicit regularization effect can be used to filter out potentially mislabeled data and to improve generalization. Explaining why large learning rates would have this effect is also interesting, but could require more assumptions than is realistic at this point.

The authors made an observation that when training with large learning rate, examples with correct labeling and incorrect labeling exhibits different loss distributions.
