", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "review": "This paper proposes using a set of orthogonal basis and their combination to represent convolutional kernels. To learn the set of basis,  the paper uses an existing algorithm (OSVF)\n\n-- Related Work\n\nRelated work suggests there is redundancy in the number of parameters (According to Denil et al) but the training can be done by learning a subset directly without drop in accuracy. I am not really sure this is strictly correct as many approaches (including Denil et al) suggest the additional parameters are needed to help the optimization process (therefore hard to learn directly a small model).\n\nAs in the clarity point below, please be consistent. Acronyms are not properly defined.\n\n\n-- Method / Clarity\n\nIt is nice to read section 3.1 but at the same time probably redundant as it does not add any value (at least the first two paragraphs including Eq. 1). Reading the text, it is not clear to me why there is a lower number of parameters to be updated. To the best of my understanding so far in the explanation, the number of parameters is potentially the same but represented using a single bit. Rephrasing this section would probably improve readability.\n\nRuntime is potentially reduced but not clear in current hardware.\n\nSection 3.2 is nice as short overview but happens to take more than the actual proposal (so I get lost). \n\nFigures 2 and 3. I am surprissed the FlexModule (a building block of BinaryFlex) is not mentioned in the binaryflex architecture and then, sparse blocks are not defined anywhere. Would be nice to be consistent here. Also note that filter banks among other details are not defined. \n\n\nNow, w and b in eq 2 are meant to be binary, is that correct? The text defines them as real valued so this is confusing. \n\n- From the explanations in the text, it is not clear to me how the basis and the weights are learned (except using backprop). How do we actually generate the filter bank, is this from scratch? or after some pretraining / preloaded model? What is the difference between BinaryFlex models and how do I generate them when replicating these results? It is correct to assume f_k is a pretrained kernel that is going to be approximated?\n\n\n\n\n-- more on clarity\n\n\nI would also appreciate rephrasing some parts of the paper. For instance, the paragraph under section 4.1 is confusing. There is no consistency with namings / acronyms and seems not to be in the right order. Note that the paragraph starts talking about ImageNet and then suggests different schedules for different datasets. The naming for state-of-the-art methods is not consistent. \nAlso note that acronyms are later used (such as BWN) but not defined here. This should be easy to improve.\n\nI guess Figurre 4 needs clarification. What are the axis? Why square and cercles? Same for Figure 5. \n\nOverall, text needs reviewing. There are typos all over the text. I think ImageNet is not a task but classification using ImageNet.\n\n-- Results\n\nI find it hard to follow the results. Section 4.1.1 suggests accuracy is comparable when constraints are relaxed and then only 7% drop in accuracy for a 4.5x model reduction. I have not been able to match these numbers with those in table 2. How do I get to see 7% lower accuracy for BinaryFlex-1.6? \n\nResults suggest a model under 2MB is convenient for using in ARM, is this actually a fact (is it tested in an ARM?) or just guessing? This is also a point made in the introduction and I would expect at least an example of running time there (showing the benefit compared to competitors). It is also interesting the fact that in the text, the ARM is said to have 512KB while in the experiments there is no model achieving that lower-bound.\n\nI would like to see an experiment on ImageNet where the proposed BinaryFlex leads to a model of approximately 7.5MB and see what the preformance is for that model (so comparable in size with the state-of-the-art).\n\nI missed details for the exact implementation for the other datsets (as said in the paper). There are modifications that are obscure and the benefits in model size (at least compared to a baseline) are not mentioned.
