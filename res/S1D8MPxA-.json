Only a subset of sparse matrices can be represented in the VCM format, however, unlike CSR format, it allows for faster parallel decoding and requires much less index space. The authors also propose a novel method of pruning of neural network that constructs an (sub)optimal (w.r.t. a weight magnitude based loss) Viterbi-compressed matrix given the weights of a pretrained DNN.\nVCM is an interesting analog to the conventional CSR format that may be more computationally efficient given particular software and/or hardware implementations of the Viterbi Decompressor. However, the empirical study of possible acceleration remains as an open question.\nHowever, I have a major concern regarding the efficiency of the pruning procedure. Authors report practically the same level of sparsity, as the pruning procedure from the Deep Compression paper. Both the proposed Viterbi-based pruning, and Deep Compression pruning belong to the previous era of pruning methods. They separate the pruning procedure and the training procedure, so that the model is not trained end-to-end. However, during the last two years a lot of new adaptive pruning methods have been developed, e.g. Dynamic Network Surgery, Soft Weight Sharing, and Sparse Variational DropOut. All of them in some sense incorporate the pruning procedure into the training procedure and achieve a much higher level of sparsity (e.g. DC achieves ~13x compression of LeNet5, and SVDO achieves ~280x compression of the same network). Therefore the reported 35-50% compression of the index storage is not very significant.\nIt is not clear whether it is possible to take a very sparse matrix and transform it into the VCM format without a high accuracy degradation. It is also not clear whether the VCM format would be efficient for storage of extremely sparse matrices, as they would likely be more sensitive to the mismatch of the original sparsity mask, and the best possible VCM sparsity mask. Therefore I\u2019m concerned whether it would be possible to achieve a close-to-SotA level of compression using this method, and it is not yet clear whether this method can be used for practical acceleration or not.\nThe paper presents an interesting idea that potentially has useful applications, however the experiments are not convincing enough.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Viterbi-based Pruning for Sparse Matrix with Fixed and High Index Compression Ratio", "abstract": "Weight pruning has proven to be an effective method in reducing the model size and computation cost while not sacrificing the model accuracy.

We address your concerns and questions below.\n\n\u201cIt is not immediately clear to me why the objective function (2) correlates to a good accuracy of the pruned network. Did you try out other functions before settling on this one, or is there a larger reason for which (2) is a logical choice?\u201d\n \nWe tried various objective functions such as x, x^2, exp(x), tanh(x) and sigmoid(x) as shown in Fig. 9. While all of the objective functions gave comparable accuracy, we chose tanh(x) because, in the context of magnitude-based pruning, selecting a few parameters with large magnitude is more desirable than choosing many parameters with medium magnitude, even though the sum of the (survived parameters\u2019) magnitude can be the same in both cases. Hence, in order to obtain a highly skewed distribution of survived parameters, \u2018tanh\u2019 is considered in our experiments. We added Appendix A.3 to show how \u2018tanh\u2019 and \u2018x\u2019 can produce different branch metric values, given a list of parameters and comparator outputs. Please note that there can be many other objective functions that potentially result in similar/better skewed distributions.\n\n\u201cI would find a plot of the final objective value assigned to a pruning scheme compared to the true network accuracy very helpful in in understanding how these two correlate.\u201d\n\nWe hope our response above addresses this concern as well. Since the Viterbi algorithm finds an optimal sequence maximizing the path metric, there is no immediate relationship between the branch metric (i.e., Eq.(2)) and the network accuracy. However, producing high branch metrics would increase the chance to improve the final path metric and to select parameters with large magnitude after a sequence-level optimization.\nAt the final time index, all path metrics share a long optimal sequence through the survivor selection procedure (as a result, it is not necessary to investigate 2^p paths). Choosing any path metric at the final time index, hence, would produce almost the same accuracy. Please note that comparing absolute values of the final path metrics with different branch metric equations would be meaningless due to the path metric normalization.\n\n\u201cCould this approach be generalized to RNNs?\u201d\n\nYes, our proposed approach can be generalized to RNN for which a pruning is applicable. For instance, we performed an experiment with a language model on PTB dataset (medium size, https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/tutorials/rnn/ptb). The magnitude-based pruning and the Viterbi-based pruning obtain 81.4% and 81.5% pruning rates, respectively, while VCM has a storage reduction of 43.9% compared with CSR and the perplexity degradation is comparable between the two cases. Since there are no widely accepted benchmarks for RNN pruning experiments, we did not include this experimental result in the manuscript. \n\n\u201cHow long does the Viterbi algorithm take, as it explores all 2^p possible prunings?\u201d\n\nDue to the dynamic programming property of the Viterbi algorithm, it is not necessary to compute all 2^p possible prunings. The time complexity of the Viterbi algorithm is linearly proportional to the number of states in the trellis diagram and p (not 2^p). There are many well-known implementation techniques to reduce the time complexity of the Viterbi algorithm, such as a sliding window technique (e.g., the time complexity becomes independent of the length of the input sequence), which could not be included in our manuscript due to the space limit.\n\n\u201cHow difficult is it to tune the pruning algorithm hyper-parameters?\u201d\n\nIn our manuscript, where a magnitude-based pruning is used as a baseline, the difficulty of tuning hyper-parameters using our proposed methodology is almost the same as that of the magnitude-based pruning, because other than VH_p, selecting hyper-parameters becomes trivial. For example, increasing NUM_c, XOR taps, and the Hamming distance always improves the pruning rate and the compression rate (while typical numbers for those hyper-parameters introduced in the paper are good enough). The comparator threshold (TH_c) is automatically determined by the target pruning rate, which is dominated by TH_p. Finding an appropriate VH_p value follows the way of magnitude-based pruning methods. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Viterbi-based Pruning for Sparse Matrix with Fixed and High Index Compression Ratio", "abstract": "Weight pruning has proven to be an effective method in reducing the model size and computation cost while not sacrificing the model accuracy.

We, however, believe that the pruning and quantization are two orthogonal approaches that both aim to help reducing the memory/computation overhead as demonstrated in S. Han et al.\u2019s Deep Compression paper, for example. To answer the reviewer\u2019s question in more detail, we also experimented quantization of weight values for the viterbi-pruned LeNet-5 on MNIST dataset. Similar to S. Han et al.\u2019s case, we observed that 4-bit weight quantization could maintain the inference accuracy, which confirms that pruning and quantization can be applied together and further reduce the memory footprint.  \n\nIn addition, recent works, such as variational dropout (as discussed by reviewer #2), show that it is possible to prune and compress a large model(i.e., vgglike) by more than 50x without loss of accuracy. The results indicate that sparse-matrix approaches still have merits for further investigation. As we have shown in response to reviewer #2, the VCM format can also work with this approach (in fact, we believe VCM can work with any underlying pruning approach).\n\nRegarding the reviewer\u2019s concern for VCM decompression overhead, we believe that the overhead is very small because it requires small number of FFs and XOR gates as shown in the Figure 1 and Table 4. Please note that VCM decompression corresponds to the Viterbi encoding in error correction code applications, which is regarded as a much lighter process compared to Viterbi decoding.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Viterbi-based Pruning for Sparse Matrix with Fixed and High Index Compression Ratio", "abstract": "Weight pruning has proven to be an effective method in reducing the model size and computation cost while not sacrificing the model accuracy. Conventional sparse matrix formats, however, involve irregular index structures with large storage requirement and sequential reconstruction process, resulting in inefficient use of highly parallel computing resources. Hence, pruning is usually restricted to inference with a batch size of one, for which an efficient parallel matrix-vector multiplication method exists. In this paper, a new class of sparse matrix representation utilizing Viterbi algorithm that has a high, and more importantly, fixed index compression ratio regardless of the pruning rate, is proposed. In this approach, numerous sparse matrix candidates are first generated by the Viterbi encoder, and then the one that aims to minimize the model accuracy degradation is selected by the Viterbi algorithm. The model pruning process based on the proposed Viterbi encoder and Viterbi algorithm is highly parallelizable, and can be implemented efficiently in hardware to achieve low-energy, high-performance index decoding process. Compared with the existing magnitude-based pruning methods, index data storage requirement can be further compressed by 85.2% in MNIST and 83.9% in AlexNet while achieving similar pruning rate. Even compared with the relative index compression technique, our method can still reduce the index storage requirement by 52.7% in MNIST and 35.5% in AlexNet.", "pdf": "/pdf/39a908ace655861827fef4e613c9264e8f940947.pdf", "TL;DR": "We present a new pruning method and sparse matrix format to enable high index compression ratio and parallel index decoding process.", "paperhash": "lee|viterbibased_pruning_for_sparse_matrix_with_fixed_and_high_index_compression_ratio", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nlee2018viterbibased,\ntitle={Viterbi-based Pruning for Sparse Matrix with Fixed and High Index Compression Ratio},\nauthor={Dongsoo Lee and Daehyun Ahn and Taesu Kim and Pierce I.
