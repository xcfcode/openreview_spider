According to our experiment, choosing alpha value = 16 generally gives a good performance. According to the new experiment in Appendix E, we can learn an alpha value and apply the heating-up strategy based on that value.  \n \nQ2: How \"heated-up\" strategy produces well generalized feature?\nA2: The explanation is given in Appendix C. For BN models learned with different alpha values (Fig. 4(c)-4(j)), in training set (left-hand side), we clearly see the trend that a smaller alpha value will lead to more compact features. Unfortunately, this trend doesn\u2019t hold for test set (right hand side). For the model trained with alpha= 4,8, although in the training set the histograms show nice compactness and spread-out properties, the features are not compact at all on the test set. It\u2019s a clear signal of overfitting.\n \nComparing the histograms of the features learned without heating-up (Fig. 4(g)-4(h)) and with heating-up (Fig. 4(k)-4(l)), applying the proposed \u201cheating-up\u201d strategy, i.e. fine-tuning the network with smaller alpha and learning rate, makes the positive pairs more compact while keeping the negative pairs spread-out. We don\u2019t observe clear overfitting phenomenon for the \u201cheated-up\u201d feature.\n \nQ3: How different alpha values change the ratio of #incorrect samples with #total samples and #boundary samples with #total samples?\nA3: To verify this, we show the final training accuracy with different alpha values on Car196 dataset in Table 7 in the revised manuscript. \u201c1 - Train Acc\u201d indicates the ratio of the number of \u201cincorrect\u201d sample and the number of total samples. The result shows that when training with small alpha value, especially when alpha = 2, the training accuracy is significantly lower (~11%) than the that of trained with larger alpha values (alpha=8, 16, 32). It verifies that training with large alpha values will focus more on the ``incorrect'' samples and provide higher training accuracy. To show the ratio of the #boundary samples to the #total samples is not really possible, since there is no formal definition of what a \u201cboundary\u201d sample is.\n \nQ4: Do multiple heating-up strategies improve learning speed?\nA4: We thank the reviewer for suggesting this good idea. This may help improve the learning speed. However, since the alpha value is only a hyperparameter, and the network needs sufficient time to respond to the change of the hyperparameter, combining different heating-up strategies may not help a lot.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1215/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1215/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1215/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Heated-Up Softmax Embedding", "abstract": "Metric learning aims at learning a distance which is consistent with the semantic meaning of the samples.

We added a comparison to [Wang et al., 2017] in the revised manuscript in the Appendix E. We applied different alpha values [1,2,4,8,16,32] as initialization. According to the results, training with a fixed intermediate alpha value (BN) outperforms the method with trainable alpha. A similar conclusion is also reported by Ranjan et al. (2017). It is interesting to observe that the final learned alpha values are always increased compared to the initial values, which is the opposite of what our heating-up strategy does. The reason for the lower performance is that learning the alpha value is equivalent to learning the norm of the feature. As mentioned in Appendix B, the classifier will tend to get larger alpha (larger feature norm) which results in a not compact feature. \n\nWe also applied the heating-up strategy to both learnable and fixed alpha settings. The proposed heating-up strategy shows performance gains for all the settings. Learning with fixed alpha and the heating-up is still the overall winner. \n \nQ2: Provide a comparison of HLN/HBN to LN/BN for \u201calpha=4\u201d\nA2: The comparison is given in Table 3. In the table, only the second column is the result of softmax without normalization. All other results are with normalization applied to both the feature and the weight which is the same setting as HBN. We\u2019ve changed the statement there to make it clearer.\n \nQ3: Explain why the temperature T should be increased in the training and better explain Fig. 1(d).\nA3: Increasing temperature T will assign larger gradient to boundary samples which results in a compact feature that is beneficial for metric learning. \n\nThe left-hand side of Fig. 1(d) shows the first step of \u201cHeating-Up\u201d, which at the beginning of the training, uses an intermediate alpha value to train the network. At the beginning, there are many \u201cincorrect samples\u201d and \u201cboundary samples\u201d, choosing an intermediate alpha value (red dashed line in Fig. 1(a)-(c)) will assign large gradients to the \u201cincorrect samples\u201d, which will quickly push them to be the \u201cboundary samples\u201d. The \u201cboundary samples\u201d will also be pushed towards the center.\n \nAfter the first step, the positions of the samples are shown in the right-hand side of Fig. 1(d). Continuing using an intermediate alpha will not give enough gradient for boundary samples. Therefore, we should use a smaller alpha (green dashed line in Fig. 1(a)-(c)) to assign larger gradient for updating the boundary samples, which will make the final embedding more compact.\n \nQ4: Show the importance of normalization.\nA4: Applying l2 normalization to the classifier weights in network training helps increase angular margin instead of Euclidean distance between different classes. It helps to get more discriminative feature representation. We\u2019ve added Appendix F to explain this and provided experiments results of training the embedding without normalization.\n \nQ5: Discuss methods using different losses, such as [Wan et al. 2018].\nA5: We thank the reviewer for pointing out this reference. The reference proposes to use Mahalanobis distance instead of inner product in the softmax function and achieve good performance in image classification task. One main difference between the deep metric learning and [Wan et al. 2018] is that [Wan et al. 2018] requires the compactness and spread-out properties with Mahalanobis distance while in deep metric learning those properties are required in Euclidean space. Therefore, [Wan et al. 2018] may not give an optimal solution to the deep metric problem. Unfortunately, since the method is not originally designed for deep metric learning, given limited rebuttal time, we weren\u2019t able to implement it for metric learning. We will definitely discuss this reference in our final version.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1215/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1215/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1215/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Heated-Up Softmax Embedding", "abstract": "Metric learning aims at learning a distance which is consistent with the semantic meaning of the samples.

However, Deep Metric Learning first learns a low-dimensional embedding for all the samples and use Euclidean distance on the new embedding as a metric. The embedding and the Euclidean distance are regarded as a whole as the \u2018metric\u2019. This terminology and setting have been widely used in recent years (Hoffer & Ailon, 2015, Harwood et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2017; Song et al., 2016; 2017).\n \nQ2: The idea of using temperature and second to the last layer\u2019s embedding is not novel.\nA2: We didn\u2019t claim the idea of using temperature and second to the last layer\u2019s embedding is the novelty of the paper. We have reviewed the related works on temperature and softmax embedding.

Using a large learning rate will make the network converge to results similar to directly using a small alpha for training. The best learning rate can be chosen through cross-validation.

The only difference from that work is the way to deal with temperature; in [Wang et al., 2017], the temperature is \"optimized\" as a trainable parameter, while it is dealt with in a hand-crafted way of heating up in this work. Honestly speaking, it is unclear which approach is better, though the optimization in [Wang et al., 2017] seems elegant as stated in that paper. The only way to validate this work compared to [Wang et al., 2017] is to empirically evaluate those two methods in the experiments. Such a comparison experiment is not found and it is a main flaw of this paper.\n\n- Justification of the method\nThe gradients of the softmax cross-entropy loss parameterized with a temperature T are well analyzed in Sections 3.1&3.2. But, in Section 3.3, the reviewer cannot find the clear and convincing explanation for why the temperature T should be increased in the training. My question is: why don't you use alpha=4 consistently throughout the training?\n It might be related to the process of simulated annealing (though \"temperature\" is usually cooled down in SA), and more interestingly, it would also be possible to find connection with the work of [Guo et al., 2017]. In [Guo et al., 2017], the temperature in the softmax is optimized as a post processing for calibrating the classifier outputs. Though the calibration task itself is a little bit apart from the metric learning of the authors' interest, we can find in that paper an interesting result that the temperature is heated up to increase the confidence of the classifier outputs, which is quite similar to the process of fine-tuning by heating up softmax as done in this work. Therefore, the reviewer guesses that the effectiveness of heating up softmax can also be interpreted from the viewpoint of [Guo et al., 2017].\n\nThere is also less description about Figure 1; in particular, the reviewer cannot understand what Figure 1(d) means.\n\n- Ablation study\nTo empirically resolve the above concerns, it is necessary to present the empirical comparison with the \"static\" softmax.\nNamely, the methods of HLN/HBN should be carefully compared to LN/BN of \"alpha=4\", not only those of alpha=16 shown in Table 1&2; the comparison in Table 3 seems unfair since the authors apply the static softmax without normalization.\nAnd, it would be better to show the performance of heated-up softmax \"without\" normalization to show the important role of the normalization, as done in [Wang et al., 2017].\nIn summary, since the proposed method is composed of a heating-up approach and feature normalization, the authors are required to validate the method from those two aspects, respectively, for increasing the significance of this paper.\n\n- Other loss function\nFor achieving a compactness in feature representation, the simple softmax requires both temperature and normalization. It, however, is also conceivable to employ the other types of loss function for that purpose, such as [a] which is based on the (Mahalanobis) distance with taking into account the margin between categories. The distance based loss also embeds features into localized clusters, which satisfies the authors' objective in this work. To validate the proposed method, it is required to compare the method with such a different types of loss function.\n\n[a] Wan, W., Zhong, Y., Li, T., & Chen, J. (2018).
