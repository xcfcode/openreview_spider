I do not think this work should be accepted to the conference for the following reasons:\n\n1: The authors show no benefit of this scheme except perhaps faster convergence.  If faster training of dictionary learning models was a bottleneck in practical applications, this might be of interest, but it is not.  SPAMS (http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/) can train a model on image patches as the authors do here in a few tens of seconds on a modern computer.  On the other hand, the authors give no evidence, empirical or otherwise, that their method is useful on any downstream tasks.\nIn my view, they do not even show that the distribution of atom usage will be better with their algorithm after the learning has converged, as at least according to their learning curves, the baselines have not finished converging.  It is not even clear that the final compression of the baselines would not be better.  Even if they did show these convincingly, it is not obvious to me that it is valuable; the authors need to *show* that uniform usage is desirable.\n\n2:    The authors should compare against several costs/algorithms (e.g. l_0 with OMP, l_1 with LARS, etc.), and across various N_0/sparsity penalties, and across several datasets.   The empirical evaluation is quite weak- one sparsity setting, two baselines, one dataset.  Even without the \"train to convergence\" question above, I don't think the authors have demonstrated that their claims on the properties of their algorithms/formulations are generally true.

The same with \"may converge to a result for which the ratio of activity between the most activated and the least activated is of the order 2\".  Why is this a problem?   What order would not be a problem?     The goal of unsupervised learning is rarely compression for its own sake (and even when this is the goal, measuring success in the space of images, for example,  requires human evaluation).  Furthermore, it is not unusual for feature representations that are optimally compressed to be less useful for other tasks.  Sparse coding gained popularity in the machine learning community because it lead to SOTA algorithms in image denoising, super-resolution,  and object recognition.   Does this approach improve the results on any of these?   Is the improvement enough to surpass modern approaches to these problems?  Is there some other downstream task where the authors method makes a significant difference?  The authors say that \"This result is often overlooked in dictionary learning and is a first novel result of the paper. \".   My claim is that this result is not unknown; but rather, has not been generally discussed in the broader sparse coding literature because it has not been considered a serious problem.  On the other hand, in the clustering literature (note that clustering is a very particular form of l_0 sparse coding), where cluster balance can be a serious problem with downstream consequences,  there are many works investigating cluster balancing. \n\nI am changing my score to 5."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper799/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper799/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper799/AnonReviewer4", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "An adaptive homeostatic algorithm for the unsupervised learning of visual features", "abstract": "The formation of structure in the brain, that is, of the connections between cells within neural populations, is by large an unsupervised learning process: the emergence of this architecture is mostly self-organized.

However, we would like to highlight that the quantitative evaluation (9 / 4/  3) is not consistent. Basing selection on the mean score makes it highly improbable that, as it is, the paper could be presented at the audience of ICLR. \n\nWe believe that it is possible to fix the main critic (\"not motivated\", \"importance unclear\") to leverage its importance and demonstrate that it meets the standard of ICLR - and not the \"red flag\" (3 with high confidence of 5) that it should be rejected straight away :-)  We acknowledge that this was a major issue and fully assume our fault : this fully lies in the readability of the paper. In particular, due to our quite unconventional way of justifying our computational choices by the current knowledge of neurophysiological processes, we understand that it is not usual in the machine learning community. Still, we also think that --without changing the theoretical background of this work-- we can change its form to allow reviewers and the conference program chairs to converge to an optimal decision on the acceptance of this paper.\n\nFor that, we have highlighted the main contribution: homeostasis in one form or the other is necessary for dictionary learning. When enforcing a simple $\\ell_2$ normalization, one may still obtain solutions for which some filters are more probable - and other more selective. Thanks to reviewers comments, we found a way to highlight this by reshuffling the atoms which we show: instead of selecting them randomly, we chose the extreme atoms (most and least probably selected). In hierarchical processing where the structural complexity of the features within each layer is preferentially homogeneous, it is undesirable to have a non uniform distribution of feature's structural complexity. We think that this knowledge from the biology of neural networks is an essential contribution to artificial networks.\n\nSecond, we have strengthened the qualitative evaluation of the algorithm. In the revision, we have shown results for larger datasets and longer learnings, highlighted the qualitative difference in the obtained dictionaries (just by changing the way they are displayed in the figure, see detailed responses). Importantly, we have included a supplementary material, which was absent from the first revision, and which shows the extension of this framework to other levels of sparsity, but also to different architectures. This was requested by the latest reviewer.\n\nAs a summary, we believe that these modifications were necessary to make the paper more impactful and we thank the reviewers for providing this essential input. We hope that this will allow us to present this quite unconventional work at ICLR.\n "}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper799/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper799/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper799/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "An adaptive homeostatic algorithm for the unsupervised learning of visual features", "abstract": "The formation of structure in the brain, that is, of the connections between cells within neural populations, is by large an unsupervised learning process: the emergence of this architecture is mostly self-organized.

We would like to point out that AnonReviewer4's final quantitative score as well as the confidence given will be crucial for the fact that this paper will or will not be presented at ICLR. We would like to respectfully detail how we completely disagree with the comments given in the two points, but acknowledge that this was mainly due to the way we presented the motivation for the paper.  We hope the revised version of the paper now meets the standards for ICLR and justifies to update the \"red flag\" (clear rejection) to a green light.\n\nFirst, the goal is not faster computation on a CPU. Our (github-shared) code runs in a few dozens of seconds per learning on a standard laptop - but the goal is mainly to be able to test all parameters. We have not used SPAMS in this work as we could use the similar methods which are used in the sklearn library. However, SPAMS is a great inspiration for our framework. (For information, the complete simulations for this paper take approximately 12 hours --which are easily distributed on a cluster as we multiplied the number of independent learning runs using different classes of parameters, cross-validations and types of sparse coding algorithms - in total approx 500 experiments. It takes a dozens of minutes on a 100 nodes cluster.). Our motivation is mainly to understand biological vision and hope this would percolate to ML. Yes, we obtain faster convergence, but as an epiphenomenon of the better efficiency of our adaptive homeostatic algorithm. However, we agree that this was not clear in this first revision: atoms which were displayed looked qualitatively similar. We have solved this issue thanks to the comments of the anonymous reviewers by now displaying the most and least active atoms. This shows a clear distinction between different methods and an important result: when $\\ell_2$ normalizing atoms, dictionary learning may converge to a result for which the ratio of activity between the most activated and the least activated is of the order 2. This result is often overlooked in dictionary learning and is a first novel result of the paper. \n\nThis being said, Figures 1 and 3 now show the clear qualitative advantage of using homeostasis in unsupervised learning. This now certainly allow to understand *why* convergence speed is a good indicator ---not for an advantage on the running speed on a classical CPU--- but rather in showing that this allows a more efficient dictionary learning overall. Concerning the point \" It is not even clear that the final compression of the baselines would not be better.  Even if they did show these convincingly, it is not obvious to me that it is valuable.\", we have performed the same experiments on more iterations such that we clearly see that baseline stay separate. Finally on the same point, we have not used at this point any application, such as supervised learning,  as it is out of the scope of this paper. But we thank the reviewer for suggesting it.\n\nSecond, we had already done the comparison \"against several costs/algorithms (e.g. l_0 with OMP, l_1 with LARS, etc.), and across various N_0/sparsity penalties\" but we had initially omitted to include this supplementary data (that takes the form of a single jupyter notebook which allows to reproduce all results). We have now included it in an anonymized format. This supplementary material contains code to replicate all figures but also additional experiments to test the effect of the different parameters. In short, we verified that the results we present are valid over a various number of parameters of the network, like the learning rates (figure 2) but also sparsity and the size of the dictionary (see Response To AnonReviewer3 @ https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyMras0cFQ&noteId=BylQtQPHRX ). As in Sandin, 2017 paper we have shown similar results in OMP. We are in the process of extending this framework to other sparse coding algorithms (LARS and lasso_lars) as plugged in from sklearn without any modification (in theory) to these algorithms. Indeed, we should remind that our adaptive homeostasis allows to be implemented by modifying the norm of each atom of the dictionary (as was done in the original work by Olshausen). We also show in the paper the application to a one-layer convolution network and our preliminary results show that we can extend this to a hierarchical network.\n\nI hope that with these clarifications on the form we gave to the paper (without changing the theory behind it), the statement that \" I don't think the authors have demonstrated that their claims on the properties of their algorithms/formulations are generally true.\"  could be re-assessed to allow us to share this work inspired by biology to the ICLR community."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper799/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper799/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper799/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "An adaptive homeostatic algorithm for the unsupervised learning of visual features", "abstract": "The formation of structure in the brain, that is, of the connections between cells within neural populations, is by large an unsupervised learning process: the emergence of this architecture is mostly self-organized.

Concerning point 6: Indeed, we acknowledge that this type of paper may be unconventional for the audience at ICLR. But we strongly  believe that scientific knowledge on biological vision is essential to work out the models that will shape DL in the future. Thus, we fully understand the rating given by the reviewer and would like to suggest that our revision addresses the main comment and show that it is relevant for a presentation at ICLR.\n\nFirst, we have extended the results by using the useful suggestions of AnonReviewer3 (point 3):\nAs suggested by the reviewer we have tested how the convergence was modified by changing the number of neurons. By comparing different numbers of neurons we could re-draw the same figures for the convergence of the algorithm as in our original figures. In addition, we have also checked that this result will hold on a range of sparsity levels. In particular, we found that in general, increasing the l0_sparseness parameter, the convergence took progressively longer.  Importantly, we could see that in both cases, this did not depend on the kind of homeostasis heuristic chosen, proving the generality of our results.\n\nThis is shown in the supplementary material that we have added to our revision (section \"Testing different number of neurons and sparsity\") . This useful extension proves the originality of our work as highlighted in point 4, and the generality of these results compared to the parameters of the network.\n\nSecond, the comment made in point 5 is essential: figures 1 and 3  in our first revision where not showing appropriately the qualitative improvement which is achieved in the resulting filters. Indeed, we were showing 18 atoms chosen at random from the 441 filters from the dictionary. We initially thought that this \"blind\" shuffling would be a fair representation of the data, but as revealed by point 5, this was not true. We have now changed the strategy by now showing  \"the upper and lower row respectively show the least and most probably selected atoms.\"  (see captions of figures 1 and 3). This now shows clearly the qualitative improvement in using a proper homeostasis and in particular that using the $\\ell_2$ normalization leads to the emergence of filters which are aberrant (too or not enough selective). In particular, we now show quantitatively the probability of choice of each atom - showing that most active filters are used twice more as least active ones.\n\nFinally, we have made an extensive pass on the manuscript to take into account the different points  and make sure that this approach derived from biological vision is relevant for the audience at ICLR.\n\nAs such, we believe this major change in the way we present the work, both in the quality of the resulting filters and in the generality of the results, have significantly changed the scope of our work to justify its acceptance to ICLR.
