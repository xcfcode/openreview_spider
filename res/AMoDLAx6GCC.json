The basic idea is to use an auxiliary \"meta model\" that (in the authors' best performing setting) has access to the base model and is trained jointly with it. The purpose of the meta model is to predict the error characteristics of the base model, which of course naturally leads to error bars. In order to account for the fact that the models errors on the train set are unlikely to be representative, the authors make use of a validation set on which the meta model is trained further. \n\nThe general idea of using a meta model to predict the error characteristics of a base model potentially has some advantages over existing approaches, including a fairly easy approach to modelling asymmetric error bars and only requiring one forward pass through the full model at test time. I do have some concerns about the experimental evaluation. \n\nA critical gap here is a lack of comparison to a relatively large literature on *explicit* ensembling and (recently) efficient explicit ensembling techniques (e.g., BatchEnsemble) for uncertainty calibration that have worked very well across a variety of complex domains including computer vision, natural language processing and sequence modelling, and model based reinforcement learning. For purely neural network based approaches, many would argue that these ensembling techniques represent the current state of the art.\n\nSome details of the experimental setup were a little unclear. Since the datasets hard a time component, how were DEV and DEV2 sets chosen relative to test? Can the authors confirm that the TRAIN set always occurred strictly before the DEV and TEST sets in time, and that the DEV sets occurred strictly before the TEST set in time? To be frank, some of the uncertainty intervals in 1D are shockingly good if this is pure extrapolation, with the uncertainty estimates seeming to always vary almost perfectly with the true error. If this were a consistent feature of the model, particularly with asymmetric uncertainty outputs, I would imagine it would be straightforward to dramatically improve mean predictive performance as well using information from the meta model, which seems surprising.\n\nHow much of the benefit is due to the additional tuning on a dev set? For example, suppose you tuned a standard heteroskedastic NN's variance outputs on a dev set? Why the decision to focus specifically on sequence modelling? I think the inclusion of WBMS and BBMS as training settings is largely unnecessary, to be frank, in particular the inclusion of BBMS. I think it would be very rare that we would need to augment a blackbox model with uncertainty estimates rather than having the ability to train from scratch to produce a well calibrated model.\n\nI am a little surprised to see the invention of new calibration metrics for regression but not the inclusion of existing metrics for this that have been used in statistics for a long time. Metrics like continuous ranked probability scores do not assume a particular distributional form of output and are well studied and likely to be highly correlated with some of these more slightly ad hoc metrics. The bandwidth \"metric\" is also a little strange as a metric, as it doesn't depend on the true label y and rather just encourages confidence generally.\n\nOn a minor note, most of the plots in the paper suffer from being scaled manually after being generated, which has lead to all of the text being unnaturally stretched.\n\n--------\nAfter author feedback, I feel that the authors did address a number of my points, including one or two that were indeed addressed in the text that I must have simply missed. Therefore, I am improving my score.\n\nThe one point if any that I continue to disagree with the authors on is that variational dropout is sufficient to cover the space of explicit ensembling methods. Many of these \"cost effective\" ensembling approaches still continue to compare to direct explicit ensembling with the very explicit goal of having a baseline that is known to work well but removed from the computational cost concerns. I feel that this comparison should be standard practice.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1221/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1221/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Uncertainty Prediction for Deep Sequential Regression Using Meta Models", "authorids": ["~Jiri_Navratil1", "marnold@us.ibm.com", "benjamin.elder@ibm.com"], "authors": ["Jiri Navratil", "Matthew Arnold", "Benjamin Elder"], "keywords": ["Uncertainty Quantification", "Uncertainty Prediction", "Deep Learning", "Regression", "Meta Modeling"], "abstract": "Generating high quality uncertainty estimates for sequential regression, particularly deep recurrent networks, remains a challenging and open problem.\nExisting approaches often make restrictive assumptions (such as stationarity) yet still perform poorly in practice, particularly in presence of real world non-stationary signals and drift. \nThis paper describes a flexible method that can generate symmetric and asymmetric uncertainty estimates,  makes no assumptions about stationarity, and outperforms competitive baselines on both drift and non drift scenarios.\nThis work helps make sequential regression more effective and practical for use in real-world applications, and is a powerful new addition to the modeling toolbox for sequential uncertainty quantification in general.", "one-sentence_summary": "Meta modeling is highly effective in uncertainty quantification in sequential regression tasks using deep recurrent NNs.

In practice, the paper proposes to jointly train two models: one predicts labels, and another predicts the residuals (can be interpreted as uncertainty measurement). The two loss terms are $\\beta$ weighted and summed together, as in traditional multi-task learning setup. Several variances are evaluated on two datasets: MITV and SPE9PR.\n\n**Pros**\n\nThe authors proposed and studied 3 variances: 1) jointly train base and meta model's weights $\\phi,\\gamma$ with the regression target and the residual term; 2, 3) sequentially train base and meta model's $\\phi,\\gamma$ with/without parameter access of the base model's $\\phi$.\nThe evaluation results on MITV and SPE9PR suggests that Jointly training approach out-performs other variances and is more robust in the presence of dataset and model drift.  The evaluation metrics consists of Missrate, Bandwidth, Excess and Deficit (Fig 3), which are well designed for the sequence regression and uncertainty prediction task.\n\n**Cons**\n\nThe main idea of the paper is to utilize meta-modeling to jointly train a meta model to estimate the error behavior of the base model.  However \"meta-modeling\" is not a new concept, and it is usually referred to as meta-learning and learning-to-learn in the literature.  The later normally requires compute the gradient of gradient (or with its first-order approximation, like MAML and Reptile) or directly predicting weights of a neural network. The proposed approach doesn't really fit into this category, as  the weight of base and meta model $\\phi,\\gamma$ are separately learnt in a multi-task fashion (e.g., there are 2 tasks in this setup: one is the regression task for the base model and the other is the residual prediction task for the meta model).\n\nI also think predicting the asymmetric residual bound loss term (eq 2) might confuse the meta-model. Would meta-model's predicted upper bound still be meaningful if it thinks the prediction is less than the regression target?\n\nThe two evaluation datasets are on limited domains. The second one is from a physics-based simulator instead of from real-world data collection. Have the author consider doing evaluation on a more broader domains to demonstrate the proposed approach can bring consistent gains? \n\nLastly, since the drift are of different nature for the two eval dataset (data drift vs model drift), perhaps worth using different names in Table 2 (data drift for SPE9PR and model drift for MITV) \n \n\n**Reason for the decision**\n\nThis paper attempts to introduce meta-learning to the sequence regression and uncertainty prediction task. The evaluation results are encouraging among a few variances and baselines, and the metrics are well thought of.  However the main reason for me to give marginally reject is that: 1. the approach doesn't really fit into the meta-learning category and 2. the two evaluation datasets are on somewhat limited domains. \n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1221/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1221/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Uncertainty Prediction for Deep Sequential Regression Using Meta Models", "authorids": ["~Jiri_Navratil1", "marnold@us.ibm.com", "benjamin.elder@ibm.com"], "authors": ["Jiri Navratil", "Matthew Arnold", "Benjamin Elder"], "keywords": ["Uncertainty Quantification", "Uncertainty Prediction", "Deep Learning", "Regression", "Meta Modeling"], "abstract": "Generating high quality uncertainty estimates for sequential regression, particularly deep recurrent networks, remains a challenging and open problem.\nExisting approaches often make restrictive assumptions (such as stationarity) yet still perform poorly in practice, particularly in presence of real world non-stationary signals and drift. \nThis paper describes a flexible method that can generate symmetric and asymmetric uncertainty estimates,  makes no assumptions about stationarity, and outperforms competitive baselines on both drift and non drift scenarios.\nThis work helps make sequential regression more effective and practical for use in real-world applications, and is a powerful new addition to the modeling toolbox for sequential uncertainty quantification in general.", "one-sentence_summary": "Meta modeling is highly effective in uncertainty quantification in sequential regression tasks using deep recurrent NNs.
