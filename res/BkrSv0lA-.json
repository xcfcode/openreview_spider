However, what is shown in that paper is that the sequence of loss function values converges, which does not imply that the sequence of weight estimates also converges, because of the presence of a non-convex constraint ($b_j^t \\in Q^{n_l}$).

For full-precision networks, the cost of WX is (M+A)rsn, where M and A are the computation costs of 32-bit floating-point multiplication and addition respectively. With the proposed ternarization, WX is computed by steps 3-5 in Algorithm 3. For illustration, we use the approximate solver (Algorithm 2) to compute the scaling parameter \\alpha and ternarized value b (invoked in Step 3 of Algorithm 3). With fixed b, computing \\alpha takes 2rs multiplications and 2rs additions. With fixed \\alpha, computing b takes rs comparisons. Assume that alternating minimization is run for k steps (empirically, k<=10), the computation cost of ternarization using Algorithm 2 is k(2M+2A+U)rs, where U is the computation cost of 32-bit floating-point comparison. Moreover, Steps 4 and 5 of Algorithm 3 take sn multiplications and rsn additions respectively. Thus the total cost for the product is Arsn + Msn + k(2M+2A+U)rs, and the speedup ratio is S = ((M+A) rsn)/(Arsn + Msn + k(2M+2A+U)rs), which is approximately (M+A)/A (some terms can be omitted as usually r >> 1 and n >>1, and k is very small). Following (Hubara et al, 2016), we consider the implication on power in 45nm technology (with A = 0.9J, and M=3.7J). Substituting into the ratio above, the energy reduction is then approximately 5. For the other ternarization algorithms such as TWN and TTQ, they also need at least sn multiplications and rsn additions for the product of WX, and thus the computation cost is similar to the proposed LAT_a.\n- Details and complexity analysis for the other models will be provided in the final version of the paper.\n\n2. \"discussion on the results in Table 2\"\n\n- The quantized LSTM performs better than full-precision network because deep networks often have larger-than-needed capacities, and so are less affected by the limited expressiveness of quantized weights. Besides, low-bit quantization acts as regularization, and so contributes positively to the performance. We will add the discussion in the final version of the paper.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Loss-aware Weight Quantization of Deep Networks", "abstract": "The huge size of deep networks hinders their use in small computing devices.

Consequently, there is not a great degree of novelty in terms of the proposed method\"\n\n- Please see our reply to reviewer 1 above.\n\n2. \"the results are only slightly better than those of previous methods\"\n\n- The testing errors on these data sets are often only a few percent, and so the improvements may appear small. To have a clearer comparison, we added the percentage degradation of classification error as compared to the full-precision network in Table 1 (https://www.dropbox.com/s/miquko7qhff9kns/iclr2018_rebuttal.pdf?dl=0). \n- As can be seen, among the weight-ternarized networks, the proposed LAT and its variants achieve much smaller performance degradation on all four data sets. Existing methods often have large degradation, while ours has <3% degradation on MNIST and <1% on the other three data sets. On CIFAR-100, the proposed LAT and its variants achieve even better results than the full-precision network.\n- For recurrent networks, we similarly added the percentage degradation of cross-entropy in Table 2. As can be seen, the proposed weight ternarization is the only method that performs even better than the full-precision counterpart on all three data sets. On the Linux Kernel and Penn Treebank data sets, the proposed LAT and its variants even have >5% performance gain. On the War and Peace dataset, the proposed LAT and its variants are the only methods that achieve significantly better results than the full-precision network. \n\n3. \"it can't be simply stated that the algorithm converges\"\n\n- On the theory side, we can only show convergence of the objective value. We will clarify this in the final version of the paper. \n- Empirically, the quantized weight also converges, as can be seen from the convergence of $\\alpha$ in Figure 1(b).\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Loss-aware Weight Quantization of Deep Networks", "abstract": "The huge size of deep networks hinders their use in small computing devices.

In Hou et al. (2017), the optimal closed-form solution for loss-aware binarization can be derived easily. However, for ternarization, the optimal \\alpha and b (in Proposition 3.2) cannot be easily solved. A straightforward solution would require combinatorial search. Instead, we proposed an exact solver (Algorithm 1) which relies only on sorting. This can be further simplified to an efficient alternating minimization procedure (Algorithm 2). The same situation applies to m-bit quantization. \n\n2. \"there are some analogous extension ideas (Lin et al., 2016b, Li & Liu, 2016b). Algorithm 2 and section 3.2 and 3.3 can be seen as additive complementary\"\n\n- While analogous extension ideas have been proposed, their weight solutions obtained are not rigorously derived. Specifically, ternary-connect (Lin et al., 2016b) performs simple stochastic quantization, but does not relate that to any quality measure (e.g., the loss, or distance between the quantized and full-precision weights). In TWN (Li & Liu, 2016b), obtaining the theoretical optimal solution is time-consuming and so they used a heuristic instead. In this paper, we explicitly consider the quantization effect to the loss (as in Hou et al (2017)). However, the resultant optimization problem is much more difficult than theirs as explained above.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Loss-aware Weight Quantization of Deep Networks", "abstract": "The huge size of deep networks hinders their use in small computing devices.
