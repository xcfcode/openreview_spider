As this is an open discussion phase, we would value your feedback to our replies to better understand how we can improve the paper. We will incorporate the obvious improvements right away, and the rest as a function of the feedback in the open discussion phase.\n\nConcerning the points you make:\n\n  (1): In streaming settings, prior, data-driven initialization is impossible because data are not (yet) available. Even if they were, k-means scales very badly for huge high-dimensional datasets so it becomes impractical. And the experiments of Secs. 4.1 and 4.3 clearly show that data-driven and random initializations perform equally well. So the advantage is: we can achieve the same results as with k-means, but in scenarios where k-means is unfeasible or impossible. \n  \n  (2): We feel that SGD requires no special mathematical analysis here, and that is probably not what you meant anyway. For the annealing, please refer to the appendix A.2 for an analysis. We show that $\\sigma$ always imposes an upper bound on the loss we are optimizing, and that we can improve the loss by decreasing $\\sigma$ except when $\\sigma \\rightarrow 0$, demonstrating that adaptive annealing is stable. We could move this to the main text, would you consider that helpful?\n  \n  (3): Thank you for pointing this out, we have stated this more clearly (top of p8).\n  We do NOT wish to show that our SGD can outperform sEM by a large margin, nor do we think this is generally possible. After all, sEM makes use of strong theoretical guarantees that do not hold for SGD. However, SGD can do just as well as sEM, or slightly better, which is surprising given the reasons just mentioned. \n\n  There is one aspect where SGD outperforms sEM by a large margin: for very high-dimensional data like SVHN and Fruits (Tab. 3, discussed at the top of p. 8). Here, sEM does not converge well without using k-means but SGD does and performs much better. We have added another Figure to the main text(Fig.3), plus some text (p7) explaining why this is the case.\n  \n  (4): We agree. This experiment is just an \"interesting fact\" without any theory behind it, and not extremely important for the message of the paper. It might be better to skip this experiment in favor of some more analytical contribution you mentioned earlier.

This is a very fair point, thanks for pointing it out: The experiment 4.4 is purely empirical and the claimed justification for the observed effect (which is plainly there) is not very rigorous. On the other hand, adding, e.g., an EWC term to the loss or performing generative replay would be beyond the scope and space of this paper. As the message of this experiment is not really a key point of the paper, we might simply drop it, and the associated claim, in favor of elaborating more on the key claims (cf. you other suggestions) and treat incremental learning for GMMs in a separate paper. What do you think? --> Update: Ok we went ahead and did it anyway\n  \n  5. We have added empirical results (left col in Tab.3) that show that this approximation holds, in all experiments, to an extremely high degree of precision, and a theoretical justification of this fact. As for the approximation itself, we elaborate on p. 3, Sec. 3.2, how this max-component approximation is derived from the \"classical\" GMM log-likelihood. Is that not exactly what you mean by \"how it is related the classical GMM, to what extent it is an approximation\"? \n  \n  6. We have added a new experiment (A.6) showing that higher K is helpful for density estimation, and a discussion of finding a good K for clustering (discussion section, A.6).\nTo respond to your concerns:\n  1) If we use the trained GMMs for clustering, we would use the conventional approaches developed for GMM/k-means to determine an optimal number of components. The fact that we train GMMs by SGD (instead of sEM or EM) should not impact these methods in any way, and thus there is not need for new contributions here (--> p8, discussion of \"hyper-parameter selection guidelines\")\n  2) When performing density estimation, the number of mixture components follows a \"the more the better\" principle as elaborated on p. 8 (\"Hyper-parameter selection guidelines\").

As this is an open discussion phase, we would value your feedback to our replies to better understand how we can improve the paper. We will incorporate the obvious improvements right away, and the rest as a function of the feedback in the open discussion phase.\n\nAnswer to the general text(\"lack of clarity\"): \n  \n  Could you please elaborate where precisely you do not find our paper sufficiently clear and what we could do about that? Your statement (\"However I feel that ...\") sounds like a summary judgement of the whole paper, and it is hard to improve the paper based on that. In Sec. 1.3 (contributions), we present a bullet-list of contributions: if we tried to put this more concisely and reduce the number of bullet points, would that make the paper more clear?\n\nConcerning the specific comments:\n  1. Point taken, we rephrased the contributions to that effect. To answer your concerns: Annealing is not novel or remarkable in itself. What is novel is its use in GMM/SGD training which has never been proposed before, and which gives good results.\n  \n  2. First point: the max-component approximation is more loose than Jensen (easy to show). Second point: it is still an extremely good approximation for high-dimensional data. We measured that all GMM responsibilities are > 0.99 throughout all experiments, and we qdeed q new experiment to the paper showing these results (--> middle of p.7 and Tab.3)  which justify our approximation. Since this can be expected to hold only for high data dimensions, the paper is restricted to the high-dimensional case (cf. paper title). \n  \n  3. Interesting point: we will add a statement to the discussion elaborating on this in the final version (more space). To answer the question here: this might work for the degenerate solutions but not for sparse-component ones. The sparse-component solutions seem to represent very broad basins of attraction, so perturbing the parameters will in general only lead back to sparse-component solutions. \n  \n  4. Very good point, thank you: We added a simple experiment showing the value of annealing to the experiments section (--> 4.2). To answer the question: The value of annealing is established by the fact that training never converges when not using annealing (i.e., having a small constant $\\sigma$), independently of the used dataset. This can be observed in the prototypes but also from the loss function values which are consistently higher with annealing turned on.\n  \n  5. Point taken, notation has been be improved, mainly in Algo. 1\n  \n  6. Thanks for pointing this out, we have made this more precise (--> Sec. 4). To answer the question: identical means \"identical hyper-parameters but different seeds for random initialization\", so as to exclude/reduce the impact of a particular random initialization (similar as for DNN training)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3386/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3386/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Gradient-based training of Gaussian Mixture Models for High-Dimensional Streaming Data", "authorids": ["~Alexander_Gepperth1", "~Benedikt_Pf\u00fclb1"], "authors": ["Alexander Gepperth", "Benedikt Pf\u00fclb"], "keywords": ["Gaussian Mixture Models", "Stochastic Gradient Descent", "Unsupervised Representation Learning", "Continual Learning"], "abstract": "We present an approach for efficiently training Gaussian Mixture Models by SGD on non-stationary, high-dimensional streaming data.\nOur training scheme does not require data-driven parameter initialization (e.g., k-means) and has the ability to process high-dimensional samples without numerical problems.\nFurthermore, the approach allows mini-batch sizes as low as 1, typical for streaming-data settings, and it is possible to react and adapt to changes in data statistics (concept drift/shift) without catastrophic forgetting.\nMajor problems in such streaming-data settings are undesirable local optima during early training phases and numerical instabilities due to high data dimensionalities.%, and catastrophic forgetting when encountering concept drift.\nWe introduce an adaptive annealing procedure to address the first problem,%, which additionally plays a decisive role in controlling the \\acp{GMM}' reaction to concept drift.\nwhereas numerical instabilities are eliminated by using an exponential-free approximation to the standard \\ac{GMM} log-likelihood.\nExperiments on a variety of visual and non-visual benchmarks show that our SGD approach can be trained completely without, for instance, k-means based centroid initialization, and compares favorably to sEM, an online variant of EM.", "one-sentence_summary": "We present a method to train Gaussian Mixture Models by SGD, which requires no prior k-means initialization as EM does, and is thus feasible for streaming data.

As this is an open discussion phase, we would value your feedback to our replies to better understand how we can improve the paper. We will incorporate the obvious improvements right away, and the rest as a function of the feedback in the open discussion phase.\n\nResponse to the questions in the text: \n\n  K-means initialization would require having all the data at your disposal which is excluded in streaming settings so we simply cannot do that. And k-means does not scale well to huge high-dimensional datasets which is another point against it in the targeted scenario. \n \nResponses to the mentioned issues:\n\n  1.1 We chose the number of epochs large enough such that annealing always converged in all experiments, for simplicitly. In practice, one would terminate training once a certain annealing radius is reached --> extremely simple scheme, thus of advantage. We added a statement to that effect to the experiments section (--> 4.4)\n\n  1.2 We added experimental results  (--> Tab.3  ) showing that responsibilities are peaked to an extremely high degree (always > 0.99) for all datasets. The reason is the high data dimensionality which leads to large inter-component distances, so the distance to the closest centroid is much larger than the distance to the next-closest one. Since this does not hold for low data dimensions, the paper is restricted to the high-dimensional case (cf. paper title)\n\n  2. Please look on page 3, at the end of Sec. 3.2, we do give a concrete example for numerical instabilies (underflow: a value is taken to be 0 when it is not) which can easily lead to NaNs in later stages. Is that the example you wanted to see?\n  \n  3. Please see p. 5, at the very beginning of Sec. 4: we clearly state that the mini-batch size is always set to 1, in all experiments, to closely emulate a streaming setting (cf. paper title). \n  SGD is always applied after a sample is processed, for each sample in 2 epochs.

However I feel that paper is not presented with sufficient clarity to pass the ICLR bar and the exposition could be greatly improved. It is hard for me to grasp the key findings or takeaways in the paper wrt to other existing baseline methods.\n\nI also have some specific comments:\n\n- The contributions sub-section in 1.3 are vague to read, instead of simply saying - \"a novel method\", \"an automatic annealing procedure\" it would be useful to explicitly state what is novel / automatic etc - this would make it easier for the reader to understand the novelty/exact technical contributions made by the authors\n\n- In section 3.2, I am curious how the max-component approximation lower bound compares to the other lower bounds used in EM (e.g. Jensen derived lower bound or evidence lower bound in Variational Inference)? To me the presented lower bound seems like inefficient and loose (e.g. if the values are close in magnitude, then intuitively the gap between the sum and max is going to be very large). Maybe I am mistaken in understanding this bound, but it would need some more explanation and it should be contrasted with the vanilla lower bounds used in EM.\n\n- In section 3.3, the authors mention updating a subset of components to break the symmetry. I am curious how a baseline of simply perturbing the GMM parameters randomly would perform since that would also help break the symmetry?\n\n- I liked the idea of using annealing to avoid local optima and this seems to be one of the key contributions of this work in my opinion. One of my main questions here is: how did the authors measure the value addition of annealing? Did they compare the final solutions obtained by the proposed approach with a baseline (without any annealing) that uses random initialization to deal with local optima?\n\n- Notations in the paper could be improved further to make it more readable. For e.g. in Algorithm 1, the iteration steps are missing in the updates (would be good to use t=1, 2, ..T and use them in the update equations since it is not clear which iterate time steps the parameters on the RHS belong to). Also, maybe I missed this while reading but prec_clipping(..) doesn't seem to be defined near the algorithm section. \n\n- I found some vague statements in the Empirical section which raises lot of follow up questions. Would suggest making the description and analysis of the results more precise. e.g. In the beginning of section 4, authors say: \".. repeated 10 times with identical parameters..\" -> what does identical mean? what was varied?\n\n\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3386/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3386/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Gradient-based training of Gaussian Mixture Models for High-Dimensional Streaming Data", "authorids": ["~Alexander_Gepperth1", "~Benedikt_Pf\u00fclb1"], "authors": ["Alexander Gepperth", "Benedikt Pf\u00fclb"], "keywords": ["Gaussian Mixture Models", "Stochastic Gradient Descent", "Unsupervised Representation Learning", "Continual Learning"], "abstract": "We present an approach for efficiently training Gaussian Mixture Models by SGD on non-stationary, high-dimensional streaming data.\nOur training scheme does not require data-driven parameter initialization (e.g., k-means) and has the ability to process high-dimensional samples without numerical problems.\nFurthermore, the approach allows mini-batch sizes as low as 1, typical for streaming-data settings, and it is possible to react and adapt to changes in data statistics (concept drift/shift) without catastrophic forgetting.\nMajor problems in such streaming-data settings are undesirable local optima during early training phases and numerical instabilities due to high data dimensionalities.%, and catastrophic forgetting when encountering concept drift.\nWe introduce an adaptive annealing procedure to address the first problem,%, which additionally plays a decisive role in controlling the \\acp{GMM}' reaction to concept drift.\nwhereas numerical instabilities are eliminated by using an exponential-free approximation to the standard \\ac{GMM} log-likelihood.\nExperiments on a variety of visual and non-visual benchmarks show that our SGD approach can be trained completely without, for instance, k-means based centroid initialization, and compares favorably to sEM, an online variant of EM.", "one-sentence_summary": "We present a method to train Gaussian Mixture Models by SGD, which requires no prior k-means initialization as EM does, and is thus feasible for streaming data.
