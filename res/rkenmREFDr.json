The\nscheme is theoretically motivated and the empirical results\ndemonstrates the utility of the proposed scheme against various\nbaselines.  \n\n\nWhile the paper presents a promising new direction for\nnearest-neighbor search with space partitioning schemes, I am somewhat\non the border, leaning towards reject. This is mostly due to my lack\nof understanding why Cayton & Dasgupta (2007) and Li et al. (2011) are\nnot valid baselines and are dismissed as \"hyperplane\npartitions\". It would be very helpful to me as a reader to understand\nwhy this literature does not warrant to be a valid\nbaseline. Especially given the following connection points:\n\n- Firstly, the theoretical results presented by the authors also\n  limit to hyperplane splits. \n- Secondly, the authors present empirical evaluation of recursive\n  hyperplane partitions where the proposed scheme is the only learning\n  based scheme while the techniques presented in Cayton & Dasgupta\n  (2007) and Li et al. (2011) would have been the learning based\n  partitioning baseline to beat.\n- Thirdly, LSH space partitioning is considered as a baseline in\n  Section 4.2 with the Neural LSH and Neural Catalyzer + k-means being\n  the only learning based baseline; Cayton & Dasgupta (2007)'s learned\n  LSH scheme would have been a valid baseline to the best of my\n  understanding. \n- Finally, the authors mention the need for coupling the graph\n  partitioning and the supervised learning phase. Li et al., 2011\n  utilizes a loss function that essentially promotes a sparse graph\n  cut while preserving near-neighborhoods, providing the closely\n  coupled scheme. In the original paper, the authors utilize a\n  recursive hyperplane partitioning scheme. However, a neural network\n  with a softmax layer can be trained to minimize this closely coupled\n  loss directly, obviating the need for the separate graph\n  partitioning and supervised learning phases proposed in this\n  paper. But it is possible that I have misinterpreted the connection\n  and any clarification here would be very helpful.\n\nMinor:\n\n- It would be very helpful as a reader to understand how sensitive the\n  neural network based partioning scheme is to the network\n  architecture and hyperparameters. Some intuition behind the choices\n  would be very useful.\n- It is a little unclear how the plots in Figure 2 are generated --\n  for each query, we would have access to the accuracy vs. number of\n  candidates curve.

Given that not all queries\n  in all the methods (including the proposed ones) will have the same\n  sequences of accuracies, the quantile curve is especially unclear.\n- The authors mention that neural LSH is only useful when the bin\n  sizes are large, and otherwise k-means is more useful. Is there a\n  straightforward way to decide when to switch between the two?

Since the \"wall clock\" running time depends on the specific setting/architecture, we decided to focus on architecture-independent metrics.  \n\n> what happens to baseline algorithms when they are given more \"capacity\"\n\nIndeed, this is an important point. We address it at the bottom of page 6. Specifically, we believe the larger model size is acceptable for Neural LSH, since in many target applications (e.g., the distributed setting) the bottleneck in the high accuracy regime is the memory accesses needed to retrieve candidates and the further processing. The model size is not a hindrance as long as does not exceed certain reasonable limits, e.g., it should fit into a CPU cache.\n\nWe also note that in the aforementioned scenarios the number of partitions is defined by the architecture of the system and cannot be adjusted/optimized.

Some intuition behind the choices would be very useful.\n\nThrough experimenting with various network architectures, we found that the partitioning results are not sensitive to the network architecture and many of the hyperparameters. Therefore, in choosing our network architecture, we optimized for the size of the neural networks to be small, for fast evaluation.\nThe effect of hyperparameters is studied in Figure 5 in appendix B. To summarize, the hyperparameter that the model is most sensitive to is S, the number of nearest neighbors whose bins are used as labels for training. Our experiments show that increasing S improves the accuracy noticeably, up to a certain point, and then the accuracy saturates (but does not degrade), cf. Fig 5(b).\n\n\n> it is unclear how the curves are aggregated across queries to generate average number of candidates (and 0.95 quantile) vs. accuracy curves.\n\nTo produce the plots we vary $m$, the number of bins searched (in multi-probe fashion) per query. That is, for each fixed m, we search for the nearest neighbor of each query in the m nearest bin to that query (including the one containing it). This gives us a number of candidates (total number of datapoints in those m bins) and a 0/1 success rate (whether the nearest neighbor is in those bins or not) per query. We average both of these (for a fixed $m$) over all queries to produce a single point on the curve. The curve is produced by gradually increasing $m$.\n\n> What are the conditions on the nonlinear splits that allows the guarantees to improve (or at least not degrade)? Is it obviously always improved?\n\nA priori we cannot give such a guarantee. In practice, we rely on the fact that the Cheeger inequality is often too pessimistic and much sparser cuts exist (not necessarily induced by hyperplanes). At the same time, if we assume that neural networks are \u201cuniversal approximators\u201d, then we expect them to capture such cut using not too many parameters.\n\n\n> The authors mention that neural LSH is only useful when the bin sizes are large, and otherwise k-means is more useful. Is there a straightforward way to decide when to switch between the two? Is it another hyperparameter we need to tune over while generating these space partitions?\n\nNeural LSH is useful whenever there are sufficient data points per bin so the network does not overfit to the training set. A good way to determine when to use k-means instead is when the model achieves low accuracy on the validation set. Practically, through our experiments, we found that reducing the network capacity, adding regularizations to the loss, and dropouts are effective ways of avoiding overfitting, and making neural LSH outperform k-means even in cases where there are fewer than 100 points per bin.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1052/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1052/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Space Partitions for Nearest Neighbor Search", "authors": ["Yihe Dong", "Piotr Indyk", "Ilya Razenshteyn", "Tal Wagner"], "authorids": ["yihedong@gmail.com", "indyk@mit.edu", "ilyaraz@microsoft.com", "tal.wagner@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["space partition", "lsh", "locality sensitive hashing", "nearest neighbor search"], "TL;DR": "We use supervised learning (and in particular deep learning) to produce better space partitions for fast nearest neighbor search.", "abstract": "Space partitions of $\\mathbb{R}^d$ underlie a vast and important\nclass of fast nearest neighbor search (NNS) algorithms.

Indeed, both Cayton & Dasgupta (2007) and Li et al. (2011) are valid baselines. We have contacted the authors of both works, but unfortunately, there are no publicly available implementation. We implemented and tuned these algorithms in the rebuttal timeframe, and produced results in the following settings:\n\nFor binary tree partitions, we include the results of Li et al. (2011) and Cayton & Dasgupta (2007) KD-tree on the SIFT dataset. We will include GloVe and MNIST in the final version.

(2011) and Cayton & Dasgupta (2007) RCS-LSH on both SIFT and GloVe, with 1 level (both 16 and 256 parts). We will include the 2-level experiments, and the results for MNIST, in the final version.

However, that paper mentions that they do not observe improvement over classic LSH (which is included in our experiments) on MNIST, due to the uniformity of random projections - a property shared also by SIFT and GloVe. Nonetheless we will include the baseline to draw a complete picture.\nRe:\u201cthe authors mention the need for coupling the graph partitioning and the supervised learning phase\u201d: Our algorithm makes no such coupling; we mentioned this as a possible avenue of improvement in future work. We thank you for bringing to our attention that the same approach has been utilized by Li et al. (2011), and have added this to the discussion in Section 5. Since Li et al. (2011) do not discuss or experiment with neural networks, it is hard to say a priori how would combining this idea into their framework would perform, and this is an exciting area for future work.\n\nWe are hoping that the above experiments address the main concern from your review. We will continue running the algorithms to evaluate their performance in all of our experimental settings, and will include the results in the final version of the paper. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1052/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1052/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Space Partitions for Nearest Neighbor Search", "authors": ["Yihe Dong", "Piotr Indyk", "Ilya Razenshteyn", "Tal Wagner"], "authorids": ["yihedong@gmail.com", "indyk@mit.edu", "ilyaraz@microsoft.com", "tal.wagner@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["space partition", "lsh", "locality sensitive hashing", "nearest neighbor search"], "TL;DR": "We use supervised learning (and in particular deep learning) to produce better space partitions for fast nearest neighbor search.", "abstract": "Space partitions of $\\mathbb{R}^d$ underlie a vast and important\nclass of fast nearest neighbor search (NNS) algorithms.

To this end, the paper provides the following procedure:\n1. Build an exact k nearest neighbor graph of the provided dataset.\n2. Partition this graph into m balanced sets while minimize inter-partition edges.\n3. Train a neural net or linear model to predict the partition for each point. They also propose creating hierarchical partitions in the same way and also propose training with \"soft\" partition labels.\n\nAt test time, the trained model is used to predict probably partitions which are then searched over for nearest neighbors. The authors compare this technique to, most notably, a k-means based technique where centroids are used to partition the space. They show that on Glove and SIFT datasets, the neural partitioning approach is more accurate i.e. it can correctly identify correct nearest neighbors significantly more than k-means.\n\n######\nPros:\n1. This proposed approach of using neural techniques to build partitions of space for fast nearest neighbors is novel. While k-means-style techniques have been proposed to learn index structures, this is the first application of neural techniques as far as I can tell.\n2. The paper is well-written and is easy to read. The experiments are sufficiently detailed and well documented.\n\nCons:\n1. Experiments: The paper reports the number of correct neighbors obtained while searching on average and at 0.95 quantile. However, the core motivation of the paper is *fast* nearest neighbors search. In that vein, the metric of interest must incorporate time e.g. queries per second at a fixed level of accuracy. This is not new -- e.g. the benchmarks provided by Andoni and co-authors are evaluated on a QPS basis (https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks). The same holds for Amueller et al. \n2. Baselines: A related point is, what happens to baseline algorithms when they are given more \"capacity\". E.g. comparing with k-means baselines with a significantly large value of k or a multi-level k-means algorithm (e.g. considered by \"FAST APPROXIMATE NEAREST NEIGHBORS WITH AUTOMATIC ALGORITHM CONFIGURATION\" by Muje and Lowe). The comparison in the paper with k-means baseline with k=50 does not seem fair here. E.g. a hierarchical neural LSH approach with 256 partitions at top and 10 k means partitions at the second level performs 2560 distance computations. Alternatively, the authors can directly compare QPS as stated above.\n3. The proof provided in the appendix is not entirely clear. E.g. after step 3, how does the next step (before (4)) follow? It is easy to see the denominator but the numerator is not clear.\n\n\nSuggestions:\n1.
