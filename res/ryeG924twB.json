Here are our responses to your questions (we would like to start with Question 4): \n\nQ4 (part 1/2):\u201d Whether our problem is widely studied and the contributions to the RL community.\u201d\n\nWe would like to highlight that Stackelberg (leader-follower) Games (SGs) with RL solvers have been explored in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and RL community for decades (Tharakunnel et al., 2007; Mguni et al., 2019, Cheng et al., 2017, Sabbadin & Viet, 2013, Sabbadin & Viet, 2016, Laumonier & Chaib-draa, 2005). However, most of these methods only focus on simple matrix games or small-scale Markov games and it is very difficult to extend them to handle complicated (large-scale states) Stackelberg Markov games (the problem we solve) because the training process is hard to stabilize in those environments as shown in our experiments. This is the reason why only a few papers focus on these environments. \n\nThe large-scale states/ actions SMGs are also significant because they can model some real-world problems better than the matrix games and the small-scale SMGs. That is, in our real world, many non-cooperative groups naturally change with time and with large-scale states, e.g., the order dispatching for a taxi company in a city where the environment is the whole city and the state and action change with time [3]. Other examples include the league and the soccer clubs as well as the manager and employees. Therefore, investigating the large-scale states/ actions SMGs is very important for many real-world applications.\n\nWe believe that investigating these complicated SMGs can provide a novel solution for non-cooperative multi-agent coordination. Nowadays, most of the prevailing deep MARL methods assume that the agents selflessly cooperate to maximize the global rewards, which is not true in many real-world non-cooperative scenarios (e.g., the order dispatch for taxi, the league and the soccer clubs, as well as the manager and employees). Taking the order dispatch for the taxi fleet as an example, order dispatch is a well-known application scenario for MARL [3,5]. However, many existing methods only consider how to maximize the total income of the company by forcing the drivers to accept the order which they may not be willing to. The learned strategy might not be efficient because the unsatisfied drivers may choose to deviate. On the contrary, our proposed method realistically assumes that drivers are self-interested. Therefore, exploring the SMGs and their solutions are necessary to learn efficient policies in many real-world applications. We add more real-world examples in the Introduction Section, on page 1.\n\nBesides that, our proposed method might inspire other areas in RL community, including multi-role MARL (our method introduces a training scheme for different roles) as well as hierarchical RL (our EBPG is a novel policy gradient for temporal abstraction). We add more details in the Conclusion Remarks Section, on page 9. We really hope our method would shed light on efficient MARL algorithm design involving self-interested agents.  \n\n\nQ4 (part 2/2):\u201d Compare MADDPG.\u201d\n\nMADDPG is not a valid baseline for our method due to the following reasons:\n1. Our problem has two kinds of players: the leader and the followers, where the leader move first and the followers best-respond to the leader\u2019s policy. Therefore, the leader and the follower cannot be trained simultaneously. However, in MADDPG, all players are trained simultaneously. Therefore, we cannot directly add the leader role into the MADDPG framework. \n2. On the other hand, we can use MADDPG only to train the followers. The training scheme can be depicted as follows: given the leader\u2019s policy, we train followers by MADDPG, then we update the leader\u2019s policy. It is our leader with DDPG-based followers structure and the only change between our method and this structure is the followers\u2019 strategies (from the action abstraction policy gradient to the deterministic policy gradient). We have tried this scheme (with the Gumbel-SoftMax trick, since we focus on the discrete action space) at the very beginning of this work, as well as using other methods to train followers such as Q-learning, vanilla policy gradient. However, this training scheme cannot converge in a mild time limit, due to the complicated interactions among leaders and followers. That is also the reason why we design our action abstraction policy gradient. \n3. The environments in [2] are open-sourced and widely used in the MARL community. We make lots of modifications to make them suitable for our problem (e.g. we add different gains for finishing different tasks by different agents). The new environments in our work are totally different from those in [2], therefore, the method in [2] cannot be used in our new environments (Details can be found in the Section D.1, on page 19).

The main results are in the table below:  \n\nModules                                       \nEBPG                                                     | +     | +     |       |        | +     | +      |          |         |\nLeader-follower consistency            | +     |        | +    |        | +     |         | +       |         |\nAction abstraction policy gradient  | +     | +     | +    | +     |        |         |          |          |\nFinal reward                                        | 8.12 |6.26 |4.18|3.48 |-0.02|-0.03 |-0.05 |-0.05 |\n\u2018+\u2019 means the module is used. This experiment is done in the Resource Collections environment with RL-based followers.\n\nAs shown in the table above, we find that the action abstraction policy gradient is very important to converge for the RL-based followers. Additionally, adding different modules can improve the performance and the method with all the modules reach the highest reward than other combinations. The contribution ranking for each module in is RL-based followers: Action abstraction policy gradient > EBPG > Leader-follower consistency.\n\nQ2:\u201d in equations.\u201d\n\nWe are sorry for making these typos. We fix them and also check the rest of the paper carefully according to your suggestions. Many thanks for reviewing our paper so carefully.\n\n\nQ3:\u201d More insights for the proposed methods.\u201d\n\nWe add more explanations about why we design our network and training scheme, including more details about the assumptions (pages 5-6), the attention module (page 6), as well as the EBPG (page 5). \n\nAdditionally, we would like to discuss more details about the attention module. We do not adopt the scaling factor into our module for two reasons: 1). Our method is inspired by (Chen et al., 2018), which also do not use the scaling factor in their attention module. 2). The scaling approach is mainly used for the scenario that there is a high dimension dot-product operator before the SoftMax layer, which may lead to extremely small gradients and the scaling factor is used to prevent large input [4]. But for our structure, we do not have dot-product operation before the SoftMax layer and our input dimension is also small (only 128*1). Therefore, it is not necessary to introduce the scaling factor (the same statement is also mentioned in [4]). \n\nTo testify our statement, we do an extra experiment on Resource Collections (with rule-based followers) and the results reveal that the final leader\u2019s rewards for the method with and without scaling factor are similar (15.20 v.s. 15.17). Therefore, the scaling factor may not be very helpful.\n\nQ5:\u201d Rearrange the paper.\u201d \n\nWe rearrange the paper by moving the assumptions (now on page 5) and some environment settings (hyper-parameters section, now on page 8) to the main text.

We add more real-world examples in the Introduction Section, on page 1. \n\nMoreover, SMGs provide a novel and significant coordination problem to the RL community: individual agents no longer follow the centralized leader completely, which is different from the commonly seen centralized training methods in Dec-POMDP.

Here are our responses to your comments:\n\nComment_1: \u201cRelationship between EBPG and STRAW.\u201d\n\nWe agree that the high-level idea of our method is related to STRAW [1]. Roughly speaking, STRAW is one of the hierarchical RL methods which maintains two modules: an action-plan module to generate a sequence of actions and a commitment module to decide when to terminate the macro-actions. Our structure has these similar components.\n\nHowever, there are several key differences between our method and STRAW. Specifically, \n\n1). Our method focuses on the non-cooperative environment between the leader (similar to high-level policy in hierarchical RL) and followers (similar to low-level policy in hierarchical RL) with more than two agents. In our problem, the leader can be viewed as the high-level policy while the followers can be regarded as low-level policies. However, different from the commonly seen hierarchical RL, the low-level policies do not always follow the high-level policy. Since the low-level policies and the high-level policy are not always cooperative, they cannot be trained end to end, which are distinct from the STRAW and other hierarchical RL methods where the low-level policies follow the high-level policy completely and can be trained end to end. As shown in our experiments, without the follower\u2019s action abstraction policy gradient and other modules (e.g., the attention-based module, the two-time scale training, as well as the sequential decisions module), it is very difficult (even impossible) to converge. \n\n2). Our macro-action updating method is also different from STRAW. We introduce an event-based probability inference approach to design a novel policy gradient for both the leader\u2019s policy as well as the termination function which is different from the A3C used in STRAW. Moreover, a successor-based value baseline function is further introduced to reduce the variance. Therefore, our method is different from STRAW in many aspects. \n\nThank you for bringing this interesting work to our attention and we cite it in the Related Works section, on page 2. \n\n[1] Vezhnevets, Alexander, et al. \"Strategic attentive writer for learning macro-actions.\" In NeurIPS, pp. 3486-3494, 2016.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper108/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper108/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["shizhy6@mail2.sysu.edu.cn", "runsheng.yu@ntu.edu.sg", "xwang033@e.ntu.edu.sg", "rundong001@e.ntu.edu.sg", "yzhang137@e.ntu.edu.sg", "laihanj3@mail.sysu.edu.cn", "boan@ntu.edu.sg"], "title": "Learning Expensive Coordination: An Event-Based Deep RL Approach", "authors": ["Zhenyu Shi*", "Runsheng Yu*", "Xinrun Wang*", "Rundong Wang", "Youzhi Zhang", "Hanjiang Lai", "Bo An"], "pdf": "/pdf/a0af93829f387e544131364f643d911eb03803ae.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose an event-based policy gradient  to train the leader and an action abstraction policy gradient to train the followers in leader-follower Markov game.", "abstract": "Existing works in deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) mainly focus on coordinating cooperative agents to complete certain tasks jointly.

My major concern about this work is whether the task that this paper follows is widely studied in the reinforcement learning community, as the authors mentioned that only [1] can be used as baseline methods since the other methods can not be applied in their problem. But in general I think this is an interesting paper. Some detailed comments and suggestions:\n\n1. This paper proposed 3 major contributions: event-based policy gradient, leader-follower consistency scheme and action abstraction policy gradient. The authors show the empirical performance comparison for the case with and without each of these techniques in the experiments. It can be seen that all of the 3 techniques help the proposed method perform better. In addition, the proposed method performs better compared to the state-of-the-art method (in [1]). Hence the authors have shown the success of their algorithm empirically. One thing that can be done to improve this paper is to show a joint comparison for the 2 ^ 3 = 8 cases of with / without any of the 3 techniques so that we can gain a better understanding about the effect of these 3 techniques.\n\n2. The authors provide some necessary theoretical derivations to compute the policy gradients. But there are some typos in the equations. For example, the numerator of the equation of the case e_i^k\\not\\in A_T in I(e_i^k) at the bottom of page 4 is incorrect. In addition, the equation on the second last line of page 3 should be P_\\gamma(s_{t+1}, \\omega_t, a_t | s_t, \\omega_{t-1}), not P_\\gamma(s_{t+1}, \\omega_t | s_t, \\omega_{t-1}, a_t).  Please check the details and solve these typos.\n\n3. It will be better if the authors can provide more theoretical analysis or quantitative explanation about the proposed method. For example, why a dense EBPG better than a sparse one? Why the equations in the attention mechanism appear in their form, not some similar forms (e.g. scale the values from the function A before putting them into the softmax function)? Intuitively the proposed techniques make sense, but it will be great if more insights are provided.\n\n4. As I mentioned, I am concerned if the proposed problem is widely studied in the reinforcement learning community. Also, since the authors mentioned in the appendix that two of the tasks are original from [2], but we can not apply the method in [2] as a baseline method. It is possible to modify the method in [2] to fit with the setting and compare with them?\n\n5. It will be better if the authors can rearrange the paper for a little bit, since there are too many important details (e.g. experiment settings, assumptions in the theorems) are in appendix.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Can the authors try to modify the method in [2] and compare with it (details in my comment 4)?\n\nReference:\n\n[1] Tianmin Shu and Yuandong Tian.

The supplementary material is longer than the main paper, and almost half of it is additional results.\n\nThe paper could be improved with more discussion of the applications of SMGs, although this could be due to my relative unfamiliarity with the area. For example, this seems immediately relevant to hierarchical RL problems that involve learning to coordinate multiple skills where the optimal subpolicies are incompatible, e.g. multi-robot coordination (or multi-limbed single robot coordination) with collisions.

Summary\n\nThe authors apply MARL to principal-agent / mechanism design problems where selfish agents need to be incentivized to coordinate towards a leader's (collective) goal.\n\nThe leader is modeled as a semi-MDP with event-based policy gradients and modules to model/predict followers' actions. The leader sends messages to followers, an \"event\" is a pair (timestep, message of leader to a follower).\nA `termination' menas that an agent should stop executing the previous selected action; the leader signals as such to the agent.\nWith this modeling step, the authors formulate an event-based policy gradient, which considers models for which goal to send to followers and when.\n\nThe authors compare this approach on 4 environments with M3RL, which also solves (extensions of) principal-agent problems.\n\n2. Decision (accept or reject) with one or two key reasons for this choice.\n\nWeak accept.\n\n3. Supporting arguments\n\nThe approach seems sound and conceptually related to a multi-agent generalization of STRAW https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04695.pdf, where a planner predicts / commits to an action-plan for a single agent.\n\n4.
