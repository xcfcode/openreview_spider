Some of the fine-tunings used include deploying different discount factors on multiple different reward channels for reward shaping.\n\nThe claimed novel contributions of the paper are (1) a new multiagent testbed, (2) a decentralized training procedure, (3) fine-tuning reward shaping, and (4) highlighting the challenges in evaluation in novel multiagent competitive environments.\n\nOverall, my judgment is that the paper is fine, but the authors have not helped me to understand the significance of their contributions.\n\nTaking each in turn:\n\n(1) What is the significance of the new environment?  What unique characteristics make it difficult?  What makes this environment an importantly different testbed or development environment?  The connection to RoboSoccer is motivating but tenuous. The new environment should have particular characteristics that expose problems with past algorithms or offer new challenges existing algorithms have not addressed at all.\n\n(2) Why is it important to have a decentralized training procedure when the authors have control over all the agents?  If it will allow faster training, has the authors' algorithm been demonstrated to accomplish that goal?  \n\n(3) It's hard to evaluate new algorithms when the domain studied is also new. We have no sense for state-of-the-art performance on this domain across a range of algorithms.  The authors conduct a careful ablation study on their new algorithm but do not compare their approach to other classes of algorithms.\n\n(4) The authors indicate that evaluating the quality of an algorithm for a competitive context is hard in absence of established benchmarks---whereas in single-agent or cooperative environments progress can be measured against the goal of the environment, progress in competitive environments requires comparison to approaches that are thought to be good.  Here the authors are themselves pointing out a fundamental problem with introducing new competitive multiagent testbeds, and the authors don't resolve this tension.  Since the main contribution of the work is the environment, it's hard to see how this point the authors themselves make doesn't undermine that central contribution.\n\nBesides other comments mentioned above, a couple other ways to improve the paper would be:\n- Clarify why this environment is important to be introducing---what are the unique things that can be studied with this new environment?\n- Hold an open competition to get benchmarks created by other teams of researchers\n\nSome minor comments:\n- $n_r$ is not defined explicitly in the text as far as I have found\n- The authors state: \"The specific shaping rewards use for soccer are detailed in Section 4.2\" but I couldn't find them there. \n\n---\n\nPost-rebuttal \n\nMy main concern was assessing the value of the overall contribution of the paper. The other reviewers seem to appreciate both the new environment being offered and the combination of techniques deployed in the authors' solution. If there is an audience that will appreciate this work at ICLR as seems to be indicated by those reviews, then I would increase my score to marginally above the acceptance threshold.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper627/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Emergent Coordination Through Competition", "abstract": "We study the emergence of cooperative behaviors in reinforcement learning agents by introducing a challenging competitive multi-agent soccer environment with continuous simulated physics.

The contribution of our work extends beyond the introduction of a novel environment. We use the domain to study the emergence of coordination by analyzing the behaviors of decentralized agents. We carried out ablation studies to surface important ingredients for effective learning in multi-agent cooperative-competitive games. Our work highlights a fundamental difficulty in evaluation on multi-agent domains, with or without benchmarks, which we alleviate through a principled Nash averaging evaluation scheme.\n\nWe address each point individually:\n\n1) Q) \u201cWhat makes this environment an importantly different testbed or development environment?\u201d\nA) The environment will provide the ML community with a cooperative-competitive multi-agent environment in a simulated physical world which is accessible and flexible. It is accessible because it uses a widely adopted physics simulator and research platform. It is also accessible in the sense that we have demonstrated a solution using end-to-end RL. It is flexible because although the current paper describes a relatively simple agent embodiment (chosen to draw attention to multi-agent coordination), the environment can be extended in terms of body complexity as well as the number of players and could become part of a wider multi-task suite with consistent physics. We believe it is an important contribution to create such an environment, release it, and publish the first set of results on it. Further, the environment rules are simple but complexity emerges from sophisticated behavior and interactions between independent physically embodied agents. As such we have seen a level of emergent cooperation in a simulated physical world, which has not been witnessed before by end-to-end RL.\n\nQ) \u201cThe new environment should [...] offer new challenges existing algorithms have not addressed at all.''\nA) Learned cooperation of embodied independent RL agents in physical worlds is an unsolved problem, and a significant challenge for all existing approaches. To our knowledge there is no published environment that allows us to study this problem with realistic simulated physics where agents must acquire and leverage physical motor skills in order to coordinate with others in an open-ended manner.\n\n2) Q) \u201cWhy is it important to have a decentralized training procedure when the authors have control over all the agents?\u201d\nA) We agree that the environment could be used to investigate centralized approaches which could yield faster learning in this particular problem (but may not in general scale to more agents). However, we chose to study the emergence of coordination in decentralized, non-communicating agents, which is a significant unsolved problem important for real-world multi-agent problems (e.g. interaction between self-driving cars from different manufacturers, or human-agent interactions) where centralized solutions may not be feasible, and is more consistent with human learning.\n\n3) Q) \u201cIt's hard to evaluate new algorithms when the domain studied is also new.\u201d & \u201cWe have no sense for state-of-the-art performance on this domain across a range of algorithms\u201d\nA) We agree that evaluation is difficult in the absence of clear baselines on a novel domain. We have combined state-of-the-art distributed RL and continuous control, with additional improvements, and suggest that this is a sensible reference solution for future investigations. We performed a detailed ablation study precisely to answer the question: what are the important ingredients for successful multi-agent learning on this novel, challenging domain?\n\n4) Q) \u201cThe authors indicate that evaluating the quality of an algorithm for a competitive context is hard in the absence of established benchmarks\u201d\nA) We disagree with reviewer\u2019s assessment that highlighting difficulties in evaluation undermines the contribution of this work. There have been multiple studies (sec 4.3) where conclusions have been drawn according to simple multi-agent evaluation schemes. Our work shows where existing evaluation procedures fall short. We adopted an evaluation scheme via Nash averaging and demonstrated the discrepancy between our methods and a tournament (Figure 10). We do not claim that our evaluation method resolves the issue completely, but we believe it provides a more principled evaluation scheme. Even for domains where we possess human baselines or programmed bots evaluation is still difficult for the same underlying reason. It is important to introduce domains in which these problems arise, such as this one.\n\nQ) \u201cwhat are the unique things that can be studied with this new environment?\u201d\nA) See 1)\n\nQ) \u201cHold an open competition to get benchmarks created by other teams of researchers\u201d\nA) we agree that our environment would be suitable for a competition, since the environment is an easily accessible MuJoCo environment.

We address each point individually: \n\nRe. correlation of rewards within and across teams:\n\nIn our setup we distinguish between the raw sparse reward events / raw continuous performance metrics (all denoted by r), and the individual agent\u2019s preferences for these (denoted by alpha). While the binary reward events \u2018goal\u2019 and \u2018concede\u2019 are correlated within team, but anti-correlated across teams, this is not true for all continuous metrics (it is for ball-vel-to-goal but not for vel-to-ball). Independently, each agent can have different preferences for each of the signals and associated discount factors. These quantities are evolved via PBT and thus vary across agents and over time. As a consequence, even when the signal itself is perfectly (anti-)correlated between agents this is almost never true for the resulting reward received by the agents and they may thus acquire different behaviors.\n\nRe. relative importance of hyperparameter adjustments performed by evolution: \n\nThe reviewer raised an important question regarding population-based training. Given that the PBT procedure drives evolution towards agents whose hyper-parameters and model parameters are the most competitive within the current population of agents (in terms of winning the game), a parameter that is irrelevant for the learning progress should not exhibit a consistent trend across experiment replicas (as each hyper-parameter is initialized randomly and then evolved through an evolution procedure that selects, inherits and mutates where mutation applies a random multiplicative perturbation). We concretely observed in our work (Figure 4) that both actor and critic learning rates as well as discount factor and entropy cost exhibit clear trends over the course of training. Regarding learning rates specifically, we believe that our PBT procedure re-discovers the commonly employed learning rate annealing schedule for accelerated learning. We have added a new Section E in the appendix comparing the evolution of hyperparameters across three experiments with different seeds: entropy cost and critic learning rates evolve consistently across experiments indicating that performance is more sensitive to these parameters. The critic learning rate in particular decreases over time. Actor learning rate is relatively less consistent across the three experiments, indicating that performance is less sensitive to fine tuning the actor learning rate."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper627/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper627/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper627/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Emergent Coordination Through Competition", "abstract": "We study the emergence of cooperative behaviors in reinforcement learning agents by introducing a challenging competitive multi-agent soccer environment with continuous simulated physics.
