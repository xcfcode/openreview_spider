In this work, the output/softmax layer is different for each data type, while the encoder is shared.\nThe authors tried two different sentence encoders (cnn-based and tree-lstm), and final results are calculated on the low resource dataset. \n\nExperimental results show that the tree-rnn encoder is able to capture valuable information from auxiliary data, while the cnn based does not.\n\n----------\n\nOVERALL JUDGMENT\nThe paper shows an interesting approach to data augmentation with data of different type for relation extraction.\nI would have appreciated a section where the authors explain briefly what relation extraction is maybe with an example.\nThe paper is overall clear, although the experimental section has to be improved I believe.\nFrom section 5.2 I am not able to understand the experimental setting the authors used, is it 10-fold CV? Did the authors tune the hyperparameters for each fold?\nAre the results in table 3 obtained with tree-lstm? \nWhat kind of ensembling did the authors chose for those experiments?\nThe author overstates that their model outperforms the state-of-the-art models they compare to, but that is not true for the EU-ADR dataset where in 2 out of 3 relation types the proposed model performs on par with the state-of-the-art model.\nFinally, the authors used only one auxiliary dataset at the time, it would be interesting to see whether using all the auxiliary dataset together would improve results even more.\n\nI would suggest the author also to check and revise citations (CNN's are not Collobert et al. invention, the same thing for the maximum likelihood objective) and more in general to improve the reference on relation extraction literature.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Cross-Corpus Training with TreeLSTM for the Extraction of Biomedical Relationships from Text", "abstract": "A bottleneck problem in machine learning-based relationship extraction (RE) algorithms, and particularly of deep learning-based ones, is the availability of training data in the form of annotated corpora.

Indeed our approach leads to the best published performances for two biomedical RE tasks, and to state-of-the-art results for two other biomedical RE tasks, for which few annotated resources are available (less than 400 manually annotated sentences). This may be particularly impactful in specialized domains in which training resources are scarce, because they would benefit from the training data of other domains for which large annotated corpora does exist.
