The idea and direction of the paper is interesting, however both the theory and numerical results could be improved and specifically it should be made more clear *what* is the added benefit of using this LDNN model as opposed to any other method for solving the integral equations. I suggest some ideas for improvements below. \n\nIdeas for improvement, comments and questions: \n- In general I like the idea of combining collocation, Legendre polynomials and neural networks. \n- For readability (especially for people less familiar with these methods) it would be good to explain some concepts more clearly (see also next points).\n- Are the last parameters \\zeta_1 and \\zeta_2 fixed or trainable? The way it looks in the equation now is since you refer to it as the \u2018second network\u2019 that they are trainable, but in Section 3 you mention they are fixed. What are the trainable parameters of the third layer?\n- How are the roots $X_j$ and consequently $\\omega_j$ computed?\n- The numerical results look good and I see the potential of the method. \n- What is the intuition behind the FC layers after the Legendre layer? What would more hidden layers mean in terms of the approximation? Some numerical results on this would be useful.\n- Related to the above, how does the LDNN method compare to the collocation method and are W^2 similar to the role of the coefficients of the basis functions? \n- I think the case of *why* we would be using the LDNN method instead of other more classical approaches should be made a lot stronger for the paper to be of significant contribution. Right now it is not clear for me how the proposed method is better than classical methods. What is the relation to methods which, as you mention, \u201can attempt is made to obtain the unknown coefficients of the basis functions so that the solution satisfies the equation in a set of candidate points\u201d. \n- A small comment but the English of the paper should be improved. \n- Maybe introduce Legendre polynomials prior to defining the network? \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3512/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3512/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Legendre Deep Neural Network (LDNN) and its application for approximation of nonlinear Volterra\u2013Fredholm\u2013Hammerstein integral equations", "authorids": ["kparand@sbu.ac.ir", "~Zeinab_Hajimohammadi1", "~Ali_Ghodsi1"], "authors": ["Kourosh Parand", "Zeinab Hajimohammadi", "Ali Ghodsi"], "keywords": ["Deep neural network", "Volterra\u2013Fredholm\u2013Hammerstein integral equations", "Legendre orthogonal polynomials", "Gaussian quadrature method", "Collocation method"], "abstract": "Various phenomena in biology, physics, and engineering are modeled by differential equations.

Their approach involves training a neural network with Legendre polynomial based activation functions to approximate the solution $y(x)$ for a given $x$. The network is trained in a supervised fashion to minimize a loss function with two term- (1) the $\\ell_2$ error between the true solution and $y(x)$ and (2) the residual of the given integral  equation when analysed at $x$. They show impressive numerical results for several instances of VFH-IEs with very low errors. The primary contributions as claimed by the authors are the use of Legendre polynomial based activation functions and creating a differentiable approximation for the integral equation by using Legendre polynomials and Quadrature methods to analyse the integral. \n\n*** Pros ***\n1. The numerical results show great efficiency and same to perform at par or better compared to other numerical methods reported in literature. \n2. The use of Legendre polynomials as an activation function to approximate the input domain is an interesting method to introduce well understood approximations from the numerical methods community.\n\n*** Cons ***\n1. The paper lacks comparisons and ablation studies to show how their model compares to simple supervised training. For example, a simple baseline comparison would be to train a network with similar number of parameters and standard loss functions in a supervised fashion and without the IE residual. This would allow us to analyse the efficacy of the various components of the proposed architecture better.\n\n2. How does the proposed method improve upon traditional numerical methods? I also would like to know the timing comparisons between traditional methods and the proposed neural network method.\n\n3. For Figures 2 and 3, the error between $y_{true}$ and $y_{pred}$ should be plotted as well.\n\nThe paper in its current form is not addressing how and why neural networks improve performance over the traditional methods and is also missing relevant comparisons and ablation studies.

LDNN utilizes Legendre orthogonal polynomials as activation functions of the Deep structure. We present how LDNN can be used to solve nonlinear V-F-H-IEs. We show using the Gaussian quadrature collocation method in combination with LDNN results in a novel numerical solution for nonlinear V-F-H-IEs. Several examples are given to verify the performance and accuracy of LDNN.", "one-sentence_summary": "we propose the Legendre Deep Neural Network (LDNN) for solving nonlinear Volterra\u2013Fredholm\u2013Hammerstein integral equations (V-F-H-IEs)", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "parand|legendre_deep_neural_network_ldnn_and_its_application_for_approximation_of_nonlinear_volterrafredholmhammerstein_integral_equations", "pdf": "/pdf/5f0fb090d796ab6d496251b5ba46a3170d551f31.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=998SEuKAbqT", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nparand2021legendre,\ntitle={Legendre Deep Neural Network ({\\{}LDNN{\\}}) and its application for approximation of nonlinear Volterra{\\textendash}Fredholm{\\textendash}Hammerstein integral equations},\nauthor={Kourosh Parand and Zeinab Hajimohammadi and Ali Ghodsi},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=H-AAaJ9v_lE}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
