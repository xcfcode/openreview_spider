There are many more or less complicated methods for processing missing data by neural networks in the literature. \nIn this paper, we show that flow-based generative models can work directly on images with missing data to produce full images without missing parts. We name this behavior Missing Glow Phenomenon. We present experiments that document such behaviors and propose theoretical justification of such phenomena.", "pdf": "/pdf/9efcc1e232163804a7bdb1f5023d5b36c5e3f08e.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|missing_glow_phenomenon_learning_disentangled_representation_of_missing_data", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021missing,\ntitle={Missing Glow Phenomenon: learning disentangled representation of  missing data},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to ICLR 2021 Workshop on Geometrical and Topological Representation Learning},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=odPywACg_Z8},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615225929161, "tmdate": 1615967298665, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
