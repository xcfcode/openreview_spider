As a note, ideas like these have been also adopted in Computer Vision with the use of the Inception score as a proxy the quality of generated images. The authors ask great questions in the paper and they clearly tackle a very important problem, that of automatic measures for assessing text quality. While their first indications are not negative, this paper lacks the rigor and depth of experiments of a conference paper that would convince the research community to abandon BLEU and ROUGE in lieu of some other metric. It's perhaps a good workshop paper or a short paper at a *CL conference. Specifically, we would need more tasks where BLEU/ROUGE is the standard measure and so how the proposed measure correlates better with humans,  so cases where word overlap is in theory a good proxy of similarity assuming reference sentence (e.g., logical entailment is not such a prototypical task). MT is a first step towards that, but summarization is also a necessary I would say. Other questions of interest relate to the type of LM (does it only need to be Roberta?) and the quality of LM (what if i badly tune my LM?)  On a more personal note: We all know that BLEU is not a good metric (especially for document-level judgements) and every now and then there have been proposals to replace BLEU that do correlate better (e.g., http://ccc.inaoep.mx/~villasen/bib/Regression%20for%20machine%20translation%20evaluation.pdf) .

We have checked the paper for typos, confusing sentences and made it easier to read.\n\n2) Overall the goals of the paper are to present clear criteria to assess evaluation metrics and show how transformers can be used to assess the quality of candidate translations and summaries. \n\n3) Currently, all summaries/translation results use BLEU/ROUGE, hence the focus on these 2 metrics. The core idea in the experimental section is that in all dimensions capturing the properties of a \"good evaluator\", BLEU/ROUGE are outperformed by a Transformer trained to predict semantic similarity between candidate and reference sentences. The earlier version of the paper hinted at a more general framework in which Transformers themselves are used as feature extractors for various sentence pairs but we removed this part to reduce confusion.\n\n4) We use the term data-driven because the evaluators are general purpose language models fine-tuned on semantic similarity. We took RoBERTa-STS as an example but recent, high-performing models such as ALBERT or ALICe are also applicable. The constant among those is the training procedure relying on the same data. The models are anticipated to evolve which is why we did not want to be specifying just a model.\n\n5) We have added 3 more experiments. The first 2 complete the evaluation of RoBERTa-STS for the 2 dimensions of the scorecard. The last experiments use RoBERTa-STS on 5300+ WMT sentence pairs and show that this model transfers well.\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1380/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1380/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "JAUNE: Justified And Unified Neural language Evaluation", "authors": ["Hassan Kan\u00e9", "Yusuf Kocyigit", "Ali Abdalla", "Pelkins Ajanoh", "Mohamed Coulibali"], "authorids": ["hassanmohamed@alum.mit.edu", "yusuf.kocyigit@boun.edu.tr", "aabdalla@alum.mit.edu", "pelkins@alum.mit.edu", "mohamed-konoufo.coulibali.1@ulaval.ca"], "keywords": ["NLP", "Evaluation Metrics", "Summarization", "Translation", "BLEU", "ROUGE", "Transformers"], "TL;DR": "Introduces JAUNE: a methodology to replace BLEU and ROUGE score with multidimensional, model-based evaluators for assessing summaries", "abstract": "We review the limitations of BLEU and ROUGE -- the most popular metrics used to assess reference summaries against hypothesis summaries, and introduce JAUNE:  a set of criteria for what a good metric should behave like and propose concrete ways to use recent Transformers-based Language Models to assess reference summaries against hypothesis summaries.\n\n", "pdf": "/pdf/616f357613725fba95999854273bd25f362ad7d5.pdf", "paperhash": "kan\u00e9|jaune_justified_and_unified_neural_language_evaluation", "original_pdf": "/attachment/f9b2bf6df072a0abfea4d7996143fdfbc6dcb793.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkan{\\'e}2020jaune,\ntitle={{\\{}JAUNE{\\}}: Justified And Unified Neural language Evaluation},\nauthor={Hassan Kan{\\'e} and Yusuf Kocyigit and Ali Abdalla and Pelkins Ajanoh and Mohamed Coulibali},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1gx60NKPS}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"required": true, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).

Does it make sense to compare the semantic similarity of two sentences if one of them isn't even near grammatical? A lot of prior work already argue the shortcomings of the existing metrics this paper is making, e.g. Conroy and Dang (2008), Liu et al. (2016), Novikova et al. (2017). I think it would be valuable to present new axes to decompose the evaluation problem, but more work is needed to clarify and develop the axes presented in this paper.\n  \nFor the second possible contribution, the idea of evaluating language generation along dimensions is not novel and in fact quite standard in the NLP community. The challenge has been showing that there are subset of tasks that can be used a reliable metrics across different domains and systems. Unfortunately, this paper does not actually evaluate its own proposals, making it hard to evaluate how effective its proposals are.  \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1380/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1380/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "JAUNE: Justified And Unified Neural language Evaluation", "authors": ["Hassan Kan\u00e9", "Yusuf Kocyigit", "Ali Abdalla", "Pelkins Ajanoh", "Mohamed Coulibali"], "authorids": ["hassanmohamed@alum.mit.edu", "yusuf.kocyigit@boun.edu.tr", "aabdalla@alum.mit.edu", "pelkins@alum.mit.edu", "mohamed-konoufo.coulibali.1@ulaval.ca"], "keywords": ["NLP", "Evaluation Metrics", "Summarization", "Translation", "BLEU", "ROUGE", "Transformers"], "TL;DR": "Introduces JAUNE: a methodology to replace BLEU and ROUGE score with multidimensional, model-based evaluators for assessing summaries", "abstract": "We review the limitations of BLEU and ROUGE -- the most popular metrics used to assess reference summaries against hypothesis summaries, and introduce JAUNE:  a set of criteria for what a good metric should behave like and propose concrete ways to use recent Transformers-based Language Models to assess reference summaries against hypothesis summaries.\n\n", "pdf": "/pdf/616f357613725fba95999854273bd25f362ad7d5.pdf", "paperhash": "kan\u00e9|jaune_justified_and_unified_neural_language_evaluation", "original_pdf": "/attachment/f9b2bf6df072a0abfea4d7996143fdfbc6dcb793.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkan{\\'e}2020jaune,\ntitle={{\\{}JAUNE{\\}}: Justified And Unified Neural language Evaluation},\nauthor={Hassan Kan{\\'e} and Yusuf Kocyigit and Ali Abdalla and Pelkins Ajanoh and Mohamed Coulibali},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1gx60NKPS}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).

Some suggestions and comments:\n\n- Please carefully check the paper and fix typos and confusing sentences. I was collecting these errors but eventually stopped. Some examples. Sec. 2.3: punctuation missing between \"RUSE\" and \"this method\", comma missing after \"a discrete space\"; Sec. 4.1.1: \"made to ,for example\"....\n\n- The motivation of the paper is unclear. Is your criticism only about BLEU and ROUGE, or the state of the arts in NLP evaluation in general? To make JAUNE appealing, one has to argue that the state of the arts in NLP evaluation is ineffective. For this, the paper needs to review a boarder range of metrics beyond just BLUE and ROUGE. \n\n- While the authors suggest a data-driven metric, it reads to me like a model-driven metric (RoBERTAa specifically). Doesn't it systematically bias towards a certain family of metrics? \n\n- Better and more comprehensive experimental results are highly desired.
