Specifically, the authors assume that we can collect $n$ data points $\\{(s_t,a_t,r_t(s_t,a_t),s_{t+1})\\}_{t=1}^{n}$. Based on the collected data, the authors calculated the sample mean of the unknown reward function $\\widehat r_n$ and transition probability $\\widehat{P}(\\cdot|s,a)$. They further defined an estimator $\\widehat Q_n$, which is the fixed point of the empirical Bellman operator $\\widehat{\\mathcal{T}}_n$ derived from $\\widehat r_n$ and $\\widehat P_n$. The authors proved under certain assumptions that $\\widehat Q_n\\rightarrow Q^*$ almost surely. Based on this argument, they also derived a similar convergence of value function $\\widehat V_n$ in distribution. Confidence intervals can also be established based on these results.\n\nThe proof of convergence in distribution is established based on the following idea: $\\widehat r_n$ and $\\widehat P_n$ converge to $r$ and $P$ by central limit theorem. By examining the Jacobian matrix of $\\widehat{\\mathcal{T}}_n$ with respect to $\\widehat Q$, it is found that the implicit function $\\widehat{ \\mathcal{T}}_n \\widehat Q -\\widehat Q=0$ can be solved in small neighborhoods of $\\widehat r_n, \\widehat P_n$ and $\\widehat Q_n$ as\n$$\n\\widehat{Q}_n = \\phi(\\widehat{r}_n, \\widehat P_n) \\qquad\\text{(implicit function theorem)}\n$$  \nThen by Slutsky theorem, $\\widehat Q_n = \\phi(\\widehat r_n, \\widehat P_n)$ also converges to $Q^*$ in distribution. The proof is straightforward and easy to follow. However, I have some concerns about the above analysis.\n\n1. The data $\\{(s_t,a_t,r_t(s_t,a_t),s_{t+1})\\}_{t=1}^{n}$ are collected by executing a fixed policy for n steps, which means the data points are not i.i.d. Therefore, the convergence of  $\\widehat r_n$ and $\\widehat P_n$ by central limit theorem may not hold ground, which further leads the later proofs potentially problematic.\n\n2. The $\\phi(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ function in implicit function theorem only exists in neighborhoods of $\\widehat r_n, \\widehat P_n$ and $\\widehat Q_n$. It is unclear from the current proof that $\\widehat Q_n$ fall into the same neighborhood of $Q^*$. Therefore, it needs to be justified that the limit point is $Q^*$.\n\n3. Even for the empirical estimator $\\widehat Q_n$, it is still the fixed point of $\\widehat{ \\mathcal{T}}_n$, which is hard to compute or solve. Thus Algorithm 1 may be inefficient in practice.\n\nOther comments:\n\nThe font and margin of this paper does not conform the format requirement of ICLR.\nWhat is $\\sigma_R(i,j)$ in Theorem 1 and Corollary 1? It seems to be undefined.\n\nI found it hard to read when the authors vectorize all the matrices and tensors to $N$ dimension vectors and $N\\times N$ matrices. In particular, the rearranged notations such $\\mu((i-1)m_a+j)$, $\\tilde P^{\\pi}((i-1)m_a+j,(i\u2019-1)m_a+j\u2019)$ are much more complicated that $\\mu(i,j)$ and $\\tilde P^{\\pi}(i\u2019,j\u2019|i,j)$. Similarly, the mapping $F(Q\u2019,r\u2019,P\u2019)$ defined in the proof of Theorem 1 can be represented by the Bellman operator $\\mathcal{T}$ defined on page 3. \n\n====post rebuttal==\nI read other reviewers' comments and the author's response.

We would like to reiterate, and as you have kindly pointed out, that our main contribution is to build a framework to tackle pure exploration in RL by developing a set of clean asymptotic results. To our knowledge, the considered pure exploration problem, even in the tabular MDP setting, has been under-studied yet arises in important applications. Our current work serves to build a foundational framework that potentially applies to more complex settings in the future, including some that you have suggested. In fact, in the Appendix, we discuss several possible extensions of our results, most noticeably on approximate value iteration in Appendix A2.\n\nBelow are our point-by-point responses to your comments:\n\t\n1. We would like to clarify that Assumption 3 is in some sense a minimal assumption for the ``correctness\" of our framework (though it could be generalized to, say, non-irreducible MDP by suitable modification of our suggested strategy via properly randomized starting/restarting). On the other hand, we agree very much with you that this assumption does not capture the ``hardness\" of the exploration problem. Rather, our approach is to propose a reasonable strategy backed by the implications and mathematical forms of our new limit theorems, and demonstrate its superiority through numerical experiments. \n    To clarify the specific numerical setup, $\\pi(1|s) = 0.8$ is used in the first experiment using the RiverSwim example. The goal here is purely a sanity check of our statistical inference method, i.e., for any data collection mechanism, the 95% confidence interval constructed according to the formula is verified to contain the true value with a 95% chance when the sample size is large enough (asymptotic validity). We did not use this configuration as an exploration policy -- and we agree with the reviewer that doing so would defy the purpose of exploration. \n    In the second experiment (Table 3 and 4), $\\pi(1|s)=0.6$ is used in the first stage to provide a warm start. The same first-stage data are used for all the methods listed in the table, either in estimating the parameters of the MDP (UCRL, Q-OCBA, $\\epsilon$-greedy) or setting a good prior distribution for the parameters (PSRL); the pure random strategy RE(0.6) in the table keeps using $\\pi(1|s)=0.6$ in the second stage. We observe in the experiments that using Q-OCBA outperforms $\\pi(1|s)=0.6$ (thus improving a naive strategy) and other previous related methods in the literature (thus appearing competitive against existing alternatives; we also provide reasons for this in the numerical section).  \n\t\n2. Thank you for pointing out the other interesting test problems, which we would investigate in the future. We have chosen RiverSwim in this paper because it is the example used in the previous PSRL and UCRL papers. This problem has the specific feature that there are a lot of uncertainty about the transition probability, which elevates the need of exploration and thus we believe it is a good test problem for comparing exploration strategies. \n\n3. Regarding your last two points, we would definitely clarify our setting and distinguish our framework/results from what was typically considered. In terms of the implications or generalizations to larger-scale problems, our framework that derives asymptotic results on estimation variance, and uses its mathematical form to formulate tractable optimization to devise good exploration strategies, is potentially applicable to these more sophisticated settings, and we do have them in our mind (e.g., Appendix A2 lists some preliminary results along this direction). However, a full investigation would require substantial additional analyses, and we would position the current paper as providing the groundwork for these important future generalizations."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper452/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper452/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Efficient Inference and Exploration for Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Yi Zhu", "Jing Dong", "Henry Lam"], "authorids": ["yizhu2020@u.northwestern.edu", "jing.dong@gsb.columbia.edu", "khl2114@columbia.edu"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Efficient Exploration", "Asymptotic Analysis", "Statistical Inference"], "TL;DR": "We investigate the large-sample behaviors of the Q-value estimates and proposed an efficient exploration strategy that relies on estimating the relative discrepancies among the Q estimates.

Thank you for pointing out the line of studies on finite-sample bounds. We will incorporate this into the introduction section and properly relate it to our work.\n\n2. Our results can be suitably modified to handle MDP where the underlying Markov chain is non-irreducible. In this case, the analysis would apply to the exploration policy designed for each commuting class. Alternatively, we can introduce randomized starting/restarting to create an irreducible chain.\n\n3. Our understanding is that the reviewer thinks of the regret as the evaluation criterion, which has been used to design previous methods such as UCRL. In this paper we focus on a pure exploration problem instead of a regret analysis - There is no work to our knowledge that directly relates to this problem in the MDP setting (though there are analogs in the multi-arm bandit literature, namely best-arm identification). We are aware that methods like UCRL use a different criterion, but, besides very naive strategies, they are indeed the only strategies available for us to compare with. In fact, in our numerical section (last paragraph of page 8), we explained clearly that Q-OCBA outperforms PSRL and UCRL because the latter ones are designed for a different criterion, thus echoing the comment of the referee. \n\tOne could certainly argue whether the probability of ``correct\" selection (PCS) is a good criterion, or, more broadly, whether it makes sense to even study exploration without caring about the performance during the learning period. Though we acknowledge that in many interesting applications minimizing cumulative regret is a natural goal, there are also applications where efficient learning in an ``exploration phase\"\twithout worrying about the cost of suboptimal decisions in the learning process is more appropriate. To our knowledge, ours is the first work considering this latter setting in RL. Our criterion of looking at PCS follows in some sense from the bandit literature. Again, one could consider replacing it by other criterion such as the expected value function gap, and also consider larger-scale problems where finding ``correct\" action is infeasible. Our goal here is not to exhaust all these generalizations but to provide a new set of tools to start tackling this under-studied class of problems. Thank you for pointing out all these and we would love to investigate them in our future works.\n\n 4. We believe our framework can be extended to finite-horizon MDP, but it may warrant a separate work by itself. The idea of using the implicit function theorem and Delta method to characterize the asymptotic variance, and designing an exploration strategy by solving a tractable optimization to minimize this variance, still applies to the finite-horizon setting, but it would require a substantial new set of analyses."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper452/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper452/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Efficient Inference and Exploration for Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Yi Zhu", "Jing Dong", "Henry Lam"], "authorids": ["yizhu2020@u.northwestern.edu", "jing.dong@gsb.columbia.edu", "khl2114@columbia.edu"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Efficient Exploration", "Asymptotic Analysis", "Statistical Inference"], "TL;DR": "We investigate the large-sample behaviors of the Q-value estimates and proposed an efficient exploration strategy that relies on estimating the relative discrepancies among the Q estimates.

This approach based on central limit theorem appears to be more insightful and cleaner and I think there is something nice about that!\n- The proposed algorithm is reasonable, for the setting in question, and the experimental results show that it outperforms benchmark exploration algorithms in this setting.\n- The general structure of the paper, quality of writing and technical rigour appears to be of good standard... although I did not check all technical details carefully. [The paper is 24 pages long and we have many reviews]\n\n\nHowever, there are also some significant places where this paper falls short:\n- The problem setting that the authors consider is really not typical of the \"exploration\" problem in RL... I'm not talking about the fact that this is a \"pure exploration\" algorithm (that's fine), but instead that Assumption 3 is really not a good model for the types of problems that are \"hard\" for exploration in RL! For example, in the RiverSwim problem choosing an exploration policy = 0.8 right is essentially saying that you've already solved the hard part of the problem. Note - I am a little bit confused about the experiments in Tables 3 and 4, here it seems that you start with a pi(1|s)=0.6 which again feels like a cheat...\n- Would it be possible to compare this algorithm in a more like-for-like standard RL setting, perhaps using the standardised bsuite https://github.com/deepmind/bsuite (the \"deep sea\" problems might be of particular interest here.)\n- Alternatively, I can imagine a future version of the paper being more upfront about this deviation from the \"standard\" setting and highlighting that this is a special-type of result quite different from typical exploration in RL.\n- I'm not sure that this sort of paper is well-served by a conference like ICLR... certainly there seems very little of \"learning representation\" in this discussion of Tabular RL. That would sort of be OK if the paper made nods to how these *insights* could carry over the deep learning or at least RL with (linear) function approximation... I don't see much of that.\n\n\nOverall I do think this is an interesting paper, with a novel approach to pure exploration in tabular MDPs under specific assumptions.\nHowever, I'm not sure that this paper is well-suited to ICLR and I have some concerns about whether it really does address the sort of \"exploration\" problem in RL that one might expect."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper452/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper452/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Efficient Inference and Exploration for Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Yi Zhu", "Jing Dong", "Henry Lam"], "authorids": ["yizhu2020@u.northwestern.edu", "jing.dong@gsb.columbia.edu", "khl2114@columbia.edu"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Efficient Exploration", "Asymptotic Analysis", "Statistical Inference"], "TL;DR": "We investigate the large-sample behaviors of the Q-value estimates and proposed an efficient exploration strategy that relies on estimating the relative discrepancies among the Q estimates.

With a given exploration policy that satisfies some strong property to collect n data, the paper studies the distribution of the estimated optimal value function and Q-function when n goes to infinity. Both unique and non-unique optimal policy cases are studied. The non-unique case has a very different behavior as it is no longer Gaussian.

You can derive an inference result for the generative model as well. \n\nMore comments:\n* The assumption on exploration policy is quite restrictive. It essentially says the bound does not hold if the MDP is not communicating. However, the Q-function is still well defined.\n* The comparison to UCRL and other exploration-based method is not fair. In these results, the probability of picking \"the\" optimal policy is not important. Also, picking the correct action is not feasible if the problem is more complex. It is my understanding that your algorithm has a much larger regret due to that it requires to sample from every state.\n* What about finite horizon MDP?\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper452/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper452/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Efficient Inference and Exploration for Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Yi Zhu", "Jing Dong", "Henry Lam"], "authorids": ["yizhu2020@u.northwestern.edu", "jing.dong@gsb.columbia.edu", "khl2114@columbia.edu"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Efficient Exploration", "Asymptotic Analysis", "Statistical Inference"], "TL;DR": "We investigate the large-sample behaviors of the Q-value estimates and proposed an efficient exploration strategy that relies on estimating the relative discrepancies among the Q estimates.

Numerical experiments show superior performances of our exploration strategy than other benchmark approaches.", "pdf": "/pdf/b008b969881726a91f5bbdfa92fa48687227be1c.pdf", "paperhash": "zhu|efficient_inference_and_exploration_for_reinforcement_learning", "original_pdf": "/attachment/b008b969881726a91f5bbdfa92fa48687227be1c.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nzhu2020efficient,\ntitle={Efficient Inference and Exploration for Reinforcement Learning},\nauthor={Yi Zhu and Jing Dong and Henry Lam},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rygw7aNYDS}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
