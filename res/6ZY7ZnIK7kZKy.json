SDR attempts to find a linear projection space such that the response variable depends on the linear projection of the inputs. The authors make a brief presentation of SDR and formulate it as an optimal scoring problem. It takes the form of a constrained optimization problem which can be solved using an alternating minimization procedure. This method is then applied to prediction problems in Bioinformatics.\r\nThe form and organization of the paper are not adequate. The projection method is only briefly outlined. Notations are not correct e.g. the same notations are used for random variables and data matrices, some of the notations or abbreviations are not introduced. The description of the applications remains extremely unclear. The abstract and the contribution do not correspond. The format of the paper is not NIPS format.\r\nThe proposed method is an adaptation of existing work. The formulation of SDR as a constrained problem is not new. The contribution here might be a variant of the alternating minimization technique used for this problem. The application is only briefly sketched and cannot be really appreciated from this description.\r\nPro\r\nDescribes an application of SDR, better known in the statistical community, which is an alternative to other matrix factorization techniques used in machine learning. \r\nCons\r\nForm and organization of the paper\r\nWeak technical contribution -  algorithmic and applicative"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"decision": "reject", "title": "An Efficient Sufficient Dimension Reduction Method for Identifying\r\n      Genetic Variants of Clinical Significance", "abstract": "Fast and cheaper next generation sequencing technologies will generate unprecedentedly massive and highly-dimensional genomic and epigenomic variation data.
