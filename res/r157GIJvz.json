Proposed solutions included using normalizing flows for stochastic variational inference [4] with more complex approximate posterior distributions for the encoder. \nIn that regard, the use of gaussian encoder in this paper seems like a missed opportunity: since there is no constraint of tractability (unlike stochastic variational inference [5]) using a more general form F(x, \\epsilon) (e.g. with F a neural network)  for the encoder would still enable the computation of the cost function. Which brings up the question of whether this approach would solve this issue. \n\n[1] Danilo Rezende, Shakir Mohamed, Daan Wierstra: Stochastic Backpropagation and Approximate Inference in Deep Generative Models.
