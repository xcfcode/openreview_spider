The choices are task-agnostic selection, linear training, and the hybrid approach. They empirically show that the hybrid algorithm works the best on few-shot learning on images.\n\n### Feedback\n\n* The paper is a straightforward paper and easily understandable. The message is practical, but not very surprising. Unfortunately, it is only on image data; it would have been great if the authors had used an example from NLP too.\n* The hybrid approach is super-simple, which is nice. The results in Figure 6 confirm that how its ensemble nature helps. Although it does not necessarily outperform the linear algorithm in Figure 6. The ensembling approach also does not seems to be the optimal solution. The authors could study the generalization performance of the hybrid algorithm to provide further insights.\n* An empirical run-time analysis is missing.\n* While the authors indicate that all models perform comparatively poorly on the structured tasks, they do not provide specific insights about the root cause of this.\n* Overall, the idea is simple and practical, but the methodological contributions of this paper is rather limited.\n\n--------\n### Post-Response Update\nUnfortunately, the authors' response is not satisfactory on multiple issues.

However, we disagree with the proposed suggestions as they are either orthogonal to our method, or have been shown as inefficient, by other related work.\n\n\n\n*   LEEP: This method assumes a pre-trained classification head as part of the pre-trained model, which works for fully/semi-supervised. However, some models from the VTAB benchmark do not fulfill this requirement! (e.g., feature representations originating from a GAN or VAE which are part of the models in the pool)\n*   Batch Norm requires one to adjust the parameters to the new data distribution. Reporting the behaviour of using restricted finetune compute to estimate unrestricted finetune compute accuracy is possible, however that is clearly as (if not more) sensitive of hyperparameter selection. Instead, we focused on doing an extensive study of methods which are known to be less sensitive to hyperparameter search to identify the best models, which are then used with larger finetune compute.\n*   Whilst one could use \u201cMINE\u201d, it is known that estimating the MI suffers considerably from a bias - variance tradeoff and no method bypasses those issues (see \u201cPoole, B., Ozair, S., Van Den Oord, A., Alemi, A., & Tucker, G. (2019, May). On Variational Bounds of Mutual Information. In ICML.\u201d). The suggested approach \u201cMINE\u201d falls into this category and additionally has a large computational requirement as it requires to train a neural network which makes it unusable as a \u201ccheap\u201d proxy task.\n*   We restricted ourselves to the 1K samples setting from VTAB on purpose, as it is known that this yields the largest gain in using transfer learning compared to training from scratch. The impact of the size of the model pool is directly visible via the novel definition of regret which we consider as a major contribution compared to other performance proxies."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3634/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3634/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Which Model to Transfer?

To the best of my knowledge, It only requires classification head. So, why it can not be applied to VTAB models is not clear to me.\n- I agree that early stopping is an open research problem. However, it can be used as a simple baseline in the comparison, e.g., finetuning with only 1 epoch or finetuning with only 10 epochs. I don't agree with the authors that finetuning requires when the batch norm layers are being used. Why can't I finetune a model for 5 epoch without knowing anything about BN layers and then use the premature models\u2019 test accuracies as ranking scores.\n- Also, why can't we simply rank the checkpoints by their mutual information between the high-dimensional features and discrete labels of the downstream task? It is a variational lower bound parameterized by a neural network. See: \"Belghazi et al. Mine: mutual information neural estimation. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.04062, 2018\".\n- Moreover, How does amount of data in the target task affects the performance of ranking? What is the effect of number of pretrained models on the ranking?\n\nBased on the above missing experiments, I am keeping my score same as the initial one."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3634/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3634/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Which Model to Transfer?

It compares 3 strategies, a task-agnostic one which uses imagenet accuracies, a task-aware one which uses the acccuracy of linear classifiers on fixed representations, and a hybrid one which combines the two.\n\nPros:\n+ The evaluation is fairly thorough. I especially like the fact that the authors consider the different axes along which pre-trained models differ (model capacity, generalist/experts etc.)\n+ The pool of downstream datasets is large.\n+ The suggested strategy is simple and easy to implement. \n+ The problem is significant in practice since almost all practical applications of neural networks have this prroblem, and the gains seem large. I wish there was more work on this problem.\n\nCons:\n- The biggest issue is that this paper ignores several important papers publiished before on this problem. Especially of note is the Task2Vec approach, which computes model and task embeddings.

At this stage, fine-tune strategies on its own are less explored and unclear in NLP compared to vision tasks (e.g., pre-trained models are typically extended by more than one linear classification layer, or the representations are not always taken from the last pre-logit layer).\n\n_[Although it does not necessarily outperform the linear algorithm in Figure 6.]_\n\nWe see Figure 6 (which is now Figure 7 in the revised version) as a confirmation of some of our claims, rather than a weakness:\n\n\n\n*   Since hybrid with budget B is based on linear on budget B-1, it is **expected that the graphs are fairly similar when experts are the best models** (which is the case in restricted pools)\n*   It shows the **necessity of including the task-agnostic method** - on ALL pool we clearly see that linear is not able to choose the best model\n*   We want to emphasize that Figure 6 cares only about winners, which differs from the rest of the paper where we look at the notion of regret\n\n_[The ensembling approach also does not seems to be the optimal solution. The authors could study the generalization performance of the hybrid algorithm to provide further insights.]_\n\nThe generalization property of the hybrid strategy using a budget of B, by definition, comes directly from the generalization of the task-aware strategy for B-1 and the first pick of the task-agnostic strategy. Giving any generalization bounds for training or fine-tuning deep neural networks is already a hard and currently open research problem, which we do not aim at solving here. Instead, we showcase empirical failures of each strategy which, interestingly, do not overlap much, enabling consistent improvements using the proposed hybrid strategy.\n\n_[An empirical run-time analysis is missing.]_\n\nEfficient implementation of all methods, which is crucial for a fair comparison, is out of the scope of this work. At this stage, understanding the limitations of using task-aware (especially a linear classifier) or task-agnostic search methods is the founding block.

We have updated the main body of the paper, in particular the \"Background\" section and the \"Other related work\" section to improve the positioning of our work, and added Figure 2 for further clarification. That being said, we believe that our contributions are relevant to the research community and the practitioners. \n\n[Contributions]\n**Hybrid approach** is not the main and only contribution, but a byproduct of a careful large scale analysis of current available model search strategies.\n\n[Not limited to classification]\nThe proposed method is **not limited to models pre-trained with classification heads, even though we focus only on classification tasks.** Note that VAE and BIGGAN-based models are included (Table 3 of the Appendix). \n\n[Related methods] \nWe thank the reviewer for helping us place the work into the more broad research context! While these methods are indeed related in the general sense, they are **not directly comparable to our method:**\n\nDuality diagram similarity (DDS) and DEPARA:\n - **We can use any model**, whereas Taskonomy is restricted to models trained on the same input with different labels.\n - **We examine fine-tuning**, whereas for both methods the encoder part which is transferred is not fine-tuned.\n - The methods aim at computing the results of the Taskonomy dataset faster by only working on a subset of the dataset (the same data for all models).\n - Adapting DEPARA and DDS to learn some dependency between tasks or models similarly to Task2Vec or Model2Vec would make it a \u201cmeta-learned task-aware\u201d strategy, on which we elaborate in the revisited paper.\n - While Task2Vec and Model2Vec are directly applicable by ranking models based on their similarity in the embedding space, it's unclear how to apply the model search on new tasks using DDS or DEPARA (or taskonomy in general) without semantic relations between the upstream and downstream tasks and without training a new network from scratch. \n\nLEEP:\n - By including the VTAB models, **we have access to models pre-trained with different loss functions, fully unsupervised to semi-supervised and strongly supervised**, whilst LEEP is only applicable to models pre-trained for classification tasks\n - LEEP provides theoretical guarantees only for fixed features, even though fine-tuning outperforms the linear classifier in their work.\n - Linear correlation is not necessarily transitive, which is why LEEP cannot be used directly to derive the relationship between fine-tuning and linear classifier. Hence, we **go one step further than LEEP** in understanding this behaviour.\n\n[Other suggestions]\nEarly stopping: \n - Training a network robustly with early stopping is an open research problem\n - Fine-tuning requires additional knowledge about the architecture (e.g., knowing when the batch norm layers are used). For our proxy task, **no such knowledge is required**.\n\nImpact of the dimension: \n - Already shown in Appendix for Pool **_DIM2048_**. The results for this model pool are **consistent** with the pool **_RESNET-50_** in the main body of the paper and were hence relegated to supplementary material. \n\nMutual Information (MI) based approaches:\n - MI could be useful, but there is no clear understanding on how to correctly estimate the MI and its relation to transferability.\n\nWe are hopeful that, together with the thoroughly revised Section 2, we addressed the major concerns."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3634/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3634/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Which Model to Transfer?

The paper is well written and easy to follow. Experiments using 46 pretrained models and 19 downstream tasks show the effectiveness of the hybrid strategy in selecting the right model for transfer learning with low computational complexity. \n\nOverall, I vote for rejecting the paper as the paper has very limited novelty and experiments are not convincing. In particular, I fail to find the major contributions of the paper except the empirical study on VTAB dataset. While papers related to empirical study are interesting and worth of acceptance, this paper does not provide any major insight that could be useful for the future research on transfer learning.

These papers should be clearly discussed with possible comparisons in the experiments to show the advantage of the hybrid approach.\n\nComparison with many simple baselines are missing in the paper. E.g., How does the hybrid strategy comparable to fine-tuning with early stopping. Can we select pre-trained models by finetuning for only few epochs? How does the number of epoch affect the final performance while comparing to the hybrid strategy? \n\nHow is the current method comparable to Leep: A new measure to evaluate transferability of learned representations? Experiments and analysis should be included in the experiments to verify the effectiveness of the hybrid strategy.\n\nHow does the size of representation/feature affect the final performance? Does the conclusion still hold with different size of features? How does amount of data in the target task affects the performance of ranking? What is the effect of number of pretrained models on the ranking?\n\nMutual information between the features and discrete labels of the downstream task can be used to rank different models for transfer learning. How does the proposed hybrid strategy related to mutual information based ranking strategy? Experimental comparison should be included in the paper to verify this.\n\nDoes the ranking strategy and analysis presented in the paper limited to only classification models? In particular, can models trained using self supervised learning where there is no classification head, be used as pre-trained models in the current approach? How does the analysis change while considering self-supervised models which are now-a-days quite popular in representation learning? What about considering discriminators of generative models, e.g., VAE or BigGAN in the transfer learning analysis? More experiments and analysis should be performed in the experiments.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3634/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3634/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Which Model to Transfer?

The emergence of rich model repositories, such as TensorFlow Hub, enables the practitioners and researchers to unleash the potential of these models across a wide range of downstream tasks. As these repositories keep growing exponentially, efficiently selecting a good model for the task at hand becomes paramount. We provide a formalization of this problem through a familiar notion of regret and introduce the predominant strategies, namely task-agnostic (e.g. picking the highest scoring ImageNet model) and task-aware search strategies (such as linear or kNN evaluation). We conduct a large-scale empirical study and show that both task-agnostic and task-aware methods can yield high regret. We then propose a simple and computationally efficient hybrid search strategy which outperforms the existing approaches. We highlight the practical benefits of the proposed solution on a set of 19 diverse vision tasks.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "renggli|which_model_to_transfer_finding_the_needle_in_the_growing_haystack", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/72449d12cd8154cfe1521f8dd2f2e6a249aab155.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/8bb0c88b85524bc04fa00cbf533ddc3cb06a3d17.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=9bdnIEl-T", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nrenggli2021which,\ntitle={Which Model to Transfer?
