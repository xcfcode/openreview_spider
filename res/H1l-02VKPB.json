The ranking scores for each node are computed by taking the average of the scores of its neighbors, by doing which the authors claim that the topological information of the graph is taken into direct account in the pooling steps. \n\nThe proposed method indeed shares some common idea with \u201cHierarchical Graph Representation Learning with differentiable pooling\u201d by Xing et al. There, a differentiable pooling procedure is used to progressively coarsen the graph to achieve global representation, and the assignment matrix is learned in each hierarchies. This is very similar to the proposed method, since those nodes with higher attention scores are those with more neighbors, which can be considered as ``local cluster centers\u2019\u2019 on a graph. In other words, both methods perform some kind of hierarchical clustering to coarsen the graph. The authors claim that an assignment matrix may cause (1) overfitting, and (2) the coarsened graph may have a different structure than the original graph, which I believe are not justified criticisms. In many cases of clustering the assignment matrix  is auxiliary variables; and even if the assignment matrix is learned as a whole matrix variable, as long as the loss terms is properly defined (such as reconstruction loss in k-means), it can be learned very well because it does not need labels as a unsupervised term.  Second, computing the assignment matrix has more flexibility, especially considering that the coarsening step is not just to perform clustering but rather to facilitate the final classification, therefore locating ``important\u2019\u2019 nodes (in terms of fully representing the graph) is not the only goal, but locating both important and discriminative nodes (i.e., those nodes that can lead to informative features for final classification) is. In this sense, learning an assignment matrix obviously has the benefit of receiving back-propagated gradients from class labels, while the proposed method does not have this flexibility in the pooling step since the neighborhood structure of the graph is fixed throughout the iterations. \n\nAnother important observation is that The proposed method seems to connect each hierarchy directly to the final layer, which is similar to skip-connections. Can this be the main reason why the performance shows improvement, as has been validated in extensive studies in the computer vision community? Some ablation studies are needed to verify that the performance gains are mainly due to the key idea of TAP but not due to the skip connections that have been widely used in computer vision tasks.\n\nSome minor comments:\nHow do you implement the ranking_k() function? Is it differentiable?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper253/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper253/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "Pooling operations have shown to be effective on various tasks in computer vision and natural language processing.

The key idea is to use the initial node attributes to compute all-pair attention scores for each node pair and then use these attention scores to formulate a new graph adjacency matrix beyond the original raw graph adjacency matrix. As the result, each node can average these attention score edges to compute the overall importance. Based on these scores, the method chooses top-k nodes to perform graph coarsening operation. In addition, a graph connectivity term is proposed to address the problems of isolated nodes. Experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. \n\nAlthough I found this paper is generally well written and well motivated, there are several concerns about the novelty of paper, computational expenses, and the experimental results as listed below:\n\n1) The idea of using attention score is simple yet seems effective. But using attention score to identify the importance of nodes has been first presented in GAT [Velic\u02c7kovic \u0301 et al., 2019] and further studied by a lot of subsequent works.  \n\n2) In this paper, authors considered using raw node features to obtain good attention scores between each node pair. However, the effectiveness of this will heavily depend on how informative these original node features are. In the extreme case, the original node features are completely random, then the proposed method will definitely fail since there are no meaningful similarity scores that can be learnt from. Surprisingly, I did not see any discussion or any ablation study on this aspect. Also, why only using initial node attributes? How about the computed node embeddings to compute the similarity scores?\n\n3) The pair-wise similarity scores (similarity or attention matrix) are very expensive to compute and score, which easily renders quadratic complexity in terms of the number of nodes O(N^2) for both computation and memory. This makes it scale to really large graph. In this sense, the proposed scheme is not promising in real applications. \n\n4) The experiments are really problematic. There are no descriptions on how the graph data are split in train/val/test. Following the traditional graph kernel settings, it should be 9/1/1. Also, there are no information about how many runs are performed on each dataset. I noticed that authors basically collected all performance results from published related works except for several baselines. Different data split and number of runs could result quite different performance report, leading to apple-and-orange comparisons. \n\n5) The experimental results are also problematic as well. For example, WL baseline has extremely large variance for all of datasets, which are completely different from the reported number from other literature [Zhang et al, neurIPS'18] and my personal experience. In general, the variance of WL could be 1/10 smaller than what are reported in this paper. Also, there is no clear explanations why the proposed method achieved quite large margin compared to G-UNet and GIN as shown in Table 1. \n\nRetGK: Graph Kernels based on Return Probabilities of Random Walks, [Zhang et al, neurIPS'18]\n\n6) In Table 3, authors tried to show the performance difference between different pooling methods. I was so surprised about the results after I looked back to Table 1. For instance, Net_top-k (G-Unet) achieved 71.5 on PTC while GUnet achieved 64.7 on PTC in Table 2. It is really hard to believe this almost 7 points difference are just due to slight different model choices in other parts beyond the main contribution - new pooling component. I feel the whole experimental results are not convincing or at least no well explanations what's going on here. Of course, based on very large variances shown in table 1 and 2, table 3 and table 4 are meaningless to look without seeing the variances for each ablation study. \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper253/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper253/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "Pooling operations have shown to be effective on various tasks in computer vision and natural language processing.

Experimental results on graph classification tasks demonstrate that our methods achieve consistently better performance than previous models.", "title": "Topology-Aware Pooling via Graph Attention", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hongyang Gao", "Shuiwang Ji"], "authorids": ["hongyang.gao@tamu.edu", "sji@tamu.edu"], "pdf": "/pdf/b622797d6f382f6a4b4174111828711fc4753b0e.pdf", "paperhash": "gao|topologyaware_pooling_via_graph_attention", "original_pdf": "/attachment/b622797d6f382f6a4b4174111828711fc4753b0e.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\ngao2020topologyaware,\ntitle={Topology-Aware Pooling via Graph Attention},\nauthor={Hongyang Gao and Shuiwang Ji},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1l-02VKPB}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
