We are glad to hear that **the reviewer agrees on the significance of our proposed SumEnergy**, which aggregates information over the labels and is better than methods that only consider the maximum scores. We have addressed the concerns regarding math clarity. \n\n1. [notation] As per suggestion, we\u2019ve updated the notations throughout the paper for clarity, using $y_i$ to indicate when an input $\\textbf{x}$ is associated with the $i$-th label. **See changes made in Equations (1) - (16) in Section 2,  as well as notations in Section 3, Page 7-8**.  \n\n2. We expanded our draft by adding formal derivations in forms of joint conditional likelihood  $p(\\textbf{x}\\mid y_1=1,y_2=1,...,y_K=1)$. **See detailed proof in Section 2.2, Equation (12-16) on Page 4**.  To provide a brief proof here for your convenience, we can apply the Bayes' theorem in each term of $\\log p(\\textbf{x} \\mid y_i)$ in $E_\\text{sum}$, which yields:\n\n\\begin{align}\n   E_\\text{sum}(\\textbf{x})&= \\log \\prod_{i=1}^K  \\frac{p(y_i \\mid \\textbf{x}) \\cdot p(\\textbf{x})}{p(y_i)} + Z\\\\\n    = \\log \\prod_{i=1}^K p(y_i \\mid \\textbf{x})  + K\\cdot \\log p(\\textbf{x}) + \\underbrace{(Z - \\log \\prod_{i=1}^K p(y_i))}_{\\text{C: constant for all  $\\textbf{x}$}} \n\\end{align}\n \nGiven all label $y_i$ are conditionally independent given $\\textbf{x}$, we have $\\prod_{i=1}^K p(y_i \\mid \\textbf{x}) = p(y_1,y_2,...,y_K\\mid \\textbf{x})$. Therefore, Equation above is equivalent to:\n \n$$  E_\\text{sum}(\\textbf{x})= \\log p(y_1,y_2, \\ldots, y_K \\mid \\textbf{x}) + K\\cdot \\log p(\\textbf{x}) + C$$\n$$= \\log \\frac{p(\\textbf{x} \\mid y_1,y_2,...,y_K)\\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^K p(y_i)}{p(\\textbf{x})} + K\\cdot \\log p(\\textbf{x})  + C\\text{       \n     (Note: first term is via the Bayes' theorem)}$$\n$$=\\underbrace{\\log p(\\textbf{x} \\mid y_1, y_2,...,y_K)}_{\\text{joint conditional log likelihood}}+ (K-1) \\cdot \\log p(\\textbf{x}) + Z$$\n \nOur proposed SumEnergy therefore captures the underlying data density and the joint information across labels, which is desirable for OOD detection in a multi-label setting. The first term is precisely joint conditional log likelihood, and also highlights the novelty and importance to our work (which is to take into account the joint estimation in a multi-label setting). This also differentiates our method from the multi-class setting which does not consider this term otherwise. \n\n3. Reference to Wu et al. has been added. See Page 8, related work. \n\nIn summary, **we greatly appreciate the feedback and have sufficiently addressed all the concerns of the reviewer**. We hope the reviewer can evaluate our work by considering the importance of the research problem (OOD detection in multi-label setting), technical solution (OOD score estimation jointly from multiple labels through energy), as well as the significance of the results (better by a large margin, with up to 10.05% FPR reduction over current SOTA).\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1862/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1862/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Energy-based Out-of-distribution Detection for Multi-label Classification", "authorids": ["~Haoran_Wang5", "~Weitang_Liu1", "~Alex_Bocchieri1", "~Yixuan_Li1"], "authors": ["Haoran Wang", "Weitang Liu", "Alex Bocchieri", "Yixuan Li"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential to prevent anomalous inputs from causing a model to fail during deployment.

Our evaluation framework builds on [1], while expanding with more competitive baselines in literature. We are not inventing things new here and would like to give credit to prior works. **We\u2019ve updated our draft, added clear citations to each baseline method in Table 1**. \n\n[1] Dan Hendrycks, Steven Basart, Mantas Mazeika, Mohammadreza Mostajabi, Jacob Steinhardt, and\nDawn Song. A benchmark for anomaly segmentation, 2019.\n\n\n2 Re: SumEnergy vs SumProb\n\nWe highlight the advantage of SumEnergy over SumProb both empirically and theoretically. **See expanded discussion on Page 7-8**.\n\n**Empirically**: The performance difference between SumEnergy and SumProb is substantial, as evidenced in Table 2. In particular, on MS-COCO, our method outperforms SumProb by 11.56% (FPR95). For threshold independent metric AUROC, SumEnergy consistently outperforms SumProb by 3.38% (MS-COCO), 4.57% (PASCAL), and 4.48% (NUS-WIDE). \n\n**Theoretically**: SumEnergy is a mathematically meaningful measurement and can be interpreted from a joint likelihood perspective (see Section 2.2), whereas SumProb does not. In fact, one can show that the probability score for each individual label is not aligned with the conditioned data density function. To see this, we can derive the probability for each binary logistic classifier as:\n\\begin{align*}\n\t\\log p(y \\mid \\textbf{x}) &=  \\log \\frac{e^{f_y(\\textbf{x})}}{1+ e^{f_{y}(\\textbf{x})}} = f_y(\\textbf{x}) + E_y(\\textbf{x}).\n\\end{align*}\nIn fact, the first term $f_y(\\textbf{x})$ is larger for in-distribution data with label $y$, whereas the second term is smaller for in-distribution data with $E_y(\\textbf{x}) \\propto -\\log p(\\textbf{x}\\mid y)$. This leads to a biased scoring distribution that is no longer proportional to the label-conditional likelihood $\\log p(\\textbf{x}\\mid y)$.

Thank you for the insightful comments!", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the insightful and helpful comments! We are glad to hear that our paper is well written with superior and promising results. Below we address all 3 comments in detail.\n\n1. Mathematical explanation:\n\nTo clarify this, the interpretation from a joint likelihood can be seen from Equation 11, where $E_\\text{sum}(\\textbf{x}) = \\sum_{y=1}^K \\log p(\\textbf{x}|y) + Z = \\log \\prod_{y=1}^K p(\\textbf{x}| y) + Z$. In this equation, $\\prod_{y=1}^K p(\\textbf{x}| y)$ measures the joint conditioned likelihood for the sample x to be in each class. Equation 13 shows a more direct meaning behind our method, which is equivalent to the probability for the data to be associated with all labels. Intuitively, OOD data should have a low SumEnergy score since $p(\\textbf{x},y)$ will be low for all labels. \n\nOur derivation is based on the assumption that all labels are conditionally independent, in which case reduces the chain probability to $\\prod_{y=1}^K p(\\textbf{x},y)$. This assumption is consistent with standard multi-label classification loss, which is multiple independent binary classification problems. We consider this setting for its simplicity and generality. Our work also opens up an interesting future direction of OOD detection by considering the structural dependency among labels. **We have further clarified this in our updated draft (see Page 4, Section 2.2)**.\n\n2. Threshold:\n\nWe follow the common practice in literature and select $\\tau$ based on 95% of true positive rate (fraction of in-distribution images that are correctly classified). Performance reported in Table 1 shows the average FPR when TPR is 95%. **To see the sensitivity of the threshold, we additionally provide AUROC curves in Figure 2**. This shows how the FPR changes (in x-axis) as we sweep over all thresholds $\\tau$ (which translates into different TPR accordingly). In general, our method produces high AUROC consistently across three in-distribution datasets considered. \n\n\n3. Novelty:\n\nWhile the energy score was used for OOD detection in the multi-class setting (Liu et al., 2020), this method does not directly generalize to a multi-label classification setting. A multi-label setting in fact exacerbates the difficulty of OOD detection since labels are not mutually exclusive. The key technical challenge and contribution of our work are to derive statistics by considering the joint information across labels (which is indeed reflected in our formulation as clarified above). This joint estimation of the OOD scoring function was previously unexplored in literature, hence not incremental but new to our work. \n\nIn particular, we showed in Section 2.2 the novel definition of SumEnergy derived from a multi-label classification network, as well as its mathematical interpretations from a joint likelihood view---both of which are new contributions to this work, and are distinct from prior works. \n\nOur empirical results in Table 1 support precisely the importance of taking into account joint information from across labels, which was not considered in previous baselines.\n\nIn summary, our work contributes to the field by both studying an **underexplored problem** (OOD detection for multi-label classification) and proposing an **unexplored solution space** (OOD scoring function estimated jointly from multiple labels). Furthermore, it opens up an **interesting and promising** future direction for OOD detection to consider information jointly from across semantics.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1862/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1862/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Energy-based Out-of-distribution Detection for Multi-label Classification", "authorids": ["~Haoran_Wang5", "~Weitang_Liu1", "~Alex_Bocchieri1", "~Yixuan_Li1"], "authors": ["Haoran Wang", "Weitang Liu", "Alex Bocchieri", "Yixuan Li"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential to prevent anomalous inputs from causing a model to fail during deployment.

However, the mathematical explanation is still confusing.\n\nFor the math explanation part:\n\nFirstly, the mathematical symbols are confusing. In Eq.(12), $p(\\mathbf{x}, y_j)$ (j = 1,...,K) exists while $p(\\mathbf{x} | y)$ exists in other equations (although I know what the authors aim to mean). Actually, $p(\\mathbf{x} | y = k)$ means the conditional probability $p(\\mathbf{x} | y_k = 1)$. The symbols should be unified and given clear meaning descriptions.\n\nSecondly, the authors clarify that the interpretation from a joint likelihood can be seen from Eq.(11), where $E_{sum} = \\sum_{i=1}^{K} \\log p(\\mathbf{x} | y) + Z = \\log \\prod_{j=1}^K p(\\mathbf{x} | y) + Z$. Authors claim that $\\prod_{j=1}^K p(\\mathbf{x} | y)$ measures the joint conditioned likelihood for the sample $x$ to be in each class, while the joint conditional likelihood should be $p(\\mathbf{x} | y_1 = 1, y_2 = 1, ... , y_K = 1)$. \n\nI concern the authors don't express precisely. Although the authors claim that the deviations are based on the assumption that all labels are independent, in my opinion, in this case, it cannot reduce the chain probability to $\\prod_{j=1}^K p(\\mathbf{x}, y)$ (i.e. $\\prod_{j=1}^K p(\\mathbf{x}, y_j = 1)$) while its original probability should be $p(\\mathbf{x}, y_1 = 1, y_2 = 1, ... , y_K = 1)$. Please give a formal proof if you could. Besides, I agree that SumEnergy can aggregate more information over the labels than MaxEnergy which only considers the largest label-wise energy score among all labels. Furthermore, recent theory [1] has confirmed the superiority of the standard multi-label classification loss for many measures (not only for Hamming Loss, but also for Subset Accuracy in small label space case).\n\n[1] Multi-label classification: do Hamming loss and subset accuracy really conflict with each other?, NeurIPS 2020\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1862/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1862/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Energy-based Out-of-distribution Detection for Multi-label Classification", "authorids": ["~Haoran_Wang5", "~Weitang_Liu1", "~Alex_Bocchieri1", "~Yixuan_Li1"], "authors": ["Haoran Wang", "Weitang Liu", "Alex Bocchieri", "Yixuan Li"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential to prevent anomalous inputs from causing a model to fail during deployment.

We\u2019ve updated our draft, added citation [1], and several subsequent works in the development of EBMs. **See Page 8-9 for changes**. \n\nRe: Novelty\n\nWhile the energy score was used for OOD detection in the multi-class setting (Liu et al., 2020), this method unfortunately does not directly generalize to a multi-label classification setting. A multi-label setting in fact exacerbates the difficulty of OOD detection since labels are not mutually exclusive. The key technical challenge and contribution of our work are to derive statistics by considering the joint information across labels. This joint estimation of the OOD score from multiple labels was previously unexplored in literature, hence not incremental but new to our work. \n\nIn particular, we showed in Section 2.2 the novel definition of SumEnergy derived from a multi-label classification network, as well as its mathematical interpretations from a joint likelihood view---both of which are new contributions to this work, and are methodologically distinct from prior works. \n\nOur empirical results in Table 1 support precisely the importance of taking into account joint information from across labels, which was not considered in any of the previous baselines (Hendrycks et al. 2019, Liang et al. 2018, Lee et al. 2018) relying on maximum scores. \n\nIn summary, our work contributes to the field by both studying an **underexplored problem** (OOD detection for multi-label classification) and proposing an **unexplored solution space** (OOD scoring function estimated jointly from multiple labels). Furthermore, it opens up an **interesting and promising** future direction for OOD detection to consider information jointly from across semantics.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1862/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1862/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Energy-based Out-of-distribution Detection for Multi-label Classification", "authorids": ["~Haoran_Wang5", "~Weitang_Liu1", "~Alex_Bocchieri1", "~Yixuan_Li1"], "authors": ["Haoran Wang", "Weitang Liu", "Alex Bocchieri", "Yixuan Li"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential to prevent anomalous inputs from causing a model to fail during deployment.

The method also establishes the state-of-the-art performance, which is good.\n\nConcerns:\n+ since the paper for energy-based out-of-distribution detection has existed. Generalizing it to multi-label context is incremental. \n+ missing some important references:  the current paper didn\u2019t discuss and cite [1], which is the first paper to show that a discriminative classifier can be interpreted from an energy-based perspective. \n+ the related work about EBM is not comprehensive. Even though the current paper is about discriminative EBM, a discussion about the development of the generative EBMs is desirable. \n\n[1] A Theory of Generative ConvNet (ICML 2016)\n\n======== score changed ==============\n\nMy major concern has been addressed by the reply from the authors.

We are encouraged to hear that our motivation and idea to be appealing and that our analysis and evaluations are extensive and strong. We absolutely agree with your view that OOD detection in multi-label classification deserves research further. Below we address the comments in detail. \n\nRe: Effect of energy threshold $\\tau$\n\nGreat question! We follow the common practice in literature and select $\\tau$ based on 95% of true positive rate (fraction of in-distribution images that are correctly classified). To see the effect of $\\tau$, **we have updated the draft with the AUROC curves in Figure 2, Page 6**. The curves show how the performance changes (FPR, x-axis) as we vary the TPR (that determines $\\tau$) on the y-axis. We report AUROC performance in Table 1, which is a threshold-independent measurement for OOD detection. In general, our method produces high AUROC consistently across three in-distribution datasets considered. \n\nRe: Attention-based & graph-based methods for multi-label classification\n\nVery interesting suggestions! Our main focus in the paper is to derive OOD scoring statistics from the output of a pre-trained multi-label classification model, rather than improving the multi-label classification model itself. We opt for the standard multi-label classification network for its generality and simplicity. However, we concur that improved training mechanisms (including suggested graph-based & attention-based methods) for the classification network can be beneficial for improving the downstream OOD scoring estimation. **We have highlighted these works on Page 4 in Section 2.2**, and are excited to explore this direction in future work. \n\nRe: few-shot learning vs. OOD detection\n\nWe'd like to highlight both the difference and connections between these two learning problems. \n\n**Difference**: In few-shot/zero-shot learning, a model may be given very few or no examples of a specific class in its training data. This class is nonetheless assumed to belong to the training data, and the model is expected to generalize to this class.  In contrast, OOD detection attempts to detect what the model cannot generalize to (e.g., a completely unseen or unknown semantics). From a learning problem perspective, the formulations and objectives are different. \n\n**Connection**: In open-world learning, one can use OOD detection for identifying novel categories as a precursor. Few-shot learning can be useful for subsequent training by incorporating the novel data detected. Though interesting to us, such a learning framework is out of the scope of current work. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1862/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1862/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Energy-based Out-of-distribution Detection for Multi-label Classification", "authorids": ["~Haoran_Wang5", "~Weitang_Liu1", "~Alex_Bocchieri1", "~Yixuan_Li1"], "authors": ["Haoran Wang", "Weitang Liu", "Alex Bocchieri", "Yixuan Li"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential to prevent anomalous inputs from causing a model to fail during deployment.
