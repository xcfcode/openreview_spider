They demonstrate that the method achieves impressive empirical results both in terms of disentanglement and a limited experiment on unsupervised domain translation.\n\nDecision: Weak Reject. I find the experimental results in this paper very appealing. However, I am weakly rejecting the paper because of 1) some problematic claims put forth in the paper, which I worry might mislead the reader and 2) lack of clarity in describing the procedure in the unsupervised domain translation setting.\n\nHere are some main comments:\n\n1.  KL-divergence v. asymmetric noise\nFirst, the authors claim that regularizing with KL-divergence leads to posterior collapse. But the particular experimental set up is tested on SmallNORB, which only has a small handful of factors of variation anyway). That KL-divergence \u201ccauses\u201d posterior collapse is a claim that must be made very carefully. There are some very specific conditions under which this is known to be true empirically (for example, see the experiments in Burda\u2019s IWAE paper and Hoffman\u2019s DLGM paper), but in general, one should be careful with this claim. Can the authors please walk back on this statement?\n\nSecond, it is worth noting that asymmetric noise regularization is itself actually a special case of KL-divergence regularzation. When q(z|x) is forced to have a globally fixed variance, KL-divergence regularization becomes asymmetric noise regularization. \n\n2. Cost of training\nOne thing I feel should be made more clear in the paper is the training cost of GLO v. amortized models. How much slower is GLO compared to amortized models? How many iterations do you employ on a given minibatch of data when using GLO? \n\n3. Ablation study\nFirst, I think the authors should show us the actual visualizations for the amortized models. Without visual inspection, it\u2019s hard to gauge the significance of the numbers in Table 3. \n\nSecond, the authors observed that the amortized models leak class information into the content representation. I find it fascinating that GLO does not. I would like the authors to dig deeper into what exactly is the inductive bias conferred by latent optimization. As of the moment, claim that \u201cthis variant is inferior to our fully unamortized model as a result of an inductive bias conferred by latent optimization\u201d is a vacuously true statement since we know that amortized models and unamortized models should in theory have equivalent behavior in the infinite-capacity / oracle optimizer regime. I request that the authors show us the training and test losses (Eq 6 and its decomposition into reconstruction + regularization terms). Inspecting it may shed light on the inductive bias. \n\n4. Unsupervised Domain Translation\nThe result looks very good. However, the experimentation is too limited. I recommend that the authors try at least one other dataset.\n\nFurthermore, the description of how to apply LORD to unsupervised domain translation is uncomfortably vague. I am not sure if the provided code and description in the main text allows for reproduction of the UDT experiments. \n\nIf the authors are able to address the above questions and requests, then I am more than happy to raise my score.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2110/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2110/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["avivga@gmail.com", "yedid@cs.huji.ac.il"], "title": "Demystifying Inter-Class Disentanglement", "authors": ["Aviv Gabbay", "Yedid Hoshen"], "pdf": "/pdf/28114c67b2a5225a8a0732f3686e31395b5da8cb.pdf", "TL;DR": "Latent Optimization for Representation Disentanglement", "abstract": "Learning to disentangle the hidden factors of variations within a set of observations is a key task for artificial intelligence.

I would appreciate if the authors can make a commitment to provide the training and test loss for all of the datasets used in the paper. \n\nI think the numbers will be valuable in shedding light on the behavior of GLO v. amortization. For example, I am surprised that you achieve better training loss without amortization than with, especially since you only take a single gradient step on the latent code. This defies conventional wisdom that amortization accelerates optimization. Perhaps with enough gradient steps, single-gradient-step-GLO will ultimately still achieve better training loss than amortization, just as is the case in Table 5. Having access to Table 5 for all of your datasets would be illuminating and also give practitioners are better sense of what to expect when they try out your method versus others."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2110/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2110/AnonReviewer2", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["avivga@gmail.com", "yedid@cs.huji.ac.il"], "title": "Demystifying Inter-Class Disentanglement", "authors": ["Aviv Gabbay", "Yedid Hoshen"], "pdf": "/pdf/28114c67b2a5225a8a0732f3686e31395b5da8cb.pdf", "TL;DR": "Latent Optimization for Representation Disentanglement", "abstract": "Learning to disentangle the hidden factors of variations within a set of observations is a key task for artificial intelligence.

Are the results dependent on this parameter?\u201d: In all our experiments, we used a fixed value of sigma=1, it is possible that better results may be obtained with a different value of sigma.\n\n\u201cDoes the randomness in content code during the training account for the variations in the images not covered by class code and content code.\u201d: The purpose of regularizing the content code with random noise and activation decay is to obtain disentangled representations (by minimality of information) and not for diverse generation. In the datasets considered, the assumption that variation not covered by class and content is small holds quite well. In cases where this assumption is insufficient, we introduced the preliminary style clustering step.\n\n\u201creliant on the imagenet trained VGG perceptual loss \u2026 do the authors anticipate any limitations generalizing to datasets such as in medical domains, etc.\u201d:  Relying on the VGG loss is obviously a limitation for non-image datasets (although perceptual losses exist in other modalities). Regarding images, previous research has shown that the VGG loss is quite generally effective e.g. Yang et al. [1] used the VGG loss successful in the medical domain.\n\n\u201cWhy is lighting chosen as the class label in the datasets?\u201d: We followed the SmallNORB protocol in DrNet, which kept object identity, lighting and elevation constant. We further extended this protocol to another configuration in which the elevation also varied. \n\n\u201cWhat are limitations from the assumption of low variability within a class?\u201d: The limitation is in the case where high intra-class variability is not explained by the content (and is not expected to be transferred across classes). In cases where the assumption is not satisfied, reconstruction will suffer. Our method can work even in such cases e.g. in the CelebA experiments. In cases where the non-content intra-class variability is very high, we perform the preliminary style-clustering step (e.g. Edges2Shoes).

The results show that our method achieves near perfect disentanglement on both directions.\n\n\u201cThis paper is based on the assumption that \u2018inter-class variation is larger than intra-class variation\u2019. Authors should verify their assumption\u201d: Our image formation model, models images as being formed by class, content and residual (style) codes. The intra-class variation is formed by both the content and the residual information. The content is transferable between classes, the residual information is not. Given class and content codes, if the residual information is small, reconstruction will be successful (as demonstrated in our experiments). If the residual information is very significant, it will not be possible to reconstruct images well only based on class and content leading to poor image formation models. For example, in the Cars3D experiment, the class labels represent the car model, content codes represent azimuth and elevation, and there is no residual information. In this case LORD performs well. We perform an exploratory experiment in which we aggregate similar car models into a single unified class (163 original car models are clustered into 50 super classes). In this case, the residual information contains the specification of the exact car model within the super class. The residual information is therefore significantly larger. The class and content information is not sufficient for reconstructing the original image perfectly. Quantitatively, we found that the reconstruction error increased from 32.5 to 55.64. A visualization of this experiment is provided in the appendix (A.7). It should be noted that our method can work well in cases where there is a moderate amount of residual information, e.g. in the CelebA experiments. Moreover, in datasets which exhibit large intra-class variations (e.g. Edges2Shoes) we introduce our preliminary step of style clustering which significantly reduces intra-class variation.

The reviewer raised several valid points, which we believe can be easily addressed.\n\n\u201cregularizing with KL-divergence leads to posterior collapse\u201d: This phenomenon was observed in all our datasets (e.g. Cars3D, CelebA), not just in SmallNorb. However, we agree with the reviewer that this does not imply that posterior collapse always happens but only in the settings that we tested.  We revised the text to clarify this. We believe that after the revision, the scope of our finding is related precisely.\n\n\u201cspecial case of KL-divergence regularization\u201d: We completely agree. Although the difference is subtle, we have extensively shown that its contribution to disentanglement is significant. This was clarified in the text.\n\n\u201cHow much slower is GLO compared to amortized models?\u201d, \u201cHow many iterations do you employ on a given minibatch of data when using GLO?\u201c: GLO requires about twice the number of iterations than amortized models for convergence. For each mini-batch, we perform a single gradient step for the generator parameters and latent codes. This was clarified in the text.\n\n\u201cauthors should show us the actual visualizations for the amortized models\u201d: We added the visualizations to the appendix (A.6).\n\nInductive bias of latent optimization: Following the reviewer\u2019s advice we have dug deeper into the inductive bias of GLO vs. amortized models. We trained our latent optimization (no amortization) model and its semi-amortized variant on Cars3D and measured the accuracy of classifying class labels from content codes after every epoch. The change in the amount of class-dependent information contained in the content codes is presented in the appendix (A.4). It can be observed that a randomly initialized content encoder (for amortization) encodes class-dependent information, which needs to be minimized as the training evolves i.e. initial mutual information is high and is decreased in the process of training. In latent optimization, content and class codes are randomly initialized, there is therefore zero mutual information between them. By the end of training, amortized models often do not completely remove the mutual information between the class and content codes and provide entangled representations, while a model trained with latent optimization preserves a very high degree of disentanglement. We hypothesize that achieving a similar degree of disentanglement by amortization requires a more sophisticated objective and a more careful hyperparameter tuning.\n\n\u201cUnsupervised Domain Translation \u2026 I recommend that the authors try at least one other dataset\u201d: We have run our method on two more domain translation tasks - (i) male to female (ii) faces to anime. The results are presented in the appendix (A.9), our method performed well on both tasks. In the second task, adding the preliminary clustering step allowed for diverse face to anime translation. For added clarity, we added pseudo code (appendix A.8) precisely detailing our procedure, more explanations were added to the text and clustering code was added to our repository.\n\nWe believe that all of the reviewer\u2019s questions were addressed.

Based on the assumption that inter-class variation is larger than intra-class variation, LORD decomposes image representation into two parts: class and content representations, with the purpose of getting disentangled representation in those parts.  \nInspired by ML-VAE, authors try to: 1. learn to reconstruct the original image of disentangled representation. 2. eliminate the class information from content code by asymmetric noise regularization. The experimental results indicate that LORD succeeds to disentangle class information on content codes, while it outperforms style-content disentangled representations on style switching tasks (Figure 2 & 3).\nStrengths: \n1.LORD achieves significantly better performance than the state-of-the-art baseline on non-adversarial disentanglement methods.\n2., In terms of confusing the classifier in \u201cClassification experiments\u201d (Table2), disentangled content representation of LORD behaves like a random guess. This shows that LORD is indeed in preventing class information from leaking into content representations.\nWeaknesses:\n1. This paper is based on the assumption that \u201cinter-class variation is larger than intra-class variation\u201d. Authors should verify their assumption by quantitative results and illustrate the importance of inter/intra-class variation (e.g. how much information we may lose if ignoring the intra-class variation).\n2. Authors claim that no information leakage between class and content representation in Sec 1.1. However, the experiments only verify \u201cno class information in content code\u201d, but miss the inverse proposition (Is there any content information is class code?)\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2110/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2110/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["avivga@gmail.com", "yedid@cs.huji.ac.il"], "title": "Demystifying Inter-Class Disentanglement", "authors": ["Aviv Gabbay", "Yedid Hoshen"], "pdf": "/pdf/28114c67b2a5225a8a0732f3686e31395b5da8cb.pdf", "TL;DR": "Latent Optimization for Representation Disentanglement", "abstract": "Learning to disentangle the hidden factors of variations within a set of observations is a key task for artificial intelligence.

The authors operate in a setting where the class labels are known. The authors perform \noptimization in the latent space to obtain these representations and argue that this is simpler and effective than adversarial and amortized inference approaches.\n\nThe main issue that the authors tackle is the information leakage between the representations for the class and content. The authors suggest several fixes for this. Firstly, the paper makes a distinction between content and style. Content is defined as the information that is unchanged when only the class labels are changes in the data generative process. The inherent randomness in the data generative process is defined as the style. \n\nTo disallow, the leakage from content/style code to class code, the authors suggest learning fixed codes for each class that does not vary across images. That is if two images have the same class by virtue of design they will have the same class codes. \n\nThe reverse, leakage from class codes to content codes is achieved by adding any asymmetric noise regularization term. This also seems to be aimed at reducing the total variability in the content codes. The authors claim that this is better than the bottleneck approach such as matching the code distribution to uniform prior and provide empirical evidence. Though in theory, it is not clear why one is better than the other. How was the sigma tuned for the regularization? Are the results dependent on this parameter?\n\nAfter learning the class and content embeddings for each sample in the training example, a pair of encoders are learned to predict these codes for unseen test images, without the need for optimization. \n\nOther comments:\n\nThe style code being 0 is not clear. Does the randomness in content code during the training account for the variations in the images not covered by class code and content code. \n\nThe methods seem heavily reliant on the imagenet trained VGG perceptual loss. This does not seem to be an issue in the datasets shown, do the authors anticipate any limitations generalizing to datasets such as in medical domains, etc. \n\nWhy is lighting chosen as the class label in the datasets? It will be interesting to see how the results change with different subsets of class labels and what is captured in the style codes. \n\nWhat are limitations from the assumption of low variability within a class?\n\nTypo: Page 4 - minimally -> minimality \n\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2110/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2110/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["avivga@gmail.com", "yedid@cs.huji.ac.il"], "title": "Demystifying Inter-Class Disentanglement", "authors": ["Aviv Gabbay", "Yedid Hoshen"], "pdf": "/pdf/28114c67b2a5225a8a0732f3686e31395b5da8cb.pdf", "TL;DR": "Latent Optimization for Representation Disentanglement", "abstract": "Learning to disentangle the hidden factors of variations within a set of observations is a key task for artificial intelligence.
