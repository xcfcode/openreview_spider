In particular, in section 3, several sentences are taken as they are from the Downey et al.\u2019s paper. Some examples :\n\n\u00ab\u00a0provide a compact representation of a dynamical system\nby representing state as a set of predictions of features of future observations.\u00a0\u00bb \n\n\u00ab\u00a0a predictive state is defined as\u2026 , where\u2026  is a vector of features of future observations and ...  is a vector of\nfeatures of historical observations. The features are selected such that ...  determines the distribution\nof future observations \u2026 Filtering is the process of mapping a predictive state\u2026\u00a0\u00bb\nEven the footnote has been copied & pasted: \u00ab\u00a0For convenience we assume that the system is k-observable: that is, the distribution of all future observations\nis determined by the distribution of the next k observations. (Note: not by the next k observations\nthemselves.) At the cost of additional notation, this restriction could easily be lifted.\u00a0\u00bb\n\u00ab\u00a0 This approach is fast, statistically consistent, and reduces to simple\nlinear algebra operations.\u00a0\u00bb \n\nNormally, I should have stopped reviewing, but I decided to continue  since those parts only concerned the preliminaries part.\n\nA key element in PSRNN is to used as an initialization a kernel ridge regression. The main result here, is to show that using orthogonal random features approximates well the original kernel comparing to random fourrier features as considered in PSRNN. This result is formally stated and proved in the paper.\n\nThe paper comes with some experiments in order to empirically demonstrate the superiority  orthogonal random features over RFF. Three data sets are considered (Swimmer,  Mocap and  Handwriting). \n\nI found it that the contribution of the paper is very limited. The connexion to PSRNN is very tenuous since the main results are about the regression part. in Theorems 2 and 3 there are no mention to PSRNN.\n\nAlso the experiment is not very convincing. The datasets are too small with observations in low dimensions, and I found it not very fair to consider LSTM in such settings.\n\nSome minor remarks:\n\n- p3: We use RFs-> RFFs\n- p5: ||X||, you mean |X| the size of the dataset\n- p12: Eq (9). You need to add \u00ab\u00a0with probability $1-\\rho$ as in Avron\u2019s paper.\n- p12: the derivation of Eq (10) from Eq (9) needs to be detailed.   \n\n\nI thank the author for their detailed answers. Some points have been clarified but other still raise issues. In particular, I continue thinking that the contribution is limited.

I would like the authors to have provided results on more than the current three datasets, as well as an explanation of how meaningful the MSEs are in each dataset (is a MSE of 0.2 meaningful for the Swimmer Dataset, for instance? the reader does not know apriori). \n\nThe contribution in terms of the theory of using random features to perform kernel ridge regression is novel, and interesting. Specifically, the author argue that the moment-generating function for the pointwise kernel approximation error of ORF features grows slower than the moment-generating function for the pointwise kernel approximation error of RFM features, which implies that error bounds derived using the MGF of the RFM features will also hold for ORF features. This is a weaker result than their claim that ORFs satisfy better error, but close enough to be of interest and certainly indicates that their method is principled. Unfortunately, the proof of this result is poorly written:\n- equation (20) takes a long time to parse --- more effort should be put into making this clear\n- give a reference for the expressions given for A(k,n) in 24 and 25\n- (27) and (28) should be explained in more detail.\nMy staying power was exhausted around equation 31.

Orthogonal Random Features (ORFs) (Choromanski et al.) is an improvement on RFs which has been shown to decrease the number of RFs required for pointwise kernel approximation. Unfortunately, it is not clear that ORFs can be applied to PSRNNs, as PSRNNs rely on Kernel Ridge Regression as a core component of their learning algorithm, and the theoretical guarantees of ORF do not apply in this setting. In this paper, we extend the theory of ORFs to Kernel Ridge Regression and show that ORFs can be used to obtain Orthogonal PSRNNs (OPSRNNs), which are smaller and faster than PSRNNs. In particular, we show that OPSRNN models clearly outperform LSTMs and furthermore, can achieve accuracy similar to PSRNNs with an order of magnitude smaller number of features needed.", "pdf": "/pdf/dbeaab9a90e3833072ace5a9b61a9430527b32b4.pdf", "TL;DR": "Improving Predictive State Recurrent Neural Networks via Orthogonal Random Features", "paperhash": "choromanski|initialization_matters_orthogonal_predictive_state_recurrent_neural_networks", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nchoromanski2018initialization,\ntitle={Initialization matters: Orthogonal Predictive State Recurrent Neural Networks},\nauthor={Krzysztof Choromanski and Carlton Downey and Byron Boots},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJJ23bW0b},\n}", "keywords": ["recurrent neural networks", "orthogonal random features", "predictive state representations"], "authors": ["Krzysztof Choromanski", "Carlton Downey", "Byron Boots"], "authorids": ["kchoro@google.com", "cmdowney@cs.cmu.edu", "bboots@cc.gatech.edu"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "duedate": 1511845199000, "tmdate": 1515642497415, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper721/Official_Review", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper721/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper721/AnonReviewer2", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper721/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper721/AnonReviewer3"], "reply": {"forum": "HJJ23bW0b", "replyto": "HJJ23bW0b", "writers": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper721/AnonReviewer[0-9]+", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "review": {"required": true, "order": 2, "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}"}, "rating": {"required": true, "order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"]}, "confidence": {"required": true, "order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"]}}}, "nonreaders": [], "expdate": 1519621199000, "cdate": 1515642497415}}}], "count": 5}
