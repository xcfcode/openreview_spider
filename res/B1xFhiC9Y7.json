While the the experiments are missing ablations and some comparisons to prior work as noted by the reviewers, the authors have provided comments in their rebuttal explaining the relation to the prior work and promising to include more in the revised manuscript. \n\nThe paper is borderline, but falls short on the necessary updates requested by reviewers.

For the work in Chen et al., CVPR\u201918, we acknowledge their idea of using spatial-aware adaptation on spatial regions in the image (will cite it in the revised paper). However, their idea is more similar to the PatchGan discriminator used in Tsai, et al., CVPR\u201918 (i.e., spatially global alignment), and is different from the proposed patch-level alignment. Our patch alignment focuses on refining small patches (e.g., 32x64) and is location-independent (as described in Figure 1, introduction, and Section 3.3), while the CVPR\u201918 works assume fixed local grids with larger regions (e.g., 171x342) that account for the context information. In addition, as shown in the ablation study (without reshaped \\hat{F} in Table 1), it shows that the proposed location-independent operation helps patch-level alignment.\n\nAlthough the forms of Eq. 3 and Eq. 6 are similar, they are different in the feature alignment space, where Eq. 6 is guided by the clustering process in the clustered space (for both \\hat{F}). As the reviewer mentioned, we do assign a cluster to a source patch for constructing the clustered space, and then we align target patches to this space (also visualized in the appendix C), based on the assumption that source and target patch distributions are shared regardless of where they are in original images. For disentanglement, we will drop this term and instead emphasize the learned discriminative feature representations for patch alignment to reduce the confusion.\n\nFor the number of clusters K, we find that the result varies on the GTA5-to-Cityscapes dataset. For example, when K is small (e.g., 20), there would be ambiguities for the patch-level alignment process and the performance drops to 41.6, while it is also more difficult to match patches across domains when K is too large (e.g., 200). In practice, we find that within a reasonable range, e.g., K = [30, 80], the IoU is in a range of [42.6%, 43.2%].

We will put this as a future work and we hope that by providing such analysis, it would help the audience better understand the effect of hyper-parameters.\n\nFollowing Tsai, et al., CVPR\u201918, the source-only performance using VGG is 26.4% and 30.7% on GTA5-to-Cityscapes and SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes, respectively. For the mIoU v.s. epoch curve on GTA5-to-Cityscapes, since there is no supervision on the target domain, the performance usually fluctuates as most domain adaptation methods do via adversarial learning. In our experiments, the IoUs are [42.6, 42.0, 42.1, 43.2, 42.1] when training for [50, 55, 60, 65, 70] K iterations using a batch size of 1.\n\nAlthough the improvement on SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes is smaller, we find larger gains on certain categories against Tsai, et al., CVPR\u201918, such as road (3%), sidewalk (2.2%), and sky (1.5%). This is because that the proposed method is designed to overcome domain gaps such as camera pose or field of view via location-independent patch-level alignment. Due to this merit of our approach and the ease of integrating our module into any architectures, we believe that it could be beneficial for other tasks (e.g., depth estimation) that also suffer from the similar issues to semantic segmentation.\n\nWe thank for pointing out related works. Different from these methods that mostly focus on the usage of pixel-level domain adaptation (synthesized target images), loss function design, and pseudo label re-training, our work explores a new perspective via patch-level adversarial alignment and the proposed module is general for different architectures or design choices. While the performance is competitive compared to these methods, we believe that our contribution is orthogonal to theirs.

Method effective but relative weak results compared to SOTA", "review": "This paper proposes a drop-in module of disentangled patch representation learning for adversarial learning-based domain adaptation. The main idea is to encourage the source patch level representation to be disentangled, by creating certain intermediate pseudo-ground truths via clustering the label patch histograms using k-means. This basically creates an alternative, additional view of prediction target of the network outputs. And similar to global network output alignment by Tsai et al., the authors impose an adversarial loss on the additionally introduced view.\n\nClarity: The paper is well-written with good clarity. \n\nResults: This paper has a good experimental validation of proposed module.\n\nConcerns: \n- The idea of using patches in domain adaptation is not completely new. ROAD: Reality Oriented Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation of Urban Scenes, CVPR 2018 also uses the patch level information to help domain adaptation. Although the ideas are not entirely identical, this paper should at least cite and compare this work.\n\n- The disentangled patch feature learning introduces two additional loss, L_d and L_adv^l, which require three extra parameters, including K in K-means, lambda_d and lambda_adv^l. It will be great if a formal sensitivity analysis on the parameters can be conducted. There are some details missing in the paper too. For example, what is the performance of the VGG source model without adaptation? I am also curious about the learning behavior of the proposed method. Could you show the mIoU v.s. epoch curve for GTA2Cityscapes, or any other benchmarks?\n\n- Although consistently improving over Tsai et al., CVPR18, the introduced methods does not show very significant gain in multiple experiments. On SYNTHIA-to-City, only 0.4 mIoU gain is obtained. In addition, while the proposed method is empirically effective, it is largely task-specific and restricted to domain adaptation for scene parsing only. It seems difficult to generalize the same method to other domain adaptation tasks. The limitation on the performance gain and generalizability somehow reduced the contribution from this work to the community.\n\n- A major concern of this work is the lack of citation and direct comparison to multiple previous SOTAs. For example, the paper should compare the end-system performance with several published works such as:\n1. Zhang et al., Fully convolutional adaptation networks for semantic segmentation, CVPR2018\n2. Zhu et al., Penalizing top performers: conservative loss for semantic segmentation adaptation, ECCV2018\n3.

Their global alignment method matches previous adversarial adaptation approaches, so the primary contribution appears to be their patch-level alignment method. They cluster source image patches by histogramming the corresponding label patches, then performing K-means clustering on the histogrammed label features. A new model is trained to reproduce the cluster labels from the source image patches, and this model is adversarially optimized so that target image patches produce a matching feature distribution.\n\nThe paper is well-written and concise. It's organized well, and I had very little trouble following the description of their method. The various components of their model are straightforward and well-motivated. They validate their model on multiple synthetic-to-real segmentation tasks, demonstrating strong performance relative to existing baselines, and they also provide a thorough ablation study showing that each of the components of their proposed model is an important part of their final product, which further convinces the reader that the model is sound.\n\nOne quibble is that the authors mention disentanglement quite a bit in this paper, including in the title, though it isn't clear to me what is being disentangled. They claim the use of of label information is a disentangling factor, but that seems to be true of domain adaptation approaches in general, which all attempt to disentangle semantic information from domain-specific details in some form or other. Further clarification on precisely what is being disentangled would be helpful.\n\nAnother question that lingers is whether or not the additional classification module $H$ and the clustering are truly necessary. A baseline I would like to see would be to remove $H$ entirely and simply train another adversarial discriminator similar to $D_g$ directly on patches of $O$ instead of the full output. This sounds similar to the ablation experiment mentioned in 4.2 where $L_d$ is removed, but my understanding is that ablation experiment still uses an additional featurizer $H$. A more rigorous exploration of the clustering process, such as visualizations of learned clusters and a study of how the number of clusters affects performance would serve to further validate the model.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper728/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Domain Adaptation for Structured Output via Disentangled Patch Representations", "abstract": "Predicting structured outputs such as semantic segmentation relies on expensive per-pixel annotations to learn strong supervised models like convolutional neural networks.

The idea is to model the structure by exploiting image patches, but account for the fact that these patches may be misaligned, and thus not in exact correspondence. This is achieved by defining new patch classes via clustering the source patches according to the semantic information, and making use of an adversarial classifier on the predicted patch-class distributions.\n\nStrengths:\n- Modeling the structure via patches is an interesting idea.\n- The proposed method achieves good results on standard benchmarks.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nMethod:\n- The idea of relying on patches to model the structure is not new. This was achieved by Chen et al., CVPR 2018, \"ROAD: Reality Oriented Adaptation...\". In this work, however, the patches were assumed to be in correspondence, which leaves some novelty to this submission, although reduced.\n- In essence, the patch-based adversarial alignment remains global; this can be thought of as working at a lower resolution and on a different set of classes, defined by the clusters, than the global alignment. The can be observed by comparing Eq. 3 and Eq. 6, which have essentially the same form. This is fine, but was not clear to me until I reached Eq. 6. In fact, what I understood from the beginning of the paper was an alternative formulation, where one would essentially assign each patch to a cluster and aim to align the distributions of the output (original classes) within each cluster. I suggest the authors to clarify this, and possibly discuss the relation with this alternative approach.\n- I am not convinced by the claimed relationship to methods that learn disentangled representations. Here, in essence, the authors just perform clustering of the semantic information. This is fine, but I find the connection a bit far-fetched and would suggest dropping it.\n\nExperiments:\n- The comparison to the state of the art is fine, but I suggest adding the results of Chen et al, CVPR 2018, which achieves quite close accuracies, but still a bit lower. The work of Saito et al., CVPR 2018, \"Maximum Classifier Discrepancy...\" also reports results on semantic segmentation and should be mentioned here. I acknowledge however that their results are not as good as the one reported here.\n- While I appreciate the ablation study of Section 4.2, it only provides a partial picture. It would be interesting to study the influence of the exact values of the hyper-parameters on the results. These hyper-parameters are not only the weights \\lambda_d, \\lambda^g_{adv} and \\lambda^l_{adv}, but also the number of clusters and the size of the patches used. \n\nSummary:\nI would rate this paper as borderline. There is some novelty in the proposed approach, but it is mitigated by the relation to the work of Chen et al., CVPR 2018. The experiments show good results, but a more thorough evaluation of the influence of the hyper-parameters would be useful.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper728/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Domain Adaptation for Structured Output via Disentangled Patch Representations", "abstract": "Predicting structured outputs such as semantic segmentation relies on expensive per-pixel annotations to learn strong supervised models like convolutional neural networks.

However, these models trained on one data domain may not generalize well to other domains unequipped with annotations for model finetuning. To avoid the labor-intensive process of annotation, we develop a domain adaptation method to adapt the source data to the unlabeled target domain. To this end, we propose to learn discriminative feature representations of patches based on label histograms in the source domain, through the construction of a disentangled space. With such representations as guidance, we then use an adversarial learning scheme to push the feature representations in target patches to the closer distributions in source ones. In addition, we show that our framework can integrate a global alignment process with the proposed patch-level alignment and achieve state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation.
