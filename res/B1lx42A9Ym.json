In what follows we shall give an example of a 2-layer Neural Rendering Model (NRM) to clarify the definition of our model. Also, in order to simplify the notations, we will define the generation process in the vectorized form. A L-layer NRM can be generalized from this example.\n\nThe 2-layer NRM is a generative model, which generates images from the class templates $\\mu$ via a linear transformations $\\Lambda$. Here $\\mu$ is a vector depending on the class label y and $\\Lambda$ is a matrix depending on a set of latent variables z. Let further assume that $\\mu$ of size 2 x 1, and $\\Lambda$ is of size D x 2. Here, we assume the generated image X is of size D x 1. Images are generated from this 2-layer NRM as follows:\n\n1) First, we sample the class label y from a categorical distribution $Cat(\\pi_y)$. Given the value of y, we will select the corresponding template $\\mu$ from a set of predefined templates, which will be learned during the training of the model by stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\n\n2) Second, given y, we sample the latent variables z from the prior p(z|y), which is also a categorical distribution $Cat(\\pi(z|y))$. Note that z contains s and t, which are the template selecting variable and the local translation variable defined in our paper. s and t are vectors of size 2 x 1. Element in s and t correspond to pixels in $\\mu$. Element s(1) and s(2) in s take one of the two possible values - 0 and 1 - which selects render or not render. Element t(1) and t(2) in t take one of the four possible values - UPPER LEFT, UPPER RIGHT, LOWER LEFT, and LOWER RIGHT. If s(1) is 0, then the first column of $\\Lambda$, i.e. $\\Lambda(:,1)$, is a vector of 0\u2019s. If s(1) is 1, then $\\Lambda(:,1)$ takes one of the four possible predefined values depending on the value of t(1). These four vectors are locally translated versions of each other. The same process is applied for s(2), t(2), and $\\Lambda(:,2)$. The generated image X is then given by:\n\n\tX = $\\mu(1)$ x $\\Lambda(:,1)$ + $\\mu(2)$ x $\\Lambda(:,2)$ + pixel noise\n\nNote that similar to the class template $\\mu$, $\\Lambda$ will be learned during training by SGD.\n\nThe process above is captured by equation (1), (2), and (3) and illustrated by Figure 3 in our paper."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1416/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1416/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1416/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Rendering Model: Joint Generation and Prediction for Semi-Supervised Learning", "abstract": "Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning are important problems that are especially challenging with complex data like natural images.

In our response below, we will also address your question regarding the advantage of our parametrized prior on the latent variables in the NRM.\n\n1) We introduce the dependency between latent variables in our NRM. This dependency is implicitly enforced by the joint prior of all latent variables $p(z|y)$ in the NRM (see in equation (1) in our paper). Particularly, we parametrize this joint prior such that it cannot be factorized into the product of priors of individual latent variables. As a result, the latent variables are dependent. Such dependency is missing in the DRM, and this limits the DRM\u2019s performance on semi-supervised learning tasks. As shown in our paper, the NRM, which captures the dependency between latent variables, significantly outperforms the DRM in semi-supervised learning tasks on popular benchmarks. Furthermore, the parametric form we choose for the joint prior $p(z|y)$ yields a conjugate prior for the NRM. Thus, inference and learning in the NRM is still computationally efficient. In particular, as shown in Theorem 2.2 in our paper, during inference, due to its conjugate form, the joint prior $p(z|y)$ only adds an additional bias term b(l) into each convolutional layer l in the CNNs. During learning, compared to the DRM, the NRM only needs to learn that extra bias term b(l) at each layer.\n\n2) We derive the cross-entropy loss used for training CNNs with labeled data in conjunction with the architecture of the CNNs, all from maximizing the conditional log-likelihood of the NRM as shown in Theorem 2.3(a). This derivation is missing in the DRM of [Patel 2016]. In their paper, they only derive the reconstruction loss for unsupervised learning without addressing supervised learning, which CNNs are good at. From our derivation of the cross-entropy loss, we are able to provide statistical guarantees and generalization bounds of NRM and CNNs for supervised and semi-supervised learning tasks. These statistical guarantees and generalization bounds are missing in [Patel 2016] due to the fact that they cannot explain supervised learning in CNNs from their DRM."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1416/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1416/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1416/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Rendering Model: Joint Generation and Prediction for Semi-Supervised Learning", "abstract": "Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning are important problems that are especially challenging with complex data like natural images.

Let us try to explain the motivation for our Max-Min cross-entropy loss here. In the Appendix C.14 of our paper, we give a proof for Theorem 2.3(a) in the main text, which establishes the connection between the cross-entropy loss for training with labeled data and the conditional log-likelihood of the NRM. The equation (31) and (32) in that appendix (page 30) show how we derive the cross-entropy loss from the conditional log-likelihood of the NRM. Notice that, from equation (31) to equation (32), we lower bound the conditional log-likelihood of the NRM by maximizing over $z_{i}$ of the term $log(exp(\\psi_{i}(y_{i}, z_{i})))$ without considering the log sum term. This corresponds to maximizing the likelihood of the correct labels without considering the likelihood of the incorrect labels. Notice that without normalization, maximizing the likelihood of the correct labels might also increase the likelihood of the incorrect labels. Alternatively, we can lower bound the conditional log-likelihood of the NRM by minimizing over $z_{i}$ of the log sum term. This is equivalent to minimizing the likelihood of the incorrect labels and yields the MIN cross-entropy loss. Combining both cross-entropy losses from these two lower bounds yields the MAX-MIN cross-entropy loss, which tries to maximize the likelihood of the correct labels and minimize the likelihood of the incorrect labels at the same time."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1416/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1416/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1416/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Rendering Model: Joint Generation and Prediction for Semi-Supervised Learning", "abstract": "Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning are important problems that are especially challenging with complex data like natural images.

As mentioned in the paper, when labeled data are available, we can design the objective loss for CNNs from the conditional log-likelihood of the NRM. Similarly, objective loss for training CNNs with unlabeled data can be derived from the expected complete-data log-likelihood of the NRM. This unsupervised learning loss can only be computed using the NRM since it is the reconstruction loss between the input images and the images reconstructed from the NRM. \n\nAnother example of task-specific knowledge that can be incorporated into the NRM is learning when there are outliers in the training set. Instead of using Gaussian pixel noise in equation (2) in our paper, we can allow the noise to be from a Students\u2019 t-distribution. Then the NRM is equivalent to a mixture of Students t-distributions. It has been shown in (Bishop, 2006) that a mixture of Students t-distributions is robust to outliers. However, this idea is out of the scope of our paper, and we leave it for future work.\n\nC. M. Bishop. Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. Springer, 2006. ISBN 978-0387-31073-2.

In what follows we shall try to elucidate these two terms.\n\nA rendering path is a set of latent variables (s_{l}, t_{l}, y), l = 1,2,...,L, in the NRM, where s_{l} decides to render or not at particular locations in layer l, t_{l} decides how to translate the rendered image locally in layer l, and y is the class label. This corresponds to a set of the ON-OFF states of the ReLUs, the argmax values from the Max Pooling layers, and the class label y in the CNN. For example, let consider a 2 x 2 image patch at layer 1 in the CNN, taking the following values [2, -3; -4, 5]. After applying Max Pooling, our patch yields one scalar, which is 5. The argmax values from the Max Pooling is then 4 or Lower Right, which implies that the Lower Right location has the highest pixel value in our patch. 4 or Lower Right is then the value for t_{1} at the corresponding pixel in the layer 1 of the NRM. After applying ReLU on 5 yield the same value 5. The ON-OFF states of the ReLU will be 1 instead of 0. 1 is then the value for s_{1} at the corresponding pixel locations in the layer 1 of the NRM. A particular value for (s_{l}, t_{l}, y), l = 1,2,...,L, defines a rendering path in NRM.\n\nThe Rendering Path Normalization (RPN) term is proportional to the negative of the log prior of the most probable rendering path (see equation 8). When minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the NRM, this RPN term encourages that the rendering path estimated by the CNN during inference has higher prior compared to other rendering paths. \n\nWe will amend the text to include the explanation above."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1416/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1416/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1416/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Rendering Model: Joint Generation and Prediction for Semi-Supervised Learning", "abstract": "Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning are important problems that are especially challenging with complex data like natural images.

The NRM\u2019s supervised learning objective is lower bounded by a variant of the cross-entropy objective. This objective is used to formulate a max-min network, which has a particular type of weight sharing between a standard branch with max pooling / ReLUs and a second branch with min pooling / NReLUs. The max-min objective and network show strong performance on semi-supervised learning tasks. \n\nPosing a CNN as inference in a generative model is an interesting direction, and could be very useful for probabilistic inference in the context of neural nets. However, the paper is rather difficult to follow and requires frequent reference to the appendix to understand the main body. Some important components (like those relating to rendering paths and RPNs) are given good intuitive explanations early on but remain a bit ambiguous throughout the paper. I would recommend improving the presentation before publication.\n\nQuestion: \u201cwe can modify NRM to incorporate our knowledge of the tasks and datasets into the model and perform JMAP inference to achieve a new CNN architecture.\u201c\nI appreciate the CNN / NRM correspondence in Table 1, and see how the NRM may be modified to produce modified CNN architectures.
