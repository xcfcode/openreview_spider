The main focus of their work is object localization, and so is not comparable to ours as we focus on object classification. Another reason the work is not comparable is because their feedback model is not tied to the bottom-up model like ours. In our work top-down (feedback) and bottom-up are tied mathematically, unlike Cao et al.'s ad-hoc feedback model. In fact, there is no learning involved with their feedback model as they optimize the activations to maximize the target score of interest.\n\n\nWe tried evaluating multiple blocks on top of class-agnostic features. In the table below, we show the number of multiplication operations and test error rates when using multiple energy-based classifiers. The number of blocks for the entire network is always fixed at 7, so if 3 energy-based classifiers are stacked at the very top, then 4 class-agnostic feature extraction blocks are stacked below them. Blocks=2 is SSC+EBC_{6-7} in the paper. Performance at blocks=3 is the same as blocks=2, but at 53% more computation. The increased computational cost makes training much more difficult, while the increased network capacity increases the likelihood of the model overfitting the training data (as seen with blocks=4). Further decrease in test error will likely require more training data.\n\nEnery-Based     Computation Cost            Performance                                                                                                                                                             \nBlocks          (#Multiply Ops)     (Train Error)   (Test Error)\n1               647M                0.0085          0.1019\n2               713M                0.0021          0.0923\n3               1,096M              0.0014          0.0923\n4               2,624M              0.0013          0.0954\n5               4,153M\n6               4,918M\n7               6,446M"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Energy-Based Spherical Sparse Coding", "abstract": "In this paper, we explore an efficient variant of convolutional sparse coding with unit norm code vectors and reconstructions are evaluated using an inner product (cosine distance).

The experimental evaluation is limited (a single database and a single baseline)\n\n------\n\nThe motivation of the sparse coding scheme is to perform inference in a feed forward manner. This property does not hold in the multi stage setting, thus optimization would be required (as clarified by the authors).\n\nHaving an efficient way of performing a bi-directional coding scheme is very interesting. As the authors clarified, this could not necessarily be the case, as the model needs to be evaluated many times for performing a classification.\n\nMaybe an interesting combination would be to run the model without any class-specific bias, and evaluation only the top K predictions with the energy-based setting.\n\nHaving said this, it would be good to include a discussion (if not direct comparisons) of the trade-offs of using a model as the one proposed by Cao et al. Eg. computational costs, performance.\n\nUsing the bidirectional coding only on the top layers seems reasonable: one can get a good low level representation in a class agnostic way. This, however could be studied in more detail, for instance showing empirically the trade offs. If I understand correctly, now only one setting is being reported.\n\nFinally, the authors mention that one benefit of using the architecture derived from the proposed coding method is the spherical normalization scheme, which can lead to smoother optimization dynamics. Does the baseline (or model) use batch-normalization? If not, seems relevant to test.\n\n\nMinor comments:\n\nI find figure 2 (d) confusing. I would not plot this setting as it does not lead to a function (as the authors state in the text).\n\n\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Energy-Based Spherical Sparse Coding", "abstract": "In this paper, we explore an efficient variant of convolutional sparse coding with unit norm code vectors and reconstructions are evaluated using an inner product (cosine distance).

I am wondering whether this is necessary but there is no ablation study to prove that. Please justify.\n\n\nSec. 3. Equ. 13 you need to solve K spherical sparse coding problem in this Equation, where K is the number of classes. That is to say, you need K feed-forward sparse coding net in order to evaluating the loss. If K is large it is quite computational expensive. Could you please comment this?\n\nSome related work should be discussed. Karol Gregor and Yann LeCun \"Learning Fast Approximations of Sparse Coding\" ICML10.

I find the idea interesting.\n\nThe optimisation in the single layer setting is clearly explained, however, the multi-layer case is not, in my opinion. Is the global optimisation still feed forward? \n\nThere are approaches that attempt the same objective with recurrent settings (such as Cao et al. cited in the paper) The authors say that the advantage of the proposed formulation is that it is feed forward rather than iterative. However, the forward pass of the EB-SSC network needs to be performed as many times as distinct labels are considered. Conditioning acts not only the last layer, but the full network, if I understand correctly from Table 1. This can be expensive and, with many classes, comparable to an iterative procedure. Please clarify. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nIn my opinion it would be good to include a section describing the multi layer setting. Please, let us know if results are updated in the PDF with the larger model (max pooled version of the model)."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Energy-Based Spherical Sparse Coding", "abstract": "In this paper, we explore an efficient variant of convolutional sparse coding with unit norm code vectors and reconstructions are evaluated using an inner product (cosine distance).
