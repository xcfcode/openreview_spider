These experiments are characterized by a high experimental variability, which makes difficult to process results. The proposed MELD algorithm maps hard group assignments (e.g. treatment/control in {-1, 1}) to soft assignments (in [-1, 1]) thanks to a low-pass filtering based on a graph built using data related to each cell. This later allows the authors to cluster relevant groups of cells, leading to biological insights.\nNote that the paper is an excerpt of the bioRxiv paper of (Burkhardt et al.) (cited in the paper).\n\n* Comment:\n\nThis paper is quite dense and makes a heavy use of technical acronyms, but it remains understandable and is well written besides that.\n\nMy main concern is related to the experimental validation of the method by the authors, which appears quite qualitative to me. Indeed, the authors mainly observe that the proposed method allows them to gain biological insights on some past experiments. While this is interesting from a biological perspective, from a machine learning perspective a more thorough benchmarking of MELD would have been appreciated. Maybe using a synthetic model would help understand its possible weaknesses?\n\nDespite this concern, I would still vote in favor of acceptance for this paper, as methods removing \"noise\" from data to increase its \"signal\" ratio would probably be of interest to the LLD community.", "rating": "3: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper45/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper45/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Enhancing experimental signals in single-cell RNA-sequencing data using graph signal processing", "authors": ["Daniel B.
