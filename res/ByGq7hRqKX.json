While the gated attention mechanism designed in this paper seems to yield nice interpretable representations (thanks for Fig 9!), I still can't see how this gating mechanism can scale to anything like natural language \u2014 take the more complex sentences in the Embodied QA dataset [1], for example \u2014 without major revisions. As such, it's not clear why we should take the Dual GA mechanism to be an important milestone on the way to bigger EQA accomplishments.\n\nRe #3: No-Aux seems to converge on this task, true \u2014 but the representations in figure 9 suggest that convergence is nowhere near optimal. I'm worried the model with the No-Aux constraint will also not scale as-is.\nI understand that, while learning in this task with model-free RL, there is little an agent can do to learn a word but to accidentally bump into the relevant object or accidentally predict the correct answer. This seems like a fundamental direction for improvement, either by model iteration or novel task design, since *human children* clearly learn much more than the model-free exploration in the current task can support.\n\nThanks for adding figure 13 \u2014 but please note in the caption that these are not an arbitrary \"3 models\", but the 3 *best* models. (How many training trajectories look like these 3 models? How many don't converge?)\n\nDue to the above concerns about model scalability and the framing of the task, I'm keeping my rating as-is.\n\n[1]: https://embodiedqa.org/"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1386/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1386/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1386/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Cross-Task Knowledge Transfer for Visually-Grounded Navigation", "abstract": "Recent efforts on training visual navigation agents conditioned on language using deep reinforcement learning have been successful in learning policies for two different tasks: learning to follow navigational instructions and embodied question answering.

Both the videos and figure indicate that our proposed model learns to detect objects and attributes corresponding to the word in relevant convolutional output channels even when it is not trained with auxiliary labels. \n\n- Addition of training curves with different seeds:\nAs requested by Reviewer 1, we added training curves for top 3 models across 3 training runs with different seeds both with and without auxiliary tasks for Easy environment in Figure 13 in the appendix C. The performance of our proposed model is fairly consistent across different runs. The variance across different runs is higher in the NoAux setting as compared to the Aux setting. We also removed the shaded region in other training curves to avoid confusion.\n\n- Addition of references to missing prior work:\nIn the original submission, we discussed prior work on visually-grounded navigation tasks. We thank Reviewers 2 and 3 for pointing us to relevant prior work on multimodal learning in static settings which do not involve navigation or reinforcement learning. We added references to prior methods which use similar attention mechanisms for Visual Question Answering [1,2,3] and grounding audio to vision [4]. We also added a reference to prior work which explored the use of object recognition as an auxiliary task for Visual Question Answering [3]. In contrast to these works, we propose a new non-trivial multitask learning problem of multimodal tasks with different action spaces, and define a novel scenario of testing cross-task knowledge transfer. We also create appropriate datasets, RL environments, and train-test splits for evaluating the above. Even though the individual attention mechanisms are similar to ones used in prior work, we propose a unique combination of these attention mechanisms to be used with specific kind of representations in order to achieve cross-task knowledge transfer.\n\n- Additional experiment on using text as subtitles:\nAs requested by Reviewer 3, we ran an experiment where we superimposed the text in the top part of the image and trained a unimodal RL network with the same convolutional network and recurrent policy module as in our proposed model using PPO. The test performance of the model was similar to the Image only baseline (0.21 SGN accuracy, and 0.10 EQA accuracy for Easy Aux setting). This highlights the need for multimodal learning and dual-attention.\n\n- Minor changes:\nRemoved the claim of zero-shot transfer in the extension to new words using object detectors.\nRevised Figure 10 to correctly reflect the actions.\nRevised Table 3 to specify out of vocabulary words.\n\nIf there are any follow-up questions or additional queries, we will be happy to provide additional details. We look forward to actively participate in the follow-up discussion.\n\n[1] Ask, Attend and Answer: Exploring Question-Guided Spatial Attention for Visual Question Answering, Huijuan Xu, Kate Saenko\n[2] Compositional Attention Networks for Machine Reasoning.

We would like to address the concern of novelty in the presented work. First, irrespective of the method we believe the problem introduced in the paper is novel. It introduces not only a new non-trivial multitask learning problem of multimodal tasks with different action spaces, but also defines a novel scenario of testing cross-task knowledge transfer. We also create appropriate datasets, RL environments, and train-test splits for evaluating the above. \n\nIn terms of the method, we agree that the mechanism of Gated-attention or use of auxiliary tasks is not novel. However, the purpose of the paper is not to introduce a new attention mechanism or auxiliary task, but to tackle the problem of embodied multimodal multitask learning and achieve cross-task knowledge transfer. For this purpose, we proposed a unique combination of these attention mechanisms to be used with specific kind of representations (GA-BoW followed by SA followed by GA-Sent), which we believe is novel. This unique combination leads to alignment of textual and visual representations with each other and the answer space and helps achieve cross-task knowledge transfer. We also provide justification behind the choice of this unique combination. The ablation tests indicate that these attention mechanisms by themselves or a trivial combination of the attention mechanisms are both not sufficient to achieve cross-task knowledge transfer. \n\nThanks for pointing us to the relevant prior work in [1], [2] and [3]. We agree that the attention mechanisms in the Dual-Attention unit are similar to the attention mechanisms used in these works and we have made revisions in the paper to add these references. However, these prior works address VQA, which does not involve navigation as in EQA. In our tasks, the action space includes navigational actions as well as answer words, and we reuse the same architecture for both semantic goal navigation and EQA to enable cross-task knowledge transfer.\n\n[1] Ask, Attend and Answer: Exploring Question-Guided Spatial Attention for Visual Question Answering, Huijuan Xu, Kate Saenko\n[2] Drew A.

Regarding the zero-shot transfer claim:\nWe used the term 'zero-shot' to imply that we do not use any trajectories for training the policy after transfer. So it is zero-shot transfer for the policy, but we agree that some static samples are required for training the object detectors. We have revised the manuscript to remove the claim of zero-shot transfer.\n\n1b. \u201cWhy is this evaluated only for SGN and not for EQA?\u201d:\nThis is because we need additional information for EQA (e.g., whether the new word corresponds to an object type or attribute), which cannot be obtained from an object/attribute detector.\n\n2a. Use of single word objects and attributes:\nWe agree that the proposed model only handles objects and attributes described by single words. One possible way to scale the proposed architecture to more naturalistic datasets with multi-word objects and attributes is to replace the Bag-of-Words representation by a \u2018Bag-of-Concepts\u2019 representation where a separate module is trained to extract \u2018concepts\u2019 from language input. \u2018Skull key\u2019 or \u2018metallic gray\u2019 can be classified as concepts. The gated-attention can then work on concepts rather than words.\nWhile our model might be able to handle multi-word object names and attributes using a \u2018Bag-of-Concepts\u2019 representation, more complex architectures are certainly required to handle other complexities of language such as negation, conjunctions, prepositions and so on. In future, we plan to look into learning to compose dual-attention units in a recursive manner to capture the relationships between words and phrases in order to handle these complexities. The fact that all the baselines fail to generalize better than a naive Text-only model emphasizes the difficulty of the task even with single word objects and attributes.\n\n2b. Visualization of convolutional outputs:\nThanks for bringing up this interesting point. We added visualizations of the convolutional network outputs in Figure 9 in Appendix A for both Aux and No Aux models. We visualize the output corresponding to 7 words for the same frame along with the auxiliary task labels. As expected, the Aux model predictions are very close to the auxiliary task labels. More interestingly, the convolutional outputs of the No Aux model show that words and objects/properties in the images have been properly aligned even when the model is not trained with any auxiliary task labels. We also uploaded some visualization videos showing convolutional output channels corresponding to different words as well as spatial attention at the following link:\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/emml\n\n3. Need for auxiliary objectives:\nThe most important benefit of using auxiliary tasks is the improvement in sample efficiency. Although the No Aux model can perform as well as Aux model given enough training data, the sample efficiency of Aux models is much better than No Aux models as shown by the training curves in Figure 7 (Aux) and Figure 12 (No Aux) in the appendix. The only way of learning new objects without auxiliary tasks is randomly bumping into objects or predicting an answer and receiving rewards and making a connection between the visual and textual modalities and the rewards. Auxiliary tasks provide additional supervision which helps in training the model much faster. As we scale embodied RL agents to learn thousands of objects and attributes, it might not be possible to train such models without auxiliary tasks as the trial-and-error method of learning new objects and attributes might require samples beyond the current computing capabilities. The sample inefficiency is partly an optimization issue (not just PPO but any RL algorithm in general) but also the task itself is very challenging with just sparse rewards.\n\nWhile auxiliary tasks improve the sample efficiency, we show that the proposed model works well even without the auxiliary tasks. This is useful for scenarios where we do not have the auxiliary labels for all or a subset of the objects and attributes.\n\nResponse to minor notes\n4a. We revised Figure 10 to correctly reflect the actions.\n4b. The shaded region does not represent the variance across multiple runs. Each point in the curves in fig 7 and 8 is calculated using weighted running average across time (Gaussian smoothing), the shaded region represents the amount of smoothing applied at each point in a single run. We removed the shaded region in all relevant figures to avoid this confusion. We also added training curves for 3 top models across 3 training runs with different seeds both with and without auxiliary tasks for Easy environment in Figure 13 in the appendix C. The performance of our proposed model is consistent across different runs. The variance across different runs is higher in the NoAux setting as compared to the Aux setting.\n4c.

They outperform a number of baseline models originally developed for EQA and SGN (but trained and evaluated in this multitask paradigm).\n\nComments and questions on the model and evaluation follow.\n\n1. Zero-shot transfer claim:\n1a. This is not really zero-shot transfer, is it? You need to derive object detectors for the meanings of the novel words (\u201cred\u201d and \u201cpillar\u201d from the example in the paper). It seems like this behavior is supported directly in the structure of the model, which is great \u2014 but I don\u2019t think it can be called \u201czero-shot\u201d inference. Let me know if I\u2019ve misunderstood!\n1b. Why is this evaluated only for SGN and not for EQA?\n\n2. Dual attention module:\n2a. The gated attention model only makes sense for inputs in which objects or properties (the things picked out by convolutional filters) are cued by single words. Are there examples in the dataset where this constraint hold (e.g. negated properties like \u201cnot red\u201d)? How does the model do? (How do you expect to scale this model to more naturalistic datasets with this strong constraint?)\n2b. A critical claim of the paper is that the model learns to \u201calign the words in both the tasks and transfer knowledge across tasks.\u201d (Earlier in the paper, the claim is that \u201cThis forces the convolutional network to encode all the information required with respect to a certain word in the corresponding output channel.\u201d) I was expecting you would show some gated-attention visualizations (not spatial-attention visualizations, which are downstream) to back up this claim. Can you show me visualizations of the gated-attention weights (especially when trained on the No-Aux task) which demonstrate that words and objects/properties in the images have been properly aligned? Show that e.g. the filter at index i only picks out objects/properties cued by word i?\n\n3. Auxiliary objective: it seems like this objective solves most of the language understanding problem relevant in this task. Can you motivate why it is necessary? What is missing in the No-Aux condition, exactly? Is it just an issue with PPO optimization? Can you do error analysis on No-Aux to motivate the use of the Aux task?\n\n4. Minor notes:\n4a. In appendix A, the action is labeled \u201cTurn Left\u201d but the frames seem to suggest that the agent is turning right.\n4b. How are the shaded regions estimated in figs. 7, 8?
