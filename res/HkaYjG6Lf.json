The authors just show that the proposed encoder-decoder works on two other datasets. \n- The approach seems to be fully supervised, requiring knowing the poses corresponding to the images.\n- There is no motivation of why exactly is this approach specifically interesting. Does it perform better than alternatives? Does it allow for something that previously was impossible?\n\nTo conclude, the paper looks somewhat interesting, but it\u2019s a minimal addition to a previously published paper. It's unclear why this addition is interesting.
