More background material. \nThe reviewer is correct, the paper covers a wide range of topics quite rapidly. We will provide more discussion in the related work section and also the Appendix to help orient readers.\n\n2. Move Lemma 1 before Definition 2? \nYes, will do.\n\n3. Use \u201cclassic definition of Nash\u201d. \nYes\n\n4. Define potential games. \nWe will put this in the appendix to save space.\n\n5. How can stop_grad cause problems? \n\nStop_grad can be used to construct essentially any smooth game, see discussion in Appendix C. Stop_grad thus opens the door to a huge variety of pathological behaviors and intractable dynamics. We will provide a more detailed explanation in the final version.\n\n6. Near zero-sum. \n\nAlthough GANs are adversarial, they are not always zero-sum games. A concrete example is discussed in sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 of Goodfellow\u2019s tutorial (https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00160). In short, it turns out that gradients tend to saturate in the original minmax setting, so Goodfellow introduced a \u201cheuristic, non-saturating game\u201d. By now there is a huge number of GANs in the literature, and it is difficult to find any mathematical property that is common to all of them. In particular, we do not have a precise definition of \u201cnear zero-sum\u201d. Nevertheless, GANs do share adversarial dynamics as a unifying theme. Appendix B of the paper contains a brief discussion of some implications of loosening the pairwise zero-sum constraint.I\n\n7. Why are forecasts always positive? \n\nSection 5 imposes the condition that \u201cproduction updates\u201d are either gradients or gradients rescaled by positive learning rates. Firms that update their production vectors using gradients will therefore always forecast profits to infinitesimally increase -- precisely because the updates are in the direction of steepest ascent. However, in reality, profits may of course go down due to the actions of other firms."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2240/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2240/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["dbalduzzi@google.com", "lejlot@google.com", "edwardhughes@google.com", "jzl@google.com", "imgemp@google.com", "twa@google.com", "georgios.piliouras@gmail.com", "thore@google.com"], "title": "Smooth markets: A basic mechanism for organizing gradient-based learners", "authors": ["David Balduzzi", "Wojciech M.

We find the Scott quote inspiring because it suggests to let go of equilibria and instead search for measurements that can be pieced together to provide a synoptic view (a map) of a game. That is, we don\u2019t need to find Nash equilibria to understand what is happening or predict what will happen in an interacting population. \n\n2.

It is well written and there are nice examples to illustrate the central ideas. However, I do have some criticisms:\n\n1. The writing in this paper is sometimes pompous. Quoting James Scott has no added value to this work. Reference to Adam Smith\u2019s invisible hand not only has no added value but is also confusing and detracts from the paper \u2014 SM-games are not purporting to be real economic models.\n2. Throughout the paper there is a confusing mix between ideas from economics and ideas from accounting. For example, it is not correct to say that aggregate revenue is the same as GDP. Revenue is an accounting term to show how much benefit you record in a year. GDP measures the value of\u00a0production. It would be more accurate to write that aggregate output and GDP are the same. But if SM-games are reflecting the perspective of an accountant, as is stated, why is GDP being discussed at all? Similarly, the idea of a dummy player with off the book costs is not consistent with an accounting perspective. I think that the paper would be clearest if it did not attempt to use terminology from other fields. But if it is going to do so, it should make a more substantial effort to do so consistently."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2240/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2240/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["dbalduzzi@google.com", "lejlot@google.com", "edwardhughes@google.com", "jzl@google.com", "imgemp@google.com", "twa@google.com", "georgios.piliouras@gmail.com", "thore@google.com"], "title": "Smooth markets: A basic mechanism for organizing gradient-based learners", "authors": ["David Balduzzi", "Wojciech M.

The paper is clear, concise, and well-written, and hence I do not have any overarching comments. There are several suggestions and questions, though, that I\u2019d like to propose.\n\n1. Since many concepts are not from the machine learning domain, further and more detailed touch on related work are very beneficial. The current section of related work (Section 1.2) is more succinct than laying the right background information. Authors could consider giving some examples of \u201cmarket mechanism\u201d, and similarly for \u201cdesign pattern\u201d. This can give readers some ideas on how this present work\u2019s use of \u201cexisting design pattern\u201d is different from prior works\u2019 proposals of \u201cmarket mechanism\u201d. Again for the second paragraph, although these concepts are more familiar to the audience, a short description for each mentioned concept is good to include (e.g. monotone games, etc)\n\n2. Move Lemma 1 before Definition 2? Since Lemma 1 is most related to Definition 1 and not related to Definition 2.\n\n3. For Definition 2, authors could consider adding \u201cthe classic definition [of Nash equilibrium]\u201d to the list to clarify the difference. This classic Nash equilibrium definition will be referred to again in later sections. \n\n4. In Section 2.1, consider giving a formal definition of \u201cpotential game\u201d.\n\n5. In Section 2.3, it is not immediately clear after the text why stop_gradient becomes a problem.\n\n6. In Section 3.1, could we elucidate a bit on what is \u201cnear zero sum\u201d?\n\n7. In Section 5, why the equation following the text \u201cfirm i\u2019s forecast\u201d is always positive? Since by definition, forecast is meant to represent the change of profit, which can be negative?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2240/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2240/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["dbalduzzi@google.com", "lejlot@google.com", "edwardhughes@google.com", "jzl@google.com", "imgemp@google.com", "twa@google.com", "georgios.piliouras@gmail.com", "thore@google.com"], "title": "Smooth markets: A basic mechanism for organizing gradient-based learners", "authors": ["David Balduzzi", "Wojciech M.

Unfortunately, negative results from game theory show there is little hope of understanding or controlling general n-player games.

SM-games codify a common design pattern in machine learning that includes some GANs, adversarial training, and other recent algorithms.
