Using BPE in our experiments. \nThanks for your suggestion again. We admit that the setting is slightly out of the current main stream of NMT research. To enrich our experiments, we accept your suggestion by adopting BPE to compare with the paper of Bastings et al. [ref-1] which also leverages BPE. We get 40.2 (BLEU1) and 11.11 (BLEU4) on WMT16 English-Czech dataset, which improves the BLEU scores by 1.4 (BLEU1) and 1.51 (BLEU4) than Bastings et al. [ref-1]. This improvement verifies the effective performance of the proposed method on the top-line NMT baselines. The experiment details are shown in Section 4.4.\n\nQ2. Large training datasets. \nWe would like to evaluate our model on the large WMT dataset (the WMT2014 English-to-German) but it is still running. After getting the results, we will post the results here and release the full experiments in the final version. For the dataset, the compared methods including ICLR18 [ref-2], NIPS18 [ref-3], EMNLP16 [ref-4], ICML17 [ref-5] only utilize the IWSLT-2014 and 2015 datasets for NMT task. To academic research, we think our experiments on current four datasets from IWSLT-2014 German-to-English, IWSLT-2014 English-to-German, IWSLT-2015 English-to-Vietnamese, and WMT-2016 English-Czech can be acceptable. \n\n[ref-1] Joost Bastings, Ivan Titov, Wilker Aziz, Diego Marcheggiani, and Khalil Sima\u2019an.

The weak baseline. \nFor the Seq2Seq baseline, we report the BLEU scores of 23.87 and 22.31, which are from the HarvardNLP work [ref-1]. Because they focus on the beam-search optimization, the non-fine-tuning results in the low BLEU scores. After fine-tuning Seq2Seq, we get the BLEU scores of 28.79 and 26.90 on beam and greedy search respectively. We also compare with the NAACL18 work [ref-2], which is still lower than our GraphSeq2Seq by 0.48. Compared to Seq2Seq, we mainly show that Graph2Seq can be used to improve the performance of Seq2Seq. This also reveals the effectiveness of our GraphSeq2Seq since it is a reasonable combination of Graph2Seq and Seq2Seq. All results are updated in the revision. \n\nQ2. Fairness for Graph2Seq. \nTo fairly compare with Bastings et al. [ref-3] which also fuses graph information for the NMT task, we set the same settings to do experiments. Our GraphSeq2Seq gets 40.2 (BLEU1) and 11.11 (BLEU4) on WMT16 English-Czech dataset, whereas the results of [ref-3] are 38.8 (BLEU1) and 9.6 (BLEU4). That means GraphSeq2Seq increases the BLEU scores by 1.4 (BLEU1) and 1.51 (BLEU4) than Bastings et al. [ref-3]. The experiment details are shown in Section 4.4.\nMoreover, NIPS\u201918 [ref-4] also considers Graph Representations in NMT task. By revising our vocab size to 50,000 trying to fairly compare with [ref-4], we get the BLEU scores of 29.47 and 27.90 on beam and greedy search on IWSLT2014 German-English dataset, which are slightly higher by 0.13 and 0.27 than the result reported by [ref-4].\n\nQ3. Quantitative analysis of how GraphSeq2Seq outperforms Graph2Seq and Seq2Seq. \nWe do two experiments to show the quantitative analysis of our GraphSeq2Seq. \n1) The first experiment is used to show the impact of the sequential encoder in the Graph2Seq [ref-5] based on three datasets. To a fair qualitative comparison, we directly use the code of the Graph2Seq [ref-5]. By adding the bidirectional sequence encoder into this code, our GraphSeq2Seq gets the improvements of 8.35 and 9.17 on beam and greedy search on IWSLT2014 German-English dataset,  4.93 and 5.7 on IWSLT2014 English-German dataset, 4.89 and 5.78 on IWSLT2015 English-to-Vietnamese dataset, 4.2 (BLEU1) and 2.89(BLEU4) on WMT2016 English-to-Czech dataset. This significant improvement definitely verifies the effectiveness of the sequential encoder. Furthermore, based on Seq2Seq, adding the sub-graph encoder gets the improvements of 1.87 and 2.16 on beam and greedy search on IWSLT2014 German-English dataset,  4.73 and 4.76 on IWSLT2014 English-German dataset, 3.52 and 2.98 on IWSLT2015 English-to-Vietnamese dataset, 2.0 (BLEU1) and 1.18(BLEU4) on WMT2016 English-to-Czech dataset. This significant improvement definitely verifies the effectiveness of the sub-graph encoder. The results of this experiment are reported in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n2) The second experiment is used to verify the quantitative analysis of our GraphSeq2Seq with random graph and sequence noises based on IWSLT2014 German-English dataset. As shown in Table 2, the random noises change from 0% to 75%, where 75% indicates that 75% of the graph and sequence information are noises. 100% is not performed because it is meaningless in real life. Table 2 shows that the BLEU scores go to bad from 29.06 (Greedy) and 30.66 (Beam) to 17.38 and 20.28 when the sequence noise varies from  0% to 75%. For the graph noise, we have a similar observation that the BLEU scores go to bad from 29.06 (Greedy) and 30.66 (Beam) to 24.19 and 26.08 when the graph noise varies from  0% to 75%. It demonstrates that both graph and sequence information are effective in our GraphSeq2Seq, and the performance relies on their qualities. The detailed experiment is shown in Table 5 in the revision.\n\n[ref-1] Sam Wiseman and Alexander M. Rush. Sequence-to-sequence learning as beam-search optimization. In Proc.

The clarity of section 3.3. \nIn section 3.3, we mainly present a variant of the encoder part of our GraphSeq2Seq. As shown in Fig.2, after the sub-graph encoder, we get the hidden feature for each node. Then we rebuild the sub-graph for the current node. For the rebuilt sub-graph, its outgoing hidden feature is the input of a Graph_Out Bi-LSTM, while its incoming hidden feature is for a Graph_in Bi-LSTM. For the current node, its node representation is utilized for a Node Sequence Bi-LSTM. \nThe main difference is that the original model is to encode the concated representation of the sub-graph by using only one Bi-LSTM, while the variant model leverages three Bi-LSTMs to respectively encode the specific representations of the sub-graph, including the incoming feature, the outgoing feature, and the node representation.\nWe clarify it in the revision and revise Fig. 2 to illustrate it.\n\nQ2. State-of-the-arts with BPE.  \nThanks for your suggestion. We compare our model with NMPT and NMPT+LM, which are proposed by ICLR18 paper [ref-4]. Both our model and the compared method utilize the same settings and do not use BPE, so they are comparable. We think it can be acceptable. We also would like to compare with Edunov et al. [ref-1] and Deng et al. [ref-2]. However, they utilized BPE on both the source side and target side, whereas our GraphSeq2Seq cannot apply BPE on the source side. Thus, we do not choose this kind of methods for comparison. We will cite and discuss these works [ref-1,ref-2] in the revision. \nFortunately, we add a comparison with Bastings et al. [ref-3], which utilizes BPE on only the target side. We get 40.2 (BLEU1) and 11.11 (BLEU4) on WMT16 English-Czech dataset, which improves the BLEU scores by 1.4 (BLEU1) and 1.51 (BLEU4) than Bastings et al. [ref-3]. This improvement verifies the effective performance of the proposed method on the top-line NMT baselines. The experiment details are shown in Section 4.4.\n\nQ3. How much it depends on the quality of the dependency parse. \nWith regard to the impact of the dependency parse on performance, we add an experiment to discuss it. We randomly add some noise to the parsing result, and then train our model. We find the BLEU scores go to bad when the parsing result contains more noises. That means the BLEU scores degrade when considering languages with less good dependency parsers. More experiments are shown in the Response of Q3 for AC comments and Table 5 in the revision.\n \n[ref-1] Sergey Edunov, Myle Ott, Michael Auli, David Grangier, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato.

Just well-tuned sequence-to-sequence models can achieve a score of 29.10 on this dataset (see \"Generative Bridging Network for Neural Sequence Prediction\", NAACL 2018).

(2018); the authors propose two variants for achieving an encoded source-side representation from the subgraph embeddings, involving bidirectional lstms. The authors show that the proposed approach leads to good results on three translation datasets.\n\nThe paper is generally written fairly clearly, though I think the clarity of section 3.3 could be improved; it took me several reads to understand the architectural difference between this second variant and the original one. The results presented are also impressive: I don't think the IWSLT de-en results are in fact state of the art (e.g., Edunov et al. (NAACL 2018) and Deng et al. (NIPS 2018) outperform these numbers, though both papers use BPE, whereas I assume the current paper does not), but the results on the other two datasets appear to be.\n\nRegarding the approach in general, it would be nice to see how much it depends on the quality of the dependency parse. In particular, while we might expect the en-de and en-vi results to be good because dependency parsers for English are relatively good, how much does performance degrade when considering languages with less good dependency parsers?\n\nPros:\n- Good results, fairly simple model\n\nCons:\n- Somewhat incremental, not clear how much method depends on quality of the dependency parser", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper759/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "GraphSeq2Seq: Graph-Sequence-to-Sequence for Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "Sequence-to-Sequence  (Seq2Seq)  neural  models  have  become  popular  for  text generation problems,  e.g.   neural machine translation (NMT) (Bahdanau et al.,2014;  Britz  et  al.,  2017),  text  summarization  (Nallapati  et  al.,  2017;  Wang  &Ling, 2016), and image captioning (Venugopalan et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2017).
