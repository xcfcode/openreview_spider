The lack of internet infrastructure results in farmers in rural areas using community radio to share concerns related to agriculture. Therefore accurate keyword spotting techniques can potentially help researchers flag up areas of interest. The main engineering challenge that the study deals with is the fact that there isn\u2019t a lot of training data available for languages like Lugandu.\n\nDetailed Comments\n\n Section 3\n\n1. The word \u201cscrapped\u201d should be replaced with \u201cscraped\u201d.\n2. Its not entirely clearly what is meant by \u201cas well as an alternative keyword in form of a stem\u201d. What is meant by \u201cstem\u201d in this context? Maybe a citation or an example would make it more clear. \n3. The corpus of keywords supposedly contains 193 distinct keywords however the models in Section 4 are only trained to discriminate between 10 randomly sampled keywords. I don\u2019t understand why this is. Training on the full corpus would allow the network to see more training data and consequently might result in more accurate models. \n\nSection 4\n\n1. The authors refer to Equation 3 in Section 4.1, but I think the reference is to Equation 2.\n2. The 1-D CNN has 14 layers but it is not clear to me what the size of the final network is. It would be useful to provide more details of the architecture and a comment about the network size either in terms of number of parameters, number of computations or size of the network weights on disk. \n3. The figure for  the Siamese network should be numbered. \n4. The authors say that the inputs to the ResNets are of shape 32x100. What do these dimensions refer to? Are their 32 frequency bins? Are their 100 frames as inputs? What are the parameters of the FFT computation? Do 100 frames correspond to a second of audio? \n5. How many parameters are their in the Siamese network? \n6. Its not clear to me how the Siamese networks are used during inference. The authors say they use the L1 distance to determine if a given test example is similar to a given keyword. How are the examples for the keyword of interest selected? Are all training examples used and the scores average? Are the training examples averaged first to form a centroid vector for  the keyword? \n\nComments on the methodology\n\nOne of the main challenges in this work is the fact that there isn\u2019t a large number of training examples available. However the authors still train relatively large acoustic models with 14 layers for 1-D CNN and a ResNet for the Siamese architecture. There are several studies for keyword spotting on mobile devices that aim to train tiny networks that consume very little power [1] [2]. I think it would be more appropriate to start with architectures similar to these due to the small size of the training dataset. Additionally, it would also be very useful to try and identify languages that are phonetically similar to Lugandu and that have training datasets available for speech recognition. Acoustic models trained on this data can then be adapted to the keyword spotting task using the training set collected for this task. Note that the languages need to have only a small amount of phonetic overlap in order for these acoustic models to be useful starting points for training keyword spotting models. \n\nComments on the evalation\n\nThe keyword spotting models presented here are trained with the intention of applying them to streaming radio data. However, the models are trained and tested on fixed chunks of audio. A big problem with this experimental design is that the models can overfit to confounding audio cues in the training data. For example, if all training data are in the form of 1 second audio chunks and all chunks have at least some silence at the start, then the models learn that a keyword is always preceded by a certain duration of silence. This is not the case when keywords occur in the middle of sentences in streaming audio data. The fact that the evaluation is also performed on individual chunks of audio fails to evaluate how the trained models would behave when presented streaming audio. I am certain that when applied to streaming audio these models would false trigger very often, however this fact isn\u2019t reflected by measuring precision and recall on fixed chunks of test audio. \n\nA more principled evaluation strategy would be to present results in the form of detection-error tradeoff (DET) curves [1], [2]. Here the chunks with examples of the keyword in question can be used to measure the number of false rejects by the system. And long streams of audio data that do not contain the keyword should be used to measure the false alarms. Given that its relatively easy to collect streams of radio data, the false alarms can be measured in terms of the number of false alarms per unit time (minutes, hours or days). This evaluation strategy roughly simulates the streaming conditions in which this model is intended to be deployed. Furthermore, DET curves present the tradeoff between false alarms and false rejects as a function of the operating threshold, which provides much more insight into the performance/accuracy of the trained models. \n\nSummary\n\nI think the area of application of this work is extremely interesting, however the training and evaluation methodologies have to be updated in order to realistically measure the way this system might perform in real-world test conditions. \n\nReferences\n\n[1] Small-footprint Keyword Spotting Using Deep Neural Networks\n[2] Efficient Voice Trigger Detection for Low Resource Hardware\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2548/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2548/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["akeraben@gmail.com", "jnakatumba@cis.mak.ac.ug", "ali.hussein@ronininstitute.org", "ssendiwaladaniel@gmail.com", "jonmuk7@gmail.com"], "title": "Keyword Spotter Model for Crop Pest and Disease Monitoring from Community Radio Data", "authors": ["Benjamin Akera", "Joyce Nakatumba-Nabende", "Ali Hussein", "Daniel Ssendiwala", "Jonathan Mukiibi"], "TL;DR": "This paper describes an approach to analyse community radio data with machine learning-based speech keyword spotting techniques for crop pest and disease monitoring.", "abstract": "In societies with well developed internet infrastructure, social media is the leading medium of communication for various social issues especially for breaking news situations.

The authors identify keywords related to agriculture and build a model that can automatically detect these keywords of interest. Their contribution is the proposed model relies on relatively simple neural networks (15-layer 1-D CNNs) to achieve keyword detection of low resourced language (e.g., Luganda). Therefore, they are capable of monitoring food security concerns in rural areas.\n\nThis paper should be rejected because (1) no novel algorithm is proposed and only straightforward solution is used (2) the paper never clearly demonstrates the existence of problem they are trying to solve, (3) the experiments are difficult to understand and missing many details, and (4) the paper is incomplete and unpolished.\n\nMain argument\nThe paper does not do a great job of demonstrating that current model development and drawbacks of dealing with low resourced language (e.g., Luganda). They said they solve the problem by the Keywords Spotting system (KWS), but they did not give a comprehensive review of the current progress of KWS. For example, they should include and compare with the paper, called \u201cSpeech recognition and keyword spotting for low-resource languages: Babel Project Research at CUED\u201d by Dr. Mark Gales.\n\nWhen it comes to methodology, the authors use unnecessary pages to describe how they collect Luganda audios and keyword dataset. It would be appropriate to illustrate their data flow or detection pipeline instead of irrelevant engineering details. In addition, SIAMESE CNN is used to compare performance, but the authors use a relatively large portion of the paper to explain its architecture. Did their method developed beyond SIAMESE CNN? Otherwise, it would be inappropriate to describe it in methodology and model design. For the 1D convolution model, the model is demonstrated in an extremely simple way. They did not even mention their target data (Y), please clarify it in detail.\nThe experiment did not provide convincing evidence of the utility of the proposed method (1-D convolution). They only demonstrated results in 1 dataset, which did not indicate the effectiveness of the model. There are so many missing details. How many times the experiment they did? How much size is an audio file? Why 1d-conv show the same values of accuracy, precision, and recall? What\u2019s the model drawn in Figure 1? The paper lacks complete discussion on their empirical results. We did not know how to interpret their results.\n\nConsidering the above, there are many drawbacks to the paper. The paper seems incomplete. Therefore, we highly recommend rejecting the paper.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2548/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2548/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["akeraben@gmail.com", "jnakatumba@cis.mak.ac.ug", "ali.hussein@ronininstitute.org", "ssendiwaladaniel@gmail.com", "jonmuk7@gmail.com"], "title": "Keyword Spotter Model for Crop Pest and Disease Monitoring from Community Radio Data", "authors": ["Benjamin Akera", "Joyce Nakatumba-Nabende", "Ali Hussein", "Daniel Ssendiwala", "Jonathan Mukiibi"], "TL;DR": "This paper describes an approach to analyse community radio data with machine learning-based speech keyword spotting techniques for crop pest and disease monitoring.", "abstract": "In societies with well developed internet infrastructure, social media is the leading medium of communication for various social issues especially for breaking news situations. In rural Uganda however, public community radio is still a dominant means for news dissemination. Community radio gives audience to the general public especially to individuals living in rural areas, and thus plays an important role in giving a voice to those living in the broadcast area. It is an avenue for participatory communication and a tool relevant in both economic and social development.This is supported by the rise to ubiquity of mobile phones providing access to phone-in or text-in talk shows. In this paper, we describe an approach to analysing the readily available community radio data with machine learning-based speech keyword spotting techniques. We identify the keywords of interest related to agriculture and build models to automatically identify these keywords from audio streams.
