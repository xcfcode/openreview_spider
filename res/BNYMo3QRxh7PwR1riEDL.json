The conditional computation approach has been proposed to tackle this problem (Bengio et al., 2013; Davis & Arel, 2013). It operates by selectively activating only parts of the network at a time. We propose to use reinforcement learning as a tool to optimize conditional computation policies. More specifically, we cast the problem of learning activation-dependent policies for dropping out blocks of units as reinforcement learning. We propose a learning scheme motivated by computation speed, capturing the idea of wanting to have parsimonious activations while maintaining prediction accuracy. We apply a policy gradient algorithm for learning policies that optimize this loss function and propose a regularization mechanism that encourages diversification of the dropout policy. We present encouraging empirical results showing that this approach improves the speed of computation without impacting the quality of the approximation.", "pdf": "/pdf/BNYMo3QRxh7PwR1riEDL.pdf", "paperhash": "bengio|conditional_computation_in_neural_networks_for_faster_models", "conflicts": ["mcgill.ca"], "authors": ["Emmanuel Bengio", "Pierre-Luc Bacon", "Joelle Pineau", "Doina Precup"], "authorids": ["bengioe@gmail.com", "pbacon@cs.mcgill.ca", "jpineau@cs.mcgill.ca", "dprecup@cs.mcgill.ca"]}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "tmdate": null, "cdate": 1454464564200, "ddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "duedate": 1455833700000, "tcdate": 1454464564200, "id": "ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/-/submission", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"pdf": null, "forum": null, "replyto": null, "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*", "description": "Your displayed identity associated with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"pdf": {"order": 4, "description": "Either upload a PDF file or provide a direct link to your PDF on ArXiv.", "value-regex": "upload|http://arxiv.org/pdf/.+"}, "title": {"order": 3, "description": "Title of paper.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "abstract": {"order": 4, "description": "Abstract of paper.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}, "authors": {"order": 1, "description": "Comma separated list of author names, as they appear in the paper.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "author_emails": {"order": 2, "description": "Comma separated list of author email addresses, in the same order as above.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "conflicts": {"order": 100, "description": "Semi-colon separated list of email domains of people who would have a conflict of interest in reviewing this paper, (e.g., cs.umass.edu;google.com, etc.).", "value-regex": "^([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))+(;[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))*$"}, "CMT_id": {"order": 5, "value-regex": ".*", "description": "If the paper is a resubmission from the ICLR 2016 Conference Track, enter its CMT ID; otherwise, leave blank."}}}, "invitees": [], "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "expdate": 1463609700000}}}], "count": 1}
