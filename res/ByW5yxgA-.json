This explicit duration modelling captures multiple scale of temporal resolution. The actual observations are a weighted linear combination of the emissions from each latent HMM. The structure allows for fast inference using a spectral approach.\n\nI found the paper unclear and lacking in detail in several key aspects:\n\n1. It is unclear to me from Algorithm 2 how the weight vectors w are estimated. This is not adequately explained in the section on estimation.\n\n2. The authors make the assumption that each HMM injects noise into the unobserved output which then gets propagated into the overall observation. What are reasons for his choice of model over a simpler model where the output of each HMM is uncorrupted?\n\n3. The simulation example does not really demonstrate the ability of the MSHMM to do anything other than recover structure from data simulated under an MSHMM. It would be more interesting to apply to data simulated under non-Markovian or other setups that would enable richer frequency structures to be included and the ability of MSHMM to capture these.\n\n4. The real data experiments shows some improvements in predictive accuracy with fast inference. However, the authors do not give a sufficiently broad exploration of the representations learnt by the model which allows us to understand the regimes in which the model would be advantageous.\n\nOverall, the paper presents an interesting approach but the work lacks maturity. Furthermore, simulation and real data examples to explore the properties and utility of the method are required. \n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multiscale Hidden Markov Models For Covariance Prediction", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel variant of hierarchical hidden Markov models (HMMs), the multiscale hidden Markov model (MSHMM), and an associated spectral estimation and prediction scheme that is consistent, finds global optima, and is computationally efficient.

From both our simulated experiments as well as results for covariance prediction on real data, we believe that the model misspecification is not an issue for this type of problem. It is possible that regularization of the spectral algorithm would lead to more robust results; however, we leave this for future work.\n\nWe believe that MSHMM is useful in the class of problems where there are multiple processes and the ratio of \\delta^{(i)} and \\delta^{(i+1)} is sufficiently small that one cannot detrend and sufficiently large that a single HMM or LSTM model is insufficient.\n\nEM is prohibitively slow for all but the daily covariance estimation, and thus excluded from analysis. As stated in paper, \u201cFor comparison, a simple HMM with 5 hidden states using EM required 1255 seconds to estimate parameters for 900,000 observations while our MSHMM-3-5 took 25 seconds.\u201d \n\nWe ran experiments to assess the LSTM performance.  \nThe synthetic data the relative RMSE was 1.76, which while worse than the MSHMM-3-5 and MSHMM-3-10, is better than both MSHMM-3-3 and HMM-15. It is expected that it should be better than HMM-15, but interesting that the LSTM exceeds MSHMM-3-3.\nExperiments with LSTM and an extremely recent variant SFM. We found that MSHMM outperforms the LSTM.\n\nWe are interested in suggestions on further synthetic data experiments.
