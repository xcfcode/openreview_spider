The approach is relatively straightforward but the specific problem has not been studied extensively. The evaluation using a simulated human-robot interaction task is interesting but as described seems quite narrow (and constrained). It is also probably not representative of real-world human-robot interactions where many image nuisances not modeled here (e.g., illumination, face variations, distance, clutter, etc) contribute to making the task challenging. The evaluation does not provide any compelling case for such foveating system to outperform a standard non-foveating one. It is also unlikely that the specific results regarding the best combination of FOVs would generalize to other problems.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Designing Efficient Neural Attention Systems Towards Achieving Human-level Sharp Vision", "abstract": "Human vision is capable of focusing on subtle visual cues at high resolution by relying on a foveal view coupled with an attention mechanism.
