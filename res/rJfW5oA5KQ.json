In our experiments, we did use the original Leaky ReLU activation, which works well.\n\n--- \u201cInvertible generator does not hold in practice\u201d\nIn Section 4.2, we have results on injective generators, which is more general than invertibility. Other more involved cases are left for future work.  \n\n--- \u201cReal vs. synthetic experiment\u201d\nWe did our experiments on synthetic datasets because in order to test the theory, we need to evaluate at least one \u201ctrue\u201d distance metric (such as KL or Wasserstein) between the generated distribution and the true distribution. The KL divergence can only be computed for invertible generators which, as the reviewer suggested, does not hold for real data. Wasserstein cannot be estimated for high-dimensional real data *from samples* because accurate estimation of Wasserstein requires an exponential (in dimension) number of samples. \n\nTherefore, we designed synthetic experiments so that either we know that the invertible generator can fit the data and we can compute the KL divergence (in Appendix G), or we use 2d synthetic data (in Section 5.1) for which we can compute the Wasserstein distance.\n\nThat being said, it would be a good future direction to see how our theory (or its implication) can be tested on real data.

We now respond to the specific concerns.\n\n--- The reviewer suggested swapping the contents of Section 3 with experiments in the Appendix.\n\nWe have migrated our 2d synthetic data experiment (previously Appendix F) into the main text as Section 5.1. The setups and results of our other experiment are still reported at the beginning of Section 5 and detailed in Appendix G.\n\n--- \u201cRelation between proposed discriminator design and experiments\u201d  \n\nThe goal of our specific discriminator designs is indeed not to make them better than vanilla ones, but rather to show that the restricted approximability can be achieved in principle. Our experiments verify this and show that choosing either our specific design or vanilla discriminators of reasonable capacity will yield good statistical property (IPM correlates well with KL / W_1). We note that indeed our theory suggests that the discriminator should have 2 more layers than the generator. \n\nWe have added a few paragraphs in Section 5 to clarify the purpose of our experiments, and their relationship with our theory. \n\n--- \u201cRelationship between designed discriminator F and weight clamping / gradient penalty\u201d \nSome sort of weight clamping / constraints for F is needed in any case, since F has to be a bounded set so that the IPM is bounded. We imposed operator norm constraints on the weight matrices that is particularly compatible with the theory, whereas typical weight clamping is in a stronger entry-wise fashion (e.g. in Arjovsky et al. \u201817).\n\nThe gradient penalty (GP) is indeed introduced to help the optimization in the experiments, and when we add GP we still keep the constraint on the operator norm of the weight matrices. Therefore, in our experiments in Appendix G, GP does not change the search space for the discriminators but is rather an alternative to SGD for finding a discriminator in this space. \n\n--- \u201cWhat happens when the target distribution is not in G\u201d \nOur theory builds on the assumption that p is in G (the realizable assumption), but the extension to the non-realizable case can be done straightforwardly. For example, if F can approximate log p - log q for all q in G and the data distribution p, then all the theory in the paper still holds. Indeed, our Lemma 4.3 is stated in this general form without assuming p is in G. We have revised Section 1.2 to allow such generality and mentioned that results in the non-realizable case can be established, for example, through applying Lemma 4.3."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper509/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper509/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper509/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Approximability of Discriminators Implies Diversity in GANs", "abstract": "While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have empirically produced impressive results on learning complex real-world distributions, recent works have shown that they suffer from lack of diversity or mode collapse.

It would thus be better to include experimental results into the main part of the paper rather than the current contents in Section 3.\n\n[clarity]\nIn most parts of this paper, the authors seem to propose designing a proper discriminator architecture according to the generator class, and the discriminator architecture is to be used in GAN learning. It seems, however, that a \"properly-designed discriminator architecture\" is not used at all in the experiments in Appendix F. A comparison between a \"properly-designed discriminator architecture\" and a \"vanilla fully-connected distriminator\" is found in Appendix G.4, where the advantage of the former seems marginal. The authors also seem to use the proposal not to improve GAN learning but rather as a tool for evaluation, in order to see whether the lack of diversity in GANs comes either from failure of properly evaluating the Wasserstein distance or from insufficient optimization in learning. These two distinct subjects are discussed in a mixed way, which reduces clarity of the presentation.\nIn the experiments in Appendix G, it is claimed that a discriminator with the architecture specified in Lemma 4.1 is used in GAN learning, but either weight clamping or gradient penalty is used as well. It is unclear how the specifications in Lemma 4.1 for the parameter $\\phi$ are combined with weight clamping or gradient penalty.\nSome statements include forward reference, which obscure readability. For example, in the last paragraph of Section 1.1 \"the statistical properties of GANs\" are mentioned without an explicit statement as to what they mean, which are given later in page 3, lines 6-12. As another example, in the third paragraph of Section 1.3 the authors start discussing the KL-divergence, but at this point it is not evident at all why they do it. It is not until Section 4.1 that the reader can understand the reason by observing that the main theorem (Theorem 4.2) is proved by making use of KL-divergence.\n\n[originality]\nThe idea of introducing the notion of restricted approximability and discussing a sample complexity bound, polynomial in the dimension, for GANs are considered original.\n\n[significance]\nThe whole arguments in this paper are based on the assumption that both $p$ and $q$ are in the class $\\mathcal{G}$. In the context of GAN learning, it poses no problem for the generator since we explicitly parameterize it, for example using a neural network, but in practice there is no guarantee that the target distribution also belongs to the same class, and this point would affect significance of the proposal. One may argue that when one employs a certain neural network architecture for the generator one expects that the target distribution is well expressed by a network with the prescribed architecture. But the question as to what will happen when the target distribution does not belong to the class $\\mathcal{G}$ remains. In any case, no discussion is presented in this paper as for this question.\n\n[minor points]\nPage 3, line 45: for low-dimensional (dimensions -> distributions)\n\nPage 4, line 8: Remove the parentheses enclosing Lopez-Paz & Oquab, 2016.\n\nPage 4, lines 20-21: Duplicate parentheses.\n\nPage 4, line 7: the true and estimated distribution(s) exist.\n\nPage 5, line 33: the lower and upper bound(s) differ\n\nPage 7, line 9: What do \"some assumptions\" refer to?\n\nPage 8, line 44: The(re) exists a discriminator class\n\nPage 19, line 1: there exi(s)ts a coupling", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper509/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Approximability of Discriminators Implies Diversity in GANs", "abstract": "While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have empirically produced impressive results on learning complex real-world distributions, recent works have shown that they suffer from lack of diversity or mode collapse.

Our paper shows that, from a statistical point of view, a properly restricted discriminator and generator class in Wasserstein GANs can provably learn the data distribution with a polynomial sample complexity bound. \n\nOur particular construction for injective neural nets requires :\na) the discriminators to have two more layers than the generator (with a particular structure) to ensure distinguishability;\nb) the number of samples to be larger than the discriminator complexity (but still polynomial in dimension) to ensure generalization. \n\n(2) Normalization / regularization techniques such as the spectral normalization very likely help the generalization through reducing the capacity of the discriminator class and potentially also help the optimization. Note however that merely having a nice discriminator class (potentially constrained/regularized) cannot guarantee generalization (Arora et al., 2017a), because the generator may output a mode-dropped distribution that fools all discriminators in the designed class.\n\nIndeed, the key message of our paper is that when the generator, as well as the true distribution, belong to certain structured families, and discriminators \u201ccollaborate\u201d well with the generator class (i.e. have restricted approximability), the distribution is learnable with polynomial number of samples. We give an instantiation of the framework for injective neural nets, with a discriminator class that works well empirically on synthetic data. However, generally, the \u201coptimal\u201d choice of discriminators for commonly used generator classes is still an open question and interesting direction for future work."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper509/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper509/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper509/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Approximability of Discriminators Implies Diversity in GANs", "abstract": "While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have empirically produced impressive results on learning complex real-world distributions, recent works have shown that they suffer from lack of diversity or mode collapse.
