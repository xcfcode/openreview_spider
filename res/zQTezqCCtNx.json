The authors make a convincing illustration in section 3 on how adversarial examples tend to activate more channels compared to natural examples, and adversarial training is not effective in reducing them. This provides a convincing motivation to their design of the Channel-wise Activation Suppression (CAS) module. Their CAS module is also effective in improving adversarial robustness when used in conjunction with different adversarial defense methods, including adversarial training, TRADES, and MART. \n\nI think this paper is of high quality, but I do have several questions on the details: \n1. In section 4.1 there is a difference in how the mask M is produced in training and test phase. How important is it to have the correct y available for the mask, as oppose to \\hat{y} from the channel predictions? For example it might be difficult to predict the target class from the low-level features (e.g. block 2 channel features), leading to inaccurate \\hat{y} for channel suppression. Could this be a reason for lower performance of inserting CAS into block 2 in Table 3?  \n2. Just to confirm, are both losses (CE and CAS) in Eq 5 taken into account in the generation of adversarial perturbations with FGSM and PGD? \n3. In Table 2, what does it mean to have CAS without channel suppression? Is it effectively just a CNN with predictions made from features in different layers? \n4. Do the authors have any intuitions on why having CAS module alone on Block 4 is better than having it on both Block 3 and 4 in general? \n\nI am leaning towards acceptance of this paper if the authors can address the above questions sufficiently. \n\nAfter author response: the authors have sufficiently addressed my questions and also the other reviewers' questions. I am keeping my score of acceptance.

Please find our responses below.\n\n---\n**Q1:** What is the side effect of redundant channel activations? Specifically, what is the side effect of uniform activations of the adversarial data? \n\n**A1:** As high-level features are highly correlated to the predicted class, the redundant features can easily cause mispredictions to the wrong classes, that is, poor robustness. Our experiments indicate that this negative effect is more associated with the channels.\n\n---\n**Q2:** Although CAS successfully suppresses the redundant channels of the adversarial data, CAS also seems to suppress the activations of natural data? Is this the reason for the improvement on natural accuracy?\n\n**A2:** Yes, we find that suppressing redundant channels can lead to more separable representations between different classes, and more compact representations within the same class, as we show in Figure 9 (e) and (f). Representations that are of high intra-class compactness and high inter-class separation have been shown can improve the natural accuracy [1].\n\n[1] Wen, Yandong, et al. \"A discriminative feature learning approach for deep face recognition.\" In ECCV, 2016.\n \n---\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper175/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper175/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving Adversarial Robustness via Channel-wise Activation Suppressing", "authorids": ["~Yang_Bai1", "~Yuyuan_Zeng1", "~Yong_Jiang3", "~Shu-Tao_Xia1", "~Xingjun_Ma1", "~Yisen_Wang1"], "authors": ["Yang Bai", "Yuyuan Zeng", "Yong Jiang", "Shu-Tao Xia", "Xingjun Ma", "Yisen Wang"], "keywords": ["Adversarial robustness", "channel suppressing", "activation strategy."], "abstract": "The study of adversarial examples and their activations have attracted significant attention for secure and robust learning with deep neural networks (DNNs).

Please find our responses below.\n\n---\n**Q1:** Adversarial training inhibits the magnitude of activation, what is the connection between this and network robustness?\n\n**A1:** Activation magnitude is a result of three factors: the norm of the weights, the norm of the input from the previous layer, and the angle between the two vectors. Inhibiting the activation magnitude can reduce the amplification effect of the adversarial perturbation on the current (and the next) layer activation, leading to small change at the output layer, i.e., improved robustness. Note that the activation magnitude of adversarial examples is only inhibited (by adversarial training) to be the same as that of the natural examples. \n\n---\n**Q2:** More discussions on that the closer the activation distribution of the adversarial example is to that of the clean example, the better the robustness of the network.\n\n**A2:** Channels are correlated to classes. Adversarial examples tend to activate those redundant channels that are correlated to the **wrong** classes. This can easily lead to misclassification and poor robustness. When the activation distribution of the adversarial example is the same as that of the natural example, similar channels will be activated, producing similar class prediction, i.e., good robustness.\n\n---\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper175/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper175/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving Adversarial Robustness via Channel-wise Activation Suppressing", "authorids": ["~Yang_Bai1", "~Yuyuan_Zeng1", "~Yong_Jiang3", "~Shu-Tao_Xia1", "~Xingjun_Ma1", "~Yisen_Wang1"], "authors": ["Yang Bai", "Yuyuan Zeng", "Yong Jiang", "Shu-Tao Xia", "Xingjun Ma", "Yisen Wang"], "keywords": ["Adversarial robustness", "channel suppressing", "activation strategy."], "abstract": "The study of adversarial examples and their activations have attracted significant attention for secure and robust learning with deep neural networks (DNNs).

Please find below our responses to your questions.\n\n---\n**Q1:** How does the activation threshold affect Figure 2?\n\n**A1:** The thresholding is applied for better visualization. A larger threshold will suppress more low-frequency channels, resulting in a sharper distribution. But the general patterns do not change. We have added the plots under different thresholds in Figure 10, Appendix F.6. \n\n---\n**Q2:** Is the auxiliary classifier vulnerable to attacks? If the predicted label is incorrect, how it will affect the final performance?\n\n**A2:**  The CAS module itself is robust to attacks. We have added this evaluation in Table 4 and the analysis in Section 5.1 \u201cRobustness of the CAS Module\u201d. The robustness decrease is within 1% compared to PGD-20 on both loss terms. We have also added an evaluation against an adaptive Margin Decomposition (MD) attack in Table 12 and Appendix F.5.\n\n---\n**Q3:** How well the auxiliary classifier works?\n\n**A3:** We have conducted an ablation study on CAS inserted at different residual blocks of ResNet18 in Table 3. The results show that CAS works the best at the last block (i.e. Block 4), where the auxiliary classifier is as good as the final classification layer. The auxiliary classifier is indeed less accurate at the shallow blocks (e.g. Block 2), where it can cause inaccurate suppression and degraded robustness.\n\n---\n**Q4:** CAS could both improve natural acc and adversarial robustness, why CAS could achieve this both? and how is the overhead of CAS?\n\n**A4:** The accuracy-robustness trade-off refers to, for the same model, the increase of one metric along with the decrease of the other metric. This is also the case for CAS: natural accuracy drops from 94.56% (Appendix E) to 90.39% (Table 4) while robustness increases from 0% to 48.88% (Table 4).

When evaluated by FGSM and PGD, both of them are taken into account. We have also conducted the ablation study on attacking separate loss terms in Table 4 and 12, where CAS demonstrates a consistent improvement over the baseline defenses. \n\n---\n**Q3:** In Table 2, what does it mean to have CAS without channel suppression? Is it effectively just a CNN with predictions made from features in different layers?\n\n**A3:** The CAS without channel suppression means the CAS module is inserted, however, the channel suppressing operation (Eq 3) is not applied during either training or testing. In other words, the channels are not reweighted. In this case, the CAS is just a simple auxiliary classifier. \n\n---\n**Q4:** Do the authors have any intuitions on why having CAS module alone on Block 4 is better than having it on both Block 3 and 4 in general?\n\n**A4:** This is because low-level features cannot produce accurate class predictions, and the low-level channels are weakly correlated with the class. This will lead to less accurate channel importance estimations. When inserted at both Block 3 and Block 4, the inaccurate channel importance estimation will reduce the quality of the inputs to Block 4. Therefore, having the CAS module on Block 4 alone is better.\n\n---\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper175/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper175/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving Adversarial Robustness via Channel-wise Activation Suppressing", "authorids": ["~Yang_Bai1", "~Yuyuan_Zeng1", "~Yong_Jiang3", "~Shu-Tao_Xia1", "~Xingjun_Ma1", "~Yisen_Wang1"], "authors": ["Yang Bai", "Yuyuan Zeng", "Yong Jiang", "Shu-Tao Xia", "Xingjun Ma", "Yisen Wang"], "keywords": ["Adversarial robustness", "channel suppressing", "activation strategy."], "abstract": "The study of adversarial examples and their activations have attracted significant attention for secure and robust learning with deep neural networks (DNNs).

They focused on the magnitude and frequency of activations and found that state-of-the-art adversarial defense (adversarial training) only addressed the magnitude issue but the frequency distribution issue remains. This provided a novel perspective for us to understand why state-of-the-art adversarial training method works to a certain extent but not so good. Then, the authors proposed a Channel-wise Activation Suppressing (CAS) to address the frequency distribution to further improve the adversarial robustness. CAS is generic, effective, and can be easily incorporated into many existing defense methods. \n\nPros:\n1. The authors studied adversarial examples from a new perspective of channels in activations. Previous works focusing on activations usually assumed that each channel is of equal importance, while the authors focused on the relationship between channels. From two aspects of activation magnitude and frequency, the authors found two novel characteristics of adversarial examples: adversarial examples have higher activation magnitude and more uniformly activated channels compared to natural examples. The findings were convincingly evaluated on different neural network architectures and different training methods. This hints at a very interesting phenomenon.\n\n2. The proposed method is generic. The authors found that the activated channels are still uniform under adversarial training, that is, some redundant and low contributing channels are still activated. To suppress the redundantly activated channels, the authors proposed Channel-wise Activation Suppressing (CAS) training strategy. It dynamically learns and incorporates the channel importance (to the class prediction) into the training process. The motivation is very clear and the method is easy to follow. More importantly, CAS can be widely applied to strengthen existing adversarial training approaches since it suppresses those less important channels.\n\n3. Lots of experiments are provided to understand and evaluate the proposed methods. The experiments covered lots of aspects, including channel suppressing effect of CAS, representation learning, ablation studies, and extensive robustness evaluation on white-box and black-box attacks. The authors also tested the adaptive attacks, strongest auto-attack, and the optimization-based black-box attack, which definitely convinced me of the effectiveness of the proposed method. \n\nOverall, the paper hints at an interesting phenomenon and inspires an in-depth understanding of adversarial training. The proposed method is elegant and generic. The empirical evidence is solid and extensive. \n\nCons:\n1. How does the activation threshold effect Figure 2?\n2. In the testing phase, the predicted class of the auxiliary classifier is used for the channel importance. Is it vulnerable to attacks? if the predicted label is incorrect, how it will affect the final performance?\n3. How well the auxiliary classifier works. With the limited information from the output of GAP, it is likely that the classifier performs poorly, and thus results in bad channel importance weighting.\n4.

Our work provides a simplebut generic training strategy for robustifying the intermediate layer activations of DNNs.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "bai|improving_adversarial_robustness_via_channelwise_activation_suppressing", "one-sentence_summary": "Training with Channel-wise Activation Suppressing (CAS) can help imrove the robustness of adversarial training.", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/1ebed165f9fbe8c67dba2b731acc7df46fa574c8.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/199e4955d4d5c6f552177bff197e00df7b1a3432.pdf", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Spotlight", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nbai2021improving,\ntitle={Improving Adversarial Robustness via Channel-wise Activation Suppressing},\nauthor={Yang Bai and Yuyuan Zeng and Yong Jiang and Shu-Tao Xia and Xingjun Ma and Yisen Wang},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=zQTezqCCtNx}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
