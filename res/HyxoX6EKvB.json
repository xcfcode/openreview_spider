There was initially one reject, but the revisions convinced the reviewer to update their score to a weak accept.  Overall, the reviewers appreciated the idea of reflection-based binary word attribute transfer.   suggestions, the authors made small improvements to the writing, added missing citations, as well as additional results for another word embedding (GloVE) and another dataset (antonyms).  One of the main remaining weakness of the work, is still the small dataset.  Although somewhat alleviated by the inclusion of the antonym dataset, this is still a weakness of the paper.  \n\nThe AC agrees that the paper has an nice idea and is well presented.  However, the work is limited in scope and is likely to be of limited interest to the ICLR community and would be more appreciated in the NLP community.  The authors are encouraged to improve upon the work, and resubmit to an appropriate venue.  \n", "title": "Paper Decision"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ishibashi.yoichi.ir3@is.naist.jp", "sudoh@is.naist.jp", "koichiro@is.naist.jp", "s-nakamura@is.naist.jp"], "title": "Reflection-based Word Attribute Transfer", "authors": ["Yoichi Ishibashi", "Katsuhito Sudoh", "Koichiro Yoshino", "Satoshi Nakamura"], "pdf": "/pdf/215b8895577d85799fb2b48af4ca9db1fc5f5990.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a novel representation learning framework that obtains a vector with an inverted attribute in embedding space without explicit attribute knowledge of the given word.

There is a lot of discussion of\nelementary ideas such as reflection about an affine plain and involutions.

The notation in this equation is unfortunate as the parameter vector Theta does not appear in the loss expression and some guesswork is needed to realize that y_i is hat{t}_\\Theta(x_i).  The discussion of optimization seems strange --- why not just apply a standard optimizer to this loss function?  The experimental results are limited to three attributes one of which --- the capital/country attribute --- seems a relation not an attribute.\n\nBut the most serious problem with this paper is a lack of references to related work.

We address your comments and questions below.  \n\n1. \u201cI would like much more discussion/analysis of the parameterizations (and their parameters), or treatment of more binary-attribute linguistic analogy types (antonymy, scalar terms), or both! Another thing that could be added is comparisons across types of word vectors (word2vec alone is a bit narrow). Any of those things would have justified a strong accept.\u201d\nThank you for your suggestions. We conducted additional experiments (other embedding, other attributes and an analysis of mirror).  See below responses for details.\n\n2. \u201cAs I was reading, I was not at all convinced by the \u201cidealness\u201d of your transfer function in 4.1 (maybe change it from \u201cideal\u201d to \u201cidealized\u201d). \u201c\nWe changed \u201cideal\u201d to \u201c\u201cidealized\u201d.\n\n3. \u201cThis is, I think, why you brought up parameterization. But you miss the opportunity to clearly motivate why we need to parameterize! You should include more motivation and lay the linguistic facts out in a clearer way that incorporates examples like the one I gave, and preferably before S4.1.\u201c\nWe added such motivation and discussion in Section 4.1.\n\n4. \u201cThe total number of words you chose to use is pretty small, which you acknowledge.  I would\u2019ve loved to see a few more phenomena, perhaps antonymy, part-whole, morphological reinflection (e.g., a generalization of your sing-pl set, datasets exist for past-tense at least), etc.\u201c\nWe conducted additional experiments  using antonyms (Table 1) from the study by Nguyen et al.: Distinguishing Antonyms and Synonyms in a Pattern-based Neural Network (EACL2017). While the transfer accuracy by the proposed method was a bit lower than that by MLP, the stability of the proposed method was 100% and that of MLP was really poor (almost 0%).\n\n5. \u201cit would have been neat to compare word2vec to other types of vector embeddings, maybe contextualized? They are what everyone\u2019s using right now (this suggestion didn\u2019t factor heavily into my rating though). Also the framing in your introduction made me think this is where you were going (you started with discussing vectors, as opposed to just jumping in on binary word attribute transfer. I think the paper could just jump right in with binary word attribute transfer, and skip the basic vectors paragraph).\u201c\nWe conducted additional experiments using GloVe and obtained similar results (Table 3). The use of contextualized word embeddings is more difficult in data preparation and would be investigated as our future work.\n\n6. \u201cI would\u2019ve liked more discussion of your parameterized mirrors, since that was the neatest/prettiest part, in my opinion. (maybe I missed something, but how did you decide on how many z to use? or did every pair get its own?

It applies a single reflection-based mapping that relates the locations of two vectors in a Euclidean space by a hyperplane, and results in an identity mapping when it is applied twice. It's sort of like roundtrip-translation, but for word vector attributes. The paper also proposes a pretty smart idea: the mirror functions are parameterized to take advantage of the fact that inversions differ, even for the \"same\" word attributes. \n\nI am giving the paper a weak accept, because I think idea is really fun, and definitely has legs. I like the idea for this paper quite a bit, it really got me thinking, but I think it isn't quite structured how I would like. Unfortunately, as it is, it also feels a bit spare in terms of contributions. I would like much more discussion/analysis of the parameterizations (and their parameters), or treatment of more binary-attribute linguistic analogy types (antonymy, scalar terms), or both! Another thing that could be added is comparisons across types of word vectors (word2vec alone is a bit narrow). Any of those things would have justified a strong accept. \n\nSuggestions: \n- As I was reading, I was not at all convinced by the \"idealness\" of your transfer function in 4.1 (maybe change it from \"ideal\" to \"idealized\"). \"Ideal\" assumes that there will be pairs sharing a stable attribute. But, often \"gendered\" words don't come in pairs, and \"gender\" is far from a stable attribute. To be more specific, despite your Fig 3a: \"actress\" may be feminine, but \"actor\" is clearly neutral (anyone can be described as an \"actor\" but only women can be described as \"actress\" in most cases); thus \"actress\" is the gendered one. We can go ahead and pair \"actress\" with \"actor\"---they do share a morphological relationship after all---but \"actor\" isn't as obvious a masculine counterpart as \"king\" is for \"queen\". How would you square this with phi(queen)=king and phi(king)=queen, where the identity of counterparts is clearer? Do we ideally want the same invertible method here for both actor-actress and queen-king (I think I don't, hence the function is not \"ideal\"). I wouldn't be surprised if the same situation arises in other analogies. This is, I think, why you brought up parameterization. But you miss the opportunity to clearly motivate why we need to parameterize! You should include more motivation and lay the linguistic facts out in a clearer way that incorporates examples like the one I gave, and preferably before S4.1.\n-The total number of words you chose to use is pretty small, which you acknowledge. I would've loved to see a few more phenomena, perhaps antonymy, part-whole, morphological reinflection (e.g., a generalization of your sing-pl set, datasets exist for past-tense at least), etc. \n-it would have been neat to compare word2vec to other types of vector embeddings, maybe contextualized? They are what everyone's using right now (this suggestion didn't factor heavily into my rating though). Also the framing in your introduction made me think this is where you were going (you started with discussing vectors, as opposed to just jumping in on binary word attribute transfer. I think the paper could just jump right in with binary word attribute transfer, and skip the basic vectors paragraph).\n-I would've liked more discussion of your parameterized mirrors, since that was the neatest/prettiest part, in my opinion. (maybe I missed something, but how did you decide on how many z to use? or did every pair get its own? Do your zs for each attribute correlate at all? you could use something straightforward like CCA to check, would be neat.)\n\nSmall Notes/Musings:\n-on p.1 \"(PMI (citation...\" with nested parentheses is not easy to read, I prefer \"(PMI; citation)\".\n- It is fine to operate on the assumption that gender is binary for now, but you should acknowledge that binary gender is an assumption (and a socially problematic one), that isn't real.\n-in 5.5, I'm not impressed by \"When non-attribute word the was given, Ref(v the) became 'the' without knowledge that the has no gender attribute\", because \"the\" is the most frequent word in English, perhaps show that it works with rare, non-gendered words instead. Incidentally, does it know syntactic category? Because that might be a neat thing to check.\n-what do you think about trinary attributes (cold, warm, hot)? It would be a cool extension.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper462/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper462/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ishibashi.yoichi.ir3@is.naist.jp", "sudoh@is.naist.jp", "koichiro@is.naist.jp", "s-nakamura@is.naist.jp"], "title": "Reflection-based Word Attribute Transfer", "authors": ["Yoichi Ishibashi", "Katsuhito Sudoh", "Koichiro Yoshino", "Satoshi Nakamura"], "pdf": "/pdf/215b8895577d85799fb2b48af4ca9db1fc5f5990.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a novel representation learning framework that obtains a vector with an inverted attribute in embedding space without explicit attribute knowledge of the given word. ", "abstract": "We propose a word attribute transfer framework based on reflection to obtain a word vector with an inverted target attribute for a given word in a word embedding space. Word embeddings based on Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) represent such analogic relations as king - man + woman \\approx queen. These relations can be used for changing a word\u2019s attribute from king to queen by changing its gender. This attribute transfer can be performed by subtracting a difference vector man - woman from king when we have explicit knowledge of the gender of given word king. However, this knowledge cannot be developed for various words and attributes in practice. For transferring queen into king in this analogy-based manner, we need to know that queen denotes a female and add the difference vector to it. In this work, we transfer such binary attributes based on an assumption that such transfer mapping will become identity mapping when we apply it twice. We introduce a framework based on reflection mapping that satisfies this property; queen should be transferred back to king with the same mapping as the transfer from king to queen. Experimental results show that the proposed method can transfer the word attributes of the given words, and does not change the words that do not have the target attributes.", "code": "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hbRZNnEoEKo55hJGO9qgUJ9FU--5heYE", "keywords": ["embedding", "representation learning", "analogy", "geometry"], "paperhash": "ishibashi|reflectionbased_word_attribute_transfer", "original_pdf": "/attachment/3515069f591e87101ef43407c73686d75fae2ef6.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nishibashi2020reflectionbased,\ntitle={Reflection-based Word Attribute Transfer},\nauthor={Yoichi Ishibashi and Katsuhito Sudoh and Koichiro Yoshino and Satoshi Nakamura},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxoX6EKvB}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
