The basic idea of the proposed method is to simply concatenate the embeddings of two nodes (via activation separately) from both side of edges, which is straightforward and produces only marginal improvement over existing methods (the comparison of Figure 1 and Figure 3 would suggest this fact). The optimization algorithm is not novel either.\n- Lack of detailed description and analysis for the proposed model S. In Section 5.2, only brief descriptions are given for the proposed approach.\n- The selected baseline methods are too weak as competitors, some important relevant methods are also missing in the comparisons. For the graph embedding learning task, one of the state-of-the-art approach is conducting Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), and GCNs seem to be able to tackle this problem as well. Moreover, the target task of this paper is mathematically identical to the rating prediction problem (if we treat the weight matrix of the graph as the rating matrix, and consider the nodes as users, for example), which can be loved by a classic collaborative filtering solution such as matrix factorization.
