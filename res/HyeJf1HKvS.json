The first step is to learn node embeddings using a GNN to obtain soft node correspondences between two graphs. The second step is to iteratively refine them using the constraints of matching consensus in local neighborhoods between graphs. The overall refining process resembles the classic graph matching algorithm of graduated assignment (Gold & Rangarajan, 1996), but generalizes it using deep neural representation. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm performs well on real-world tasks of image matching and knowledge graph entity alignment.\n\nThe paper is interesting and has some good potential but lacks some important evaluations and analyses. My main concerns are as follows. \n\n1) The consensus in the second stage is crucial? \nAs the title shows, the main technical contribution lies in the second stage of consensus inducing. But, for the real tasks, in the experiments, the gain by the second stage is not significant or often negligible (L=0 vs. L=10 or 20  in Table 1,2,3). The results of the first stage (L=0) already give better results than all the baselines in many cases, so that most gains appear to come from the usage of GNNs for representation. This makes the major contribution of this work less significant.  I hope the authors justify this. And, I guess that's maybe because the consensus information may also be induced in the first stage by matching nodes with relational presentations learned using a GNN. To see this, the authors may run the second stage only without the first stage. \n\n2) Comparison to the graduated assignment (GA) process\nAs discussed in 3.3, the proposed neighborhood consensus can be viewed as a generalization of GA of Eq.6 with trainable neural modules. But, it's not actually shown what is the gain by this generalization. This needs to be shown experimentally by substituting the second stage by GA process.  \n\n3) Robustness to node addition or removal. \nAll the experiments look assuming only edges are varied. Is this algorithm robust to node addition or removal, occurring in many practical graph matching problems? This needs to be also discussed.   \n\n======================================\n\nThe rebuttal succeeds in addressing most of my concerns so that I upgrade my initial rating to weak accept. I hope all the points in the rebuttal are included in the final manuscript.

The overall framework can be viewed as a graph siamese network, where two set of points are passing through the same graph neural network, and then two new embeddings are generated. Using the two embedding the similarity between points can be computed and then the final matching can be generated. \n\nThe overall structure of this paper is similar to [1] and [2], the authors should discuss the difference of the proposed with these two papers, if it is possible, the authors may try to compare with these two methods in experiments. Currently, I think the main contribution of the paper should be the new message-passing scheme (in Sec. 3.2). However, from the current experiment, I can not see if the performance improvement is from the new message-passing scheme.\n\nIn fact, the message passing scheme is also related to the dual decomposition framework, which is previously used in the graph matching area. For example, in [3], a message-passing algorithm derived from dual decomposition is used to solve the graph matching problem. The authors may also consider add some discussion the difference between message-passing derived from dual decomposition and the message passing in the graph neural network.\n\n==================================== After Revision ==============================================\nIn the new experiment, the authors proved that the new message-passing scheme (i.e. the consensus stage) in Sec 3.2 can successfully improve the performance by refining original assignment.

Here, the authors propose a compositional message passing algorithm that maps point coordinates into a high-dimensional space. The final matching procedure is done by computing the pairwise inner product between point embeddings, proposing enhancements to the initial embedding stage. It does not apply a refinement stage for soft correspondences. Hence, we see improvements in the architecture of the first stage as orthogonal to our work.\n\nTo compare our approach, we replicated the experimental setup of [2]. We train our unmodified anisotropic keypoint architecture on the synthetic keypoint training setup from [2] and evaluate the final model on the Pascal PF dataset [4], using only point coordinates as input.\nOverall, our consensus architecture improves upon the state-of-the-art results of [2] on almost all categories while our $L=0$ baseline is weaker than the results reported in [2]. We report the final results below and will include them in the final version.\n\nHits@1 on the Pascal PF dataset:\n--------------------+---------+--------+----------+--------+-------+----------+--------+-------+-------+---------+--------+\nMethod            | mean | aero | bicycle | bird | boat | bottle | bus  | car   | cat   | chair  | cow  |\n--------------------+---------+--------+----------+--------+-------+----------+--------+-------+-------+---------+--------+\nDGFM [2]         | 88.5    | 76.1 |  89.8    | 93.4  | 96.4 |  96.2    | 97.1  | 94.6 | 82.8 |  89.3  | 96.7  |\n--------------------+---------+--------+----------+--------+-------+----------+--------+-------+-------+---------+--------+\n           $L=0$   | 86.7    | 64.6 |  86.9    | 76.6  | 88.5 |  96.0    | 98.4  | 91.4 | 89.6 |  93.4  | 77.2   |\nOurs  $L=10$ | 95.4    | 83.6 |  92.0    | 94.2  | 98.2 |  99.3    | 99.3  | 98.7 | 98.5 |  99.8  | 96.3   |\n           $L=20$ | 95.5    | 83.0 |  92.1    | 92.9  | 98.2 |  99.3    | 99.0  | 98.7 | 99.2 | 100.0 | 96.3   |\n--------------------+---------+--------+----------+--------+-------+----------+--------+-------+-------+---------+--------+\n\n--------------------+---------+---------+--------+---------+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+---------+--------+--------+\nMethod            | mean | table | dog  | horse | m-bike | person | plant | sheep | sofa  | train  |  tv    |\n--------------------+---------+---------+--------+---------+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+---------+--------+--------+\nDGFM [2]         | 88.5    | 89.7   | 79.5  | 82.6   |  83.5     |  72.8      | 76.7   | 77.1    |  97.3  | 98.2  | 99.5  |\n--------------------+---------+---------+--------+---------+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+---------+--------+--------+\n           $L=0$   | 86.7    | 97.9   | 85.7  | 73.3   |  76.8     |  69.4      |  97.4   | 76.4   |  85.1  |  91.7  | 97.4  |\nOurs  $L=10$ | 95.4    | 100.0 | 98.5  | 86.8   |  87.0     |  87.8      | 100.0  | 79.4   |  99.6  | 100.0 | 98.9 |\n           $L=20$ | 95.5    | 99.5   | 98.9  | 86.8   |  86.4     |  89.0      | 100.0  | 76.5   | 100.0 | 100.0 | 99.3 |\n--------------------+---------+---------+--------+---------+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+---------+--------+--------+\n\nIn addition, it shows that our method works also well even when not taking any visual information into account.

We agree that the message passing algorithms presented in [3] shares some similarities with our message passing architecture on an abstract level. However, the dual ascent algorithms also known as \"message passing\" used here solves the graph matching problem by using MAP-inference, linear assignment problems and (several small) quadratic assignment problems. Therefore, in this case it is difficult to establish such a clear mathematical relation to our method as we were able to show for the GA method. We will add a discussion of [3] to the related work section on graph matching approaches.\n\n[2] Zhang and Lee: Deep Graphical Feature Learning for the Feature Matching Problem (ICCV'19)\n[3] Swoboda et al.: A Study of Lagrangean Decompositions and Dual Ascent Solvers for Graph Matching (CVPR'17)\n[4] Ham et al.: Proposal Flow (CVPR'16)"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1565/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1565/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Graph Matching Consensus", "authors": ["Matthias Fey", "Jan E.

We are working on incorporating your feedback in a new revision of our paper. We would like to provide more explanations to address your concerns.\n\nMain Contribution\n================\nWe emphasize that the main contribution of our work lies indeed in the second stage of our architecture, i.e., refining initial soft correspondences using a trainable message passing scheme that reaches for neighborhood consensus. Our approach allows us to not only distribute local information, but to also distribute global information in the form of node indicator functions/node colorings using purely local operators. The distribution of global information is then used to resolve ambiguities/false matchings made in the first stage of our architecture. In addition, we proposed optimizations to make the consensus stage scale to large real-world instances.\n\nWe agree that obtaining initial soft correspondences via similarity scores of node embeddings is not a novel contribution and shouldn't be viewed as one. We will make this more clear in a revised version. We performed additional experiments to emphasize the usefulness of our consensus stage (see below).\n\nImpact of the Consensus Stage\n===========================\nWe argue that our consensus stage has a huge impact on the resulting performance of our model. For example, on the WILLOW-ObjectClass dataset, it at least reduces the error of the initial model ($L=0$) by half across all categories. On the DBP15K dataset, it consistently improves the model's performance by 4 percentage points on average which we claim to be highly significant.\n\nWe nonetheless agree with Reviewer #1 that those improvements should be more significant when using weaker baselines. To verify this, we conducted additional experiments as suggested where we replaced the first stage GNN module with a weaker MLP. The results are shown below which we will include in the final manuscript.\n\nHits@1 on the WILLOW-ObjectClass dataset:\n----------------------------+------------------+-----------------+------------------+------------------+\n$\\Psi_{\\theta_1}$ = MLP                  |  Motorbike   |        Car        |        Duck      |   Winebottle  |\n----------------------------+------------------+-----------------+------------------+------------------+\n                      $L=0$    | 56.85 \u00b1 2.65 | 73.44 \u00b1 2.65 | 71.93 \u00b1 2.10 | 86.10 \u00b1 1.25 |\n----------------------------+------------------+-----------------+------------------+------------------+\nisotropic      $L=10$  | 80.34 \u00b1 2.34 | 81.31 \u00b1 2.48 | 81.16 \u00b1 2.55 | 93.53 \u00b1 1.38 |\nisotropic      $L=20$  | 82.24 \u00b1 3.06 | 82.49 \u00b1 3.70 | 81.84 \u00b1 2.92 | 95.14 \u00b1 1.58 |\n----------------------------+------------------+-----------------+------------------+------------------+\nanisotropic  $L=10$  | 87.15 \u00b1 3.27 | 91.56 \u00b1 2.92 | 88.36 \u00b1 2.55 | 96.57 \u00b1 0.83 |\nanisotropic  $L=20$  | 94.16 \u00b1 3.03 | 94.23 \u00b1 2.14 | 90.03 \u00b1 2.21 | 97.24 \u00b1 0.84 |\n----------------------------+------------------+-----------------+------------------+------------------+\n\nIt can be seen that we can still obtain SOTA results even when starting from a weak initial baseline. Here, the consensus stage improves the initial matchings significantly, with nearly up to 40 percentage points improvements on the Motorbike class. However, it is worth noting that good initial matchings do help the consensus stage to improve its performance further, which stresses the importance of our two-stage approach. Furthermore, starting from weak initial matchings takes significantly more refinement steps to converge (as can be seen by the difference between $L=10$ and $L=20$).\n\nIt should be noted that the first stage cannot infer any information about consensus. In order to check for consensus, an initial matching is needed that can be tested. The first stage siamese network has no information flow between both heads until the feature matching. The second stage can rerank those hypotheses based on additional information: matching agreement in neighborhoods. It can not be applied without an initial ranking of correspondences."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1565/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1565/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Graph Matching Consensus", "authors": ["Matthias Fey", "Jan E.

We agree that this work tackles the feature matching procedure in a similar fashion as we do in our initial feature matching procedure based on inner product similarity scores. Additionally, this work leverages a Transformer module to let point clouds know about each other before feature matching takes place.\n\nOur work differs in that we introduce a consensus stage to resolve ambiguities in matchings after the initial matching procedure based on neighborhood consensus. Hence, our method could be used to improve the results of [1] further. In order to resolve ambiguities, [1] can only rely on the least squares optimization, inherentely utilizing the rigid embedding of the point cloud in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which does not exist for general graphs and is not required for our approach. In addition, our approach is highly scalable due to only operating an local neighborhoods, while the Transformer module operates on the whole point cloud in a global fashion.\n\nDue to the different task and difference in assumptions, we do refrain from an in-depth experimental comparison. We will nonetheless discuss the similarities/differences to this work further in our related work.\n\n[1] Wang and Solomon: Deep Closest Point: Learning Representations for Point Cloud Registration (ICCV'19)"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1565/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1565/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Graph Matching Consensus", "authors": ["Matthias Fey", "Jan E.

This is a (1) bold (2) capital (3) Greek letter with a (4) subscript that is (5) greek with a (6) subscript that is (7) numeric.  I understand that each of these levels of distinction has a purpose and a meaning, but it is also arguably a much richer designation that is necessary.
