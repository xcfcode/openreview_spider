We divide the parameters into blocks, for example in a linear threshold unit the bias term is in a bias term block while the input weights are in an input weight block.  We then average the square norm of the gradients over each block and use the same adaptation based on this average square norm for all parameters in the block.  theoretical and experimental results are given.\n\nThe idea of assigning different learning rates to different types of parameters is old.  Extending this idea to blockwise adaptation is natural and intuitively I would expect this to be an improvement on Adam.  However, I did not find this paper very compelling.  First, I believe that the theoretical results are a straightforward adaptation of know methods.  Second, and more significantly, comparing optimizers empirically is very tricky and I am not convinced that the experiments described here are convincing.  In particular the performance of optimizers is very sensitive to the tuning of hyper-parameters.  I would need to be convinced that the hyper-parameter tuning is sufficient.  Grid search is very inefficient compared to random or quasi-random methods.  Adam has four hyper-parameters and gird search over four parameters is very difficult.  For vision applications of Adam joint tuning of the learning rate and the epsilon parameter is critical --- these parameters are coupled.  It seems extremely likely to me that the move to blockwise adaptation has a profound effect on the optimal value of epsilon.  A thorough investigation of epsilon tuning is needed to demonstrate the value of blockwise adaptation in vision applications.\n\nPostscript:\n\nI still feel that the theoretical analysis provides little to no evidence of in-practice value of the method.  In general I find that theorems guaranteeing getting stuck on a flat plateau to be not very exciting.  What about the exploration goal of local search or mcmc?  In the absence of meaningful theory, the empirical results are what matter.\n\nI have read the response and am not convinced by the comments on optimizing epsilon.

The authors also propose a momentum version of BAG called BAGM. Convergence rate results are proved for the algorithm, and some uniform stability results show situations where BAG would generalize better than previous adaptive gradient methods.\n\nOverall I found the paper interesting, although I found the paper very dense and hard to read. The paper would be much easier to read if an effort was made to present the theoretical results in slightly simplified forms. In addition to this, I have a couple more concerns about the paper, which I list below:\n\n1. I am a bit unsure about the what the uniform stability results add to the paper. \na) While Proposition 1 is interesting, is it relevant for the BAG algorithm since it considers a layer-wise training process. \nb) Proposition 2 is also a bit confusion to me. How does generalization get worse as the number of blocks approaches the number of parameters (i.e., gets closer to AdaGrad)?\nc) Proposition 4 looks interesting, but hard to interpret the way it is presented now.\n\n2. Is the better generalization performance observed for BAGM (as well as Adam) simply due to the larger epsilon value used in the experiments? Would such an epsilon value simply turn off the adaptivity as the iterates gets closer to the minimizer (when the gradients are small relative to epsilon), and effectively do SGD? How does performance vary with epsilon?\n\n==================================\n\nEdit after rebuttal:\nI thank the authors for their response.

This motivates us to further exploit the optimization (Corollary 2) and generalization (Proposition 4) of blockwise adaptivity in end-to-end training. \n\n\"Proposition 2 is also a bit confusion to me. How does generalization get worse as the number of blocks approaches the number of parameters (i.e., gets closer to AdaGrad)?\"\n\n- Proposition 2 does not show that generalization gets worse as the number of block gets larger. What it shows is that BAG finds the minimum $\\ell_2$-norm solution in each subspace induced by the group structure when each data sub-matrix has full row rank. Wilson et al., 2017 show that coordinate-wise adaptive methods converge to solutions with low $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm, and such solutions can generalize arbitrarily poorly.\n\n\"Proposition 4 looks interesting, but hard to interpret the way it is presented now.\"\n\n- We will make it more precise in the final version. \n\n\"Is the better generalization performance observed for BAGM (as well as Adam) simply due to the larger epsilon value used in the experiments? Would such an epsilon value simply turn off the adaptivity as the iterates gets closer to the minimizer (when the gradients are small relative to epsilon), and effectively do SGD? How does performance vary with epsilon?\"\n\n- In our experiments, we use $\\epsilon=10^{-3}$, which is suggested in (Zaheer et al., 2018) for coordinate-wise adaptive methods. Zaheer et al., 2018 show how the generalization varies between $\\epsilon=10^{-3}$ and $\\epsilon=10^{-8}$. \n- larger epsilon value indeed improves the generalization for adaptive methods, which has been empirically verified in (Zaheer et al., 2018) and is theoretically demonstrated in Proposition 4. We agree that it is possible that epsilon can dominate the denominator when gradients are relatively small. However, our experiments also show that blockwise adaptivity can further improve upon Adam and achieve better generalization.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1290/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1290/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Blockwise Adaptivity:  Faster Training and Better Generalization in Deep Learning", "authors": ["Shuai Zheng", "James T.

We will revise it in the final version.\n\n\"Some choices might help, some might hurt based on the unknown structure of the data. This is barely touched upon in section 5.1. as it is noted that the more sever the mismatch the worse the results. \"\n\n- The experiments on Section 5.1 serves to verify Corollary 1. Indeed, for linear model, it is difficult to construct proper blocks without prior knowledge. However, due to the natural layer-wise structure of deep learning models, we have some intuition on which parameters are likely to have similar gradients in expectation (this is because the theories suggest to group as many gradients with similar magnitudes in expectation as possible). For instance, for image classification, gradients in each parameter vector/matrix/tensor (i.e., B.1) are likely to have similar gradient upper bound in expectation. For language modeling task, as word frequency varies a lot, we expect that gradients in each word embedding (i.e., B.2) are likely to have similar gradients. Our experiments also validate such hypotheses as B.1 and B.2 achieve the best performance for image classification and language modeling, respectively. \n\n\"The claimed superiority of block-wise adaptivity in the theory relies heavily on an assumption relying on tightness and closeness of  upper bounds on gradient magnitude/gradient second moment in each block...\"\n\n- When we make Assumptions 2, 4$\\&$8, constants $D_b$, $\\sigma_b$ and $G_b$ are already the unknown \"\\textit{smallest}\" (tight) constants. Given that constants $D_b$, $\\sigma_b$ and $G_b$ are the smallest ones, the corresponding inequalities $D_b^2 \\leq \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{G}_b}D_i^2$ and $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\max_b\\max_{i\\in\\tilde{\\mathcal{G}}_b} G_{i}^2 + \\epsilon^2}{\\max_b G_b^2 + \\epsilon^2}} \\geq 1$ hold. \n- We add extra experiment to estimate$\\sqrt{\\frac{\\bar{v}_{T,d} + \\epsilon^2}{\\bar{v}_{T,\n\\tilde{B}} + \\epsilon^2}}$and $\\min(r_1, r_2, r_3)$ for B.2, B.3 and B.4. The numbers are shown in Appendix B of the revision. \n\n\"assess performance against previously proposed layer wise stepwise approaches mentioned in the introduction. \"\n\n- As requested, we add comparison to LARS (You et al., 2017), the results on CIFAR-10 and Wikitext-2 are: LARS:  $6.60 \\pm 0.17$ on ResNet56, $6.15 \\pm 0.21$ on ResNet110, and $65.38 \\pm  0.08$ on AWD-LSTM. LARS improves over NAG and Adam. However, it is still worse than BAGM-B.1 and BAGM-B.4 on CIFAR-10, and is worse than BAGM-B.2 on training AWD-LSTM.  For the experiment on ImageNet, we have tried a number of hyper-parameters, but none of them allow LARS to converge.\n\n\"These related approaches should also be discussed more deeply and contrasted against qualitatively.\"\n\n- These approaches are heuristic and do not have convergence analysis. Algorithmically, these layer-wise methods consider incorporating gradient normalization into the learning rate, while our method averages the estimate of the second moments of each block, which is more related to coordinate-wise adaptive methods.\n\n\"The empirical results are not substantially superior... \"\n\n- Improvements on these competitive datasets are usually not very substantial. Here, we compare our improvements with those of other papers (that are not addressing the same problem as ours) on the same dataset.  For example, on ImageNet, BAGM-B.1 has 0.15% better accuracy than NAG; while in Table 8, \"Wide residual networks\",  changing from ResNet152 to WRN-50-2-bottleneck achieves a similar 0.26% improvement. On language modeling, BAGM-B.2 reduces perplexity by 0.46 compared to NAG; while in Table 2, (Merity et al., 2017), changing from a 2-layer skip connection LSTM to AWD-LSTM only improves perplexity by 0.1. On the other hand, the test error of BAGM-B.1 on ResNet56 is lower than those of NAG and Adam on ResNet110. \n- From Tables 1,2&3, it can be seen that standard deviation of all methods are already very small relative to the error rate (%).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1290/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1290/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Blockwise Adaptivity:  Faster Training and Better Generalization in Deep Learning", "authors": ["Shuai Zheng", "James T.
