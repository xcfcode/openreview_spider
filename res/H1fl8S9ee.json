We would like to give answers to the reviewer's questions:\n\n1) In section 2.2, it should be explained how the random z_n input is used by the neural network: is it just concatenated \nto the other inputs and used as-is, or is there a special treatment?\n\nYes, the random input z_n is an additional input  variable of  dimension 1, concatenated to the other inputs. \nIn contrast to  the other inputs  however,  we optimize two  free parameters (mu_z_n,\\sigma_z_n) for each z_1,\\cdots,z_N \nduring training: \n\nWe assume there exists a latent variable $z$ with unknown realizations  $z_1,\\cdots,z_N$ for the state transitions \n\\{(x_1,y_1),\\cdots,(x_N,y_N)\\}$. Our models tries to infer these realizations by learning a  variational distribution\n\\{(\\mu_z_1,\\sigma_z_1),\\cdots,(\\mu_z_N,\\sigma_z_N)\\}.  \n\n\n2) Moreover, much case is made for the need to have stochastic inputs, but only a scalar input seems to be provided throughout. \nIs this enough? How computationally difficult would providing stochastic inputs of higher dimensionality be?\n\nA central motivation for the stochastic inputs is so that the Bayesian Model has an explicit place where model uncertainty is \n(in the uncertainty over the W) and an explicit place where noise uncertainty is (the transformation of the input noise z sampled\nfrom the prior). These two components give principled Bayesian inference over stochastic functions.\n\nHigher dimensional stochastic input noise can be used without any restriction, note however, that by default a BNN will blend \ntogether all input sources x and z in each layer. Thus, while the stochastic input  was just 1-dimensional at the input layer, \na transformation to a  high-dimensional and complex random variable will occur as it propagates through the network.\nIn this sense, we do not believe that using only 1-dimensional input noise is a limitation in our method.\n\n3) How important is the normality assumption in z_n? How is the variance \\gamma established?\n\nThe normality assumption in z_n is not important at all. We could have as well used any other sampling distribution.\n Any arbitrary distribution could be obtained by transforming Gaussian samples through non-linearities, e.g. by \napplying the Gaussian cdf and then the inverse cdf of any desired distribution. As the random samples of z are propagated\nthrough the neural network the could be transformed to have the same effect as if they had been sampled from \nany other arbitrary distribution.\n\nWe define the prior over  the latent variable z to be a Gaussian with \\mu_z_n=0, \\sigma_z_n = \\gamma = \\sqrt(d) \nwhere d is the dimensionality of x.  This is an attempt to keep the effect of z  on the network activation independent\nof the input dimensionality (compare the Wet-Chicken benchmark with only 4 inputs to the industrial benchmark with around\n50 input dimensions). By doing this, the effect of the input noise is not vanishing in high dimensional problems. \nIn our experiments, the results obtained are not very sensitive to the particular choice of \\gamma that we make.\n \n4) It is mentioned that the hidden layers of the neural network are made of rectifiers, but no further utilization of this\nfact is made in the paper. Is this assumption somehow important in the optimization of the alpha-divergence \n(beyond what we know about rectifiers to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem) ?\n\nThe choice for the activation function is unrelated to alpha-divergence minimization.  We choose rectifiers \nbecause these are standardly used in literature. As with neural networks any differentiable activation  function can be used.\n \n5) Equation (3), denominator \\mathbf{y} should be \\mathbf{Y} ?\n\nThis is correct. Thanks for pointing this out!\n\n6) Section 2.3: it would be helpful to have an overview or discussion of the computational complexity of training BNNs, \nto understand whether and when they can practicably be used.\n\nThanks for the feedback. We would like to refer the reviewer to our answer given to question 3 to  AnonReviewer2. \nShort answer: In theano, the computational graph of the BNNs is similar to that of an ensemble of standard deterministic \nneural networks (with ensemble size equal to the number of samples from the posterior approximating that are used to \napproximate the expectations in the objective function for black-box alpha)\n\n7) Between eq (12) and (13), a citation to the statement of the time embedding theorem would be helpful, \nas well as an indication of how the embedding dimension should be chosen.\n\nThanks for the feedback. A citation will be added to the final version.\n\n8) Figure 1: the subplots should have the letters by which they are referenced in the text on p. 7.\n\nThanks for the feedback. We will include this in the final version.  \n\n9) In section 4.2.1, it is not clear if the gas turbine data is publicly available, and if so where.\nIn addition more details should be provided, such as the dimensionality of the variables E_t, N_t and A_t.\n\nThe gas turbine data unfortunately is not publicly available at this point. Similar experiments can be found in [1]. \nFor the final version we will be more specific about the dimensionalities of these variables.  \n\n10) Perhaps the comparisons with Gaussian processes should include variants that support stochastic inputs, \nsuch as Girard et al. (2003), to provide some of the same modelling capabilities as what\u2019s made use of here. \nAt least, this strand of work should be mentioned in Section 5.\n\nThanks for the reference, we will be include it in the final  version. We chose the GP to resemble the \nPILCO approach[2], it is to our knowledge the most direct competitor to the method we propose. \n\nWe agree that comparing to GPs with stochastic inputs would be interesting. Extending PILCO to learn a  \nvariational distribution on z_1,\\cdots,z_N is not trivial, to our knowledge such an  architecture has \nnever been used in the context of model-based RL or policy search. It  may be of special interest for a \nseparate, independent contribution. \n\n[1] Schaefer, Anton Maximilian, et al. \"A neural reinforcement learning approach to gas turbine control.\" \n2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks.

BNN training is carried out using \\alpha-divergence minimization, the specific form of which was introduced in previous work by the authors. Validation and comparison of the approach is undertaken on a simulated domain, as well as real-world scenarios. \n\nThe paper is tightly written, and easy to follow. Its approach to fitting Bayesian neural networks with \\alpha divergence is interesting and appears novel in this context. The resulting application to model-based control appears to have significant practical impact, particularly in light of the explainability that a system model can bring to specific decisions made by the policy. As such, I think that the paper brings a valuable contribution to the literature.\n\nThat said, I have a few questions and suggestions:\n\n1) In section 2.2, it should be explained how the random z_n input is used by the neural network: is it just concatenated to the other inputs and used as-is, or is there a special treatment?\n\n2) Moreover, much case is made for the need to have stochastic inputs, but only a scalar input seems to be provided throughout. Is this enough? How computationally difficult would providing stochastic inputs of higher dimensionality be?\n\n3) How important is the normality assumption in z_n? How is the variance \\gamma established?\n\n4) It is mentioned that the hidden layers of the neural network are made of rectifiers, but no further utilization of this fact is made in the paper. Is this assumption somehow important in the optimization of the alpha-divergence (beyond what we know about rectifiers to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem) ?\n\n5) Equation (3), denominator \\mathbf{y} should be \\mathbf{Y} ?\n\n6) Section 2.3: it would be helpful to have an overview or discussion of the computational complexity of training BNNs, to understand whether and when they can practicably be used.\n\n7) Between eq (12) and (13), a citation to the statement of the time embedding theorem would be helpful, as well as an indication of how the embedding dimension should be chosen.\n\n8) Figure 1: the subplots should have the letters by which they are referenced in the text on p. 7.\n\n9) In section 4.2.1, it is not clear if the gas turbine data is publicly available, and if so where. In addition more details should be provided, such as the dimensionality of the variables E_t, N_t and A_t.\n\n10) Perhaps the comparisons with Gaussian processes should include variants that support stochastic inputs, such as Girard et al. (2003), to provide some of the same modelling capabilities as what\u2019s made use of here. At least, this strand of work should be mentioned in Section 5.\n\n\nReferences:\n\nGirard, A., Rasmussen, C. E., Qui\u00f1onero Candela, J., & Murray Smith, R. (2003).

We would like to give answers to the reviewer's questions:\n\n1. Could you comment on applicability of stochastic gradient MCMC (SGLD / SGHMC) for your setup?\n\nSGLD / SGHMC are alternative methods for approximate inference in the proposed neural networks with stochastic inputs. \nInstead of learning a parametric Gaussian approximation q(w) to the posterior, we could have as well used such methods \nto  produce a collection of samples, whose empirical distribution would approximate the exact posterior.  For training\nthe policy we would simply exchange line 4 of algorithm 1 to draw samples from the empirical distribution. \nWe chose to use deterministic methods because of 1) their simplicity, 2) lower computational cost and 3) ability to \ncompactly represent and to easily update the posterior approximation.\nNote also that while SGLD / SGHMC have already been applied to Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) for learning a posterior \non the weights, these methods have never been applied to BNNs with random inputs, where one is also required to learn \na posterior over the random inputs that were used to generate the training data.\nThere are different trade-offs to consider when choosing whether to use sampling based methods (SGLD / SGHMC) or\ndeterministic approximation methods based on optimization (alpha-divergence minimization, variational Bayes) \nfor approximate inference:\n1 - Sampling-based methods are asymptotically unbiased and can therefore produce more accurate posterior approximations than \n    deterministic approaches providing enough computation time is available. Deterministic methods are by contrast biased.\n2 - Sampling-based methods have higher computational cost. Requiring a significantly higher number of passes through the \n    data than deterministic approaches.\n3 - Sampling-based method usually include many hyper-parameters that are highly data and model dependent and that require tuning. \n    By contrast, deterministic approaches often include less hyper-parameters (in our case, we only tune the learning rate).\n4 - It is difficult to determine when a sampling-based method has converged and is drawing samples from the correct stationary \n    distribution. By contrast it is easy to determine when a deterministic approach has converged. For example, when \n    the objective function that is being optimized does not improve anymore beyond a specific threshold.\n5 - In deterministic methods the posterior approximation is compactly represented by a collection of parameters. These parameters \n    can be easily updated when new data is available. Updating the samples generated by sampling-based methods is by \n    contrast very challenging.\n\n2.  \"Section 4.2.1: why can't you use the original data? in what sense is it fair to simulate data using another neural network? can you evaluate PSO-P on this problem?\"\n\nWe use original data recorded from a gas turbine to train the world model. We do this because  we need to transform the\nrecordings into a model that an agent can interact with (We cannot compare the different methods on the real turbine directly, \nfor obvious safety concerns). To that end we use a neural network as an approximator for the turbine dynamics and sample \ndata from it in a partial observable scenario.  This process is repeated in each of the 5 repetitions of the \nexperiment.\nRegarding fairness:  The artificial batch only has about 10% of original features visible. Because of this partial \nobservability, we expect that there should be not much advantage from the fact that the MLP and BNNs share the same \nbase function class with the world model as compared to the GPs. Indeed, the results in table 1 show that the policies \nof the  BNNs and the GP outperform the MLP although the MLP and the world model do their stochastic transition in a \nsimilar fashion. We mentioned the \u2018fairness\u2019 aspect here because we saw the MLP as a simple baseline and used \nthis class as the lowest common denominator--- it would be arguably more unfair had we used a BNN or GP as function\nclass for the world model.\nYes, we will include PSO-P results in the final version. We excluded it in the current version because it is computationally \ndemanding.\n\n 3. \"Can you comment on the computational complexity of the different approaches?\"\n\nWe would like to comment on the complexity of training the model (usually faster) and training the policy\nseparately (usually much slower):\nAll models were trained using theano and a single GPU. Training  the standard neural network is the fastest (SGD + the \nearly stopping process that slows things a bit down). The training time for this method was between 5 - 20 minutes, \ndepending on data set size and dimensionality of the benchmark.\nIn theano, the computational graph of the BNNs is similar to that of an ensemble of standard neural networks. The training time\nfor the BNNs varied between 30 minutes to 5 hours depending on data size and dimensionality of benchmark.\nThe sparse Gaussian Process was optimized using an expectation propagation algorithm and after training, it was approximated\nwith a Bayesian linear model with fixed basis functions whose weights are initialized randomly (see Appendix B). \nWe choose the inducing points in the GPs and the number of training epochs for these models so that the resulting \ntraining time was comparable to that of the BNNs.\nFor policy training we used a single CPU. All methods are of similar complexity as they are all trained using Algorithm 1.\nDepending on the horizon, data set size and network topology, training took between 20 minutes  (Wet-Chicken,T=5),\n3-4 hours  (Turbine, T=20) and 14-16  hours (industrial benchmark, T=75).\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Learning and Policy Search in Stochastic Dynamical Systems with Bayesian Neural Networks", "abstract": "We present an algorithm for policy search in stochastic dynamical systems using\nmodel-based reinforcement learning.

Thanks for pointing this out. We will extend the related work section for\nthe final version. \n\n2. We agree: the point of this paper is not that we can now solve RL problems\nthat were impossible to solve before. We have two main contributions:\n\na) In the model-based framework we propose a Bayesian model architecture (BNN\nwith stochastic inputs trained with \\alpha-divergences) that allows us to\ndescribe systems with complex stochastic transitions.\n\nYes, \"we try to improve within the class of Bayesian methods\" but also more\ngenerally within the class of model-based RL methods.Our motivation was to come up with a model that is flexible & scalable like a\nNN, is fully Bayesian like a Gaussian Process/BNN and can model complex\nstochastic patterns (e.g bi-modality, heteroskedasticity, etc.). \n\nb) An algorithm that trains a parameterized policy on a batch of data using a\nBNN. Algorithm 1 in the paper shows the interplay between model and policy and\ndescribes the sampling process. The roll-outs give particle-like trajectories\nfrom which we obtain gradient information. We consider this to be interesting\nand novel, and for industry setting the applicability to 'batch settings' is an\nimportant criteria.\n\nWe would also like to point out that in our experience model-free approaches\nhave issues with convergence and stability in these batch settings.  \nOften times policy performance is unstable and at some point in training starts to detoriate. A good\nmodel is very useful here for evaluation. \n\n3. We want to make two clarifications first:\n\n3.1 We assume there exists a latent variable $z$ with unknown realizatons  $z_1,\\cdots,z_N$  \nfor the state transitions \\{(x_1,y_1),\\cdots,(x_N,y_N)\\}$. Our models tries to infer these realizations by learning a \nvariatonal distribution \\{(\\mu_z_1,\\sigma_z_1),\\cdots,(\\mu_z_N,\\sigma_z_N)\\}.   This  inference is possible\nbecause we see both x and y. \nWhen we use the model after training to make predictions,  we will sample z from the prior N(0,\\gamma), because  we only have a prior belief over what z might be (since y is unknown).\n\n3.2  $\\epsilon_1,\\cdots,\\epsilon_d$ are the variances of the gaussian output noise with zero mean. We have 1 parameter per output\ndimension. In regression one normally assumes the data is corrupted by zero-mean gaussian noise:\n\ny = f(x,W_true) + N(0,\\epsilon) \n\nOur model is:\n\ny = f(x,W_true,z) + N(0,\\epsilon)\n\nIn this framework sampling W and z will give a  mixture of a diagonal\nd-dimensional Gaussians (with each mixture component having the same variance).\n\nIf we would not assume  gaussian output noise we instead would have a mixture of delta\ndistributions. This would make optimization difficult as  the gradients \nfor the energy function would be either infinitely large or zero. \n\n4. We are a bit unsure what is meant with this question, so we give two\nrelated answers:\n\na) We are doing batch RL, the result of our optimization is a policy that maps\nfrom a state to an action; during optimization no interaction with the 'target\nsystem' is required, all inference is done on the batch and a given reward\nfunction. So the property that the target system can be reset to different\nstates is not relevant for the training process.\n\nb) When we train our policy we initialize algorithm 1 to a starting state s_0\nand simulate for $T$ steps the interaction between model, policy and reward function. When the policy is deployed it usually interacts\nconstantly with the target system. \n\nIf the horizon $T$  that we chose is too short, the policy may behave\nsuboptimal in deployment. We are aware of this; but it is fundamental to a lot\nof model-based RL approaches, such like the 'receding horizon' approach in\nmodel predictive control. (or the discount factor and number of update steps in the updates \nto the Q-function)\n\nSo 'no', at test/deployment time we don't assume the system is repeatedly\ninitialized to a particular state, we usually have continuous autonomous\ninteraction. We are aware that this requires the horizon $T$ to be chosen to be\nlong enough."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Learning and Policy Search in Stochastic Dynamical Systems with Bayesian Neural Networks", "abstract": "We present an algorithm for policy search in stochastic dynamical systems using\nmodel-based reinforcement learning.
