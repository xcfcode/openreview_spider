There are several repetitions and disordered lists (same numbers used multiple times or mixing names and numbers for the items) which distract the reader. As a side note, it would be better to avoid mentioning dataset names without their description and definition ('aPY' appears out of the blue in the introduction). \n\nA1: Thanks for your advice. We have revised some of these flaws.\n\nQ2: The experiments extend over different datasets and the ablation study is valuable. However to understand how the proposed method advances over the current state of the art it is important to consider and discuss the most recent publications on OSL and G-ZSL. See for instance\n[1] Open Set Learning with Counterfactual Images, ECCV 2018\n[2] Feature Generating Networks for Zero-Shot Learning, CVPR 2018\n\nA2: We have supplemented the comparison with [2] and other new methods. We even add an implement for [2] to improve it. Although the task of [1] seems similar to ours, the purposes are not the same. For our approach and W-SVM, we address the build a boundary in REAL manifolds to detect outliers. However, for OpenMax and [1], they intend to resist attacks from artificial samples. So you can see that the result of OpenMax (OSDN) in our experiment is not very good. Meanwhile, [1] did not release their codes or detailed parameter setting, we are unable to reproduce it in a short period of time."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper218/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper218/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper218/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Separate Domains in Generalized Zero-Shot and Open Set Learning: a probabilistic perspective", "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of domain division which aims to segment instances drawn from different probabilistic distributions.

The abstract starts right off with the awkward \"This paper studies the problem of domain division problem...\" The manuscript needs more careful revision for clarity.\n\nA1: Thank you for your advice, we have proofread the paper and fixed such errors.\n\nQ2: Related to the previous point, there are several elements of the technical exposition that are lacking in clarity. For example, it is unclear what eq. 9 is defining exactly. It seems to be the final decision rule, but it is not clear how seen, unseen, and uncertain samples are determined. Algorithm 1 is clear, but there is never a clear, complete definition of the end-to-end decision pipeline given. I feel like it would be difficult to reproduce the results of this article without significant trial-and-error.\n\nA2: Thanks. Based on your comment, we included detailed descriptions for both Alg.1 and Eq (9).  Eq.9 describes how to predict the label of x_i for the seen, unseen, and uncertain domain, which are defined in Section 4.1 and 4.2.\nRegarding the reproduction of the results, we will release the codes if the paper is accepted.\n\nQ3: The authors seem to have relied on the Xian et al. paper to extract data for their comparative evaluation on G-ZSL.

Actually, since we reduce the candidate set of prediction significantly, the difficulty of G-ZSL reduced a lot.

Indeed a method able to separate samples between known and unknown domains in these settings would clearly indicate the direction for their solution. The idea proposed here consists in starting from the extreme value theory and then using bootstrapping to model the confidence score for a sample of belonging or not to a certain class. Through a probabilistic evaluation (based on K-S test) on the trustworthy of each category classifiers, the domain separation is extended to consider also an uncertain domain and the separation threshold is progressively refined. Once the domains are separated, classification can be performed disjointly in each of them.\n\n+ Having a way to define known/unknown and uncertain samples on the basis of which one can\nthen proceed to solve OSL and GZSL sounds as a very effective strategy. Moreover, all the parts of the method are \nbased on reliable probabilistic principles.\n \n- Unfortunately the text is not easy to read. There are several repetitions and disordered lists (same numbers used multiple times or mixing names and numbers for the items) which distract the reader. As a side note, it would be better to avoid mentioning dataset names without their description and definition ('aPY' appears out of the blue in the introduction). \n\n- The experiments extends over different datasets and the ablation study is valuable. However to understand how the proposed method advances over the current state of the art it is important to consider and discuss the most recent publications  on OSL and GZSL.

We also want to emphasize several points,\n(1) The whole paper aims at  Learning to Separate Domains in Generalized Zero-Shot and Open Set Learning: a probabilistic perspective. The focus is on domain division algorithm from a probabilistic perspective. So we only use linear model for zero-shot learning parts (rather than design a bit \"heavy\" zero-shot learning algorithm); and we show that even by using such a simple model, our model still works very well (thanks to well separating the sevearl domains). Of course, designing a good ZSL/G-ZSL is also an extra-ordinary work, which nevertheless would be enough to make an independent paper.\n(2) Admittedly, in some datasets, our model has slightly inferior results, and yet our results are generally good on most of dataset. Thus the results show the efficacy of proposed models, since again we actually use very simple forms in the recognition parts.\n\n2,Discussion about synthesis instances.\nYes, it's really a brillant point of employing synthesis instances to solve the task, since it seems like a \"free lunch\". We actually mean that the works of using synthesis instances for Open-Set/ZSL/G-ZSL are orthogonal but potentially useful to our works. Thanks again for mentioning it.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper218/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper218/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper218/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Separate Domains in Generalized Zero-Shot and Open Set Learning: a probabilistic perspective", "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of domain division which aims to segment instances drawn from different probabilistic distributions.

Here it will be more interesting to see the ZSL result also. Can you include the result of ZSL also?\n\u2014 As you mentioned, our main contribution is the domain division part. The ZSL result only depends on the mapping we mentioned, which we do not highlight. Thus, we did not report the ZSL results. Actually, the result of this simply mapping is very close to the state-of-the-art (AWA 73.3; aPY 46.8; CUB 39.6) with much fewer computation resources. This kind of simple mapping can prove the efficacy of the domain division algorithm. \n\n2. The main contribution of the paper are G-ZSL, there is a lot of recent work handling this problem, but the author has not compared with any recent work of G-ZSL. Can you discuss and compare a few recent works of G-ZSL.\n\u2014 Admittedly, all of the works you mentioned are very interesting and promising, however, they all synthesize the pseudo-instances in the target domain, which is distinct from previous methods. But these works are complementary and potentially useful to our works. As we said, our mapping based on very simple and classic algorithms, in order to emphasize the meaning of domain division. Moreover, the works you mentioned are also likely to be enhanced by our division algorithm, which reflects the adaptability of our work. \n\u2014 Additionally, although our work is not accuracy-oriented, our results are still promising in some datasets, like AWA (Ours: 67.3; Verma et al.: 61.5; Felix et al.: 60.2; Xian et al.: 59.6)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper218/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper218/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper218/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Separate Domains in Generalized Zero-Shot and Open Set Learning: a probabilistic perspective", "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of domain division which aims to segment instances drawn from different probabilistic distributions.
