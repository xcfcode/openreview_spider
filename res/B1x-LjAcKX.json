Alternatively, they also propose a method to do progressive inference for similar reasons. \nThe ensembling result is interesting, but the figure 4 is not necessarily clear on the significance of this result, especially since the standard deviation is not shown in this figure.\nThe idea proposed in this paper is interesting, however, the experiments are restricted on relatively small and simple architectures and limited on two very similar datasets (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100), making the argument less compelling.

The idea is a small modification on top of Czarnecki et al. Critic training, where instead of using final loss as a critic target, one bootstraps from critics on other layers. In particular, if only one module is present, these two approaches are actually identical. To be more precise, the only difference between these two methods is that (7) in Critic training would change to l(L_i, L_N). As a consequence, method becomes forward unlocked too. It is worth noting, that in the appendix of Czarnecki et al. it is shown that this particular method (critic training) under simple conditions actually \"degenerates\" to deep supervision (which is forward unlocked too). Consequently unlocking property as such is not a big contribution of the proposed method. Rest of the paper includes following elements:\n- empirical evaluation showing improvement over critic training by 0.4% in CIFAR10 and 0.9% in CIFAR100 when using 3 splits.\n- expansion on using the model for progressive inference.\n\nGiven standard deviation of errors in Table 1. it is not clear how significant these improvements are. How many samples were used to estimate these quantities? It is worth noting, that Critic training was showed to be outperformed by Sobolev Training in the same paper authors cite, but its performance is not reported despite looking like a well defined baseline. In particular, can these two methods be combined? \n\nI believe that this is an interesting research direction, however paper in its current form seems as a small incremental improvement over sota, and could be significantly improved by for example:\n- providing more comprehensive evaluation (including estimating accuracy to lower std errors)\n- adding other baseline solutions (such as Sobolev training, cDNI, or deep supervision)\n- considering any form of convergence/dynamics analysis of the proposed approach\n\n\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper148/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Local Critic Training of Deep Neural Networks", "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach to train deep neural networks by unlocking the layer-wise dependency of backpropagation training.

Please check the revised paper.\n\n1. Unlocking property \nIn the deep supervision, a certain layer is trained in the direction to minimize the weighted sum of the main loss (loss of the main network) and the supervision loss (loss of the additional modules located above the layer), therefore training of the layer is possible only after the feedforward pass finishes and then the error gradient is backpropagated. \nIn the critic training, training of the additional modules requires L_N, and thus needs to wait until the feedforward pass completely ends to obtain the final output of the main network; in this sense, the method is not fully unlocked. \nOn the other hand, in our approach, training of a layer does not need to wait until the main network's output is obtained and then the error gradient is backpropagated till the layer, and furthermore, training of a local critic network does not need to wait until the main network's output is obtained. Therefore, our method achieves the most complete unlocking property. Thus, we believe that our modification brings a significant opportunity for training with unlocking.\n\n2. Comprehensive evaluation (improvement over critic training)\nAll the experiments are performed 5 times (mentioned in the sentence right before Section 3.1), from which the average and standard deviation values are obtained.\nWe conducted nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests in order to examine statistical significance of the improvement of our method over critic training (0.4% and 0.9% for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively), from which we found the improvement is significant. This result is added in the revised paper, Section 3.1.\n\n3. Other baselines\nWe ran more experiments for other baselines (Sobolev training applied to both our method and the critic training method, and deep supervision). The results are provided in Section A.1 of the supplementary material.\n\n4.

The main idea is to attach a local critic module to each group and the error gradient is back propagated to each group from its local critic module instead of the last layer of the whole network.\nSuch an idea seems to work well and the resultant performance decrease is acceptable when the original network is not very large. However, when the original network is complex, the performance decrease may be relatively big. \n\nAnother benefit of this local critic training is that in addition to the main model, it can also produce several submodels that can be used for ensemble inference and progressive classification. \n\nIn summary, this manuscript proposes an interesting idea, but not sure empirically how useful it will be since for a complex network, this method may result in relatively big performance decrease. For a simple network, although the performance decrease is small, but there is no need to use the proposed training method for a simplex network.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper148/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Local Critic Training of Deep Neural Networks", "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach to train deep neural networks by unlocking the layer-wise dependency of backpropagation training.
