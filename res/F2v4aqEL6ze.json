They argue that this regularization makes the local minima flat and thus less prone to forgetting. They try to build a theoretical connection using results from information projection but there is still a large gap. In experiments, they show on several benchmarks that applying the KL divergence regularization to different regularization-based continual learning brings improvements. \n\nIt is always interesting to find a simple method that can consistently bring improvements. However, the simple method in this paper lacks sufficient explanation and theoretical justification. The experiments are also less convincing if without comparison to other types of continual learning methods.\n\n(1) The paper uses too much space (~4 pages) to explain the motivation of preferring flat minima and KL divergence and make them overcomplicated, which are actually quite straightforward to understand. However, **it uses less than 1 page for theoretical justification of the main idea (Section 2.3)** with few explanations about the equations and a large gap in building the connection between \"flat minima\" and KL divergence regularization. In particular, in Proposition 1:\n\n(i) The cross-entropy on the left or right-hand side of Eq.7 is defined on two joint distributions in the form of $P(X,Y)=P(Y|X)P(X)$, i.e., it shows that two joint distributions P1(X,Y) and P2(X,Y) becomes closer after projecting one of them to the KL ball. **However, what we truly care is whether P1(Y|X) and P2(Y|X) are close in expectation of X drawn from P(X), i.e., whether $E_{X~\\sim P(X)}[KL(P1|P2)]$ or $E_{X\\sim P(X)}[CE(P1|P2)]$ becomes smaller after the projection**, where E is expectation and CE is cross-entropy. To close this gap, the authors need to prove this very specifically.\n\n(ii) The result is mainly due to **an artifact of constraining all previous tasks' classifiers' outputs close to the uniform distribution**. It is obvious that the distance of distribution outside the ball to distribution inside becomes smaller if we project the outside distribution onto the ball. However, previous tasks' classifiers might already perform very poorly on their data distributions because their predictions are too close to uniform sampling, and the KL regularization accumulates the error and only make the prediction quality worse. In the extreme case, one can think that the classifier for task t-1 produces almost uniform predictions so it performs very poorly. Now making the classifier at task t also produce similar uniform predictions for data drawn from task t-1 does not help.\n\n(iii) Proposition 1 holds only when Lemma 1 holds, and Lemma 1 holds only when P* is the minimum solution for minimizing the KL divergence, i.e., Eq.6. However, the KL divergence is only a regularization term in the objective of Eq.3 (and there are two other terms) so it almost cannot be minimized. So **both Lemma 1 and Proposition 1 do not hold rigorously**.\n\n(2) It is encouraging to see that the proposed KL divergence regularization can improve regularization-based continual learning. However, as shown in recent works, other types of continual learning (e.g., memory replay based and dynamic architecture based) usually performs better. Since the proposed regularization can easily work within these methods, it is more convincing to compare their performance before and after adding the regularization.\n\n(3) The experiments do not cover several standard continual learning benchmarks such as permuted/rotated MNIST/FMNIST and sequential MNIST/Tiny-ImageNet. \n\n(4) Encouraging flat minima can alleviate forgetting in continual learning has been analyzed and studied in a recent paper: \nMirzadeh et al., \"Understanding the Role of Training Regimes in Continual Learning\", NeurIPS 2020. A discussion and comparison to it are recommended. Its analysis is in the model parameter space instead of the output space and is rigorous.\n\n(5) In Figure 3(c), the EWC+CPR achieved flat minima has much worse(larger) loss. Does this indicate that the stability is achieved with the price of significantly degraded loss?\n\n(6) Minor: the notations need to be more rigorous, for example (i) expectations E_{P_X} and E_X are both used in the paper at several positions, but they should be E_{X~P(X)}; (ii) to make the paper and appendix consistent, Q* in the proof of Lemma 1 of the appendix should be P*; (iii) The superscripts and subscripts can be simplified.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper463/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper463/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CPR: Classifier-Projection Regularization for Continual Learning", "authorids": ["~Sungmin_Cha1", "~Hsiang_Hsu1", "gxq9106@gmail.com", "~Flavio_Calmon1", "~Taesup_Moon1"], "authors": ["Sungmin Cha", "Hsiang Hsu", "Taebaek Hwang", "Flavio Calmon", "Taesup Moon"], "keywords": ["continual learning", "regularization", "wide local minima"], "abstract": "We propose a general, yet simple patch that can be applied to existing regularization-based continual learning methods called classifier-projection regularization (CPR).

This somehow intuitively makes less sense because it seems that there is an inherent\u00a0tradeoff between\u00a0them. If the model is well calibrated\u00a0then increasing stability should decrease plasticity and vice versa. That's why it's usually\u00a0referred\u00a0to as the stability-plasticity dilemma. It might be the case that improvement in both measures is a sign of a sup-optimal regime.\n\nThe paper has also claimed the first one to study the connection between widness of local minima and continual learning. There is at least one paper that has studied this relation before:Mirzadeh, Seyed Iman, et al. \"Understanding the role of training regimes in continual learning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.06958 (2020).\nSince it's been around for a short while the authors were probably not aware of this paper but it basically connects widness of the local minima to stability of continual\u00a0training. It's worth elaborating on the differences from and similarities to their approach.\n\nThe paper is generally well written. But, some notations are a little unclear and can be improved. For example, the difference between\u00a0\\theta_i^start and \\hat \\theta_i is wauge. Also, citations should be improved. The authors should note the difference between\u00a0\\citet and \\citep, etc. A proofreading can improve some typos throughout the paper.\u00a0\n\nSection 2.3 is not straightforward to follow. For example, it's good to elaborate (e.g. in an appendix section) why proposition\u00a01 is a consequence of lemma 1? Alos, how P_{Y|X}^{t} are related to continual learning\u00a0steps? The role of P_u is unclear and it's not that obvious\u00a0where does it appear in equation 7?\n\nExperiments look convincing but it can be improved in terms of clarity of the setup. For example, in measuring intransigence\u00a0it's mentioned no regularization is applied. It's unclear whether this \"regularization\" is the proposed CPR (using KL) or the normal EWC-like regularization (like last term in equation 3)?

Inspired by both recent results on neural networks with wide local minima and information theory, CPR adds an additional regularization term that maximizes the entropy of a classifier's output probability. We demonstrate that this additional term can be interpreted as a projection of the conditional probability given by a classifier's output to the uniform distribution. By applying the Pythagorean theorem for KL divergence, we then prove that this projection may (in theory) improve the performance of continual learning methods. In our extensive experimental results, we apply CPR to several state-of-the-art regularization-based continual learning methods and benchmark performance on popular image recognition datasets.
