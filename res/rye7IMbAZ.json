We finally would like to take the opportunity to discuss openly about the criteria for publishing papers. Novelty is obviously very important in research, because research aims at producing knowledge. However, another obvious fact is that most novelties are soon forgotten: among these, the numerous variants or combinations of existing things that do not bring much understanding or value according to whatever utility criterion one may have as a researcher or an end-user. In this regard, stressing the importance of novelty in paper evaluation is not necessarily good.\n\nPublishing should primarily a question of utility, not of novelty.\u00a0Our paper asserts (convincingly If we believe the reviews), that the current strategy for transfer learning is to use a wrong baseline. This is bad if you want to get good results in applications, this is also bad if you build novel strategies motivated by improving upon a bad baseline. We therefore think that publishing this paper is useful for stopping the current practice, which provides suboptimal results, and encourages useless novel strategies that only improve upon a bad

Overall, the evaluation concludes with recommending that all layers of a network whose weights are directly transferred during fine-tuning should be regularized against the initial net with an L2 penalty during further training. \n\nRelationship to prior work:\nRegularizing a target model against a source model is not a new idea. The authors miss key connections to A-SVM [1] and PMT-SVM [2] -- two proposed transfer learning models applied to SVM weights, but otherwise very much the same as the proposed solution in this paper. Though the study here may offer new insights for deep nets, it is critical to mention prior work which also does analysis of these regularization techniques. \n\nSignificance:\nAs the majority of visual recognition problems are currently solved using variants of fine-tuning, if the findings reported in this paper generalize, then it could present a simple new regularization which improves the training of new models. The change is both conceptually simple and easy to implement so could be quickly integrated by many people.\n\nClarity and Questions:\nThe purpose of the paper is clear, however, some questions remain unanswered. \n1) How is the regularization weight of 0.01 chosen? This is likely a critical parameter. In an experimental paper, I would expect to see a plot of performance for at least one experiment as this regularization weighting parameter is varied. \n2) How does the use of L2 regularization on the last layer effect the regularization choice of other layers? What happens if you use no regularization on the last layer? L1 regularization?\n3) Figure 1 is difficult to read. Please at least label the test sets on each sub-graph.\n4) There seems to be some issue with the freezing experiment in Figure 2. Why does performance of L2 regularization improve as you freeze more and more layers, but is outperformed by un-freezing all. \n5) Figure 3 and the discussion of linear dependence with the original model in general seems does not add much to the paper. It is clear that regularizing against the source model weights instead of 0 should result in final weights that are more similar to the initial source weights. I would rather the authors use this space to provide a deeper analysis of why this property should help performance. \n6) Initializing with a source model offers a strong starting point so full from scratch learning isn\u2019t necessary -- meaning fewer examples are needed for the continued learning (fine-tuning) phase. In a similar line of reasoning, does regularizing against the source further reduce the number of labeled points needed for fine-tuning? Can you recover L2 fine-tuning performance with fewer examples when you use L2-SP?\n\n[1] J. Yang, R. Yan, and A. Hauptmann. Adapting svm classifiers to data with shifted distributions.

The experiments are now clear and thorough enough to provide a convincing argument for using this regularization in deep nets.

First, we would like to inform you that we improved our results by using the original version of ResNet. The comparisons and conclusions are qualitatively identical to the previous version.\n\nBelow are our answers to your questions.\n\n(0) Relationship to prior work:\nThanks for the references on SVM that are now added in the related work section. Although our regularizers are technically very similar to A-SVM and PMT-SVM, they have a rather different role: they act on the representation learned by the deep networks, which are equivalent to the kernels of SVM. The only weights that are not preserved by our approach are the weights in the last layer, which are the only weights that are regularized by A-SVM and PMT-SVM.\n\nOur aim in this paper is to promote regularizers that are technically similar to the ones used for SVM, but that are largely ignored in fine-tuning for transfer learning. This paper demonstrates that the regularization matters in transfer learning and that a simple change can improve the performance for the target task. \n\n(1)(2) The regularization hyper-parameters are chosen in the same way as choosing other hyper-parameters, by cross validation. We have added a new figure (Figure 1) in Section 4.2 to show the sensitivity of the two regularization hyper-parameters. This figure can also respond the question (2). \nAs for other regularization approaches on the last layer, we didn't observe the advantage of L1. The paper focuses on the demonstration that we can improve the performance by using a pre-trained model as reference to regularize the parameters. \n\n(3) Thank you for pointing this out. Sub-graph labels in Figure 2 (Figure 1 in the previous version) have been added.\n\n(4) Thanks for your observation about the figure with frozen layers. We corrected it by using the set of hyper-parameter values that were tested for getting the results of Table 2 (fixing no layers) throughout the experiments with frozen layers. The updated results, now in Figure 3, correspond to your expectations. \nWe reproduced this experiment on Caltech 256 and found a similar pattern.\n\n(5) With Figure 4 (Figure 3 in the previous version), we verify the effect of -SP approaches on parameters by measuring the linear dependence of activations. Activation similarities are easier to interpret than parameter similarities and provide a view of the network that is closer to the functional prospective we are actually pursuing. In addition, it proves that there's some connection between preserving the parameters and preserving the activations.\nFrom this figure, we can also notice that comparing with L2, L2-SP always has an R2 coefficient above 0.6, which means that L2-SP is capable to keep most of the pre-trained model.\nOn the other hand, we have added the results of L2-SP-Fisher in this Figure. Although there's no noticeable difference between L2-SP and L2-SP-Fisher, we can observe extremely high R2 in the first layer, which indicates large values of Fisher matrix and the importance of the first layer.\n\n(6) Totally right. Another way to observe the advantage of L2-SP is that we need fewer training examples to have the same performance with L2."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": " Explicit Induction Bias for Transfer Learning with Convolutional Networks", "abstract": "In inductive transfer learning, fine-tuning pre-trained convolutional networks substantially outperforms training from scratch.\nWhen using fine-tuning, the underlying assumption is that the pre-trained model extracts generic features, which are at least partially relevant for solving the target task, but would be difficult to extract from the limited amount of data available on the target task.\nHowever, besides the initialization with the pre-trained model and the early stopping, there is no mechanism in fine-tuning for retaining the features learned on the source task.\nIn this paper, we investigate several regularization schemes that explicitly promote the similarity of the final solution with the initial model.\nWe eventually recommend a simple $L^2$ penalty using the pre-trained model as a reference, and we show that this approach behaves much better than the standard scheme using weight decay on a partially frozen network.", "pdf": "/pdf/165f67b1ff4e62a8ddc596d70306ef90093bc059.pdf", "TL;DR": "In inductive transfer learning, fine-tuning pre-trained convolutional networks substantially outperforms training from scratch.", "paperhash": "li|explicit_induction_bias_for_transfer_learning_with_convolutional_networks", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nli2018,\ntitle={ Explicit Induction Bias for Transfer Learning with Convolutional Networks},\nauthor={Xuhong LI and Yves GRANDVALET and Franck DAVOINE},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rye7IMbAZ},\n}", "keywords": ["transfer Learning", "convolutional networks", "fine-tuning", "regularization", "induction bias"], "authors": ["Xuhong LI", "Yves GRANDVALET", "Franck DAVOINE"], "authorids": ["xuhong.li@utc.fr", "yves.grandvalet@utc.fr", "franck.davoine@utc.fr"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "duedate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "tmdate": 1516825726815, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper844/Official_Comment", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"replyto": null, "forum": "rye7IMbAZ", "writers": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper844/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper844/Authors|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper844/Area_Chair|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper844/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper844/Authors|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper844/Area_Chair|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "value-dropdown": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper844/Authors_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper844/Reviewers_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper844/Area_Chairs_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 0, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper844/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper844/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper844/Area_Chair", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "cdate": 1516825726815}}}, {"tddate": null, "ddate": null, "tmdate": 1515186408401, "tcdate": 1515186408401, "number": 2, "cdate": 1515186408401, "id": "SylgFP6Xz", "invitation": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper844/Official_Comment", "forum": "rye7IMbAZ", "replyto": "BJQD_I_eM", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper844/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper844/Authors"], "content": {"title": "Response", "comment": "Thank you for your feedback.
