For each (x,y), we compute I_{ewe}(s,drive) and record it in a matrix R with size 18*18. For example, we place the agent at (0, 0), and comput I_{ewe}(s,drive). The result is the saved in R[0][0].

Except for the square field,  effect of the agent on the ewe when it is placed on other field computed by our method is almost zero. This experiment result shows that the effect of the agent on the ewe is strong only when it is in the square field, and this is in line with the  true game rule and our method can capture this.\n\n**Q: \"If the colored square in Figure 5 right presents the effect of the agent\u2019s action on the ewe, the effect is strong except for the top row.

Here are our responses.", "comment": "**Q: \u201cThe proposed approach first need to create a factored state space, given by the user. It is not clear how intuitive is this process and if it can be performed automatically.\u201d**\n\nA: The factored space contains subspace each recording the states of entities belonging to one category. To construct such a space, we need to identify: 1. how many categories. 2. category of each entity. Given an environment with multiple entities, intuitively objects with the same shape, color or size might be within the same category. Domain knowledge like the background of the game also provides hints for this. One may consider an intuitive example that a game contains interacting balls with 3 colors: white, green and blue. Then the user can define the number of category to be 3 and conduct causal analysis. We thus think constructing the factored space (identifying number of category) is intuitive. In case where the category of the objects is not available as a prior, one may apply some segmentation approaches such as shape or color analysis to obtain the category of objects. For example, object detection and segmentation approaches can be applied in case that images are input and categories need to be inferred. We add discussions about this in  section 3.1. We think automatic construction of such factored space is achievable.\n\n\n**Q: \u201cIt is not clear how to determine the number of categories? (how many decoders?) If there is a single agent interacting with different objects, a new category needs to be defined for each object?\u201d**\n\nA: For the first question, you may refer to the answer above. We here assume that the category of objects is fixed in the game. If new objects are generated (for example, in the ant game, a new ant is born), its category falls into the existed pool and we do not need to add a new decoder for it. We do not yet consider the case where the number of category of objects is changing.  But this is an interesting direction for future research.\n\n\n**Q: \u201cThe results should also include the time used to obtain the causal graphs.\u201d**\n\nA: Table 3 recording the time is available in the revised version in section 4.2, with analysis. Please kindly refer to the revised version.\n\n\n**Q: \u201cTypos: ... analysis et, al (Ren et al. ... ... deconvlutional ... ... cause that the ewe ... => ... cause the ewe ... ... the the ...\u201d**\n\nA: The listed ones are corrected, and we also go through the paper for typo correction.  \n\nThank you again for your valuable comments that help a lot to improve the paper!\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1073/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1073/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Causality-based Intrinsic Reward", "authorids": ["~Peng_Zhang20", "liufurui2@huawei.com", "~Zhitang_Chen1", "~Jianye_HAO1", "~Jun_Wang2"], "authors": ["Peng Zhang", "Furui Liu", "Zhitang Chen", "Jianye HAO", "Jun Wang"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Causal Relation"], "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great potential to deal with sequential decision-making problems.

The title and the first contribution of this paper should be more specific and the related work should be included in the main text.\nThere were unclear points in the implementation (without sharing codes) and the results (below).\n[i] W. Shi et al. Self-Supervised Discovering of Causal Features: Towards Interpretable Reinforcement Learning, arXiv, 2020 [ii] W. Agnew and P. Domingos. Relevance-Guided Modeling of Object Dynamics for Reinforcement Learning, arXiv, 2020\u201d**\n\nA: The comments are addressed:\n1. The title has been changed to \"Deep Reinforcement Learning with Causality-based Intrinsic Reward\" to be more specific on the contributions of the paper.\n2. We add several discussions in section 3.1 (last paragraph) and section 5 of related work. More related work are presented (including two papers i and ii).  Please kindly refer to our uploaded revised version.\n3. As we promised in the last two paragraph of the introduction, the environment and the algorithm are \"to be released to the community\". This sentence would definitely appear in our camera-ready version. In fact, we already get the official approval of this project to be open-sourced from our institution, and you can expect it to be released soon. For easy reference and reproducibility, we also provide many details in appendix.\n\n**Q: \u201cThere is little information about the algorithm of Relational DRL (Zambaldi et al., 2018) as one of the baseline. Relational DRL seems to be an attention-based A2C algorithm, but is the difference only related to the attention-based approach? At least, whether it is an A2C algorithm or not should be clarified.\u201d**\n\nA: RDRL is actually an A2C algorithm, with extra attention based feature extration layers. To make this clarified, we add \"We compare CARE with flat DRL method (A2C) and Relational DRL \\citep{rdrl}, which is an A2C based algorithm and uses multi-head attention to extract relation between entities. \" in the first paragraph of section 4.\n\n**Q: \u201cIn both experiments, is the number of categories K the number of agents? This was not specified.\u201d**\n\nA: The K here refers to number of categories of entities, and this is in consistency with the definitions in section 3. To make this clear, we add specifications of K in section 4.1 and 4.2.\n\n**Q: \u201cI did not understand Figure 5 right and the sentence (\u201dThe value of coordinate (x, y) in the heatmap corresponds to the effect of the agent on the ewe when it is on position (x, y) and taking action drive\u201d). The correspondence of xy coordinates with Figure 5 left might help my understanding.\u201d**\n\nA: Figure 5 is used to test if the effect of the agent's action on the entity is correctly estimated, which is for computing the intrinsic reward as showed by Eq 15. When the sheep are in positions as showed by figure 5 left, we place the agent in the positions coordinated by (x,y) and record the effect of the agent\u2019s action on the ewe (showed by color). In other words, the value in coordination (x,y) records the effect of taking the action \"drive\" when the agent is at position (x,y). One can see that the closer the agent is to the ewe, the larger the effect would be. This is reasonable since the influence of the agent's action on ewe becomes larger if they are closer. To make this clear to readers, we make clarifications using the texts around the figure 5.\n\nThank you again for your valuable comments that help a lot to improve the paper!"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1073/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1073/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Causality-based Intrinsic Reward", "authorids": ["~Peng_Zhang20", "liufurui2@huawei.com", "~Zhitang_Chen1", "~Jianye_HAO1", "~Jun_Wang2"], "authors": ["Peng Zhang", "Furui Liu", "Zhitang Chen", "Jianye HAO", "Jun Wang"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Causal Relation"], "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great potential to deal with sequential decision-making problems.

Here are our responses.", "comment": "**Q: \u201cThe authors should define a critical entity since they mentioned it many times in the article. Since the learned graph considers categories as nodes, I did not understand the reference of critical entities as top-ranked nodes in the graph (Sec. Calculating ACE).\nI would like also to see a proper definition of the entities and how the learned causal graph of entities impacts the performance of the proposed method.\nThere is confusion about the nodes in the causal graph, sometimes the authors mention them as entities:\nAbstract: \u201ccritical entities of the causal graph\u201d Introduction:: \u201dThe proposed algorithm learns a graph to encode the relation information between entities\u201d.\nAnd they change to consider nodes as categories of entities:\nMethod: \u201cwe calculate ACE values between categories of entities, which are used for constructing a causal graph G\u201d Sec.3.1: \u201cwe focus on the causal relation among categories of entities.\u201d\u201d**\n\nA: Critical entities here refer to entities belonging to top ranked categories. To address the comments, we make several revisions:\n1. The related statements in abstract and introduction are revised to be in consistency with other parts.\n2. Section 3.1 is rewritten to introduce the category of entities, and a new definition 3 is added in section 3.2 to formalize the criticality of category of entities as their rankings in the casual ordering (top ranked nodes) required by our algorithm.\n\n**Q: \u201cMy main concern about this paper is about the experimentation, specifically: baselines. I consider that the requirement of no prior knowledge is an interesting and valuable contribution of this paper. However, in scenarios in which we have such information, I do not consider that we should ignore it. Thus, I consider it is an open research question the application of the proposed method in these scenarios. In this sense, I consider that the approaches proposed in [1,2] should be considered as baselines in an experiment where CARE receives the causal graph and does not \u201cupdate\" it during the sequential decision-making process. The categories of the given entity causal graph could be inferred to build the causal relation among categories of entities as assumed as input to CARE.\u201d**\n\nA: We give a training schema targeting the cases where prior causal graph is not obtainable, which often happens, and consider the graph learning part a contribution of this paper. In our environment, the learned graphs are just the true ones, and providing the true graphs to it would generate the same performance curve for CARE. Since baselines such as A2C do not require a prior graph, to ensure fairness we do not compare them with the ones you list, given our current game settings. It is indeed interesting to consider the case where the underlying graph is available. We are going to maintain an open-source repository consisting of multiple game environments, and some of them may provide a choice that the graph is given or not. Then we would be able to test more baselines (e.g. [1,2]) to further promote this line of research.\n\n**Q: \u201cI did not understand why CARE is not appropriate to Text-Adventure Game [3].\u201d**\n\nA: The CARE introduced in the paper takes matrix signals as input and uses convolutional layers. The inference of causal graph is by minimizing the state prediction error. Thus, it cannot be directly adopted to texts. However, the framework of CARE is adoptable to text games, if one uses language processing techniques to identify several categories of entities from texts, and analyze their causal relations. \n\n**Q: \u201cReferences should point to the published work rather than the arxiv entries, when the former is available (e..g. Neural Network Attributions: A Causal Perspective, ICML\u201919).

Since the learned graph considers categories as nodes, I did not understand\nthe reference of critical entities as top-ranked nodes in the graph (Sec. Calculating ACE).\n\nI would like also to see a proper definition of the entities and how the learned causal graph of entities impacts the performance of the proposed method.\n\nThere is confusion about the nodes in the causal graph, sometimes the authors mention them as entities:\n\nAbstract: \u201ccritical entities of the causal graph\u201d\nIntroduction:: \u201dThe proposed algorithm learns a graph to encode the relation information between entities\u201d.\n\nAnd they change to consider nodes as categories of entities:\n\nMethod: \u201cwe calculate ACE values between categories of entities, which are used for constructing a causal graph G\u201d\nSec.3.1: \u201cwe focus on the causal relation among categories of entities.\u201d\n\nFor my review, I am considering nodes as categories of entities, given that the authors discuss a restriction on learning the category causal graph\nrather than the entity causal graph to make their approach scalable. But this inconsistency and lack of definition lead to confusion.\n\nMy main concern about this paper is about the experimentation, specifically: baselines. \n\nI consider that the requirement of no prior knowledge is an interesting and valuable contribution of this paper. However, in scenarios in which we have such information, I do not consider that we should ignore it. Thus, I consider it is an open research question the application of the proposed method in these scenarios.\nIn this sense, I consider that the approaches proposed in [1,2] should be considered as baselines in an experiment where CARE receives the causal graph and does not\n\u201cupdate\" it during the sequential decision-making process. The categories of the given entity causal graph could be inferred to build the causal relation among categories\nof entities as assumed as input to CARE. \n\nI did not understand why CARE is not appropriate to Text-Adventure Game [3].\n\n[1] Tingwu Wang, Renjie Liao, Jimmy Ba, and Sanja Fidler.
