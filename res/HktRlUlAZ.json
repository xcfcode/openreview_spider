The method is combination of a spatial transformer module that predicts a focal point, around which a log-polar transform is performed. The resulting log-polar image is analyzed by a conventional CNN.\n\nI find the basic idea quite compelling. Although this is not mentioned in the article, the proposed approach is quite similar to human vision in that people choose where to focus their eyes, and have an approximately log-polar sampling grid in the retina. Furthermore, dealing well with variations in scale is a long-standing and difficult problem in computer vision, and using a log-spaced sampling grid seems like a sensible approach to deal with it.\n\nOne fundamental limitation of the proposed approach is that although it is invariant to global translations, it does not have the built-in equivariance to local translations that a ConvNet has. Although we do not have data on this, I would guess that for more complex datasets like imagenet / ms coco, where a lot of variation can be reasonably well modelled by diffeomorphisms, this will result in degraded performance.\n\nThe use of the heatmap centroid as the prediction for the focal point is potentially problematic as well. It would not work if the heatmap is multimodal, e.g. when there are multiple instances in the same image or when there is a lot of clutter.\n\nThere is a minor conceptual confusion on page 4, where it is written that \"Group-convolution requires integrability over a group and identification of the appropriate measure dg. We ignore this detail as implementation requires application of the sum instead of integral.\"\nWhen approximating an integral by a sum, one should generally use quadrature weights that depend on the measure, so the measure cannot be ignored. Fortunately, in the chosen parameterization, the Haar measure is equal to the standard Lebesque measure, and so when using equally-spaced sampling points in this parameterization, the quadrature weights should be one. (Please double-check this - I'm only expressing my mathematical intuition but have not actually proven this).\n\nIt does not make sense to say that \"The above convolution requires computation of the orbit which is feasible with respect to the finite rotation group, but not for general rotation-dilations\", and then proceed to do exactly that (in canonical coordinates). Since the rotation-dilation group is 2D, just like the 2D translation group used in ConvNets, this is entirely feasible. The use of canonical coordinates is certainly a sensible choice (for the reason given above), but it does not make an infeasible computation feasible.\n\nThe authors may want to consider citing\n- Warped Convolutions: Efficient Invariance to Spatial Transformations, Henriques & Vedaldi.\nThis paper also uses a log-polar transform, but lacks the focal point prediction / STN.\nLikewise, although the paper makes a good effort to rewiev the literature on equivariance / steerability, it missed several recent works in this area:\n- Steerable CNNs, Cohen & Welling\n- Dynamic Steerable Blocks in Deep Residual Networks, Jacobsen et al.\n- Learning Steerable Filters for Rotation Equivariant CNNs, Weiler et al.\nThe last paper reports 0.71% error on MNIST-rot, which is slightly better than the PTN-CNN-B++ reported on in this paper.\n\nThe experimental results presented in this paper are quite good, but both MNIST and ModelNet40 seem like simple / toyish datasets. For reasons outlined above, I am not convinced that this approach in its current form would work very well on more complicated problems. If the authors can show that it does (either in its current form or after improving it, e.g. with multiple saccades, or other improvements) I would recommend this paper for publication.\n\n\nMinor issues & typos\n- Section 3.1, psi_gh = psi_g psi_h. I suppose you use psi for L and L', but this is not very clear.\n- L_h f = f(h^{-1}), p. 4\n- \"coordiantes\", p. 5", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Polar Transformer Networks", "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are inherently equivariant to translation.

The idea is to jointly train\n- a network predicting a polar origin,\n- a module transforming the image into a log-polar representation according to the predicted origin,\n- a final classifier performing the desired classification task.\nA (not too large) translation of the input image therefore does not change the log-polar representation.\nRotation and scale from the polar origin result in translation of the log-polar representation. As convolutions are translation equivariant, the final classifier becomes rotation and scale equivariant in terms of the input image. Rotation and scale can have arbitrary precision, which is novel to the best of my knowledge.\n\n(+) In my opinion, this is a simple, attractive approach to rotation and scale equivariant CNNs.\n\n(-) The evaluation, however, is quite limited. The approach is evaluated on:\n 1) several variants of MNIST. The authors introduce a new variant (SIM2MNIST), which is created by applying random similitudes to the images from MNIST. This variant is of course very well suited to the proposed method, and a bit artificial.\n 2) 3d voxel occupancy grids with a small resolution. The objects can be rotated around the z-axis, and the method is used to be equivariant to this rotation.\n\n(-) Since the method starts by predicting the polar origin, wouldn't it be possible to also predict rotation and scale? Then the input image could be rectified to a canonical orientation and scale, without needing equivariance. My intuition is that this simpler approach would work better.

The paper is very well written, easy to follow and substantiates its claims convincingly on variants of MNIST. A weakness of the paper is that it does not attempt to solve a real-world problem. However, I think because it is a conceptually novel and potentially very influential idea, it is a valuable contribution as it stands.\n\nIssues:\n\n- The clutter in SIM2MNIST is so small that predicting the polar origin is essentially trivially solved by a low-pass filter. Although this criticism also applies to most previous work using \u2018cluttered\u2019 variants of MNIST, I still think it needs to be considered. What happens if predicting the polar origin is not trivial and prone to errors? These presumably lead to catastrophic failure of the post-transformer network, which is likely to be a problem in any real-world scenario.\n\n- I\u2019m not sure if Section 5.5 strengthens the paper. Unlike the rest of the paper, it feels very \u2018quick & dirty\u2019 and not very principled. It doesn\u2019t live up to the promise of rotation and scale equivariance in 3D. If I understand it correctly, it\u2019s simply a polar transformer in (x,y) with z maintained as a linear axis and assumed to be parallel to the axis of rotation. This means that the promise of rotation and scale equivariance holds up only along (x,y). I guess it\u2019s not possible to build full 3D rotation/scale equivariance with the authors\u2019 approach (spherical coordinates probably don\u2019t do the job), but at least the scale equivariance could presumably have been achieved by using log-spaced samples along z and predicting the origin in 3D. So instead of showing a quick \u2018hack\u2019, I would have preferred an honest discussion of the limitations and maybe a sketch of a path forward even if no implemented solution is provided.\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Polar Transformer Networks", "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are inherently equivariant to translation.

It is likely that for imagenet/coco local translation\nequivariance is more important, but that may not be the case when\nglobal rotations and large scale variance is present.  We show that\nthe trade-off favors roto-dilation equivariance for the rotated MNIST,\nModelNet40, and rotated SVHN (included in the appendix during the\nreview period); a more interesting real life example where\nroto-dilation equivariance could be beneficial is object recognition\nin satellite images.\n\n> The use of the heatmap centroid as the prediction for the\n> focal point is potentially problematic as well.

Note that in\nthe newly included SVHN results there are often multiple instances\npresent (see figure 6); however, the correct label is the one of the\ncentral digit and our origin predictor learns to use that.  If we\nassume that multiple instances may be present in different positions,\nwith no central prior, we need to treat the problem as multiple object\ndetection.  Since the origin predictor is fully convolutional, we\nbelieve we could train our model on single objects and test it with\nmultiple objects, with some sort of test-time non-maximum-suppression\non the final heatmap.  It is likely that a soft argmax (perhaps with a\nloss term enforcing concentration) should be used instead of computing\nthe centroid.  We could also pre-train the origin predictor with\nobject center supervision, and then fine-tune it end-to-end (since we\nhave shown that the object center is not necessarily the best origin).\nNote that we have not tried this approach yet, though we did\nexperiment with the soft argmax and concentration loss in the\nsingle-instance setting, and found no performance difference.\n\n> There is a minor conceptual confusion on page 4, where it\n> is written that \"Group-convolution requires integrability\n> over a group and identification of the appropriate measure\n> dg.

The purpose of section 5.5 is to show\nthat our method is applicable to a more challenging problem, from a\ncompletely different domain.  Even though our implementation may be\nconsidered a hack (applying channel-wise polar transforms), the\nconcept of using cylindrical coordinates for azimuthal rotation\nequivariance is solid, and so is learning axis of the transform.  This\nis the direct extension of the PTN to 3D.\n\nAs you mentioned, it is not possible to achieve full SO(3)\nequivariance using cylindrical or spherical coordinates.  Hence, we\naim for equivariance to rotations around axes parallel to z.  We\nconsider this a reasonable assumption, which is equivalent to assuming\nsensors parallel to the ground, or known gravity direction in robotics\napplications, for example.  Moreover, the vast majority of results on\nModelNet40 are with azimuthal rotation only.\n\nIt is indeed the case that scale equivariance could be achieved by\nlog-spaced samples along z.  It could also be achieved by using\nspherical coordinates.  We experimented with those but neither improve\nperformance on ModelNet40, since the scale variability is negligible\non it.
