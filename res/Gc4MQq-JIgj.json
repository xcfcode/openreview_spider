Our most important algorithmic innovation is the isolation of the reward seeking phase from the threat assessing phase that extensively requires the simulation. We present a novel way to use the generative model. In addition, our method only uses the generative model during the R-MDP training phase. The P-MDP phase as well as the real-time execution do not need to access the generative model, and this feature further provides transferability as discussed in the introduction and demonstrated in Section 4.3.

Note that [1] was actually published in 2006, just a year after Geibel and Wysotzki, 2005. Both of them belong to a family of classical methods in solving a CMDP by using Lagrangian multipliers. We will mention it clearly in the revision. The method in [3] is also based on Lagrange multipliers, and it attempts to solve the CMDP as LP problem using the incremental column-generation method to optimize the lagrange multiplier coefficient. We believe that we can make sufficient comparative study with all these Lagrange multiplier methods by comparing our method against the baseline of DQN-based Lagrange multiplier method [5]. \n\nSecond, the methods in [2] and [4] are not suitable for the high-dimensional stochastic environments we considered. The method proposed in [2] is a version of Monte Carlo tree search, whose variation of the future state can quickly explode especially when there are many randomly moving obstacles in the system. The approach of [4] requires constraints to be \u201clinear\u201d which is not the case for the complex environments we consider in this paper.\n\nLastly, we would like to point out that none of the cited papers has verified their performance in as high dimensional environment as the Jam environment used in our paper, the state of which is represented by 392 real values. More particularly, [2] used deterministic MuJoCo-based environment like Ants; [3] used low-dimensional environments (|S|: up to 60) for evaluation; [4] also used lower-dimensional (at most 100 real values) environments.\n\nThe video we provided in the supplementary would help you to see how difficult the task is, especially for the Jam environment.\n\n[1] Reinforcement Learning for MDPs with Constraints, Geibel, ECML 2016. \n\n[2] Monte-Carlo Tree Search for Constrained MDPs, Chen et al., IJCAI 2018. \n\n[3] Column Generation Algorithms for Constrained POMDPs, Walraven and Spaan, JAIR 2018. \n\n[4] Hindsight Optimization for Hybrid State and Action MDPs, Raghavan et al.

It proposes to solve the CMDP by decomposing it into a pair of MDPs; i) a reconnaissance MDP (R-MDP) that is trained with the help of a generative model, and ii) a planning MDP (P-MDP) that is trained given a threat function (i.e., previously trained for the R-MDP). The decomposition approach is tested over some classical benchmarks.\n\nStrengths:\n\ni) The motivation, organization and the overall writing of the paper are clear.\n\nWeakness:\n\ni) The paper seems to be missing out related works [1,2,3,4,\u2026] that can solve C-(PO)MDPs, which could have been used as baselines (i.e., instead of DQN). Therefore it is not clear if the following claim is true or not: \u201cAlthough our method does not guarantee to find the optimal solution of the CMDP problem, there has not been any study to date that has succeeded in solving a CMDP in dynamical environments as high-dimensional as the ones discussed in this study.\u201d. Overall, I would say this is the weakest part of the paper.\n\nii) It is not clear if the selected experimental benchmarks are challenging. Looking at Table 1 and 2, it seems either i) the selected domains do not benefit from long-term planning, and/or ii) the proposed method learns short-sighted policies. That is in Table 2 for N=15, the proposed method performs similar to MPC over 3 steps.\n\niii) The experimental results require better presentation.

In the first phase, it uses a generative model to solve the MDP with the original constraint being the cost. The policy is then used to define secure actions to help solving the second MDP that maximizes the reward. While the method does not guarantee to find the optimal safe policy, the authors claim (and show in few experiments) that it can perform better than classical methods.\n\nWhile the approach seems simply and intuitive, it is not clear whether the contributions are significant for the community. The decomposition seems straightforward and the algorithmic innovation does not seem to be significant. All the difficulties of solving the thread function is being resolved by assuming the access to a generative model. In particular, the authors further consider the case where solving the R-MDP is simpler: the danger is described by known risky events and hence sampling rare events with the generative model is easier. As a result, the experiments primarily focus on navigation tasks. More thorough experiments would be appreciated. In addition, beyond MPC, is it possible to add other baselines that use a learning based approach with access to generative model? If possible, I think this will help to further clarify the benefit of the overall idea of decomposition.

The main idea is to consider essentially two distinct reward functions on the same MDP, one quantifying the risk/safety level of the states, and the other quantifying the usual reward. A policy is first trained to optimize safety, and then a policy is trained to optimize reward, subject to remaining in the safe region, i.e., subject to a constraint given by the Q function for the safety MDP. If the policy enters an unsafe state, it is required to follow the policy for the safety MDP; the paper includes some theoretical results demonstrating that this is an adequate way to ensure the expected safety remains above a given threshold.\n\nActually, the paper also proposes to decompose the safety reward into scores w.r.t. various events such as colliding with the various objects in the environment, and uses a linear combination of these component scores to obtain an aggregate safety score. This approach provides estimates of the safety scores in novel environments, for example where the configuration of the environment is changed, or with a different number of obstacles. Experiments suggest that the resulting approach is much computationally lighter than model-predictive control, and obtains the safest execution across the various methods considered. The reward obtained remains competitive overall.\n\nThe one downside here is the assumption of a simulator, which is pretty strong. It is true that pure sampling alone is never going to be able to provide a strong safety guarantee, and some kind of assumption is going to be necessary to obtain a strong guarantee, so I don't fault the use of some assumption. At the same time, the existence of the simulator does not make the problem trivial, as the optimization remains challenging, and the relative efficiency of the proposed approach is an argument in its favor. The approach is pretty effective overall and has some nice generalization properties. I recommend acceptance.\n\nOne question I have is whether the decomposition of the environment's threats into different factors could be used with other methods: if the dimension of the state space is sufficiently small, then maybe for example the synthesis (model checking/reachability) methods could be feasibly applied.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2990/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2990/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Reconnaissance for reinforcement learning with safety constraints", "authorids": ["~Shin-ichi_Maeda2", "~Hayato_Watahiki1", "~Yi_Ouyang1", "okada@preferred.jp", "~Masanori_Koyama1"], "authors": ["Shin-ichi Maeda", "Hayato Watahiki", "Yi Ouyang", "Shintarou Okada", "Masanori Koyama"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Safety constraints", "Constrained Markov Decision Process"], "abstract": "Practical reinforcement learning problems are often formulated as constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) problems, in which the agent has to maximize the expected return while satisfying a set of prescribed safety constraints.
