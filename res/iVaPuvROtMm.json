The aggregate data refers to the setting when the data is anonymized. For example, one has data about the location of the birds at different instants in time, but the birds are not labeled and can not be distinguished from each other. For the purpose of learning, the paper proposes to use a generator, in the setting of WGAN, to learn the drift term in the dynamics. The novelty of the proposed approach is to consider the weak form of the Fokker-Planck equation to express the loss function. \n\nThe problem is interesting, but I found several issues about the proposed approach that need to be addressed.  \n\n1- The paper consider a special setting where the dynamics is given by a diffusion process. It is assumed that the diffusion coefficient is known and the objective is to learn the drift function. I think this is a strong assumption and learning diffusion coefficient is also very important and need to be included in this work.  \n\n2- Learning the drift function from aggregate data may have fundamental limitation that the paper needs to address. It seems impossible to learn mixing terms (the terms in the dynamics that do not effect the distribution) from aggregate data. In other words, even in and ideal setting with infinite capacity for neural network and infinite amount of data, the learned drift function differs from the actual one. This can be verified by running a simple experiment with dynamics [[0,1][-1,0]] so that the distribution does not change and the learned drift function should be zero. \n\n3- In the proposed formulation, eq (8), it is not clear which one is real data and which one is generated data. \n\n4- Theorem 1 is not stated correctly and it is missleading. It states that eq (7) is the Wasserstein distance. However, eq (7) is just an approximation. And I really don't think this should be stated as a result in a Theorem. This is basic definition of Wasserstein distance and eq (1) and it is more appropriate to be presented as part of text.  Also, Lemma 1 is well-known and a reference should be given. \n\n5- The numerical experiments are nice, but they should also consider the long-term behavior: If the learned dynamics results to the correct stationary distribution or not. Because the stationary distribution is one of the important characteristics of a stochastic dynamics.

For your concerns, here are our point-by-point responses.\n\n\n\n1.The reviewer commented \u201cIn my first reading of the paper, I thought the topic was very interesting but I struggled to follow some parts of the manuscript, which I thought was overly unclear. Some of the notation is undefined or ill-defined, the general reasoning is hard to follow, the notation does not help identifying the objects that are observed from the objects that are simulated.\u201d\n\nResponse: We rewrote the derivation part (section 2 in the paper) in order to make it clearer. The current reasoning has been revised to be more coherent and rigorous. Hopefully it will be easier to follow. Despite that, we also improved our narrative language and fixed several unclear notations which may cause confusions to the readers. \n\n\n\n2.The reviewer commented \u201cThere is a lack of acknowledgement of limitations of the proposed method.\u201d\n\nResponse: This a good suggestion. One obvious limitation is that we can\u2019t recover the trajectory information from the learning. Another limitation is that in theory our method can only learn a drift that may be a curl field different from the real drift term. This is because there may be infinitely many drift functions to induce the same density evolution. In other words, given the density evolution $p(\u00b7,t)$, the solution for drift term is not necessarily unique. This is an intrinsic difficulty of determining the exact drift term from the density. To better illustrate this point, we added this limitation in a new section \u201cDiscussions\u201d. We also added a new experiment: a Gaussian distribution is driven by a curl field, thus at any time the distribution doesn\u2019t change, in such a case if we only know the information of the distribution, it is impossible to recover the drift function as a curl field. However, if we know enough samples from the Gaussian distribution and these samples doesn\u2019t follow the distribution perfectly, we demonstrate that our algorithm is able to capture the correct vector field.\n\n\n\n3.The reviewer commented \u201cThe synthetic examples are not well-motivated, and various other fairly standard concerns.\u201d\n\nResponse: In this work we aim to predict the future distribution of the aggregate data, with the help of Fokker Planck Equation and Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Our method begins with using the weak form of Fokker Planck Equation to estimate the densities, then we compare generated distribution and real distribution within the WGAN framework. For synthetic data, we want to prove the efficiency of our method in both linear and nonlinear cases, it is shown that our method is able to capture and predict the distribution evolutions. \n\n\n\n4.The reviewer commented: \u201cHowever, during my second reading I looked at the reference Wang et al, \"Learning Deep Hidden Nonlinear Dynamics from Aggregate Data\", published in UAI in 2018. From this I got more serious concerns. \u2026 \u201d\n\nResponse: Thank you for pointing out this important aspect. We revised our paper carefully to avoid the similarities in the new version.  Our work and Wang\u2019s work are in the same domain, the question we both want to solve is how to model the hidden dynamic from aggregate data, we all select Wasserstein distance to compare distributions. For that reason, the description of the problem have similarities. However, our strategy and algorithm are totally different. Wang did it from the perspective of Hidden Markov Model, while we do it from the view of the weak form of Fokker Planck Equation. \n. \n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper290/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper290/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Stochastic Behaviour from Aggregate Data", "authorids": ["~Shaojun_Ma1", "sliu459@gatech.edu", "~Hongyuan_Zha1", "~Hao-Min_Zhou1"], "authors": ["Shaojun Ma", "Shu Liu", "Hongyuan Zha", "Hao-Min Zhou"], "keywords": ["Fokker Planck Equation", "weak form", "Wasserstein GAN"], "abstract": "Learning nonlinear dynamics from aggregate data is a challenging problem since the full trajectory of each individual is not available, namely, the individual observed at one time point may not be observed at next time point, or the identity of individual is unavailable.

When the training is done, still start with $x_0$, we predict $x_2$, $x_8$ and $x_{15}$ by Euler-Maruyama scheme of the SDE with the final learned drift function, then we compare them with the ground truth.

Here are our point-by-point responses to your concerns.\n\n\n1.Learning diffusion term is of great interest to us as well. We consider it as a natural extension of the work in this paper. We conducted an experiment by treating diffusion coefficient as a neural network, and the results seem to be promising. We have added this part to the new version of the paper.\n\n\n2.This is a great point, thanks for pointing out for us. Mathematically, it is impossible to recover the exact drift term of an SDE if we are only given the information of density evolution on certain time interval. This is because the solution for drift term is not necessarily unique for a given density evolution $p(\u00b7,t)$. There might be infinitely many drift functions that can induce the same density evolution. This is clearly an essential difficulty of determining the exact drift term from the density. In this study, our main goal is to recover the entire density evolution (i.e. interpolate the density between observation time points) and predict the density in the future rather than only learning for the drift function. As a result, although we cannot always acquire the exact drift term of the dynamic, we can still accurately recover and predict the density evolution. To better illustrate our view, following your suggestion, we added an experiment in section \u201cDiscussions\u201d. Saying that a Gaussian distribution is driven by a curl field, thus at any time the distribution doesn\u2019t change, in such a case if we only know the information of the distribution, it is impossible to recover the drift function as a curl field. However, if we know enough samples from the Gaussian distribution and these samples doesn\u2019t follow the distribution perfectly, we demonstrated that our algorithm is able to capture the correct vector field.\n\n\n3.We revised $\\hat{x}$ as true data and $\\tilde{x}$ as generated data.\n\n\n4.We changed \u201cTheorems\u201d to \u201cPropositions\u201d since the Wasserstein distance here is an approximation form. Also, we changed the words to \u201cthe Wasserstein distance between \u2026 can be approximated by\u2026\u201d. We wrote Ito process in the text and the reference of Lemma 1 is added. We also improved the derivations and notations so as to make the paper easier to follow.\n\n\n5.Sorry for the unclear statement, in all cases of numerical experiments, the distributions we predict finally converge to stationary distributions (as ground truths suggest). Syn-1 and syn-3 both converge to the distributions as their last figure shows, syn-2 converges to the defined mean slowly, we only show the evolution trend of the distribution due to the limitation of the paper space.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper290/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper290/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Stochastic Behaviour from Aggregate Data", "authorids": ["~Shaojun_Ma1", "sliu459@gatech.edu", "~Hongyuan_Zha1", "~Hao-Min_Zhou1"], "authors": ["Shaojun Ma", "Shu Liu", "Hongyuan Zha", "Hao-Min Zhou"], "keywords": ["Fokker Planck Equation", "weak form", "Wasserstein GAN"], "abstract": "Learning nonlinear dynamics from aggregate data is a challenging problem since the full trajectory of each individual is not available, namely, the individual observed at one time point may not be observed at next time point, or the identity of individual is unavailable.
