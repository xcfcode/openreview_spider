If the main point of this paper is to \u201cincorporate discriminator in a metric learning task instead of involving it in classification\u201d, we should have that direct comparison.\n\nA1: A direction comparison of our method with the semi-supervised classification in (Salimans et al, 2016) shows the following result: In (Salimans et al, 2016) the classification accuracy for Cifar10 is 81.27% (4000 labeled examples) and 82.27% (8000 labeled examples). Our method takes the penultimate layer of our triplet network model and obtains the classification accuracy 81.59% (5000 labeled examples) with a 9-nearest-neighbour classifier. \n\nHowever, the major benefit of developing this Triplet-based approach is that it does not need to access class labels (as in (Salimans et al, 2016)). Instead, this approach only needs to access the relationship (similar or dissimilar) between some portion of training examples. In this kind of applications classification-based learning models will not work. In addition, our approach will produce a metric that could be applied to search, compare and rank data. This cannot be done effectively through a classifier as that learned in (Salimans et al, 2016). \n\nTo highlight the benefits of using our approach, we compared its retrieval performance with two alternatives via the criterion of mean average precision (mAP). Specifically, for Cifar10 our approach achieves mAP=0.6353. If only using triplet (without incorporating GAN), the result is mAP=0.5367; and if only using GAN, the result is mAP=0.2003. This comparison clearly shows the advantage of our approach on learning a better metric for search or retrieval tasks. By the way, we intended to compare with the classification model in (Salimans et al, 2016) in terms of mAP value. However, such result is not available in that work because it focuses on classification. We are now re-training their model to make this comparison. \n\nQ2: Is triplet network a well-defined term? \u201cTriplet networks are one of the most commonly used techniques in deep learning metric (Yao et al., 2016; Zhuang et al., 2016). \u201c It is not used in these two reference papers.\n\nA2: As far as we have observed, the \u201ctriplet network\u201d term has been used by Hoffer & Ailon (2015) (See the title). In the revised version we will cite this paper immediately after the use of \u201ctriplet network\u201d to avoid confusion. On the other hand, by referring to (Yao et al., 2016; Zhuang et al., 2016), we just want to express that currently this kind of models have been widely applied in practical metric learning tasks in computer vision.  \n\nQ3: I also would like to see how the accuracies are sensitive to #labeled examples and #features. It\u2019d be desired to add more experimental results. \n\nA3: We agree that this kind of additional evaluation would be beneficial. Below we present the classification and retrieval results obtained on MNIST data (m-number of features, N-number of examples, 9-NN is used as classification model). As seen, the performance of our approach is relatively stable, and it improves with the increasing number of labeled examples and features. In addition, we are working on additional experiments for Cifar10. However, it takes more time than on MNIST. We are going to report the results on Cifar10 (including the mAP result mentioned at the end of A1) in Appendix to the extended abstract. \n\n            \t\t        N=100     N=200     N=500    N=1000\nm=16   accuracy\t97.61%    98.50%    98.59%   98.86%\n\t    mAP            0.8929     0.9244     0.9588    0.9700\n     \n            \t\t          m=16     m=32    m=64      m=128     m=256\nN=100  accuracy\t  97.61%  98.26%  98.31%   98.69%   98.65%\n\t    mAP              0.8929   0.9118   0.9056    0.9321     0.9414"}, "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Training Triplet Networks with GAN", "abstract": "Triplet networks are widely used models that are characterized by good performance in classification and retrieval tasks.
