While the final conclusions are still vague, this paper raises several noteworthy finding from its experiments.\nThe paper is well written and easy to follow. Although I still have some concerns about the paper (see the comments below), this paper has good contributions and worth to publish.\n\nPros:\nFor the first time in the literature, this paper proposed the concept of \u2018label leaking\u2019. Although its effect only becomes significant when the dataset is large, it should be carefully handled in the future research works along this line.\nUsing the ratio of 'clean accuracy' over \u2018adversarial accuracy\u2019 as the measure of robust is more reasonable compared to the existing works in the literature. \n\nCons:\nAlthough the conclusions of the paper are based on the experiments on ImageNet, the title of the paper seems a little misleading. I consider Section 4 as the main contribution of the paper. Note that Section 4.3 and Section 4.4 are not specific to large-scale dataset, thus emphasizing the \u2018large-scale\u2019 in the title and in the introduction seems improper. \nBasically all the conclusions of the paper are made based on observing the experimental results. Further tests should have been performed to verify these hypotheses. Without that, the conclusions of the paper seems rushy. For example, one dataset of imageNet can not infer the conclusions for all large-scale datasets.

This includes results in Table 3.\n\n> For the results in Figure 2, when \\epsilon is fixed (say \\epsilon=8), have you compared how many successful adversarial examples are generated (and thus passed to the target network)? Will it be another factor of this transferability rate?\n\nTransfer rate is computed as \u201cnumber of examples fooling both source and target networks\u201d / \u201cnumber of examples fooling only source network\u201d.\nSo yes, number of successful adversarial examples for source network is indeed one of the factors affecting transferability rate.\nHowever conclusions of section 4.4 are valid if you take into account this observation.\n\nIn particular if you fix epsilon and compare only numerator of transfer rate for different methods then it will be higher for one step methods, lower for basic iterative method and the lowest for iterative least likely class.\nOverall numerator of transfer rate will behave similarly to error rate on adversarial images generated for one network and classified by another. These numbers are discussed in appendix C, table 6 and figure 5.\n\nIf your question is about change of epsilon with fixed method.\nIn such case both numerator and denominator of transfer rate will increase with increase of epsilon. However we observed that numerator (number of transferred examples) increasing much faster than denominator (number of examples which fooled source network).\nFor example when epsilon growth from 8 to 16, denominator increases by less than 1% while numerator increases by more than 20%.\nWe added this clarification to the paper.\n\n\n> Also, do we have an estimation of the variance of the estimation of the transferability rate? How does this variance depend on the number of the successful adversarial examples?\n\nWe estimated that 95% confidence interval for the transfer rate is within \u00b11.3 percent point of value reported in Table 4. 1.3% is worst case estimation, for many values in this table actual 95% confidence interval is even smaller.\n\n\n> In the paragraph below Table 3, what does the following sentence mean? \"The most labels are leaked wit \\epsilon=0.3 *****, the model leaks 79 labels on the test set\" How this number 79, is calculated?\n\nN_correct_adv_label - N_correct_adv_pred\nwhere N_correct_adv_label is the number of test examples that are\ncorrectly classified when perturbed using the true label to generate\nthe perturbation, and N_correct_adv_pred is the number of test\nexamples that are correctly classified when perturbed using the\nmodel's prediction of the label.\n\n\n> Shouldn't all the true label have been leaked, since they all have been used to construct adversarial examples.\n\nNo, every label had the opportunity to be leaked, but not all of them\nwere successfully leaked.\n\nWe updated the paper to clearly define the term \"leak.\" We say a\nlabel has been leaked if and only if the model classifies an\nadversarial example correctly when that adversarial example is\ngenerated using the true label but misclassifies a corresponding\nadversarial example that was created without using the label.\n\nWe think your question is based on a less restrictive definition of\n\"leak\", where a label is considered leaked if the perturbation is a\nfunction of the label.\n\nRecall that the model gets to observe only the adversarial example\nx_adv, not the original example x_clean, so the trivial way to recover\nthe label by enumerating all possible calls to\nmake_adversarial_example(x_clean, label) is not possible.\n\n\n> Lastly, for the observations in section 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4, are they particular for only large scale dataset, or similar phenomenons happen in small scale dataset?\n\nLabel leaking was observed on small dataset (MNIST) as well after careful re-examination of results (section 4.2).\n\nWe haven\u2019t specifically studied how \\epsilon affect transferability and how model capacity affect robustness to adversarial examples on small dataset. But there are no fundamental reason why it would be different.\n\nIn response to this question, we ran the MNIST tutorial for cleverhans 1.0 (the paper for 1.0 isn\u2019t available yet, but 0.1 is here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00768) for 100 epochs with different depths of model.\n\nDefault depth, included with cleverhans:\nClean train, clean eval: 0.9922\nClean train, adv eval: 0.0503\nAdv train, clean eval: 0.9928\nAdv train, adv eval: 0.9347\n\nDouble depth:\nClean train, clean eval:  0.9915\nClean train, adv eval: 0.1754\nAdv train, clean eval: 0.9924\nAdv train, adv eval:  0.9683\n\nWe see that increasing the depth of the model increased the resistance to adversarial examples, whether or not adversarial training was used."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Adversarial Machine Learning at Scale", "abstract": "Adversarial examples are malicious inputs designed to fool machine learning models.\nThey often transfer from one model to another, allowing attackers to mount black\nbox attacks without knowledge of the target model's parameters.\nAdversarial training is the process of explicitly training a model on adversarial\nexamples, in order to make it more robust to attack or to reduce its test error\non clean inputs.\nSo far, adversarial training has primarily been applied to small problems.\nIn this research, we apply adversarial training to ImageNet.\nOur contributions include:\n(1) recommendations for how to succesfully scale adversarial training to large models and datasets,\n(2) the observation that adversarial training confers robustness to single-step attack methods,\n(3) the finding that multi-step attack methods are somewhat less transferable than single-step attack\n      methods, so single-step attacks are the best for mounting black-box attacks,\n      and\n(4) resolution of a ``label leaking'' effect that causes adversarially trained models to perform\n      better on adversarial examples than on clean examples, because the adversarial\n      example construction process uses the true label and the model can learn to\n      exploit regularities in the construction process.\n", "pdf": "/pdf/5c5fbf174131ed5bbba332fd1f627d17e4e1c608.pdf", "paperhash": "kurakin|adversarial_machine_learning_at_scale", "conflicts": ["google.com", "openai.com"], "keywords": ["Computer vision", "Supervised Learning"], "authors": ["Alexey Kurakin", "Ian J.
