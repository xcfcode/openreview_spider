For that, the authors study a simple toy model, where each data point consists of several patterns. All patterns are assumed to be orthogonal to each other. Those images should be learned with a 3-layer neural network. The contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\n1. The authors show that the networks, which are analyzed in this paper, have large VC dimension. In particular, this implies that generalization cannot be explained via generic VC theory. \n2. As a way out, the authors introduce the concept of Patterns Statistics Inductive Bias (PSI). This relates the weight to the patterns in the dataset. In particular, the authors prove that PSI implies good generalization.\n3. The authors study the conjecture, that training a neural network via gradient descent (with hinge loss) leads to a network, which satisfies the (PSI) condition.  They provide empirical as well as some theoretical evidence.\n\nI think this is an interesting paper, which develops a new point of view and contains interesting ideas. While, the paper does not provide full evidence that the (PSI) condition is the right way to look at the problem, it may open up a new research direction.\n\nOn a personal level, I think point 1. and 2. are argued convincingly in the paper, but 3. could be strengthened with more evidence. For example, Theorem 7.1 allows for only two data points. It would be interesting to see a more general version of this theorem.\n\nRemarks:\n-I was wondering about Figure 1c).

Thus, we believe it is instructive to make this assumption for analyzing CNNs.\n\n\nIn Section 8, we use our analysis to understand overparameterized CNNs on a variant of MNIST. We get a good understanding of the inductive bias of GD in this task and why it has very low sample complexity. This is highly non-trivial and we believe this can set the ground to understand how overparamaterized CNNs work in other vision tasks.\n\nWe note that our setting is significantly closer to practice than other published works which consider networks with *one* channel (e.g., Du et al., 2018) or *linear* CNNs (Gunasekar et al., 2018).\n\n\n\n\n###\n\u201cThis is mainly a theory paper, but the theoretical contribution is pretty limited. The theory only considers orthogonal patterns and non-overlapping filters. Theorem 6.1 needs to assume that PSI holds and spurious patterns are unbiased; under these assumptions, the result is pretty straightforward. This paper didn\u2019t prove PSI holds for SGD except in a toy example (two training points).\u201d\n#####\n\n\nAnalyzing the optimization and generalization of gradient methods on overparameterized CNNs is extremely challenging. Even for \u201csimple\u201d' settings (such as ours), the optimization is non-convex and providing a complete analysis of optimization and generalization is not tractable using current mathematical methods. Therefore, expectations regarding what can be achieved with theoretical analysis should be set accordingly.\n\nTo make progress on this challenging task, we provided a proof in a simple setting and corroborated our findings in a large number of experiments. We also note that our VC dimension lower bound is a novel and non-trivial theoretical result.\n\n\n###\nThe lower bound on the VC dimension is only exponential in the filter size. This lower bound is pretty weak since in practice the filter size is usually small (e.g. 3x3).\n#####\n\nWe note that there are cases where filter sizes are larger, e.g., in AlexNet the first layer has convolutions of size 11x11. More importantly, the VC result emphasizes the difference between solutions that gradient descent converges to and overfitting solutions that it in principle *can* converge to. The result shows that a network can have zero training error while only detecting the spurious patterns. This network is vastly different from the network that gradient descent converges to, which mainly detects the discriminative patterns.\n\n\n###\nThe experiment is run on an artificial task based on MNIST images. It would be much more convincing if the experiment is on standard tasks (like 10-class classification in MNIST). Since the theoretical setting is limited, it needs experiments to show how the theory applies to practical tasks.\n#####\n\nAlthough the variant of MNIST we consider is artificial, it does capture real-life data properties, such as different written digit patterns. Understanding what overparameterized CNNs learn in this setting and why they have low sample complexity is highly non-trivial. Using our analysis we provide novel insights that accurately predict the behavior of gradient descent and that better explain why it has low sample complexity. Therefore, we believe that this result is significant. Understanding why overparameterized CNNs generalize on MNIST is a major challenge  and we believe that our work sets the ground for tackling it.\n\nWe hope that we have clarified the novelty of our results and our contribution to the understanding of overparameterized CNNs.

We address your comments below.\n\n###\n\u201cThe novel property mentioned by the authors is one of the first that comes to mind when thinking about the success of ConvNets. It seems very unlikely that this has not been observed before (at least empirically). While obtaining rigorous proofs of properties of NN is hard, one would expect that for the simple setting studied by the authors there would be a simpler explanation for the so-called PSI.\u201d\n#####\n\nWe are not aware of any work which shows the PSI condition and that it implies good sample complexity. We think that it is unfair to say that there should be simple results in our setting without providing any references. As we discuss below, even though our setting may appear \u201csimple\u201d, it is highly non-trivial to analyze.\n\n###\n\u201cThe setting is very specific (one type of architecture, realizability assumption, a single positive pattern and a single negative one).\u201c\n#####\n\nWe agree that our setting is specific, but the difficulty of the problem should be considered and expectations on which settings can be analyzed should be set accordingly.\n\nStudying the generalization of SGD on overparameterized CNNs is extremely challenging. To the best of our knowledge, there is no *single* setting where we have a good understanding of generalization in this case. Indeed, there are major difficulties in this research direction. First, even for \u201csimple\u201d' settings (such as ours), the optimization is non-convex and providing a complete analysis of optimization and generalization is not tractable using current mathematical methods. Second, defining mathematical properties of real-world data (such as images) is very challenging. \n\nTo tackle this problem, we considered a novel setup which both shares features with practical architectures and real-world classification problems and can be analyzed using theoretical and empirical methods. We provide a detailed analysis of overparameterized CNNs in our setting and gain very good understanding of their generalization properties. We further show that we gain very precise insights into the inductive bias of SGD on a variant of MNIST (that contains non-orthogonal patches), which is highly non-trivial and novel.\n\n\nThe distribution we assume captures the idea of inputs with specific patterns and that the pixels are correlated as in real image data. This is in contrast to IID assumptions assumed in many works (such as isotropic Gaussian distributions). Moreover, our architecture assumption is significantly closer to practice than other works which consider networks with *one* channel (e.g., Du et al., 2018) or *linear* CNNs (Gunasekar et al., 2018).\nTherefore, we believe our work is significant and is a valuable contribution to the understanding of learning overparameterized CNNs.\n\n###\n\u201cMy issue with this paper is that it uses rather cumbersome measures (PSI and detection ratios).\u201d\n#####\n\nOur main goal is to understand generalization. Of course, it is better if the measures used to understand generalization are very simple, but we believe that understanding generalization with any reasonable measure is significant. PSI involves algebraic notation of the network but conceptually it is not complicated. It bounds the ratio between the response to spurious pattern detectors and the response of discriminative pattern detectors. When this ratio is small, the network generalizes well (because it has low response to spurious patterns). The bound depends on the statistics of the patterns in the training set (e.g., if a spurious pattern appears roughly equally in both classes, the upper bound is small). Furthermore, in the MNIST experiments we provide an informal and simple definition of PSI and show that it empirically holds. \n\n###\n\u201cThe combination of these factors casts doubts on whether these measures and analysis will be of any use elsewhere.\u201c\n#####\n\nWe disagree. In Section 8, we have shown that our analysis accurately predicts the inductive bias of SGD in a variant of MNIST with non-orthogonal patches. Therefore, we see that the analysis is applicable in other settings. We believe that the ideas in this work can be used to understand even more complex settings.\n\nRegarding other remarks:\n\nWe clarified the proofs and cited the papers you mentioned. Both papers deal with learnability questions of visual patterns distributions. Of course, our distribution is learnable (e.g., by SVM). However, our focus is on learnability using a specific algorithm and architecture: SGD trained on overparameterized CNNs. This is similar to works that study networks in learnable settings (e.g., linear networks on linearly separable data in Gunasekar et al., 2018).\nWe require n<d because we sample n patterns without replacement out of d patterns.\n\nWe hope that we have clarified the novelty of our results and our contribution to the understanding of overparameterized CNNs.

The authors suggest a new property \nof convents where filters have large dot products with patterns occurring in images classified as 1 and small dot products with patterns appearing with images classified as 0. \nIt is assumed that there are two unique patterns whose occurrence in an image determines if the image is classified by 1 or 0. \n\nI like the classification problem studied in the paper and the attempt to understand how ConvNets work from first principles.\u00a0 \n\nMy issue with this paper is that it uses rather cumbersome measures (PSI and detection ratios). The setting is very specific (one type of architecture, realizability assumption, a single positive pattern and a single negative one). \nThe combination of these factors casts doubts on whether these measures and analysis will be of any use elsewhere.\u00a0 The authors claim: \n\n\"Empirically, we identify a novel property of the solutions found by SGD. We observe that the statistics of patterns in the training data govern \nthe magnitude of the dot-product between learned pattern detectors and their detected patterns. Specifically, patterns that appear almost exclusively in one of the classes will have a large dot-product with the channels that detect them. On the other hand,\u00a0patterns that appear roughly equally in both \nclasses, will have a low dot-product with their detecting channels. We formally define this as the \u201cPattern Statistics Inductive Bias\u201d condition (PSI) and \nprovide empirical evidence that PSI holds across a large number of instances. We also prove that SGD indeed satisfies PSI in a simple setup of two points in the training set\" \n\nI find this somewhat unsatisfying. The novel property mentioned by the authors is one of the first that comes to mind when thinking about the success of ConvNets. It seems very \nunlikely that this has not been observed before (at least empirically). While obtaining rigorous proofs of properties of NN is hard, one would expect that for the simple setting studied \nby the authors there would be a simpler explanation for the so-called PSI. \n\nThis paper makes numerous restrictions and assumptions. \nSome examples: \n\n\"a natural model in this context is a 3-layer network with a convolutional layer, followed by ReLU, max pooling and a fully-connected layer.\"\nWhy is this a natural architecture? Has it been studied before or used before? \nAlso in the classification task why is it assumed that n<d? \n\nThere are many more such examples. \n\nThe proof of Theorem 5.1 uses the Sherman-Morrison formula without giving the formula and showing how it is used. \n\nThe survey of related work is very short, not mentioning many relevant works looking into similar pattern recognition problems. \n\nSome examples:\nLearnable and Nonlearnable Visual Concepts (Shvayster, 1990)On learning visual concepts and DNF formulae (Kushilevitz, Roth, 1996)", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1541/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1541/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On the Inductive Bias of a CNN for Distributions with Orthogonal Patterns", "authorids": ["~Alon_Brutzkus1", "~Amir_Globerson1"], "authors": ["Alon Brutzkus", "Amir Globerson"], "keywords": ["Deep learning theory", "generalization", "overparemeterization", "CNN"], "abstract": "Training overparameterized convolutional neural networks with gradient based optimization is the most successful learning method for image classification. However, their generalization properties are far from understood. In this work, we consider a simplified image classification task where images contain orthogonal patches and are learned with a 3-layer overparameterized convolutional network and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We empirically identify a novel phenomenon of SGD in our setting, where the dot-product between the learned pattern detectors and their detected patterns are governed by the pattern statistics in the training set. We call this phenomenon Pattern Statistics Inductive Bias (PSI) and empirically verify it in a large number of instances. We prove that in our setting, if a learning algorithm satisfies PSI then its sample complexity is $O(d^2\\log(d))$ where $d$ is the filter dimension.
