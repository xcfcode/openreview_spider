It is not totally clear from the theory what other alternatives there are (although we're sure they exist!) We see our contribution here as an interesting first step in exploring the problem which we've formalized. From the theoretical perspective we lay out in our revision, however, we think the symmetric difference (and intersection) is well motivated.\n\nFinally, we agree 100% that our baselines would be more interesting if we tried harder to isolate different aspects of our model.

Thank you for your thoughtful feedback.\n\nWe have taken it into as much consideration as possible in our revision.\n\nOur main revision is a formalization of the problem we are trying to solve. We hoped to make clear here that the symmetric difference is not really a learning criterion for semi-supervised clustering. Rather, the error on predicting symmetric difference relates directly to how well the model captures the desired notion of \"containment\" (which we state more formally in paper).\n\nWe are not 100% sure whether this answers your question about the normalization of \\phi, but we provide a formal justification for this, by relating \\phi to a probability distribution, i.e. a point in the probability simplex.\n\nWe agree that a more nuanced look at the classification accuracy (up to permutation)  obtained by the semi-supervised clustering would be helpful. As this wasn't the main focus of our paper, we hope that instead our new experiments argue for the usefulness of the learned representations.\n\nFinally, we do mention a possible real-world application we think our model could apply to during our exposition of the problem.

The approach is built on top of the DeepSets (Zaheer et al., 2017) model, which already is capable of learning representations of multisets, with a new objective of predicting the size of symmetric differences between two multisets, plus a small change in the implementation of the DeepSets model by restricting the per-element module to output a point in the probability simplex.\n\nI liked the background on fuzzy sets and the development of fuzzy multisets and different operations on these multisets.  The definitions and arguments are quite clear and helpful.  One small suggestion for page 4 is that I can understand why the formulation is the only sensible choice for multisets with desired properties, but a claim like this deserves a proper proof.\n\nModel-wise the paper made two contributions for learning representations for multisets as mentioned above: (1) proposed the symmetric difference prediction as a task for learning representations, the argument for this task is that predicting symmetric difference implicitly encourages the model to learn about containment; (2) a slight change in the DeepSets model architecture where the outer rho function is identity and the inner phi function has to output a point in the simplex.\n\nI found these technical contributions to be a bit small.  In addition to this, the paper only presents results on MNIST in a toyish setting, this makes me feel the paper may be more suited for publication in a workshop (idea is interesting, small scale experiments to illustrate the insights, but not complete enough to be published at a conference).\n\nRegarding contribution (1), I can see why predicting symmetric difference makes sense as argued in the paper, but I\u2019m not convinced that this is better than other alternatives.  In order to show that this is a reasonable approach for learning representations, some results that compare this with other possible learning objectives would be necessary.  But I don\u2019t see any such results in this paper.\n\nRegarding contribution (2), I feel the restriction of the phi function to output points in simplex is not very well motivated and confusing in the first read.  Again I can understand why we may want to do this but don\u2019t see why we need to do this.  I\u2019m also concerned that such an architecture may only be good for the task of predicting symmetric difference as it is customized for this task.  Figure 3 shows that an unrestricted model seems to learn better representations despite a worse symmetric difference prediction error, which again confirms the concern.\n\nAnother thing about the experiment setup: the second baseline, labeled \u201cDeepSets\u201d in Table 1 actually changed two things compared to the proposed approach: (1) changing the psi function and (2) also changed the symmetric difference function.  It would be good to isolate the contribution of the two.\n\nOverall I feel this paper is not yet ready to be published at ICLR."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1581/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1581/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Representation Learning with Multisets", "authors": ["Vasco Portilheiro"], "authorids": ["vascop@stanford.edu"], "keywords": ["multisets", "fuzzy sets", "permutation invariant", "representation learning", "containment", "partial order", "clustering"], "TL;DR": "Based on fuzzy set theory, we propose a model that given only the sizes of symmetric differences between pairs of multisets, learns representations of such multisets and their elements.", "abstract": "We study the problem of learning permutation invariant representations that can capture containment relations.

The statement seems not so straightforward, and how it works as the learning criterion for semi-supervised clustering in the experiments. \n\nFor the relaxation used for the normalization of \\phi(a), does this restrict the feasible space of the standard basis vectors? In Section 4.3, authors claimed that in the case of n=3, 98.9% classification accuracy can be obtained by simply picking the maximum valued coordinate of the representation of each object. A systematic comparison in terms of the classification accuracy is important for evaluating the semi-supervised clustering problem. \n\nIn Section 4.2, authors directly model the mean absolute errors in symmetric difference size prediction.
