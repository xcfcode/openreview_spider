In this context of learning to hash, supervised is often used to mean that the model learned from the same dataset that queries are made against, whereas unsupervised is used to mean that the model learned from a different dataset. In our SIFT 1M example, both PQ and HDT-E are trained in an unsupervised way.\n\nWe do indeed use similarity labels, but we make them by discretizing the distances between SIFT vectors into 0's and 1's, which is strictly less information than the exact distances used in training PQ. We assert that discretizing these distances should not be considered applying additional labeled data. We will clarify this in the paper.\n\nWe are currently using HDT on a growing dataset of over 1 million hours of video (>1 petabyte), hashing it at 6 to 16 FPS for over 20 billion hashes with 32-bit hash substrings. Our use case is reverse video lookup. Every hour, we query over 10 million frames of incoming video against this multi-indexed dataset, using a small database instance (6 nodes) on commodity hardware.\n\nOn a per-frame level, we achieved 81% recall and a false positive rate of 10^-10. By considering nearby frames, our recall is somewhat higher, and precision is unmeasurably close to 1.\n\nSince this is a near-neighbor task, high performance is synonymous with low frame-wise false positive rate. This product has seen substantial iteration. Our original implementation using a wavelet embedding had a per-frame recall of 70% and a false positive rate of 9x10^-8. While we could usually filter out false positives by considering nearby frames, returning hundreds of them slowed performance by a factor of roughly 10. When we switched to a hash trained with HDT, this problem dissolved."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Hash Codes via Hamming Distance Targets", "abstract": "We present a powerful new loss function and training scheme for learning binary hash codes with any differentiable model and similarity function.\nOur loss function improves over prior methods by using log likelihood loss on top of an accurate approximation for the probability that two inputs fall within a Hamming distance target.\nOur novel training scheme obtains a good estimate of the true gradient by better sampling inputs and evaluating loss terms between all pairs of inputs in each minibatch.\nTo fully leverage the resulting hashes, we use multi-indexing.\nWe demonstrate that these techniques provide large improvements to a similarity search tasks.\nWe report the best results to date on competitive information retrieval tasks for Imagenet and SIFT 1M, improving recall from 73% to 85% and reducing query cost by a factor of 2-8, respectively.", "keywords": ["information retrieval", "learning to hash", "cbir"], "authorids": ["martin@thehive.ai", "ryan@thehive.ai", "liubowei@gmail.com"], "authors": ["Martin Loncaric", "Ryan Weber", "Bowei Liu"], "TL;DR": "We present a new loss function for training any differentiable model to hash that can vastly improve recall and lookup speed.", "pdf": "/pdf/b555fe273e719db5053dd5740bbe354998e50f1d.pdf", "paperhash": "loncaric|learning_hash_codes_via_hamming_distance_targets", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nloncaric2019learning,\ntitle={Learning Hash Codes via Hamming Distance Targets},\nauthor={Martin Loncaric and Ryan Weber and Bowei Liu},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxNAjC5F7},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper885/Official_Comment", "rdate": null, "ddate": null, "expdate": null, "duedate": null, "tmdate": 1543621621667, "tddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "reply": {"forum": "rJxNAjC5F7", "replyto": null, "readers": {"description": "Select all user groups that should be able to read this comment.", "value-dropdown-hierarchy": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"]}, "signatures": {"description": "", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Authors|ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Area_Chair[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values-copied": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference", "{signatures}"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "required": true}, "comment": {"order": 1, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}", "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).", "required": true}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "noninvitees": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "multiReply": true, "taskCompletionCount": null, "transform": null, "cdate": 1543621621667}}}, {"id": "rkxP4RvF3X", "original": null, "number": 2, "cdate": 1541140014534, "ddate": null, "tcdate": 1541140014534, "tmdate": 1543214276882, "tddate": null, "forum": "rJxNAjC5F7", "replyto": "rJxNAjC5F7", "invitation": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper885/Official_Review", "content": {"title": "Solid idea in the learning to hash area, needs further development", "review": "Summary: This paper contributes to the area of learning to hash. The goal is to take high-dimensional vectors in R^n resulting from an embedding and map them to binary codewords with the goal of similar vectors being mapped to close codewords (in Hamming distance). The authors introduce a loss function for this problem that's based on angles between points on the hypersphere, relying on the intuition that angles corresponds to the number of times needed to cross to the other side of the hypersphere in each coordinate. This is approximately the Hamming distance under a simple quantization scheme. The loss function itself forces similar points together and dissimilar points apart by matching the Hamming distance to the binomial CDF of the angle quantization. They also suggest a batching scheme that enforces the presence of both similar and dissimilar matches. To confirm the utility of this loss function, the authors empirically verify similarity on ImageNet and SIFT.\n\nStrengths: The main idea, to match up angles between points on the hypersphere and Hamming distance is pretty clever. The loss function itself seems generally useful.\n\nWeaknesses: First, I thought the paper was pretty difficult to understand without a lot of background from previous papers. For the most part the authors don't actually state what the input/output/goals are, leaving it implied from the context, which is tough for the reader. The overall organization isn't great. The paper doesn't contain any theory even for simplified or toy cases (which actually seems potentially tractable here); there is only simple intuition. I think that is fine, but then the empirical results should be extensive, and unfortunately they are not. \n\nVerdict: I think this work contains a great main idea and could become quite a good paper in the future, but the work required to illustrate and demonstrate the idea is not fully there yet. \n\n\nComments and Questions:\n\n- Why do you actually need the embedded points y to be on the unit hypersphere? You could compute distances between points at different radii. The results probably shouldn't change much.\n\n- There's at least a few other papers that use a similar idea, for example \nGong et al \"Angular Quantization-based Binary Codes for Fast Similarity Search\" at NIPS 2012. Would be good to discuss the differences.\n\n- The experimental section seems very limited for an empirical paper. There's at least a few confusing details, noted below:\n\n- The experimental results for ImageNet comparing against other models are directly taken from those reported by Lu et al. That's fine, but it does mean that it's hard to make comparisons against *any* other paper than the Lu paper. For example, if the selected ImageNet classes are different, then the results of the comparison may well be different. I checked the HashNet paper (Cao et al. 2017), and it papers that their own reported numbers for ImageNet are better than those of the Lu et al paper. That is, I see 0.5059 0.6306 0.6835 for 16/32/64 bit codewords vs Lu's result of 0.442 0.606 0.684, which is quoted in this paper. What's causing this difference? It would probably be a bit less convenient but ultimately better if the results for comparison were reproduced by the authors, and possibly on a different class split compared to the single Lu paper.\n\n- The comparison against PQ should also consider more recent works of the same flavor as PQ, which themselves outperform PQ. For example, \"Cartesian k-means\" by Norouzi and Fleet, or \"Approximate search with quantized sparse representations\" by Jain et al. These papers also use the SIFT dataset for their experimental result, so it would be great to compare against them.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Hash Codes via Hamming Distance Targets", "abstract": "We present a powerful new loss function and training scheme for learning binary hash codes with any differentiable model and similarity function.\nOur loss function improves over prior methods by using log likelihood loss on top of an accurate approximation for the probability that two inputs fall within a Hamming distance target.\nOur novel training scheme obtains a good estimate of the true gradient by better sampling inputs and evaluating loss terms between all pairs of inputs in each minibatch.\nTo fully leverage the resulting hashes, we use multi-indexing.\nWe demonstrate that these techniques provide large improvements to a similarity search tasks.\nWe report the best results to date on competitive information retrieval tasks for Imagenet and SIFT 1M, improving recall from 73% to 85% and reducing query cost by a factor of 2-8, respectively.", "keywords": ["information retrieval", "learning to hash", "cbir"], "authorids": ["martin@thehive.ai", "ryan@thehive.ai", "liubowei@gmail.com"], "authors": ["Martin Loncaric", "Ryan Weber", "Bowei Liu"], "TL;DR": "We present a new loss function for training any differentiable model to hash that can vastly improve recall and lookup speed.", "pdf": "/pdf/b555fe273e719db5053dd5740bbe354998e50f1d.pdf", "paperhash": "loncaric|learning_hash_codes_via_hamming_distance_targets", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nloncaric2019learning,\ntitle={Learning Hash Codes via Hamming Distance Targets},\nauthor={Martin Loncaric and Ryan Weber and Bowei Liu},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxNAjC5F7},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper885/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234354822, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "rJxNAjC5F7", "replyto": "rJxNAjC5F7", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335825309, "tmdate": 1552335825309, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}, {"id": "Hyl1p4zYRX", "original": null, "number": 9, "cdate": 1543214263043, "ddate": null, "tcdate": 1543214263043, "tmdate": 1543214263043, "tddate": null, "forum": "rJxNAjC5F7", "replyto": "H1ljGMwA3Q", "invitation": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper885/Official_Comment", "content": {"title": "Response to Author's Questions", "comment": "I appreciate the authors' response.

We have used HDT in production systems with datasets of over 10 Billion rows and achieved average retrieval times of <2ms, so it is quite practical. We can clear up most of your concerns easily:\n\n1. The comparison against PQ is fair because both are provided only the \"train\" set from the SIFT1M dataset; neither receives the query samples. As described in section 3.2, we defined similarity within the train set by each elements 10 nearest neighbors in the train set, but this is not additional information.\n\nPQ also \"learns\" a codebook, relying on the assumption that training and testing datasets will be similar. There may be cases where it better handles novel data points, but HDT performed much better on a common benchmark nonetheless.\n\n2. As mentioned, we have used HDT with datasets of over 10 Billion rows and achieved average retrieval times of <2ms. Expected memory usage for kNN is simply O(k) by streaming through query results. Expected space to store the indexed dataset is O((r+1)Nn), where r is the Hamming radius and n is the number of bits per hash. Since r is practically no more than ~5, and hash bit size is small, this is not much of a concern.\n\n3. We plot different values of \\lambda in Figure 4 to demonstrate how the recall/performance tradeoff varies, so that should address part of your question. p_0 is simply chosen such to extrapolate values of likelihood less that 10^{-100}. As \\lambda_w is simply a regularization term, we did think it warranted an entire table or plot to compare.\n\nHow would you recommend comparing against \u201cBillion-scale similarity search with GPUs\u201d?

We can clear up most of your concerns easily:\n* Unfortunately different benchmarks in this field use different optimization criteria, so out of input/output/goals, only output can be clearly defined (and we define it to be a binary hash code). A given problem may choose any specific input, such an image, audio clip, or vector. The goals vary wildly, and our benchmarks used MAP and recall vs. query cost. We will work to make this clearer in the final draft.\n* The datasets we compare against are common choices, and we believe they are sufficient (and our % improvements large enough) for the results to be clear.\n\n- Good question. The advantage of comparing the angle between points (rather than Euclidean distance) is that we are able to build a good statistical approximation of the conditional distribution of Hamming distances. Any such model must assume some distribution for the embedding. We believe a uniform distribution on the hypersphere is most natural, since the binarized hash codes depend only on the direction of the embedding point, not its magnitude.\n- While Gong et al. also work with a hypersphere, their approach is very different, choosing a projection that optimizes binarization loss, rather than log likelihood of falling within a desired Hamming distance, which we argue better represents the true optimization goal. We will mention them in our final version.\n- \n- A public commenter already mentioned this, so please refer to that chain. Cao et al. updated those figures later, after Lu et al. published their paper. We will include the updated figures in our final version. Lu et al.'s results simply compare against Cao et al.'s reported results. Both papers use the same subsets of ImageNet and are directly comparable.

The basic idea is motivated by the intuition: given points z_i and z_j on the hypersphere, the angle between the two points is arccos(z_i \\dot z_j), while the probability that a random bit differs between them is arccos(z_i \\dot z_j)/\\pi. This leads to a nice formulation of learning Hamming Distance Target (HDT), although the optimization procedure requires every input has a similar neighbor in the batch.\n\nThe minor issue of this paper is that the writing should be polished. There are numerous typos in paper citing (e.g., Norouzi et al in the 3rd page is missing the reference; Figure 3.2 in the 7th page should be Figure 3; and a number of small typos). But I believe these issues could be fixed easily.\n\nThe major issue is how we should evaluate a learning to hash paper with nice intuition but not convincing results. Below are my concerns of the proposed approach.\n\n1. Learning to hash (including the HDT in this paper) and product quantization (PQ) are not based on the same scenario,  so it is unfair to claim hashing method outperforms PQ.\n\nMost learning to hash methods requires two things in the following:\na) the query samples\nb) similar/dissimilar samples (or we can call them neighbors and non-neighbor) to the query\n\nPQ does not require a) and b). As a result, in PQ based systems, a query can be compared with codewords using Euclidean distance, without mapping to a hash code. This is important especially for novel queries, because if the system does not see similar samples during training, it will probably fail to map such samples to good hash codes. \n\nSuch advantage of PQ (or other related quantization methods) is important for real-world systems, however, not obvious in a controlled experiment setting. As shown in the paper, HDT assumes the queries will be similar in the training and testing stages, and benefits from this restricted setting. But I believe such assumption may not hold in real systems. \n\n2. It is not clear to me that how scalable the proposed method is.\n\nI hope section 1.2 can give analysis on both **space** and time complexity of Algorithm 2. It will be more intuitive to show how many ms it will take to search a billion scale dataset. Currently I am not convinced how scalable the proposed algorithm is. \n\n3. Implementation details\nIn page 5, it is not clear how the hyper parameters \\lamda, \\lamda_w and p_0 are selected and how sensitive the performance is.

As mentioned, we are working on adding more datasets.\n\nThank you"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Hash Codes via Hamming Distance Targets", "abstract": "We present a powerful new loss function and training scheme for learning binary hash codes with any differentiable model and similarity function.\nOur loss function improves over prior methods by using log likelihood loss on top of an accurate approximation for the probability that two inputs fall within a Hamming distance target.\nOur novel training scheme obtains a good estimate of the true gradient by better sampling inputs and evaluating loss terms between all pairs of inputs in each minibatch.\nTo fully leverage the resulting hashes, we use multi-indexing.\nWe demonstrate that these techniques provide large improvements to a similarity search tasks.\nWe report the best results to date on competitive information retrieval tasks for Imagenet and SIFT 1M, improving recall from 73% to 85% and reducing query cost by a factor of 2-8, respectively.", "keywords": ["information retrieval", "learning to hash", "cbir"], "authorids": ["martin@thehive.ai", "ryan@thehive.ai", "liubowei@gmail.com"], "authors": ["Martin Loncaric", "Ryan Weber", "Bowei Liu"], "TL;DR": "We present a new loss function for training any differentiable model to hash that can vastly improve recall and lookup speed.", "pdf": "/pdf/b555fe273e719db5053dd5740bbe354998e50f1d.pdf", "paperhash": "loncaric|learning_hash_codes_via_hamming_distance_targets", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nloncaric2019learning,\ntitle={Learning Hash Codes via Hamming Distance Targets},\nauthor={Martin Loncaric and Ryan Weber and Bowei Liu},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxNAjC5F7},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper885/Official_Comment", "rdate": null, "ddate": null, "expdate": null, "duedate": null, "tmdate": 1543621621667, "tddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "reply": {"forum": "rJxNAjC5F7", "replyto": null, "readers": {"description": "Select all user groups that should be able to read this comment.", "value-dropdown-hierarchy": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"]}, "signatures": {"description": "", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Authors|ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Area_Chair[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values-copied": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference", "{signatures}"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "required": true}, "comment": {"order": 1, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}", "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).", "required": true}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper885/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "noninvitees": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "multiReply": true, "taskCompletionCount": null, "transform": null, "cdate": 1543621621667}}}, {"id": "rJgytH0atQ", "original": null, "number": 1, "cdate": 1538282871303, "ddate": null, "tcdate": 1538282871303, "tmdate": 1538282907563, "tddate": null, "forum": "rJxNAjC5F7", "replyto": "rJxNAjC5F7", "invitation": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper885/Public_Comment", "content": {"comment": "Dear authors, I have some concerns for the ImageNet-100 results in your paper:\n\n(1)  Results from other methods such as the popular HashNet are not the same as reported in the original paper (for example 16 bits mAP@1000)\n\n(2) HashNet model use pretrained AlexNet whereas your model use pretrained ResNet 50.
