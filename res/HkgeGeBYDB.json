I updated my score to Weak Accept (6). \n\n####################\n\nThis paper considers deep autoencoders (AEs) for the unsupervised novelty/anomaly detection task and proposes to extend the standard AE anomaly score, given by the reconstruction error between the input and output in the original data space, to also utilize the reconstruction errors of the hidden activations in the AE network. The proposed method, Reconstruction along Projection Pathway (RaPP), specifically compares the hidden activations of all encoder layers given by the original input $x$ with the activations of the same units given by feeding the reconstruction $\\hat{x}$ back into the AE. Thus RaPP compares the activation statistics of the original input $x$ and its reconstruction $\\hat{x}$ along the encoder projection pathway from original data space to latent code space. Two ways for aggregating those reconstruction errors to a final anomaly score are presented: (1) Simple Aggregation Along Pathway (SAP) which simply computes the sum of reconstruction errors, and (2) Normalized Aggregation Along Pathway (NAP) which computes the sum of reconstruction errors after normalization via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The paper conclusively presents experiments on eight datasets from various domains, in which SAP and NAP are compared to the reconstruction error baseline for vanilla AE, VAE, and AAE, as well as experiments on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST in which NAP is compared to state-of-the-art deep anomaly detectors.\n\nThough this work is well presented and indicates promising results, I think the paper should not yet be accepted due to the following main reasons: \n(i) The experimental evaluation indicates promising, but not yet convincing results; \n(ii) The computational complexity of NAP seems to be a major limitation of RaPP which is not addressed in the text; \n(iii) The added value/insights from the theoretical Section 4 (Motivation of RaPP) are not clear.\n\n(i) I think the experimental section shows promising, but not yet convincing results. To judge the significance of results, I think the paper should address the following:\n(ia) The experiments on the eight non-image datasets should include other baselines (e.g. OC-SVM, Isolation Forest) besides the standard AE reconstruction error. One should expect SAP and NAP to improve over the standard AE since both methods include the original data space reconstruction errors as well. Moreover, the advantage of deep approaches on such non-image datasets is less clear [7] why a comparison to well-known baselines should be given.\n(ib) The main motivation for deep approaches to anomaly detection are large and complex datasets [6, 5, 4, 2]. I think the comparison to recent, state-of-the-art deep competitors should at least include another dataset more complex than MNIST or Fashion-MNIST, e.g. CIFAR-10 as reported in the previous works or MVTec [1]. \n(ic) I think the proposed method begs for an ablation study of subsequently adding the reconstruction errors of additional layers. This would clearly demonstrate the potential benefits of adding the hidden reconstructions.\n\n(ii) The experiments indicate that a proper normalization of the hidden activation reconstruction errors is crucial for improving detection performance. NAP shows consistent improvements, whereas SAP often performs similar to the AE baseline. However, the current SVD normalization procedure on a matrix with dimensions number of samples \u00d7 number of hidden encoder units seems extremely costly to me and appears to be a major limitation towards larger datasets or networks. Could you comment on this since this is not yet addressed in the manuscript. Have you tried using Batch Normalization (after activation) together with per-layer averaging? To me, this seems the natural first choice to normalize unit scores and to account for different layer widths. Do you apply SVD on mini-batches?\n\n(iii) The additional insights from the theoretical Section 4 are not clear to me. I think the presented reconstruction property for the hidden layers follows somewhat directly per definition for symmetrically constructed deep autoencoders (specifically if weights would be shared in addition). For a theoretical contribution, on the other hand, the proof and proposition should be fully rigorous in my mind, i.e. stating all the necessary assumptions on the function class (e.g. you implicitly assume invertibility and thus some smoothness of the $g_i$'s which Conv+ReLU modules do not satisfy for instance). As of now, I think this section does not add to intuition, but on the other hand is not completely rigorous. Maybe I am missing something?\n\nThe overall presentation of the paper is good (clear writing and structure, polished Figures and Tables). The work is well motivated and properly placed in the literature. Maybe since the approach is rather simple (which I don\u2019t find negative), the author felt the need to add some rigor to the paper, which I think would not be necessary for a significant contribution if the experimental results hold up against the additional baselines and more complex datasets as described in (i).\n\n\n####################\n*Additional Feedback*\n\n*Positive Highlights*\n1. Simple idea that does not require autoencoder modification or retraining that indicates improved anomaly detection results.\n2. The work is well placed in the literature. The related work includes all relevant and recent major works on the subject matter.\n3. I appreciate the evaluation on both anomaly/novelty detection setups, unimodal and multimodal.\n4. Comparison to recent OC-NN [3], GPND [5], Deep SVDD [6], and GT [4].\n5. The writing, structure and overall presentation is good.\n\n*Ideas for Improvement*\n6. Include additional baselines and more complex datasets as described in (i).\n7. Address the computational complexity of RaPP as in described in (ii).\n8. Maybe cut the methodical/theoretical parts in Section 3.2 and Section 4 a bit. I think they are rather straightforward. Maybe combine Figures 1+2 as well. Extend the experimental evaluation instead.\n9. Report the AUROC standard deviations over the trials as well to better infer statistical significance of the results (defer to appendix if space is a constraint).\n\n*Minor comments*\n10.

In order to make evaluations of the existing methods on the datasets used in Table 1, the following architectural modifications were made for the models in the recent approaches: (1) CNN components were removed and replaced by fully connected (FC) layers. (2) Number of layers and bottleneck size were modified to match that of AE, VAE, AAE in Table 2\n\nThe modifications were necessary for the following reasons. First, numeric data has no explicit relation between its features while CNN explicitly utilizes the grid structure of pixels in an image. As such, CNN architecture does not naturally extend to 1D numeric data (not 2D image data). Second, to make the comparison as close as possible, we keep the same number of layers and bottleneck size. Below is the result of the evaluations. We used the same settings for the training as in the cases shown in Table 2. Due to the shortage of time, the evaluation was done only for OCNN and DSVDD in uni- and multi- modal normality cases. GT was excluded since it relies on image-specific data transformations like rotation and flipping.\n\n**Result**\n+---------+------------+-----------+----------+-----------+----------+\n| Dataset |    Type    | OCNN MEAN | OCNN STD | DSVDD MEAN | DSVDD STD |\n+---------+------------+-----------+----------+-----------+----------+\n| STL     | Multimodal |     0.755 |    0.146 |     0.518 |    0.162 |\n| OTTO    | Multimodal |     0.496 |    0.149 |     0.552 |    0.101 |\n| SNSR    | Multimodal |     0.487 |    0.029 |      0.49 |    0.048 |\n|         |            |           |          |           |          |\n| MI-F    | Unimodal   |     0.358 |    0.107 |     0.523 |    0.103 |\n| MI-V    | Unimodal   |      0.43 |    0.061 |      0.46 |    0.042 |\n| EOPT    | Unimodal   |      0.53 |    0.014 |         - |        - |\n| NASA    | Unimodal   |     0.526 |    0.043 |     0.549 |    0.062 |\n| RARM    | Unimodal   |      0.43 |    0.116 |     0.604 |    0.048 |\n| STL     | Unimodal   |     0.467 |    0.094 |     0.566 |    0.124 |\n| OTTO    | Unimodal   |     0.572 |    0.139 |     0.663 |     0.03 |\n| SNSR    | Unimodal   |     0.578 |    0.069 |     0.586 |    0.058 |\n+---------+------------+-----------+----------+-----------+----------+\n(The experiment for DSVDD on EOPT is still on-going)\n\nThe result shows AUROC is in general lower than that of AE, VAE and AAE with the reconstruction error. The only exception is OCNN on STL in multimodal normality case where AUROC reaches 0.755. In all cases, AUROC is lower than the highest AUROC among AE, VAE, and AAE results. \n\nWe\u2019d like to point out that more study is needed to make the comparison rigorous. In this regard, it would be interesting to see how CNN-based models could extend to incorporate 1D numeric data (e.g., sensors or time-series data). We are currently looking into the possibility of extending RaPP to CNN-based models, which will allow the evaluations of RaPP on more complex image datasets such as CIFAR-10, MVTec and so on. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2160/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2160/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["khkim@makinarocks.ai", "sangwoo@makinarocks.ai", "yongsub@makinarocks.ai", "jongseob.jeon@makinarocks.ai", "jeongwoo@makinarocks.ai", "kbc8894@makinarocks.ai", "andre@makinarocks.ai"], "title": "RaPP: Novelty Detection with Reconstruction along Projection Pathway", "authors": ["Ki Hyun Kim", "Sangwoo Shim", "Yongsub Lim", "Jongseob Jeon", "Jeongwoo Choi", "Byungchan Kim", "Andre S.

In general, performance tends to get higher as more layers are used.\n\n\n[Cost of SVD]\n\nWe conducted experiments to evaluate the scalability of SVD with Pytorch implementation and Facebook\u2019s implementation of a fast randomized algorithm (fcpca) [2]. Note that PyTorch SVD [3] partially utilizes GPU, but fcpca only runs on CPU.\n\n** Setup **\nThe experiments were carried out for MNIST, SNSR, and OTTO which have a large number of samples and high dimensionality as can be seen in Table 1. Since the time complexity of SVD is linear in the number of data samples (because n_samples > data_dim in most of the cases), we mainly tested the performance of SVD across the various depth and bottleneck sizes of networks, which is directly related to the number of columns of the matrix fed to SVD.\n\n** Result **\nWe observed that Pytorch SVD (used in our paper) is faster than fbpca, and takes much shorter than autoencoder training time. In our result, Pytorch SVD and fbpca are at least 47x and 6.5x faster than training an autoencoder, respectively.\nWe will add the result in the following revision.\n\n** Conclusion **\nThe impact of the SVD computation (required only at a training phase) in NAP is relatively small compared to training an autoencoder in practical setups.\n\n[1] Halko, N. and Martinsson, P.

Since AUROC is invariant in expectation regardless of the proportion of novelty samples, we took the maximum proportion of 50% used in [4].\n\n[4] Stanislav Pidhorskyi, Ranya Almohsen, and Gianfranco Doretto.

With the baseline models, for some datasets best AUROC performance is altered, i.e., baseline models show higher AUROC performance. We\u2019d like to point out, however, that there is room for improvement for the NAP result since hyperparameter tuning (e.g., depth of deep architecture, size of bottleneck, training epochs and etc) was not performed while the baseline models used tuned hyperparameters as provided in the DSVDD paper [1]. The evaluation of the baselines for SNSR, MNIST, and F-MNIST are still on-going.

For the preprocessing of the dataset, the following procedures were applied. First, each image is grayscaled and the resolution was lowered. Second, the image was segmented to $32\\times32$ patches. \nWe used VAE with 8 layers for each fully-connected encoder and fully-connected decoder, and trained 200 epochs.

Yet it is noted that the overall performance is still lower than the quoted performance in the cited paper [1] except Leather and Tile. In order to make an apple-to-apple comparison, more work is needed to include 1) Incorporating with CNN architecture and 2) Data Augmentation, which is missing in our evaluation. In our evaluation, the resolution was intentionally lowered due to the shortage of time for the evaluation, but this should also be recovered as well to make a fair comparison. We are currently looking into the possibility of extending RaPP to CNN-based models, which will allow rigorous comparisons of RaPP approach with the other existing approaches on more complex image datasets such as CIFAR-10, MVTec and so on. \n\n[1] P.

Thank you for pointing this out. If we let the covariance matrix be $S$, in our terminology, $S = \\overline{D}^T\\overline{D} = V\\Sigma \\Sigma V^T$. \nTherefore, the mahalanobis distance $(d - \\mu)^T S^{-1} (d - \\mu) = (d - \\mu)^T V\\Sigma^{-1} \\Sigma^{-1}V^T (d - \\mu) = ||\\overline{d}^T V\\Sigma^{-1}||_2^{2}$, which is the same as $S_{NAP}$.\n\nThere was a typo in the manuscript ($d$ must be $\\overline{d}$), and we will fix it in our revision. Since our code was correctly written, the numbers in the current manuscript were obtained with the corrected expression above.\n\n\n[About VAE inference]\n\u200b\nAs you pointed out, we carried out experiments with the mean component (\u2018mu\u2019) given by the encoder during the inference phase and found the results are still consistent within the quoted standard deviation (and potentially better.) We also found that we included the results with K = 1 (K: number of latent samples for reparameterization trick) in the paper instead of K = 10. Thus, we additionally carried out experiments with K = 10, as originally intended, and found the results are also within the quoted standard deviation. See the table below. Evaluations were repeated 5 times to estimate the mean and standard deviation.

However, since SVD computation is required only at a training phase in RaPP, we are more flexible in utilizing computational resources. To be more efficient, we can also employ probabilistic approximation algorithms [1]. \nWe will add an explanation about this in our revised paper. Also, we are carrying out experiments to check computational advantage of [1] with the implementation provided in [2], and we will share the results in the next reply.\n\n[1] Halko, N. and Martinsson, P. G. and Tropp, J. A. \u201cFinding Structure with Randomness: Probabilistic Algorithms for Constructing Approximate Matrix Decompositions.\u201d SIAM Rev., 53(2), 217\u2013288, 2011\n[2] https://fbpca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\n\n[(iii) Revision of Section 4]\n\u200b\nWe would like to clarify the motivation in Section 4.\n\n** Background **\nLet us consider a symmetric autoencoder $A$. In general, its pair of the corresponding encoding and decoding layers is not guaranteed to express the same space: an obvious example is permuted dimensions. This is because training $A$ does not care about activations from intermediate hidden layers. As a result, directly comparing $g_{:i}(x)$ and $f_{\\ell:i+1}(g(x))$ does not make sense, except for $i=0$ with which the comparison becomes the same as computing ordinary reconstruction error. This makes the concept of \u201chidden reconstruction\u201d not defined as done with $A$ for the ordinary reconstruction, though it sounds reasonable.\n\n** What we showed  **\nNevertheless, we show that activation vectors in an encoding hidden layer obtained by feeding the original input $x$ and its reconstruction $\\hat{x}=A(x)$ to the same network $A$ have the relation of input and reconstruction for the corresponding hidden space. That is, $g_{:i}(A(x))$ is equivalent to a reconstruction for $g_{:i}(x)$ in the $i$-th hidden space of $A$.\n\n** Assumption **\nFor the conclusion above, we only assumed that given a trained autoencoder $A$, $x = A(x)$ for $x\\in M_0$ where $M_0$ is a low dimensional manifold in the paper. With this assumption, $g$ restricted on $M_0$ and $f$ restricted on $M_\\ell$ must become one-to-one functions. Here, we note that we did not make the statement on training data but on the manifold $M_0$ that the trained autoencoder describes.\n\nIn Section 4, we tried to provide what quantity $\\hat{h}_i(x)=g_{:i}(A(x))$ means or why it is meaningful in connection to the well-known reconstruction concept.\nReviewing Section 4 by ourselves, we think readers can be confused about the point. We will make it clearer in our revision.\n\u200b\n\n[Reporting standard deviations]\n\u200b\nWe will add the result in the appendix of our revised paper.\n\u200b\n\n[About other feedbacks]\n\u200b\nWe are now working on a revision and will include your feedback. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2160/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2160/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["khkim@makinarocks.ai", "sangwoo@makinarocks.ai", "yongsub@makinarocks.ai", "jongseob.jeon@makinarocks.ai", "jeongwoo@makinarocks.ai", "kbc8894@makinarocks.ai", "andre@makinarocks.ai"], "title": "RaPP: Novelty Detection with Reconstruction along Projection Pathway", "authors": ["Ki Hyun Kim", "Sangwoo Shim", "Yongsub Lim", "Jongseob Jeon", "Jeongwoo Choi", "Byungchan Kim", "Andre S.
