If we define the perturbation set in PGD to be S, then in general S can be union of perturbation set of several L_p norm, and the resulting algorithm will be MSD (everytime you do a gradient update and then find the worst case projection in S). It would be interesting to study the convergence of this kind of algorithms, since S is no longer convex, the projection is trickier to define. Unfortunately this is not discussed in the paper. \n\nIn terms of experiments, this is an interesting data point to show that we can have a model that is (weakly) robust to L1, L2 and Linf norms simultaneously. However, the results are not surprising since there's more than 10% performance decreases compared to the original adversarial training under each particular attack. So it's still not clear whether we can get a model that simultaneously achieves L1, L2, Linf robust error comparable to original PGD training. \n\n[Performance] \n- It seems MSD is not always better than others (worst PGD and PGD Aug). For MNIST, MSD performs poorly on Linf norm and it's not clear why.\n- There's significant performance drop in clean accuracy, especially MSD on MNIST data. \n\n[Suggestions]\n- As mentioned before, studying the convergence properties of the proposed methods will be interesting. \n- It will be interesting if you can train on a set of perturbation models and make it also robust to another perturbation not in the training phase. For instance, can we apply the proposed method to L{1,inf} in training and generalize to L2 perturbation? \n\n=====\nThanks for the response. I still have concerns about novelty so would like to keep my rating unchanged. \n\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1944/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1944/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["pratyush.maini@gmail.com", "ericwong@cs.cmu.edu", "zkolter@cs.cmu.edu"], "title": "Adversarial Robustness Against the Union of Multiple Perturbation Models", "authors": ["Pratyush Maini", "Eric Wong", "Zico Kolter"], "pdf": "/pdf/cf2808a44fdfabec066720081b9e3e428c42140d.pdf", "TL;DR": "We develop a generalization of the standard PGD-based procedure to train architectures which are robust against multiple perturbation models, outperforming past approaches on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets.", "abstract": "Owing to the susceptibility of deep learning systems to adversarial attacks, there has been a great deal of work in developing (both empirically and certifiably) robust classifiers, but the vast majority has defended against single types of attacks.

These changes reflect nearly all of the constructive suggestions that we have received from the reviewers. \n\nOf course, we are aware that there seems to be a fundamental disagreement over the importance of evaluating an adversarial defense outside of its threat model, which we discussed in a longer, earlier comment. Despite this being a completely non-standard metric for evaluating adversarial defenses throughout the literature, we have gone ahead and incorporated all of the suggestions for adding these experiments into the updated paper. Note that all of the relevant work that we compare to does *not* do any evaluation of this sort, so it is rather unprecedented for this to suddenly become a necessary requirement. \n\n\nSummary of changes: \n\n+ We have added a substantial discussion on the different risk tradeoffs between threat models that the various algorithms obtain, as requested by Reviewer 2. In summary, the simpler generalizations result in unclear tradeoffs, while MSD consistently minimizes worst-case performance over the union. This was added to the last paragraph of Section 5. \n\n+ We have updated Figures 2 and 3 to allow for the more systemic comparison to baseline defenses by merging them with the corresponding figures in the Appendix, as requested by Reviewer 2. \n\n+ We have added the experiment requested by Reviewer 3, where we show model performance on CIFAR-10-C. This is in Appendix E, and reflects the additional discussion we've had with Reviewer 3 on OpenReview. \n\n+ We have adjusted the text to make it clear that Schott et al. use the fact that the L-infinity defense overfits to L-infinity perturbations as motivation for their paper, to avoid the misunderstanding that Reviewer 3 brought up. \n\n+ We have added the experiment requested by Reviewer 1, where we train on Linfinity and L1, while evaluating on L2. This is in Appendix E, and reflects the additional discussion we've had with Reviewer 1 on OpenReview. \n\nLastly, we remind our reviewers that we have already stuck to a very high standard for an extensive adversarial evaluation within the threat model, following best practices in the field and using a wide variety of gradient and non-gradient based attacks, which is among the most comprehensive evaluations present in the literature.

Of course, this is by no means a central point of the paper, and we merely wished to contextualize the result with relevant research on the same topic. We are quite willing to adjust the wording (e.g. the referenced phrasing with respect to overfitting and universal robustness). \n\nOn the motivation and significance of MSD: \nWhile it is correct that the straightforward baselines work, they only work to some degree and are suboptimal when measuring their performance *with respect to the robust performance metric at which they attempt to minimize*, namely the robust optimization objective which is the performance against the union of threat models. On both MNIST and CIFAR10, we see a substantial increase in robust performance (5% and 6% respectively) on the union threat model from MSD over the baselines. This shows that the baselines, while they work to some extent, make various implicit tradeoffs that don\u2019t actually minimize the robust objective that they are trying to minimize, and so MSD is a more direct, explicit way of minimizing the robust loss over the union adversary. The baselines themselves are also not consistent across the datasets: PGD-Aug performs poorly on MNIST, while PGD-Worst performs poorly on CIFAR10, whereas MSD is consistent across both problems. \n\nIt is unfortunate that you think the approach is deficient in creativity and generality. Rather, we believe that the simplicity of the method adds to its strength, showing that even simple approaches can perform quite well without resorting to complex procedures. MSD is also general in that it can utilize any first-order iterative method for adversarial generation, and is not an image-specific defense (it is at least as generally applicable as the standard adversarial training approach for a single threat model). \n\nOn generalizing to unforeseen corruptions: \nDefending against attacks outside of the threat model has never been a goal of adversarial training, and has little theoretical justification for why this would be the case. As such, performance comparisons on out-of-threat-model attacks like CIFAR-10-C, while potentially interesting, are completely orthogonal to the point of the paper. See our general comment here for a more detailed discussion: https://openreview.net/forum?id=rklMnyBtPB&noteId=rJgRBxZ-iB\n\nHowever, despite this, since CIFAR-10-C isn\u2019t too expensive to evaluate, we ran this anyways just to see what happens and got the following mean accuracies: \n\nStandard model: 66.52%\nPGD-Worst: 70.8%\nPGD-Aug: 76.84%\nMSD: 74.22%\n\nSo indeed, all of the approaches appear to improve model performance on CIFAR-10-C in comparison to standard training to some degree. However, because none of the models were explicitly trained to minimize these sorts of corruptions, we refrain from making any further conclusions. \n\nOn the budgets chosen for L1 and L2: \nThe chosen budgets all come from the literature. For MNIST, we chose the same budget as that used in \u201cTowards the First Adversarially Robust Neural Network Model on MNIST\u201d [Schott et al. 2019] in order to be directly comparable and most fair in the comparison. For CIFAR10 budgets comes from \u201cTowards Evaluating the Robustness of Neural Networks\u201d [Carlini & Wagner 2017], though we used a smaller L1 budget to account for the difference from L0 to L1 and to not entirely subsume the other threat models.

We do in fact have the accuracies as a function of radius for PGD-aug and PGD-worst (we had put them in the appendix as Figures 4-7 for lack of space), but we can certainly combine them into a single plot for MNIST and CIFAR10. \n\nAs for the baselines at robust-ml.org, since the setting we study is the union of multiple threat models, we focus on baselines which also study defending against multiple threat models. To our knowledge, the only baseline on robust-ml.org which does this is the ABS model by Schott et al., which we explicitly compare to in our paper. \n\nOn comparing the performances against individual attacks and the corresponding risk tradeoffs: \nThe main point is that while comparing individual threat models leads to an unclear conclusion about risk tradeoffs as you pointed out, the conclusion for the reader is quite clear when measuring performance in the \u201call attacks\u201d mode.

Namely, 1) the performance of the model on individual threat models (subsets of the considered threat region), and 2) the ability of the model to generalize beyond the threat model it was trained on. We discuss these points in this comment, but at a high level, the main message is that the most natural metric to use for evaluating the various algorithms is the *robust objective being minimized*, which MSD does best. All other metrics (individual threat models or attacks outside the threat model) are simply not what any of these algorithms are trying to minimize. We will adjust the text to make this clear. \n\n1) On the performance for individual threat models: \nAs you likely are well aware, there is very rarely free lunch in adversarial robustness: at some point, tradeoffs between various metrics (e.g. standard vs robust accuracy, or robust performance against different threat models) become inevitable. As pointed out, the other training procedures (Worst PGD and PGD Aug) do achieve different trade-offs between the various threat models, and for specific individual threat models, can achieve better performance on those specific threat models. \n\nHowever, the tradeoffs that these methods achieve are suboptimal when measuring performance against the *union* of multiple threat models, which is the goal of this paper (and importantly, also the mathematical objective for the robust optimization problem). By no means do we claim MSD to have, for example, the best performance on L-infinity robustness for MNIST. An adversarial attack on the union of threat models is successful if it succeeds within *any* of the threat models. This is the objective that all the methods (MSD, Worst PGD, PGD Aug) attempt to minimize, and this is where we see the advantage of MSD: it is able to achieve the best performance when the union of threat models is taken as a whole. \n\nThe takeaway here is that yes, there are indeed different tradeoffs obtained by the various methods, however, MSD is most effective at finding the tradeoff that maximizes the goal of robust performance to the union of perturbation sets, which is directly the robust optimization objective and thus the most natural metric. On the other hand, the alternatives (Worst PGD and PGD Aug) find some suboptimal tradeoff that doesn\u2019t quite maximize the robust optimization objective for the union of multiple sets, despite being seemingly obvious ways to do so. \n\nWe do not claim to achieve top performance on individual threat models or standard accuracy (neither of which is directly the goal of the robust optimization problem for the union threat model), and so while it would be nice if this were the case, it is certainly not expected and may not even be possible. To give an analogous example, when studying threat models for a single norm, we do not carve up the threat model into subsets and compare performance within the various subsets (at least, not beyond plotting robustness curves for different radii, which we do in this paper). \n\nIf it is still insisted that we compare the individual threat models: as Reviewer 2 discussed, it becomes unclear how to evaluate the various tradeoffs. On the other hand, the robust optimization objective, or the performance against the union of threat models, is directly the goal of all these algorithms and leaves the reader with a clear interpretation: it measures the performance of the model when a failure under any threat model constitutes an overall failure, which MSD is able to do best. \n\n2) On the ability of the defense to generalize beyond the threat model: \nBeing able to generalize beyond the threat model on which a model has been trained has never been a goal of adversarial training. In most cases, there is little to no principled reason for why we would believe this to occur, and empirically the answer in the adversarial examples literature tends to be that it does not. Generalizing beyond the threat model used in training is completely orthogonal and not at all a goal of this paper, let alone a goal of adversarial training. \n\nRather, the goal of this paper is to present a structured way in which the threat model can be expanded *during* training, as this is the only scenario in which we would expect the defense to generalize. The way to defend against a new threat model would be to add it to the set of threat models and use one of the methods presented in this paper to defend against the union of threat models.

The experimental results demonstrate improvement over several baselines. \n\nWeaknesses: \n-- I am missing a more systematic comparisons to baseline defenses in the experiments. Figures 2 and 3 should have shown the accuracy as a function of radius also for PGD-aug, PGD-worst, Schott et al. Also what about comparisons to the latest SoTA defenses, e.g. recent baselines from from  \nwww.robust-ml.org/defenses/. \n\n-- An implicit expectation from this paper is that it addresses the key issue of  \"Defend against one attack but face a different attack\".

Specifically: \n\nThe approach improves over baselines for the \"all attacks\" mode, but under-performs compared with PGDaug and PGDworst when attacked with a single norm (Tab 1). \n\nWhile this is expected and probably cannot be avoided, it leaves the reader with an unclear conclusion about risk tradeoffs. It would have been useful to clarify the regime of mixtures of attacks where the various approaches are best. For instance, if one uses a of mix attack samples from the three norms, what mixtures would it be best to defend using MSD, wand what mixtures would it be best to use PGD-aug? or ABS? \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1944/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1944/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["pratyush.maini@gmail.com", "ericwong@cs.cmu.edu", "zkolter@cs.cmu.edu"], "title": "Adversarial Robustness Against the Union of Multiple Perturbation Models", "authors": ["Pratyush Maini", "Eric Wong", "Zico Kolter"], "pdf": "/pdf/cf2808a44fdfabec066720081b9e3e428c42140d.pdf", "TL;DR": "We develop a generalization of the standard PGD-based procedure to train architectures which are robust against multiple perturbation models, outperforming past approaches on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets.", "abstract": "Owing to the susceptibility of deep learning systems to adversarial attacks, there has been a great deal of work in developing (both empirically and certifiably) robust classifiers, but the vast majority has defended against single types of attacks.

They then propose a method which does somewhat better than the obvious way of adversarially training against more than one l_p perturbation.\nThe motivation for the paper is limited, in that they suggest previous works have suggested adversarial training itself \"overfits\" to the given l_p norm. This isn't surprising that it works, since the straightforward baseline works. They make it seem surprising by suggesting that ABS suggested adversarial training is doomed and cannot provide robustness to l_1, l_2, l_\\infty norms simultaneously. The other motivation is that this is a step toward studying an expanded threat model, but the authors have not demonstrated that the learned representations are any bit more robust to common corruptions (could the authors show the generalization performance on CIFAR-10-C or generalization to unforeseen corruptions?). Without further evidence, we are left to believe this only helps for this narrow threat model. Overall the paper is deficient in creativity and generality, so I vote for rejection.\n\nSmall comments:\n\n> take more time than a single norm,  it is a step closer towards the end goal of truly robust models, with adversarial robustness against all perturbations.\nPlease show model performance on CIFAR-10-C since if the model is more robust, it should hopefully be more robust to stochastic adversaries.\n\n> has claimed that adversarial training \u201coverfits\u201d to the particular type of perturbation used to generate the adversarial examples\nWouldn't this be that l_\\infty training fits specifically to l_\\infty examples, not that robust optimization cannot handle more than one norm at a time? Who is claiming that?\n\n> First, we show that even simple aggregations of different adversarial attacks can achieve competitive universal robustness against multiple perturbations models without resorting to complex architectures.\nI am not sure this was in doubt. The phrase \"universal robustness\" is misleading.\n\nHow were the budgets chosen for l_2 and l_1?
