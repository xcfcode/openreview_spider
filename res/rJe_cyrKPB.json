We can provide more detail on the appearance of the expansion, however it is dependent on how the specific tensor/convolution library stores weights. Therefore, we hope to provide more intuition of how the expansion function works in the paper.\n\n\u201cCan you justify the softmax and the very high temperature? For N = 8, s_1 will be sampled 98.2% of the time s_2 1.8% and the other sampling probabilities are close to neglibigle. While I understand it seems to work better in practice, it looks extremely aggressive.\u201d\n\nWhen decomposing into multiple group sizes, each successive size in the series only aims to capture information not approximated by the previous order term. In Table 2, we show that even a depthwise factorisation of the network is able to recover almost all of the original accuracy (83.99 vs 81.74). Therefore, most of the energy of the approximation should be captured by the lowest rank term in the decomposition series. This provides intuition that the increasing rank terms in the series should be sampled with frequency that reflects the energy which they capture in the approximation, hence a high sampling temperature.\n\n\u201cIn 4.4 you say you perform finetuning for 150 epochs, which is huge, while on the abstract you said \"GroSS represents a significant step towards liberating network architecture search from the burden of training and finetuning\". Can you comment?\u201d\n\nWe found that for each single configuration, convergence was most reliably achieved by fine-tuning for 100 epochs. When a network is factorised using GroSS it is fine-tuned for a longer schedule of 150 epochs, but provides 252 configurations in our 4-layer network (4^12 configurations for our VGG16 decomposition). There are very likely more optimal fine-tuning strategies for both individual configurations and GroSS, but they still provide fair comparison to each other. If both training strategies were optimised, we would still expect to see the number of additional configurations trained by GroSS to vastly exceed the relative increase in number of epochs."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1883/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1883/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "GroSS Decomposition: Group-Size Series Decomposition for Whole Search-Space Training", "authors": ["Henry Howard-Jenkins", "Yiwen Li", "Victor Adrian Prisacariu"], "authorids": ["henryhj@robots.ox.ac.uk", "kate@robots.ox.ac.uk", "victor@robots.ox.ac.uk"], "keywords": ["architecture search", "block term decomposition", "network decomposition", "network acceleration", "group convolution"], "TL;DR": "A decomposition method which allows for simultaneous training of an entire search space of group convolution architectures.

There is already large bodies of work on parametrizing neural networks with tensor decomposition, including coupled decomposition.\u201d\n\nWhile there are works on parameterising and factorising networks with tensor decomposition, rank selection for decomposition remains relatively unexplored. \nThe novelty of GroSS comes, not from the mechanics of decomposition, where we can use standard BTD due to the process described in Eq.6, but instead from the formulation of the search space as the combination (and interaction) of a number of series components. Each of these can be changed on-the-fly and therefore allow for simultaneous training. Here, we apply this series formulation to rank search for factorisation of networks, but we envisage similar series-based search can be used for a number of search tasks, such as number of channels and kernel dimensions.\n\n\u201cHow is the method different to training several network with the same Tucker parametrization but different ranks?\u201c\n\nGroSS differs from the training of individual rank configurations since GroSS is able to train each rank factorisation of each layer, as well as all the possible combinations of ranks between layers. To explore our 4-layer network this would require 252 individual training runs, and 4^12 for our VGG16 network. However GroSS allows for all these configurations to be fine-tuned simultaneously, in a single training run.\n\n\u201cWhy the convolution R should be grouped? Should it not be a regular convolution?\u201d\n\nWe perform BTD, rather than pure Tucker decomposition. BTD is the extension of Tucker decomposition as it is the factorisation of a single tensor into the sum of multiple Tucker decompositions. When the number of Tuckers present in the BTD sum and the size of each Tucker kernel are set to the specific values, as described in our paper, the factorisation becomes equivalent to the grouped bottleneck architecture. Full derivation of this can be found in (paper ref: Yunpeng et al., 2017).\n\n\u201cThe model is a simple 4-layer network, not fully described. An established architecture, such as ResNet should be employed.\u201d\n\nWe agree and now have provided preliminary search results for VGG16 on CIFAR10, where we decompose all but the first convolutional layer into sizes [1, 4, 16, 32], therefore the number of possible configurations from our GroSS decomposition of VGG16 is 4^12. We implement a rudimentary breadth-first search to find configuration proposals. We can provide full implementation details of the search, network definition and fine-tuning strategy in an appendix.\n\nConfig                                                       | MACs         | Accuracy\n-------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------\nBaseline 4s                                              | 9.36M         | 91.00\n1, 4, 1, 32, 1, 1, 16, 1, 4, 16, 32, 4           | 8.84M         | 91.28\nBaseline 16s                                            | 29.04M       | 91.48\n1, 32, 16, 32, 16, 16, 32, 32, 32, 1, 4, 16 | 26.19M      | 91.56\nFull Network                                            | 313.74M    | 91.52  \n\nHere, we perform similar testing to that with our 4-layer network. We set baseline configurations, where every layer is set to the same rank (4 or 16). We then employ GroSS to find a configuration which requires fewer MACs, while acheiving higher accuracy than the baseline. This was possible in each case, and notably one of our found configurations outperforms the original network before factorisation, requiring an order of magnitude fewer operations.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1883/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1883/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "GroSS Decomposition: Group-Size Series Decomposition for Whole Search-Space Training", "authors": ["Henry Howard-Jenkins", "Yiwen Li", "Victor Adrian Prisacariu"], "authorids": ["henryhj@robots.ox.ac.uk", "kate@robots.ox.ac.uk", "victor@robots.ox.ac.uk"], "keywords": ["architecture search", "block term decomposition", "network decomposition", "network acceleration", "group convolution"], "TL;DR": "A decomposition method which allows for simultaneous training of an entire search space of group convolution architectures.

A contribution of GroSS, however, is that it allows search between these rank configurations. As such, we did not optimise fine-tuning or search strategy in favour of demonstrating that GroSS did enable search in the grouped convolution space.\n\nTherefore, GroSS should be compared with rank selection such as VBMF proposed in [4] (employed in [1]). We apply VBMF to our 4-layer network weights to estimate the rank of each layer, choosing the nearest value which satisfies the BTD to grouped bottleneck requirements. We then set the decomposition to this predicted rank (16, 8, 16), fine-tune and search, as described in the paper. The results are shown below:\n\nConfig                     | MACs | Accuracy    \n------------------------ | -------- | ------------     \nVBMF [4]: 16 8 16 | 2.51M | 83.33 (0.10)\n2 32 64 (in paper) | 2.36M | 83.84 (0.12)\n4 16 64                    | 2.22M | 83.93 (0.13)\n\nWe are able to find lower cost configurations with improved accuracy over the VBMF estimation.

The basic idea is to reformulate the BTD so that higher-order decompositions can be expressed as functions of lower-order decompositions. Given this nesting, it is possible to implicitly train the lower-order decompositions while training the higher-order ones. \n\nThe authors frame this contribution as a form of \"neural architecture search\" (NAS), arguing that this allows researchers to simultaneously train grouped-convolution CNNs with varying group sizes. After the simultaneous training based on the GROSS approach, the researcher can then select the group size that gives the best performance/accuracy tradeoff. The selected model can be further fine-tuned on the task, and the authors found that this improved performance. \n\nEmpirical results on the CIFAR-10 dataset show that the proposed approach performs as expected, allowing for the simultaneous training of CNNs with grouped convolutions of varying orders. The results show the the proposed approach can find \"better\" solutions than a simple search over fixed architectures. \n\nAssessment: Overall, this is a well-written and soundly derived contribution. However, it is quite niche and---while the authors frame it as a form of NAS---in my view, this contribution is more in the realm of hyperparameter search for grouped convolutions, and not NAS in general. I would recommend reframing the introduction to make this fact more explicit, as the approach does not provide a general strategy for differentiable NAS.  In addition, the empirical results are relatively shallow, with only one dataset and without detailed discussion of the variance of the results.\n\nReasons to accept:\n- Well-written\n- Sound and well-motivated algorithm\n- Potential applications in cases where grouped convolutions are useful\n- Empirical results demonstrate validity of the proposed approach\n\nReasons to reject:\n- Relatively niche contribution incorrectly framed as general contribution to NAS\n- Limited empirical analysis (e.g., only one dataset).

This enables architecture search for the convolution parameters in a differentiable and efficient way.\n\nComments\n---\nI think was paper is well written, and was clear at least until 3.2. I believe some clarifications could be useful here, it is not written clearly that t' and u', the 2 first dimensions of the core are R times smaller than t and u. There is some explanation in the bracket (3) but 1) it should be stated clearly in the text, 2) I believe there are several typos on the 4th line of bracket (3) making it hard to understand.\n\nI did not know about the expansion function, and while I trust the authors that it is correctly used, I would have like either more explanations on how it works or some reference.\n\nCan you justify the softmax and the very high temperature? For N = 8, s_1 will be sampled 98.2% of the time s_2 1.8% and the other sampling probabilities are close to neglibigle. While I understand it seems to work better in practice, it looks extremely aggressive.\n\nIn 4.4 you say you perform finetuning for 150 epochs, which is huge, while on the abstract you said \"GroSS represents a significant step towards\nliberating network architecture search from the burden of training and finetuning\". Can you comment?\n\nAs you say GroSS is an alternative to NAS (for the convolutions parameters that is), is the GroSS method proposed really faster and more accurate than a NAS baseline for finding these architectures?\n\nI don't find the column titles in Table 3 to be always informative. \"After train\" means after the finetuning? I took me some time to realize the delta was the delta in accuracies, it is not very informative and it was not clear for me for some time what it meant. Either the titles should be chosen more carefully or the caption should be more precise I believe.\n\nIn figure 1, the legend should be more informative, at least incorporate a \"alpha\" or \"temperature\" title in the legend.\n\nConclusion\n---\nWhile the method is interesting I am wondering whether GroSS enables more efficient architecture search that tradional methods as there is still a long finetuning step, furthermore it can only be applied to grouped convolutions parameters. As the authors present it in the abstract and introduction as an alternative to NAS, I believe a comparison to a NAS would be needed."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1883/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1883/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "GroSS Decomposition: Group-Size Series Decomposition for Whole Search-Space Training", "authors": ["Henry Howard-Jenkins", "Yiwen Li", "Victor Adrian Prisacariu"], "authorids": ["henryhj@robots.ox.ac.uk", "kate@robots.ox.ac.uk", "victor@robots.ox.ac.uk"], "keywords": ["architecture search", "block term decomposition", "network decomposition", "network acceleration", "group convolution"], "TL;DR": "A decomposition method which allows for simultaneous training of an entire search space of group convolution architectures.

GroSS allows for dynamic and differentiable selection of factorisation rank, which is analogous to a grouped convolution. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, GroSS is the first method to simultaneously train differing numbers of groups within a single layer, as well as all possible combinations between layers. In doing so, GroSS trains an entire grouped convolution architecture search-space concurrently. We demonstrate this with a proof-of-concept exhaustive architecure search with a performance objective. GroSS represents a significant step towards liberating network architecture search from the burden of training and finetuning.", "pdf": "/pdf/0448de88c011f64503c25cc4c3ee2ea214a2bfa3.pdf", "paperhash": "howardjenkins|gross_decomposition_groupsize_series_decomposition_for_whole_searchspace_training", "original_pdf": "/attachment/0448de88c011f64503c25cc4c3ee2ea214a2bfa3.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nhoward-jenkins2020gross,\ntitle={Gro{\\{}SS{\\}} Decomposition: Group-Size Series Decomposition for Whole Search-Space Training},\nauthor={Henry Howard-Jenkins and Yiwen Li and Victor Adrian Prisacariu},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJe_cyrKPB}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
