As it can be seen, OrthoReg has a lower error bound compared with regularizing the negative correlations (0.2% on Cifar10, and 0.7% on Cifar100).\n\n\n>> One of my main concerns is ambiguity stemming from the fact that the paper sometimes discusses activations and sometimes filter weights, but refers to both as \"features\". However, the authors have already said they will address this.\n\nWe have fixed this issue accordingly replacing \u201cfeatures\u201d with \u201cfeature weights\u201d or \u201cfeature activations.\n\n>> The paper somewhat ignores interactions with the choice of nonlinearity, which seems like it could be very important; especially because the goal is to obtain feature activations that are uncorrelated, and this is done only by applying a penalty to the weights (i.e. in a data-agnostic way and also ignoring any nonlinearity). I believe the authors already mentioned in their responses to reviewer questions that this would be addressed, but I think this important and it definitely needs to be discussed.\n\nAlthough we successfully applied the proposed regularizer on ReLU networks, we agree with the reviewer that a thorough study on the effects of the non-linearities should be done. We have modified the discussion part of the paper so as to reflect this important concern.\n\n\n>> In response to the authors' answer to my question about the role of biases: as they point out, it is perfectly possible to combine their proposed technique with the \"multi-bias\" approach, but this was not really my point. Rather, the latter is an example that challenges the idea that features should not be positively correlated / redundant, which seems to be the assumption that this work is built upon. My current intuition is that it's okay to have correlated features, as long as you're not wasting model capacity on them. This is the case for \"multi-bias\", seeing as the weights are shared across sets of correlated features.\n\nWe now better understand the point, but note that there is no guarantee that networks with a high number of filter weights, and thus with a lot of redundant filters, will show a good behaviour in terms of generalization and overfitting. We have added a comment on this fact in section 2.\n\n>> The dichotomy between regularisation methods that reduce capacity and those that don't which is described in the introduction seems a bit arbitrary to me, especially considering that weight decay is counted among the former and the proposed method is counted among the latter. I think this very much depends on ones definition of model capacity (clearly weight decay does not actually reduce the number of parameters in a model).\n\nAs we explained in the paper, weight decay is shown to reduce the \u201ceffective number of parameters\u201d of neural networks [1]. Taking this into account we think it is sensible to make the distinction between those regularizations which drop weights, activations\u2026 (in essence, regularizations which reduce the capacity of the network), from those which do use all the capacity as effectively as possible. \n\nHowever, we agree this distinction may not be as clear to a reader as we claimed in the paper, thus, we change the sentence \u201cThere are two clearly defined regularization strategies in the literature\u201d for \u201cFrom the literature, two different regularization strategies can be defined\u201d.\n\n[1] Moody, J. E. (1991, December). The effective number of parameters: An analysis of generalization and regularization in nonlinear learning systems. In NIPS (Vol. 4, pp. 847-854).\n\n\n>> Overall, the work is perhaps a bit incremental, but it seems to be well-executed. The results are convincing, even if they aren't particularly ground-breaking.\n\nThanks.

An alternative version which penalises all correlations regardless of sign is also considered. The paper refers to these as \"local\" and \"global\" respectively, which I find a bit confusing as these are very general terms that can mean a plethora of things.\n\nThe experimental validation is quite rigorous. Several experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN) and improvements are demonstrated in most cases. While these improvements may seem modest, the baselines are already very competitive as the authors pointed out. In some cases it does raise some questions about statistical significance though. More results with the global regulariser (i.e. not just on MNIST) would have been interesting, as the main novelty in the paper seems to be leaving the negative correlations alone, so it would be interesting to see exactly how much of a difference this makes.\n\nOne of my main concerns is ambiguity stemming from the fact that the paper sometimes discusses activations and sometimes filter weights, but refers to both as \"features\". However, the authors have already said they will address this.\n\nThe paper somewhat ignores interactions with the choice of nonlinearity, which seems like it could be very important; especially because the goal is to obtain feature activations that are uncorrelated, and this is done only by applying a penalty to the weights (i.e. in a data-agnostic way and also ignoring any nonlinearity). I believe the authors already mentioned in their responses to reviewer questions that this would be addressed, but I think this important and it definitely needs to be discussed.\n\nIn response to the authors' answer to my question about the role of biases: as they point out, it is perfectly possible to combine their proposed technique with the \"multi-bias\" approach, but this was not really my point. Rather, the latter is an example that challenges the idea that features should not be positively correlated / redundant, which seems to be the assumption that this work is built upon. My current intuition is that it's okay to have correlated features, as long as you're not wasting model capacity on them. This is the case for \"multi-bias\", seeing as the weights are shared across sets of correlated features.\n\nThe dichotomy between regularisation methods that reduce capacity and those that don't which is described in the introduction seems a bit arbitrary to me, especially considering that weight decay is counted among the former and the proposed method is counted among the latter. I think this very much depends on ones definition of model capacity (clearly weight decay does not actually reduce the number of parameters in a model).\n\nOverall, the work is perhaps a bit incremental, but it seems to be well-executed.

Any particular reason for this? How do CNNs with fewer layers perform when using OrthoReg?\n\nWe chose to regularize \"very deep\" neural networks in order to prove that, contrary to other regularizations which apply to the feature maps, our proposal can be applied to state-of-the-art neural networks with dozens of hidden layers in feasible time. We already provide results on a shallower MLP and CNN models trained with MNIST, showing similar results in Section 3.1. \n\n\n>> The increase is in performance is quite little as compared to the original networks using other regularization schemes. More experimental validation might help. Can you please comment on this.\n\nNote that the improvements were found even in the presence of Dropout, weight-decay and Batch-Normalization at the same time on deep residual networks and wide residual networks. In Table 3 we show that improvements in performance of recent models trained on CIFAR are below 1%. (e.g. 0.11% improvement 100-Layer ResNet w.r.t. the ELU-Network). In this context, it can be considered that the 0.16% improvement obtained on CIFAR-10, the 0.9% on CIFAR-100, and the 0.1% on SHVN obtained with OrthoReg can be considered as remarkable. \nMore experimentation can also be found in Table 2, where we show that the margin of improvement can be increased if compared with no Dropout but the total improvement is best when both regularizations are present.\nWe encourage reviewer 1 to propose any extra experiment if still considered necessary.\n\n\n>> Reviewer1: Biases also play important role in de-correlation of neural responses.

However, the most prevalent regularizations do not leverage all the capacity of the models since they rely on reducing the effective number of parameters. Feature decorrelation is an alternative for using the full capacity of the models but the overfitting reduction margins are too narrow given the overhead it introduces. In this paper, we show that regularizing negatively correlated features is an obstacle for effective decorrelation and present OrthoReg, a novel regularization technique that locally enforces feature orthogonality. As a result, imposing locality constraints in feature decorrelation removes interferences between negatively correlated feature weights, allowing the regularizer to reach higher decorrelation bounds, and reducing the overfitting more effectively. \nIn particular, we show that the models regularized with OrthoReg have higher accuracy bounds even when batch normalization and dropout are present. Moreover, since our regularization is directly performed on the weights, it is especially suitable for fully convolutional neural networks, where the weight space is constant compared to the feature map space.
