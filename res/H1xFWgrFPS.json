I don't understand Figure 1a. I don't think this helps to illustrate the point. M_z seems to just be a bottleneck but the writing makes it seem like it is more. \n\n[Ans] We agree that M_z is just a bottleneck. Through Figure 1a, we want to show the abstraction of the changes (perturbations) in the bottleneck.  We hope the figure is conveying the message. We have added additional text to explain the figure better. If it is still misleading, we can remove the figure.\n\nFigure 1a is showing that the perturbation of the image happens not in high dimensional image space (M_x) but in low dimensional embedding space i.e. M_z. And there is a correspondence between image space (M_x) and latent space (M_z).\n\nAlso, Figure 1a is explaining the meaning of the desired perturbation (\\delta). Our proposed explainer function takes two arguments: a query image and the desired perturbation. Figure 1a demonstrates that the desired perturbation is the desired change in f(x). Most of the earlier work denoted \\delta as the amount of change in the input image (x). \n\n\n2. Section 4.2 is a bit hard to read. It is not clear for me what is the goal of this section.\n\n[Ans] We understand that our audience will be less familiar with the x-ray images. We are showing the results of our model for evaluating Cardiomegaly disease on chest x-ray. Cardiomegaly means an enlarged heart. We overlaid the heart segmentation over the x-ray image, to help the readers in visualizing the gradual change in heart size. The black-box model didn\u2019t use the heart segmentation or the heart size information to classify chest x-ray as Cardiomegaly.  Our explanation model was successful in exaggerating the correct features (increasing the heart size), which comply with the clinical definition of the disease. \n\n\nIn Section 4.2, we showed that on population-level, when we generate a counterfactual (abnormal) for a normal chest x-ray, it has a higher heart size as compared to the normal population and vice-versa. Thus, the explainer was successful in correlating the heart size with the disease. Hence, the explainer verified that the back-box is considering the correct feature (heart-size) for identifying the target class (cardiomegaly). \n\n3. Section 4.4 seems very similar to the idea in this work https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08841 which studied how bias in CycleGANs can be seen when you vary the bias which I think should be cited here.\n\n[Ans] The conclusion of the suggested work (Distribution Matching Losses Can Hallucinate Features in Medical Image Translation) is that if the training data has biased, then GAN inference will reflect that bias. Section 4.4 is using this conclusion to detect bias. Thank you for introducing this relevant work. We have cited this paper in our updated version\n\n\n4.

The presentation is clear. The coverage of prior work is sufficient (although references should point to the published work instead of arxiv entries, when the former is available).\n\n[Ans] We have updated the references in the paper to the published work.\n\n2. One question that is not addressed is how efficient is this method, in terms of computational cost. This is a method that increases the amount of input data (through perturbation). What is the minimum amount of input data that needs to be perturbed in this way, before the method can become human interpretable?\n\n[Ans] \nWe want to answer this question in terms of computational and statistical efficiency. Computationally, our model is very efficient. At inference time, for a new image, only a single forward pass is required to generate a series of perturbation images (explanation).\n\nIn terms of statistical efficiency, yes, our model requires a minimum amount of input data for GAN training. The training data should be sufficient for training GAN and for producing realistic-looking results. However, the end-user can use any data that is compatible with the black-box model to train the explainer function, and not necessarily the same data that was used to train the black-box model. Also, we don\u2019t require labeled (supervised) data for training our explainer function. \n\n3. Also, ideally any work on human interpretability of ML should be evaluated on humans. If not, it is an approximation, and it should be presented and reasoned as such (with a discussion of limitations and caveats, for instance).\n\n[Ans] We are currently running human experiments to test our model and will add the results in the revision. For human evaluation, we are running three tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk. \n\nIn the first task, we demonstrate how humans perceive \u201cthe progressive exaggeration\u201d aspect of our explanation. In this task, we showed users two explanations create by our model for the same individual and ask the user to compare them in terms of a target class like age and smile (e.g. Identify the image in which the person is smiling more?). \n\nIn the second task, we show that our explanations help the user to understand better, the target class for the classifier. In this task, we showed users a series of images with gradual exaggeration of a target class, and ask the users to identify the target class. (e.g what is changing in the below images? Option: Age, Smile, Gender, Nothing, Something else). \n\nIn the third task, we demonstrate that our model helped the user to identify problems (biased training) in a black-box. Here, we used the same setting as in the second task but also showed explanations generated from a biased classifier. \n\n\nWe will soon upload our revised version."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2144/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2144/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["sumedha.singla@pitt.edu", "kayhan@pitt.edu", "cjx880409@gmail.com", "kayhan@pitt.edu"], "title": "Explanation  by Progressive  Exaggeration", "authors": ["Sumedha Singla", "Brian Pollack", "Junxiang Chen", "Kayhan Batmanghelich"], "pdf": "/pdf/0668079e8510cc0d717c920f2fd8f93c12b1dbec.pdf", "TL;DR": "A method to explain a classifier, by generating visual perturbation of an image by exaggerating  or diminishing the semantic features that the classifier associates with a target label.", "abstract": "As machine learning methods see greater adoption and implementation in high stakes applications such as medical image diagnosis, the need for model interpretability and explanation has become more critical.

This is a method that increases the amount of input data (through perturbation). What is the minimum amount of input data that needs to be perturbed in this way, before the method can become human interpretable? \n\nAlso, ideally any work on human interpretability of ML should be evaluated on humans.
