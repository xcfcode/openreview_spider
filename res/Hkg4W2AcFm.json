In addition, the work also proposes to progressively add latent nodes to the network for training. The claim is that using this framework, one avoid GAN-style training (e.g., Fader network) which could be unstable and hard to tune. \n\nAlthough the idea is interesting, the experiments are lacking. While previous works (e.g., Fader network) has both qualitative (e.g., image quality when changing attribute values) and quantitative results (e.g., classification results of generated image with novel combination of attributes), this paper only shows visual comparison (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5), and its comparison with Fader network is a bit vague (e.g., it is not clear to me why Fig. 5(e) generated by proposed approach is \u201cmore natural\u201d than Fig. 5(d), even if I check the updated version mentioned by the authors' comments). Also in the paper there are five hyperparameters (Eqn. 14) and the center claim is that using Jacobian loss is better. However, there is no ablation study to support the claim and/or the design choice. From my opinion, the paper should show the performance of supervised training of attributes, the effects of using Jacobian loss and/or cycle loss, the inception score of generated images, etc. \n\nI acknowledge the authors for their honesty in raising the issues of Fig. 4, and providing an updated version.

This is achieved by first training the teacher autoencoder (unsupervised or supervised) that learns to disentangle the factors of variation at the cost of poor reconstruction, and then distills these learned representations into a student model with extra latent dimensions, where these extra latents can be used to improve the reconstructions of the student autoencoder compared to the teacher autoencoder. The distillation of the learned representation is encouraged via a novel Jacobian loss term that encourages the change in reconstructions of the teacher and student to be similar when the latent representation changes. There is one experiment for progressive unsupervised disentangling (disentangling factor by factor) on MNIST data, and one experiment for semi-supervised disentangling on CelebA-HQ.\n\nPros:\n- I think the idea of progressively capturing factors of variation one by one is neat, and this appears to be one of the first successful attempts at this problem.\n- The distillation appears to work well on the MNIST data, and does indeed decrease the reconstruction loss of the student compared to the teacher.\n- The qualitative results on CelebA-HQ look strong (especially apparent in the video), with the clear advantage over Fader Networks being that the proposed model is a single model that can manipulate the 40 different attributes, whereas Fader Nets can only deal with at most 3 attributes per model.\n\nCons:\n- There are not enough quantitative results supporting the claim that the model is \u201ceffective at both disentangling and reconstruction.\u201d The degree of disentanglement in the representations is only shown qualitatively via latent interpolation, and only for a single model. Such qualitative results are generally prone to cherry-picking and it is difficult to reliably compare different disentangling methods in this manner. This calls for quantitative measures of disentanglement. Had you used a dataset where you know the ground truth factors of variation (e.g. dSprites/2D Shapes data) for the unsupervised disentangling method, then the level of disentanglement in the learned representations could be quantified, and thus your method could be compared against unsupervised disentangling baselines. For the semi-supervised disentanglement example on CelebA, you could for example quantify how well the encoder predicts the different attributes (because there is ground truth here) e.g. report RMSE of the y_i\u2019s on a held out test set with ground truth. A quantitative comparison with Fader Networks in this manner appears necessary. The qualitative comparison on a single face in Figure 5 is nowhere near sufficient.\n- There is quantitative evidence that the reconstruction loss decreases when training the student, but here it\u2019s not clear whether this quantitative difference makes a qualitative difference in the reconstructions. Getting higher fidelity images is one of the motivations behind improving reconstructions, so It would be informative to compare the reconstructions of the teacher and the student on the same image.\n- In the CelebA experiments, the benefit of student training is not visible in the results. In Figure 5 you already show that the teacher model gives decent reconstructions, yet you don\u2019t show the reconstruction for the student model (quantitatively you show that it improves in Figure 3b, but again it is worth checking if it makes a difference visually). Also it\u2019s not clear whether Figure 4 are results from the student model or the teacher model. I\u2019m guessing that they are from the student model.\n- These quantitative results could form the basis of doing ablation studies for each of the different losses in the additive loss (for both unsupervised & semi-supervised tasks). Because there are many components in the loss, with a hyperparameter for each, it would be helpful to know what losses the results are sensitive to for the sake of tuning hyperparameters. This would be especially useful should I wish to apply the proposed method to a different dataset.\n- I think the derivation of the Jacobian loss requires some more justification. The higher order terms in the Taylor expansion in (2) and (3) can only be ignored when ||y_2 - y_1|| is small compared to the coefficients, but there is no validation/justification regarding this.\n\nOther Qs/comments:\n- On page 5 in the last paragraph of section 3, you say that \u201cAfter training of the student with d=1 is finished, we consider it as the new teacher\u201d. Here do you append z to y when you form the new teacher?\n- On page 6 in the paragraph for prediction loss, you say \u201cThis allows the decoder to naturally \u2026. of the attributes\u201d. I guess you mean this allows the model to give realistic interpolations between y=-1 and 1?\n- bottom of page 6: \u201cHere we could have used any random values in lieu of y_2\u201d <- not sure I understand this?\n- typo: conditionnning -> conditioning\n- I would be inclined to boost the score up to 7 if the authors include some quantitative results along with more thorough comparisons to Fader Networks\n\n************ Revision ***********\nThe authors' updates include further quantitative comparisons to Fader Networks and ablation studies for the different types of losses, addressing the concerns I had in the review.

The quantitative measure consists in evaluating, via an external\nclassifier, how well the latent units condition the specified factor of\nvariation in the generated image.  \n\nIn the MNIST example we measure how well the first two latent units can\nmanipulate the digit class in the images generated by the student models.  The\nresults are presented in the new Table 1, showing that the student with Jacobian\nsupervision obtains a better trade-off between disentanglement and reconstruction.\n\nIn the facial attribute manipulation task we used a pre-trained attribute\nclassifier provided by the authors of Fader Networks. Using the classifier, we\nmeasure if by manipulating the latent unit corresponding to one attribute we can\nchange the presence or absence of that attribute in the generated image. We do\nthis for all attributes and for all images in the test set. The results are\nshown in Table 2 and Figure 4.\n\nFor comparison, we trained two Fader Networks models to manipulate all\nattributes. The training did not converge and the resulting manipulation and\nreconstruction performance is inferior to our method. Besides the quantitative\ncomparison, this can also be seen qualitatively in the new Figures 7 and 8.\n\n\n> \"[...] compare the reconstructions of the teacher and the student on the same\n  image.\"\n\nWe added a new figure to the appendix showing a comparison between the\nreconstructions obtained by the teacher and by the student (new Figure 7). It\nshows that the student model is better at reconstructing fine image details.  The\ncomparison also includes a Fader Networks model trained to manipulate multiple\nattributes, and show that its reconstruction is distorted.\n\n> \"Also it\u2019s not clear whether Figure 4 are results from the student model or\n  the teacher model. [...]\"\n\nSorry for this lack of clarity. Figure 4 shows results by the student model\ntrained with Jacobian supervision. We clarified this in the manuscript.\n\n> \"[...]  ablation studies for each of the different losses [...]\"\n\nWe added ablation studies for both unsupervised and supervised tasks in the new\nsection A.3 in the appendix (page 14).  Unless otherwise noted, the weighs of\nthe losses were found by evaluation on separate validation sets.\n\n> \"[...] The higher order terms in the Taylor expansion in (2) and (3)\n  can only be ignored when ||y_2 - y_1|| is small [...]\"\n\nIndeed, because of the higher order terms, even assuming (5) and (6) hold, (7)\nis only an approximation. Note however that the norm of the approximation error\nin (7) is that of the difference between the higher order terms of the teacher\nand the student, namely ||o^T(||y_2-y_1||) - o^S(||y_2-y_1||)||. This might be\nlower than the individual higher order terms, especially if both decoders\nrespond similarly to variations in $y$.  Currently, our justification is mainly\nempirical. We also considered weighing the loss by a factor reciprocal\nto ||y_2-y_1||, to give less importance to pairs of samples for\nwhich ||y_2-y_1|| is large.  Another option we contemplated is, for the Jacobian\nsupervision, to consider a blurred version of the student, so that it has the\nlow resolution of the teacher. The formulation still holds and this would also\nmake (6) easier to enforce. In informal experiments we observed no significant\nadvantage w.r.t. the current approach, which is simpler.  We\nleave these possible avenues of improvement as future work.\n\n> \"[...] you say that \u201cAfter training of\n  the student with d=1 is finished, we consider it as the new teacher\u201d. Here do\n  you append z to y when you form the new teacher?\"\n\nYes this is correct. We clarified this in the text. \n\n> On page 6 in the paragraph for prediction loss, you say \u201cThis allows the\n  decoder to naturally \u2026\" of the attributes\u201d. I guess you mean this allows the\n  model to give realistic interpolations between y=-1 and 1?\n\nWe intended to say that we do not require the prediction to be binary values, as\nif we used the cross-entropy loss, but any real value. Thus, the decoder can\nread the amount of attribute variation from this variable, and not only if the\nattribute is present or not.\n\n> \"[...] \u201cHere we could have used any random values in lieu of y_2\u201d [...]\"\n\nWe wanted to say that the $y$ part in the fabricated latent code could be\nrandom, but instead we sample it from the data (copy from another sample).  \nWe clarified this in the text.\n\n> \"typo: conditionnning -> conditioning\"\n\nThank you.\n\n> \"I would be inclined to boost the score up to 7 if the authors include some\n  quantitative results along with more thorough comparisons to Fader Networks\"\n\nThank you. We hope the additional quantitative and qualitative results can\nconvince you of the superior performance of our method with respect to Fader\nNetworks, for multiple attributes manipulation.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1160/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1160/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1160/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Overcoming the Disentanglement vs Reconstruction Trade-off via Jacobian Supervision", "abstract": "A major challenge in learning image representations is the disentangling of the factors of variation underlying the image formation.

But his setup fails when z is sufficiently large as the decoder can learn to ignore y altogether. Smaller sized z leads to poor reconstruction.\n\nTo overcome this issue, the authors propose to employ a student teacher training paradigm. The teacher is trained such that the encoder only produces y and the decoder that only consumes y. This ensures good disentanglement but poor reconstruction. Subsequently, a student autoencoder is learned which has a much larger latent code and produces both y and z. The y component is mapped to the teacher encoder\u2019s y component using Jacobian regularization.\n\nPositives:\nThe results of image manipulation using known attributes is quite impressive. The authors propose modifications to the Jacobian regularization as simple reconstruction losses for efficient training. The approach avoids adversarial training and thus is easier to train.\n\nNegatives:\nUnsupervised disentanglement results are only shown for MNIST. I am not convinced similar results for unsupervised disentanglement can be obtained on more complex datasets. Authors should include some results on this aspect or reduce the emphasis on unsupervised disentanglement.

In this paper we use the\nword disentangling to refer to both aspects:\n\na) each latent unit in the specified part is sensitive to one generative factor\nb) the value of each of these latent units conditions the generated output such\nthat it varies the corresponding generative factor\n\nWe will clarify this in the manuscript and revise the text to make sure it is\ncoherent.\n\n(7) See item (8)\n\n(8) We evaluated quantitatively how well the output is conditioned to the specified\nfactors, similarly to the procedure described in item (5). To do this, for each\nimage in the CelebA test set, we tried to flip each of the 32 disentangled\nattributes, one at a time (e.g. eyeglasses/no eyeglasses). We did the flipping\nby setting the latent variable y_i to sign(y_i)*-1*\\alpha, with \\alpha >0 a\nmultiplier to exaggerate the attribute, found in a separate validation set for\neach model (\\alpha=40 for all).\n\nTo verify that the attribute was indeed flipped in the generated image, we used\nan external classifier trained to predict each of the attributes. We used the\nclassifier provided by the authors of Lample et al. (2017), which was trained\ndirectly on the CelebA dataset.\n\nThe results are as follows:\n\n| model                           |  $d$ | flips OK | recons. MSE |\n|------------------------------+--------+------------+---------------|\n| teacher                        | 2048  |    73.1% |     1.82e-3 |\n| student w/ Jac. sup.   | 8192 |    72.2% |     1.08e-3 |\n| student wo/ Jac. sup. | 8192 |    42.7% |     1.04e-3 |\n|------------------------------+--------+------------+---------------|\n| Lample et al., 2017     | 2048 |    43.1% |     3.08e-3 |\n| random weights         | 2048 |    20.2% |     1.01e-1 |\n\nAt approximately the same reconstruction performance, the student with Jacobian\nsupervision is significantly better at flipping attributes than the student\nwithout it. \n\nWe also trained a Fader Networks model (Lample et al., 2017) with the same\nhyperparameters and training epochs as our teacher model. The result suggests\nthat the adversarial discriminator acting on the latent code harms the\nreconstruction and that the conditionning is worse than with our teacher model.\n\n(9) We will add to the appendix the result of trying the same experiment as in\nFigure 4, but using the student model without Jacobian supervision. It will be\nclear from this experiment that the latter cannot effectively control most of\nthe attributes.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1160/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1160/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1160/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Overcoming the Disentanglement vs Reconstruction Trade-off via Jacobian Supervision", "abstract": "A major challenge in learning image representations is the disentangling of the factors of variation underlying the image formation.

If it does, it would be good to say this explicitly.\n\n(3) The derivation of Equation (7) is clear and very easy to follow. \n\n(4) Is it possible to quantify the contribution of L_{xcov} to the model?\n\n(5) The authors say that: \n`Once the student model is trained, it generates a better reconstructed image than the teacher model, thanks to the expanded latent code, while maintaining the conditionning of the output that the teacher had.\u2019\n\nThe authors have not quantified the level of \u2018conditionning\u2019 (disentanglement) for either the student or the teacher, so it is not clear if this claim is well backed, or the extent to which this is true. It would be hard for other researchers to build on this work, without having methods to qualitatively compare models. Higgins et al. ICLR 2017 propose one method for measuring disentanglement.\n\n(6) A more serious concern is that the term disentanglement as defined in the abstract:\n\n`where a subset of the latent variables is constrained to correspond to specific factors'\n\n is not clear nor is it consistently used throughout the paper. When the authors disentangle MNIST, they appear to be searching for linear separability, and when they disentangle CelebA they appear to be trying to assign one factor of variation (attribute) to each unit of y^T. Additionally, the paper refers more to \u2018conditionning\u2019 than disentanglement, it would be nice to rectify or explain this discontinuity between the main body of the text and the title.\n\n(7) Reconstruction results in Figure 4. appear to be very good, however there is no quantitative evaluation nor comparison with other models.\n\n(8) Additionally, while most of the results in Figure 4. are visually pleasing, there are no quantitative results. From these visual results it is not clear how reliably (or consistently) the model is able to edit the correct attribute? \n\n(9) The authors say that:\n`In comparison, a student model with enlarged latent code but that continues with the training procedure as the teacher, without Jacobian supervision, achieves good reconstruction but loses the effective conditionning on the attributes.\u2019\n\nThere are no quantitative (or qualitative) results to demonstrate that the disentanglement is worse in the `student model with enlarged latent code'.", "title": " Interesting paper, but I have a few questions and concerns"}, "signatures": ["(anonymous)"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1160/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["(anonymous)", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Overcoming the Disentanglement vs Reconstruction Trade-off via Jacobian Supervision", "abstract": "A major challenge in learning image representations is the disentangling of the factors of variation underlying the image formation.  This is typically achieved with an autoencoder architecture where a subset of the latent variables is constrained to correspond to specific factors, and the rest of them are considered nuisance variables. This approach has an important drawback: as the dimension of the nuisance variables is increased, image reconstruction is improved, but the decoder has the flexibility to ignore the specified factors, thus losing the ability to condition the output on them.  In this work, we propose to overcome this trade-off by progressively growing the dimension of the latent code, while constraining the Jacobian of the output image with respect to the disentangled variables to remain the same.  As a result, the obtained models are effective at both disentangling and reconstruction.  We demonstrate the applicability of this method in both unsupervised and supervised scenarios for learning disentangled representations. In a facial attribute manipulation task, we obtain high quality image generation while smoothly controlling dozens of attributes with a single model. This is an order of magnitude more disentangled factors than state-of-the-art methods, while obtaining visually similar or superior results, and avoiding adversarial training.", "keywords": ["disentangling", "autoencoders", "jacobian", "face manipulation"], "authorids": ["jlezama@fing.edu.uy"], "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 Lezama"], "TL;DR": "A method for learning image representations that are good for both disentangling factors of variation and obtaining faithful reconstructions.", "pdf": "/pdf/5e99e815bff098d048777982ea421e68ed2d0eb5.pdf", "paperhash": "lezama|overcoming_the_disentanglement_vs_reconstruction_tradeoff_via_jacobian_supervision", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nlezama2018overcoming,\ntitle={Overcoming the Disentanglement vs Reconstruction Trade-off via Jacobian Supervision},\nauthor={Jos\u00e9 Lezama},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkg4W2AcFm},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1160/Public_Comment", "rdate": null, "ddate": null, "expdate": null, "duedate": null, "tmdate": 1542311664652, "tddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "reply": {"signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*|\\(anonymous\\)", "description": "How your identity will be displayed."}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "forum": "Hkg4W2AcFm", "readers": {"description": "Select all user groups that should be able to read this comment.", "value-dropdown-hierarchy": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1160/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1160/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1160/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "replyto": null, "content": {"comment": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}", "required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters)."}, "title": {"value-regex": ".{1,500}", "required": true, "order": 0, "description": "Brief summary of your comment."}}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values-copied": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference", "{signatures}"]}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "invitees": ["~"], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1160/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1160/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1160/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "multiReply": true, "taskCompletionCount": null, "transform": null, "cdate": 1542311664652}}}], "count": 12}
