It was not our intention to suggest that the low scores \"come from the fact that we trained our agents for 100M frames\". Our sentence was just pushing back on the comment that our results were not convincing. We do think our results are convincing when you compare the performance of our algorithm to similar methods at 100M frames (and this is why we mentioned a paper with high scores). I don't think we, as a community, should only reward papers that had the computational budget to run much longer experiments. Within the budget of 100M frames our results are very convincing. \n\nAbout our claim that it is \"well-known fact that most current deep RL algorithms perform better in Atari 2600 games when more frames are provided\",  we stand behind it. Let us try to clarify why. The learning curves in some of the games we used in our evaluation have sharp increases because the reward function of these games is sparse (see individual runs in Figure 4). The agent needs to \"figure out\" how to get to the next rewarding state so the learning curve can start increasing again.  The stabilizing flat curves are an artifact of the environment. We refer back to Figure 7 of the RND paper because they ran their experiment for 2 billion frames. In Private Eye, for example,  the learning curve is flat until 1.5 billion frames! \n\nIn Montezuma's Revenge, algorithms that do not promote exploration cannot reach 2500 points even with hundreds of millions of frames. Those that promote exploration sometimes can reach 2500 points in 100M frames. That is what our algorithm does as well. I'm not aware of any algorithm that does better within such short time frame. More frames mean that the agent would have time to figure out how to reach the next rewarding state. We realize this discussion was not clear in the paper and we are happy to make it clearer if the paper is accepted.\n\nFinally, we do agree with you that we present no guarantees that our method would keep improving at the rate of other method. This is not our goal. Exploration is about reducing the sample complexity of learning algorithms because useful information is collected faster. This is exactly what we evaluate by running up to 100M frames. Maybe it was not clear from our paper that we were comparing ourselves against other baseline results with a small number of frames. We are also more than happy to be more clear about this if our paper is accepted."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper29/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper29/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper29/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Count-Based Exploration with the Successor Representation", "abstract": "The problem of exploration in reinforcement learning is well-understood in the tabular case and many sample-efficient algorithms are known.

This is why we didn't spend too much time discussing the fact that it performs worse than MBIE. We are happy to expand this discussion if you think it is worth.\n\nIn a sense, the same argument applies to our Atari results. Our experiments intend to show that our algorithm performs as well as the pseudo-count based methods, but without requiring a density model, which is is a big plus. If we compare the performance of our algorithm to DQN+PixelCNN we see that it outperforms this baseline in 4 out of 6 games. If we compare the performance of our algorithm to DNQ+CTS, DQN+SR outperforms DQN+CTS in 5 out of 6 games! The other baseline, DQN_e^{MMC}, which doesn't use the exploration bonus, is demonstrating something else. It is showing how different parameters of the network can improve the agent's performance. That being said, these different parameters do not help at all in the task with very sparse rewards: Montezuma's Revenge. This shows that the exploration bonus we proposed is indeed effective.\n\nThe impression that the numbers we are reporting are \u201clow\u201d comes from the fact that we trained our agents for 100M frames. One of the great papers submitted to ICLR, introducing RND, got scores of 7, 9, and 10 (https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1lJJnR5Ym&noteId=H1lJJnR5Ym). The numbers reported in that paper were obtained after 2 billion frames(!). Unfortunately we do not have the computational power to evaluate our algorithm for that long. However, if we look at the performance of RND at 100M frames, in Figure 7 of the referred paper, our method outperforms RND at 100M frames in Venture and Solaris, it is outperformed by RND in Gravitar, and exhibits comparable performance in Montezuma\u2019s Revenge and Private Eye. It is a well-known fact that most current deep RL algorithms perform better in Atari 2600 games when more frames are provided. We don\u2019t think our paper should be evaluated on our ability to run experiments for 20 times longer. It seems to us that the reviewers assessment in the regard of the reported performance is harsher than what is common at ICLR.\n\nThe other concern that was raised was the fact that we do not explain the model-based algorithms used as baseline, nor DQN_e^{MMC}. We didn't explain the model-based algorithms used as baseline in order to be more concise and because they are fairly standard in the field. If the paper is accepted, we are happy to do so in its final version. DQN_e^{MMC} is explained in the fourth paragraph of Section 5. Shortly, it is our algorithm without the exploration bonus.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper29/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper29/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper29/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Count-Based Exploration with the Successor Representation", "abstract": "The problem of exploration in reinforcement learning is well-understood in the tabular case and many sample-efficient algorithms are known.

Regarding our theorem, it intends to provide some intuition of why the norm of the successor representation can be used as an exploration bonus. When we started developing this work, in the tabular case, we observed that the successor representation (SR) could be used to drive exploration when we were computing it online, with temporal-difference (TD) learning. However, this is true only while the SR is being learned, not at its fixed point. At its fixed point the $\\ell_1$ norm of the SR is $\\sum \\gamma^t 1 = 1/(1-\\gamma)$ for all states (the SR is a collection of value functions in which a reward of 1 is observed at each time step). Therefore, the converged SR is not able to distinguish between interesting states for exploration because its future state occupancy (the cumulative sum of discounted visitation) is the same for all states. However, when being learned with TD learning, because a reward of $1$ is observed at each time step, there is no variance in the target and the predictions slowly approach the true value of the SR. If pessimistically initialized, the predictions approach the target from below. In this sense, what defines how far a prediction is from its final target is how many times it has been updated in a given state. This is why we used the online updates of TD learning in the function approximation case. We introduce the substochastic SR (SSR) because it is extremely hard to theoretically analyze this transient behavior of TD learning, with only recent papers being able to provide finite-sample complexity bounds for it. The SSR is a clearer way of analyzing the behavior of a predictor that, in the limit, converges to the SR (the $+1$ in the denominator becomes irrelevant) while incorporating the notion of counts before convergence, underestimating the true target but slowly approaching it. Such an analysis is not possible with the closed-form solution of the traditional SR exactly because we are interested in its transient behavior.\n\nAside from the discussion regarding the usefulness of the theorem along the paper, there were also other comments regarding the clarity of the paper. We address them below:\n\n- We didn't explain how the policy is optimized. We did. See the footnote in page 5. We used policy iteration, a fairly standard algorithm in the field.\n- There's no intuition for the theorem. I'm not sure what the reviewer had in mind here. We do provide an intuition on how the SSR underestimates the SR the same way that TD does while learning. We also discuss how the theorem shows how the SSR counts state visitation. \n- The bounds on n(s) are left for the reader. It is not clear to us what is the source of confusion. Our theorem is explicitly stated in terms of n(s).\n- The use of expected counts and not the discounted version. Traditionally, in the RL literature, expected counts are used. Our work implicitly discounts the counts because the SR has a discount factor. Investigating these different choices is indeed interesting, but this is not the goal of this paper.\n- It is hard to know what the real contributions are on the new architecture. The architecture is not supposed to be the contribution, but the idea of using the norm of the SR as an exploration bonus. The architecture is simply an architecture that instantiates this idea.\n- Results are extracted from histograms. I'm not sure what the reviewer means by this comment. The only results obtained from histograms are some baseline results in Table 1, which is definitely not the main focus of the paper. We explicitly reached out the the authors of the papers we used as baseline in Table 2 in order to get the *exact* numbers they obtained.\n- The intuition is not new. This was a very surprising comment to us and it was not even backed up by references. The other reviewers did acknowledge the novelty of the idea. To the best of our knowledge, using the SR as an exploration bonus has never been done before.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper29/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper29/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper29/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Count-Based Exploration with the Successor Representation", "abstract": "The problem of exploration in reinforcement learning is well-understood in the tabular case and many sample-efficient algorithms are known.

There is indeed an inconsistency between the use of the norm of the SR in the theorem and in the function approximation case. It is not uncommon though that a theoretically derived result must be adapted to better work when combined with complex function approximators such as neural networks. Shortly, we haven't been able yet to obtain results with the l1 norm that are as good as those we've obtained with the l2 norm. This doesn't change the fact that the theorem does provide an intuition for why the idea we propose works. There is an obvious relationship between the norms as well (e.g., through the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality).\n\nRegarding our results in Atari, we strongly disagree that they are not convincing. Our experiments intend to show that our algorithm performs as well as the pseudo-count based methods, but without requiring a density model, which is is a big plus. If we compare the performance of our algorithm to DQN+PixelCNN we see that it outperforms this baseline in 4 out of 6 games.

This choice was obviously motivated by the cost of running some of these experiments as well (notice we use 10 runs everywhere, which is at least twice the traditional number of runs in the field). If the auxiliary task explained the reported results in Montezuma's Revenge that would mean that our results were fully explained by the auxiliary task and the new network parameters.

We try to clarify the main items below.\n\n- Definition of the loss of the SR: As we discussed in Section 2, the SR can be learned with TD learning, similarly to how a value function is learned. This is exactly what we do with the SR. Thus, our loss is simply motivated by DQN. Finally, there is indeed an equivalent Bellman equation for the SR where the reward is replaced by an indicator function of state visitation (or by a feature vector in the linear function approximation case). We know, since DQN, how to use a deep neural network to learn a value function (minimizing the squared TD error).\n\n- Motivation for the proposed architecture: Our architecture was motivated by related work (Oh et al., 2016; Kulkarni et al., 2016; Machado et al., 2017). It is actually fairly simple. We use an auxiliary task to predict the next screen using the architecture proposed by Oh et al. (2016) and a fully connected layer to predict the SR, which has been shown to work in the past (Kulkarni et al., 2016; Machado et al., 2017). Actually, Machado et al. (2017) basically proposed this architecture, we just added a new head to predict the Q-values, as done by DQN. Our main contribution is not the architecture.\n\n- We refer the reviewer to the equation between equations 3 and 4 in our paper, the one that defines the SR, to explain what we mean by a reward of 1 being observed at each time step. Psi(s,s') is an entry in the matrix. When computing the norm of Psi(s), we are actually looking at a row of the matrix Psi, taking into consideration all future states. I{S_t = s'} is going to be true for only one of the future states, which means that in vector notation, the observed \"reward\" will be always 1.\n\n- Tau is set to 0.1 in our experiments.

Finally, the proposed algorithm had been tested on simulated examples, and several hard exploration Atari domains.\n\nIn general, there are some interesting ideas in this paper, while the empirical justification may not be strong enough. My pros and cons are summarized as follows. \nPros:\n- The idea of using SR for pseudo count in deep RL is novel.\n- Theorem 1 shows the interesting connection between state visit count and the proposed SR.\n- The experiments on Atari games show some promise for using SR (but not that much).\nCons:\n- There are a few inconsistencies regarding the use of SR. For example, the tabular case used the minus l1 norm as the reward bonus; however, the Atari case instead set the bonus to be the reciprocal of the l2 norm. \n- Other than the Montezuma's Revenge, it's difficult to draw the conclusion that using SR can generally lead to better exploration performance, based on the last two columns of Table 2.\n- The definition of loss L_{SR} is a bit unclear: Is there something similar to the Bellman equation you can say about SR? I also don't quite understand the motivation for the architecture between \\phi and \\psi in Figure 1.\n- A few small comments/questions are listed as follows.\n  1. When discussing the impact of the introduced auxiliary task, it would be more convincing to show the performance of games other than Montezuma's Revenge.\n  2.

Both learning algorithms are optimized together.\n\nThis initial algorithm is fairly simple in its description and builds on well established ideas in RL. The authors then \u2018evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed exploration bonus in a standard model-based algorithm\u2019 against other baselines. They do explain how the model is learned, but not how the policy is optimized.\n\nThe remainder of the manuscript applies the same idea to different settings.\nFor large state spaces, The SR expected visits are learned using TD along with state action value functions. The counts of visitations are replaced by features that are also learned.\n\nOverall, the manuscript is rather confusing.\nThe SSR theorem is stated (with no real intuition and the actual bounds on n(s) left for the reader to derive). It is not well motivated. Why would we want expected counts and not the discounted version?\nThen the remainder of the paper actually makes no use of this theorem, but only use it as a distant inspiration. Tentative connections are made such as TD underestimating SR thus leading to a result more akin to SSR, which is highly speculative. It is also irrelevant since features are learned anyway.\n\nThe final proposed architecture has many additions to a simple DQN (the reconstruction + the exploration bonus + the MMC). This makes it difficult to understand what the contribution of the exploration bonus is.\nIt does not help that results are manually extracted from histograms found in  papers.\n\nOverall, although the intuition is interesting (though not so new).\nThe overall motivation and structure of this manuscript makes think it does not match the standards of ICLR for publication\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper29/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Count-Based Exploration with the Successor Representation", "abstract": "The problem of exploration in reinforcement learning is well-understood in the tabular case and many sample-efficient algorithms are known.

To achieve this they propose you use the successor function which basically counts how often a state has been visited. At first the show this for discrete settings and extend their approach to the continuous state spaces in the Atari 2600 environments. \n\nThe paper is well written and the motivation and methods are clear from the beginning. \n\nMy biggest concerning is regarding the experimental results of this work. In Table 1 the authors show the results for the tabular games River Swim and Six Arms and copare their approach which they dub ESSR to three methods (E3, R-MAX, MBIE). The numbers in the table indicate that their method ESSR is outperforming E3 and R-MAX on both environments but is itself outperformed by MBIE. The authors don't mention this at al in the respective paragraph nor do the provide a reason as to why this could be case. Also, they neither introduce any of these methods nor do the explain the meaning of the acronyms. Only in the section 6 (of 7) they talk about related works are R-MAX and E3 introduced briefly. But yet again, MBIE is not mentioned. \n\nI have similar concerns about the results presented for the Atari benchmarks. In table 2 the authors compare their method to the classic DQN approach and two more approaches. While their approach outperforms DQN in almost all tasks, this does not hold for the remaining algorithms. Their method is being outperformed in all but one (Venture) task, where they report a higher variance and a small performance boost compared to DQN_e^MMC. Also it is not clear to me where the numbers for the DNQ_e^MMC come from. The authors just say \"[...] denotes another baseline used in the comparison\". Is this the proposed method of this work but without the successor representation?\n\nIn my opinion this work is lacking some clear and convincing results.  Is the main benefit of this method that it does not rely on domain-specific knowledge? If so, then it is not communicated clearly.
