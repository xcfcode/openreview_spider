No \"exciting new ideas\".", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "review": "The abstract presents a co-segmentation approach that is trained in a semi-supervised manner. As one would expect, the semi-supervised model works better than a model trained just on the small set of fully supervised data and worse than the model that would be obtained if the unlabeled data were labeled, also. From the abstract, however, it is not entirely clear what ingredients are essential to make the approach work: the proposed approach seems like a straightforward combination of prior work on co-segmentation and producing segmentation masks with image-classification convnets (Oquab & Bottou; Zhou, ..., & Torralba). It performs roughly on par with a prior approach by Papandreou et al. (the image-level labels are unlikely to help much on the dataset that is studied in the abstract).\n\nIt is also unclear how well the results compare with other co-segmentation approaches (Joulin, Bach, & Ponce) or with generic object proposal algorithms such as SharpMask (Pinheiro et al.). More in general, human body part segmentation doesn't seem like the right task to be studying segmentation approaches with limited supervision on: there exist many datasets with human and / or body part segmentations, so why not use those annotations? The proposed method seems more suitable for segmentation of infrequent object classes for which few annotated examples (not even image-level annotations) are available.\n\nOverall, the approach described here may be of interest, but a lot of additional work is needed to know for sure. Having said that, I think the submission does not meet the bar for the ICLR workshops, because it does not present any clear novel ideas --- it is mostly combining existing approaches in a slightly different learning setting. I would recommend the authors to submit a more detailed version of this study to a venue such as CVPR or ICCV.\n\n\n\nMinor comment: Table 2 is very hard to read; the data should be presented in learning curves.", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Cosegmentation Loss: Enhancing segmentation with a Few Training Samples by Transferring Region Knowledge to Unlabeled Images", "abstract": "We treat semantic segmentation where a few pixel-wise labeled samples\nand a large number of unlabeled samples are available.
