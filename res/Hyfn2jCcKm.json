As common in recent applications like AlphaZero, the RL part learns a deep network for policy and a value function that reduce the breadth (policy) and depth (value function) of the tree searched in MCTS. This basic idea without extensions fails when trying to solve the Rubik cube because there is only one final success state so the early random policies and value functions never reach it. The solution proposed by the authors, called autodidactic iteration (ADI) is to start from the final state, construct a few previous states, and learn value function on this data where in a few moves a good state is reached. The distance to the final state is then increased and the value function learn more and more. This is an interesting idea that solves the Rubik cube, but the paper lacks a more detailed study. What other problems can be solved like this? Would a single successful trajectory be enough to use it in a wider context (as in https://blog.openai.com/learning-montezumas-revenge-from-a-single-demonstration/) ? Is the method to increase distance from final state specific to Rubik cube or general? Is the training stable with respect to this or is it critical to get it right?

The first is planning problems in environments with a high number of states. The second type of problem is when you need to find one specific goal but might not know what the goal is. However, if you have examples of solved examples you can train a value function using ADI on these solved examples and hopefully it will transfer to the new problems. For instance, in protein folding, the goal is to find the protein conformation with minimal free energy. We don\u2019t know what the optimal conformation is beforehand, but we can train a value network using ADI on proteins where we know what their optimal conformation is. \n\n\n> \u201cWould a single successful trajectory be enough to use it in a wider context? (as in https://blog.openai.com/learning-montezumas-revenge-from-a-single-demonstration/)\u201d\n\nFor our method to work, all we need is the ability to start from the goal state and take moves in reverse. Therefore, not only is a single successful trajectory sufficient, all that is needed is the final state of that successful trajectory: the goal state. Using only the goal state, it can generate other states by randomly taking actions away from the goal state.\n\n> \u201cIs the method to increase distance from final state specific to Rubik cube or general?\u201d\n\nThe core concept is that the agent uses dynamic programming to propagate knowledge from easier examples to more difficult examples. Therefore, this method is applicable to any scenario in which one can generate a range of states whose difficulty ranges from easy to hard. For our method, we achieved this by randomly scrambling the cube 1 to N times. There has been other work in the field of robotics [1], as well as the work on Montezuma\u2019s Revenge provided by the reviewer, that builds a curriculum starting by first generating states close to the goal and then progressively increasing the difficulty as performance increases. Instead of adaptively changing the state distribution during training, our method fixes the state distribution before training while the targets for the state values change as the agent learns.\n\n> \u201cIs the training stable with respect to this or is it critical to get it right?\u201d\n\nWe found that the value of N, the maximum number of times to scramble the solved cube, was not crucial to the stability of training. It only had an effect on the final performance. If N was too low (e.g. 5), then DeepCube only performed well on cubes close to the solutions, but not on more complicated cubes. If N was too high (e.g. 100), then it took more iterations to learn; nonetheless, the agent would still learn. We found that N=30 resulted in both good value function estimation as well as reasonable training time.\n\n[1] Florensa, C., Held, D., Wulfmeier, M., Zhang, M., & Abbeel, P. (2017).

From this single positive reward given at the solved state, DeepCube learns a value function. Using dynamic programming, DeepCube improves its value estimate by first learning the value of states one move away from the solution and then building off of this knowledge to improve its value estimate for states that get progressively further away from the solution.\n\n> \u201cDo you have solving time comparison between your method and other approximate methods?\u201d\n\nYes, we have improved the efficiency of our solver since we last submitted our paper by optimizing our code.

These results are summarized in section C of the appendix of the updated paper. While Rokicki\u2019s algorithm is faster, Rokicki\u2019s algorithm also uses knowledge of groups, subgroups, cosets, symmetry, and pattern databases. On the other hand, our algorithm does not exploit any of this knowledge and learns how to solve the Rubik\u2019s Cube given only basic information about the problem. In addition, Rokicki\u2019s solver uses 182GB of memory to run whereas ours uses at most 1GB. These differences are summarized in the updated paper. We are currently making better use of parallel processing and memory to improve the speed of our algorithm.\n\n[1] Rokicki, T., Kociemba, H., Davidson, M., & Dethridge, J. (2014).

The particularity of this algorithm is to handle the huge state space and very sparse reward of the Rubik's cube. To do so, a) it ensures each training batch contains states close to the reward by scrambling the solution; b) it computes an approximate value and policy for that state using the current model and c) it weights data points based by the inverse of the number of random moves from the solution used to generate that training point. The resulting model is compared to two non-ML algorithms and shown to be competitive either on computational speed or on the quality of the solution.  \n\nThis paper is well written and clear. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to handle the Rubik's cube problem so well. The specificities of this problem make it interesting. While the idea of starting from the solution seemed straightforward at first, the paper describes more advanced tricks claimed to be necessary to make the algorithm work.

However, the Rubik\u2019s Cube has only a single solved state, and episodes are not guaranteed to terminate. This poses a major problem for these API algorithms since they rely on the reward received at the end of the game. We introduce Autodidactic Iteration: an API algorithm that overcomes the problem of sparse rewards by training on a distribution of states that allows the reward to propagate from the goal state to states farther away. Autodidactic Iteration is able to learn how to solve the Rubik\u2019s Cube and the 15-puzzle without relying on human data. Our algorithm is able to solve 100% of randomly scrambled cubes while achieving a median solve length of 30 moves \u2014 less than or equal to solvers that employ human domain knowledge.", "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "Rubik's Cube", "approximate policy iteration", "deep learning", "deep reinforcement learning"], "authorids": ["smcaleer@uci.edu", "fagostin@uci.edu", "ashmakov@uci.edu", "pfbaldi@ics.uci.edu"], "authors": ["Stephen McAleer", "Forest Agostinelli", "Alexander Shmakov", "Pierre Baldi"], "TL;DR": "We solve the Rubik's Cube with pure reinforcement learning", "pdf": "/pdf/c56062fd2a47056b342d015f009198c615023653.pdf", "paperhash": "mcaleer|solving_the_rubiks_cube_with_approximate_policy_iteration", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nmcaleer2018solving,\ntitle={Solving the Rubik's Cube with Approximate Policy Iteration},\nauthor={Stephen McAleer and Forest Agostinelli and Alexander Shmakov and Pierre Baldi},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyfn2jCcKm},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper750/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234384794, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "Hyfn2jCcKm", "replyto": "Hyfn2jCcKm", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper750/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335794867, "tmdate": 1552335794867, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper750/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 9}
