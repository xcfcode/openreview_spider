The approach was evaluated on several Atari games, Super Mario, and VizDoom.\n\nThere are several strengths to this work, including the fact that it comes with open source code, and several reviewers agree it\u2019s an interesting approach. R1 thought it was well-written and quite easy to follow. I also commend the authors for being so responsive with comments and for adding the new experiments that were asked for.\n\nThe main issue that reviewers pointed out, and which I am also concerned about, is how these particular games were chosen. R3 points out that these 5 Atari games are not known for being hard exploration games. Authors did conduct further experiments on 6 Atari games suggested by the reviewer, but the results didn\u2019t show significant improvement over baselines.\n\nI appreciate the authors\u2019 argument that every method has \u201cits niche\u201d, but the environments chosen must still be properly motivated. I would have preferred to see results on all Atari games, along with detailed and quantitative analysis into why FICM fails on specific tasks. For instance, they state in the rebuttal that \u201cThe selection criteria of our environments is determined by the relevance of motions of the foreground and background components (including the controllable agent and the uncontrollable objects) to the performance (i.e., obtainable scores) of the agent.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t seem like this was assessed in any quantitative way.  Without this understanding, it\u2019d be difficult for an outsider to know which tasks are appropriate to use with this approach. I urge the authors to focus on expanding and quantifying the work they depict in Figure 8, which, although it begins to illuminate why FICM works for some games and not others, is still only a qualitative snapshot of 2 games. I still think this is a very interesting approach and look forward to future versions of this paper.", "title": "Paper Decision"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["hellochick@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "ymmoy999@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "romulus@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "cylee@gapp.nthu.edu.tw"], "title": "Exploration via Flow-Based Intrinsic Rewards", "authors": ["Hsuan-Kung Yang", "Po-Han Chiang", "Min-Fong Hong", "Chun-Yi Lee"], "pdf": "/pdf/68041685527637e028c9025779e0dcf2222fd5a3.pdf", "abstract": "Exploration bonuses derived from the novelty of observations in an environment have become a popular approach to motivate exploration for reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the past few years.

To address the second concern from the reviewer, we performed further experiments on the suggested six established hard exploration environments with original sparse reward settings, as in [1]. We compared our proposed method with forward dynamics (Random CNN) in [2], which is similar to one of the baselines \"Dynamics\" in [3]. \n\nThe figures of the six environments can be accessed at the following link, https://imgur.com/Jsp3eSm\n\nThese experiments are evaluated for 15M timesteps (~900 parameter updates compared to the experiments in [3]). Please refer to [3] for the results of RND. From the above figure, it can be observed that FICM performs comparably to the forward dynamics baseline in Gravitar, Pitfall, and Solaris, while both of them are not able to acquire any reward in \u201cMontezuma\u2019s Revenge\u201d. However, our results reveal that FICM is able to achieve a score of up to 1000 in Venture within less than 15M timesteps (~900 parameter updates), while RND requires 20K~30K updates to reach the same level of scores. On the contrary, the forward dynamics baseline even fails to receive any reward in this environment.\n\nWe respectfully hope that our results and the above discussions could provide a different perspective for the reviewer to reconsider the evaluation. As we mentioned in our first post, every method has its own niche, while a single and unified algorithm is not our primary purpose and original intention. FICM contributes to the concept of employing flow prediction errors from the field of computer vision to generate intrinsic rewards, which has never been discussed in the literature before. Furthermore, the experimental results presented above are fully reproducible and verifiable. Our source code can be accessed at the following link, https://github.com/IclrPaperID2276/iclr_paper_2276\n\nWe would be glad to discuss further with the reviewer, and are willing to provide additional results should they are necessary. We look forward to hearing from the feedback of the reviewer.\n\n[1] Bellemare, M., Srinivasan, S., Ostrovski, G., Schaul, T., Saxton, D., and Munos, R.

In usual cases, a reference image and a target image are required. The optical flow is represented as a vector field, where displacement vectors are assigned to certain pixels of the reference image. These vectors represent where those pixels can be found in the target image.\n\nIn recent years, a number of deep learning approaches running on GPUs dealing with large displacement issues of optical flow estimation have been proposed [1-3]. FlowNet [1] was the pioneer of constructing Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to solve optical flow estimation problem as a supervised task. The author proposed a correlation layer that provides matching capabilities. FlowNet 2.0 [2], an upgraded version of FlowNet, improves the performance in both quality and speed. They adopt a stacked architecture with the auxiliary path to refine intermediate optical flow, and introduce a warping operation which can compensate for some already estimated preliminary motion in the target image. Furthermore, they elaborate on small displacements by introducing a sub-network specializing in small motions. In this paper, we use a simplified version of FlowNet 2.0 to generate optical flow. For more details definition and computation of warping function, we recommend the reviewer can refer to the supplementary materials as provided in [2].\n\n[Attention area]\nThe visualization method proposed in [4] is able to visualize the part on which the agent concentrates on current observation. It first selects a region from the original observation and blurs it into a perturbed one. Then, the perturbed observation would be fed to the agent to generate a probability distribution of action to be taken. A score of the importance of the selected region is calculated on the difference between this distribution and the original distribution based on the unperturbed observation. At last, the region with a higher score in observation is colored more brightly.\n\n[1] P. Fischer, A. Dosovitskiy, and E. IlgA. et al. FlowNet: Learning optical flow with convolutional networks.

And also, if there is a shortcoming, what are those?\n[Response]\nThanks for raising this interesting question. We would like to address the reviewer\u2019s concern in two different aspects.\n\nFirst, we assume that the stochastic environments mentioned by the reviewer correspond to those in which their state transitions are stochastic. In other words, each state transition is associated with a probability, not totally determined by the action performed by the agent. In such a case, we expect that FICM would still be able to learn and generate meaningful intrinsic rewards from the observations, as it does not require the actions performed by the agent for generating intrinsic rewards. What FICM requires, as discussed in Section 3 of our manuscript, are the current observation and the next observation of the agent. As a result, we believe that FICM would demonstrate robustness to stochastic environments. The determining factor of the agent\u2019s performance in such environments would thus greatly rely on the underlying DRL method for learning the policy. On the contrary, ICM would probably not be able to deliver satisfactory performance for such environments. As the state transitions are unpredictable, the intrinsic curiosity modules have no clue to learn the state transition dynamics from the current observation and the action performed by the agent, thereby might cause large prediction errors. Therefore, poor performance caused by the stochastic environment might still be inevitable.\n\nSecond, we do have an analysis and discussion regarding the limitations of optical flow. This is why we incorporated additional paragraphs in Section 4.3 for discussing the applicable domains of FICM as a balanced discussion. It is not our paper\u2019s objective to claim or argue that optical flow is omnipotent. Optical flow suffers from occlusions or textureless images, which have already been prevalently recognized by researchers in the domain of computer vision. However, it is still widely adopted in numerous researches as an effective tool for extracting information between consecutive frames. Our research similarly intends to leverage this tool in the domain of reinforcement learning. To validate that the prediction errors from an optical flow estimator can indeed serve as a satisfactory novelty indicator, we presented an experiment in Fig. 2 with a discussion to demonstrate that the prediction errors do gradually decrease over training iterations. This implies that FICM is able to learn and gradually become familiar with the transitions and the motions between consecutive observations.\n\n[Comment]\nWhat do the authors think would happen when the action directly does not change the scene, at least immediately?\n[Response]\nWe would like to thank the reviewer for raising this interesting question. For the scenario mentioned by the reviewer, FICM would generate few intrinsic rewards under such a circumstance, as the transition between the current state and next state is negligible. The agent would therefore be motivated to explore other states. However, if unfamiliar uncontrollable moving objects suddenly appear in the current observation of the agent, FICM would generate intrinsic rewards to encourage the agent to explore the current state more.\n\n[Comment]\nTypos and rephrasing suggestions.\n[Response]\nThe authors sincerely appreciate the reviewer\u2019s kindness for pointing out typos and providing constructive rephrasing suggestions (e.g., the \u201caim\u201d issue). We will definitely revise the manuscript according to the suggestions in our final version.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2276/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2276/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["hellochick@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "ymmoy999@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "romulus@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "cylee@gapp.nthu.edu.tw"], "title": "Exploration via Flow-Based Intrinsic Rewards", "authors": ["Hsuan-Kung Yang", "Po-Han Chiang", "Min-Fong Hong", "Chun-Yi Lee"], "pdf": "/pdf/68041685527637e028c9025779e0dcf2222fd5a3.pdf", "abstract": "Exploration bonuses derived from the novelty of observations in an environment have become a popular approach to motivate exploration for reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the past few years.

We agree with the reviewer and have prepared additional paragraphs at the end of this response post, including the background materials for optical flow, FlowNet, warping approach, as well as attention area. We would be glad to incorporate those paragraphs into our manuscript, and discuss with you should you have any further comments or suggestions regarding the sufficiency of the background material.\n\n[Comment]\nIt would be helpful to have a better evaluation of this paper if the authors could clarify and motivate the choice of games in their empirical study. For example the empirical study in Figure 5.\n[Response]\nWe would like to thank the reviewer for raising this question, and are glad to share our perspectives with the reviewer. The selection criteria of our environments is determined by the relevance of motions of the foreground and background components (including the controllable agent and the uncontrollable objects) to the performance (i.e., obtainable scores) of the agent. As the primary theme of this work is to leverage flow features as intrinsic reward signals, we benchmarked our methodology on Atari and Super Mario Bros game environments characterizing sophisticated motions of objects. Taking the Atari game \u201cEnduro\u201d for example. The agent not only has to understand the motion of its controllable car, but is also required to perceive and comprehend the motions of the other cars, as their motions are directly related to the final score of this agent. BeamRider, on the other hand, is not considered as an environment satisfying the above property. According to our experiments, our method does assist the agents to explore better and deliver more satisfactory results in the environments satisfying the above criteria. As a result, instead of focusing on those hard-explored environments, the emphasis of this paper is on bringing to the community the existence and effectiveness of flow-based intrinsic rewards, and motivating researchers with a potential direction in their future endeavors. We have therefore dedicated significant portions of our manuscript to demonstrating and validating that FICM is able to master the environments featuring the above property, and is more effective than other intrinsic motivated approaches when motion features play a vital role in determining the performance of the agents.\n\nMoreover, as the necessity of taking complex motion features into account during the exploration phase of an agent becomes critically important for first-person perspective games, we benchmarked the proposed FICM on ViZDoom, and showed that FICM is naturally more capable of capturing motion features than the baseline methods in Section 4 of our manuscript. As human beings and animals inherently tend to be motivated, attracted, and encouraged by moving objects, we consider that our approach aligns with animal instinct, and believe that our work brings a different perspective to the reinforcement learning community.\n\nFurthermore, in order to provide a balanced analysis of FICM as a complete and comprehensive study, we additionally conducted another set of experiments on \u201cBeamRider\u201d to reveal the limitation of FICM and discussed its applicable domains in Section 4.3. Based on the motivations discussed above, we consider that the flow-based intrinsic reward is worth sharing with the community in ICLR. FICM contributes to the concept of employing flow prediction errors to generate intrinsic rewards, which has never been discussed in the literature before. Rather than finding a panacea for RL exploration, we consider that introducing different perspectives of intrinsic rewards to the existing set of approaches is more likely the correct way to proceed.\n\nWe hope that the above discussions have adequately responded to the reviewer\u2019s concerns, and hope that the reviewer can take our perspective into consideration.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2276/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2276/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["hellochick@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "ymmoy999@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "romulus@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "cylee@gapp.nthu.edu.tw"], "title": "Exploration via Flow-Based Intrinsic Rewards", "authors": ["Hsuan-Kung Yang", "Po-Han Chiang", "Min-Fong Hong", "Chun-Yi Lee"], "pdf": "/pdf/68041685527637e028c9025779e0dcf2222fd5a3.pdf", "abstract": "Exploration bonuses derived from the novelty of observations in an environment have become a popular approach to motivate exploration for reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the past few years.

Like leaves trembling in the wind. ICM was proposed to eliminate those effects in the first place, but what is this paper\u2019s solution to that problem? Furthermore, the experiments on BeamRider show that this concern is not a theoretical one but quite practical.\n[Response]\nWe would like to thank the reviewer for raising the question about \u201cspurious curiosity\u201d. Conventionally, researchers believe that uncontrollable parts (e.g., trembling leaves) in the environment cause spurious curiosity which may mislead an agent\u2019s exploration. Researchers in the past few years have spent tremendous efforts on eliminating such impacts. However, we argue that spurious curiosity is not always caused by uncontrollable parts from an agent\u2019s observations, and not removing them should not be a weakness. In fact, uncontrollable parts sometimes play key roles for effective exploration.\n\nUncontrollable parts are crucial for success in several games in which other objects\u2019 behaviors are related to the agent\u2019s score. For example, in \u201cEnduro\u201d, comprehending the other cars\u2019 motions is the key to learn a good driving policy. Knowing more about their policies helps the agent make better decisions. However, filtering out uncontrollable parts, as ICM does, prohibits an effective exploration of the others\u2019 acts. This is because the uncontrollable movements of the others might be ignored by ICM. As opposed to ICM, our method preserves the other objects\u2019 motions, enabling effective exploration in games that require the involvement of them. It is worth noticing that in Fig. 5, our method outperforms ICM in \u201cEnduro\u201d by a drastic margin.\n\nOn the other hand, uncontrollable parts do hinder the performance of our method in some cases like \u201cBeamRider\u201d. In this game, constantly rolling decorated beams in the game screen are not related to the agent\u2019s scores. Endlessly pursuing curiosity produced by those beams could mislead the exploration direction and thus might result in poor performance. In such a case, filtering out uncontrollable parts could be an answer since focusing on the agent\u2019s motion is the key to success in this game.\n\nTo conclude, we believe that removing uncontrollable parts is not a panacea for all scenarios. In fact, whether or not eliminating those uncontrollable is problem-dependent and a tradeoff when designing intrinsic rewards.\n\n[Minor concerns] \nThe authors sincerely appreciate the reviewer's kindness for pointing out our typos (e.g., \"5 instead of 8\" and \"sparse\") and readability issues, and providing constructive formatting and rephrasing suggestions.

However, we do have different perspectives on this issue and would be glad to discuss our points of view with the reviewer in the following two aspects.\n\nFirst, the selection criteria of our environments is determined by the relevance of motions of the foreground and background components (including the controllable agent and the uncontrollable objects) to the performance (i.e., obtainable scores) of the agent. Taking the Atari game \u201cEnduro\u201d for example. The agent not only has to understand the motion of its controllable car, but is also required to perceive and comprehend the motions of the other cars, as their motions are directly related to the final score of this agent. BeamRider, on the other hand, is not considered as an environment satisfying the above property. Instead of focusing on those hard-explored environments, the main emphasis of this paper is on bringing to the community the existence and effectiveness of flow-based intrinsic rewards, and motivating researchers with a potential direction in their future endeavors. As a result, we have dedicated significant portions of our manuscript to demonstrating and validating that FICM is able to master the environments featuring the above property, and is more effective than other intrinsic motivated approaches when motion features play a vital role in determining the performance of the agents.\n\nSecond, even though we did not present experiments for all Atari games, we do believe that our current experiments sufficiently explain and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. From our perspective, carrying out experiments on tailored environments is not evil. Every method has its own niche. We do believe different types of intrinsic rewards have their best fit for different scenarios, and it is difficult to find one approach being suitable for every situation. As a result, a single and unified algorithm should not be the ultimate goal of research, and is absolutely not our primary purpose and original intention. For example, although RND delivers superior performance in \u201cMontezuma\u2019s Revenge\u201d, it performs poorly in the experiments presented in Fig. 5 of our paper. On the contrary, our method does assist the agents to explore better and deliver more satisfactory results in the environments satisfying the above criteria. In order to provide a balanced viewpoint of FICM, we further conducted another set of experiments on \u201cBeamRider\u201d to reveal the limitation of FICM and discussed its applicable domains in Section 4.3. Therefore, rather than finding a panacea for RL exploration, we consider that introducing different perspectives of intrinsic rewards to the existing set of approaches is more likely the correct way to proceed.\n\nWe hope that the above discussions have adequately responded to the reviewer\u2019s concerns, and hope that the reviewer can take our perspectives into consideration.\n\n===To respond to the reviewer\u2019s detailed comments===\n[Comment]\nIf you omit the rewards the question remains how to select hyperparameters of your method. Was the game reward used for selecting hyperparameters? If not, what is the protocol for their selection?\n[Response]\nWe would like to bring to the reviewer\u2019s attention that the game rewards are not used to select hyperparameters for either the agent or the intrinsic module. The hyperparameters of the agents are aligned with those of the baselines in each experiment for fair comparisons. Please note that we did not select the hyperparameters by any specific protocol - we just use the same ones as the baselines. Our hyperparameters are provided in our supplementary material. If you are interested, we have already uploaded our source codes as well as the demonstration videos to the following sites.

PPO is normally significantly better than A3C. Why isn\u2019t it used throughout the whole paper?\n[Response]\nWe would like to thank the reviewer for raising this question. Since we intended to reproduce the results of [2] and compare with them, we directly executed their officially released open-source codes, where the solver is A3C. We only replaced their intrinsic module by our own method for a fair comparison.

Please note that we first address the two major concerns from the reviewer, which also cover our responses to a few questions raised in the detailed comments part provided by the reviewer. Then, we respond to the remaining questions raised in the detailed comments part.\n\n===To address two major concerns===\n[Comment]\nBetter motivating the approach in the paper would help. Why using the flow prediction error as a curiosity signal?\n[Response]\nWe appreciate the time and efforts of the reviewer to read through the paper thoroughly. As the reviewer has raised concerns about the motivations of FICM, we would definitely love to share our perspectives with the reviewer and expect a rigorous discussion afterward.\n\n\uff37e believe that rapidly changing parts in two consecutive frames, i.e., motion features extracted by a flow predictor, do usually serve as an important indicator of information in an environment. As depicted in Fig. 1, the motions of Mario and the fire traps contain essential information for the agent to perform well in SuperMario Bros. Biologically, human beings and animals also tend to concentrate on motion features of objects. For instance, animals may not be able to memorize the exact appearance of the objects in their habitats, but do posses the capability to discover whether or not unfamiliar newcomers have intruded into their territories. It is a natural instinct that arouses an animal\u2019s curiosity from motions of unfamiliar feature patterns appearing in its field of view. Our FICM is therefore inspired by the observations mentioned above, and is designed to focus on motion features of objects extracted from two consecutive frames by adopting optical flow estimation for evaluating the novelty of the frames.\n\nWe do agree with the reviewer\u2019s concern about the limitations of optical flow. This is why we incorporated additional paragraphs in Section 4.3 for discussing the applicable domains of FICM as a balanced discussion. It is not our paper\u2019s objective to claim or argue that optical flow is omnipotent. Optical flow suffers from occlusions or textureless images, which have already been prevalently recognized by researchers in the domain of computer vision. However, it is still widely adopted in numerous researches as an effective tool for extracting information between consecutive frames. Our research similarly intends to leverage this tool in the domain of reinforcement learning. To validate that the prediction errors from an optical flow estimator can indeed serve as a satisfactory novelty indicator, we presented an experiment in Fig. 2 with a discussion to demonstrate that the prediction errors do gradually decrease over training iterations. This implies that FICM is able to learn and gradually become familiar with the transitions and the motions between consecutive observations in spite of those potential problems.\n\nBased on the motivations discussed above, we consider that the flow-based intrinsic reward is worth sharing with the community in ICLR. FICM contributes to the concept of employing flow prediction errors to generate intrinsic rewards, which has never been discussed in the literature before. The concept is proposed to bring new insights to the research community, and provide a potential direction for future enhancements in the realm of intrinsic reward based exploration."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2276/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2276/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["hellochick@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "ymmoy999@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "romulus@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "cylee@gapp.nthu.edu.tw"], "title": "Exploration via Flow-Based Intrinsic Rewards", "authors": ["Hsuan-Kung Yang", "Po-Han Chiang", "Min-Fong Hong", "Chun-Yi Lee"], "pdf": "/pdf/68041685527637e028c9025779e0dcf2222fd5a3.pdf", "abstract": "Exploration bonuses derived from the novelty of observations in an environment have become a popular approach to motivate exploration for reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the past few years.

To the best of my knowledge, this was the first paper proposed to use moving patterns in two consecutive observations to motivate agent exploration.\n\nBalanced view: \n- The authors discussed both the advantages of FICM and settings that FICM might fail to perform well, and conducted experiments to better help the readers understand such nuances. Such balanced view should be valuable to RL communities in both academia and industry.\n\nClarity:  \n- In general this was a very well-written paper, I had no difficulty in following the paper throughout. The proposed method (FICM) was clearly motivated, and the authors provided good coverage of related works. Notably, the authors reviewed two relevant methods upon which FICM was motivated, which made the paper self-contained.\n\n\nCons\nExperiments:\n- Experiments were conducted only using a few recent results as baselines (ICM, forward dynamics, RND). It would be interesting to compare FICM against simpler exploration baselines such as epsilon-greedy or entropy regularization.\n- I\u2019d also like to see more extensive comparisons between FICM and ICM across different datasets, for example, Super Mario Bros. and the Atari games, instead of only comparing FICM against ICM on ViZDoom.\n\nSignificance of the innovation: \n- The proposed exploration method seemed to be applicable with a particular RL setting: the environment changes could be represented through consecutive frames (e.g., video games), and optical flow could be used to interpret any object displacements in such consecutive frames. And as the authors discussed, even under such constraints the applicability of proposed method depends on how much changes of the environment were relevant to the goal.\n\nReproducibility:\n- Although the authors discussed the experiment setting in detail in supplements, I believe open-sourcing the code / software used to conduct the experiments would be greatly help with the reproducibility of the proposed method for researchers or practitioners.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nA good paper overall, but the experiments were relatively weak (common for most ICLR submissions) and the novelty was somewhat limited.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2276/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2276/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["hellochick@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "ymmoy999@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "romulus@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "cylee@gapp.nthu.edu.tw"], "title": "Exploration via Flow-Based Intrinsic Rewards", "authors": ["Hsuan-Kung Yang", "Po-Han Chiang", "Min-Fong Hong", "Chun-Yi Lee"], "pdf": "/pdf/68041685527637e028c9025779e0dcf2222fd5a3.pdf", "abstract": "Exploration bonuses derived from the novelty of observations in an environment have become a popular approach to motivate exploration for reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the past few years.

The prediction is done with Flownet-v2 architecture and the training is formulated as self-supervision (instead of the ground-truth-based supervised learning in the original Flownet-v2 paper). The flow predictor takes two frames, predicts forward and backward flows, then warps the first/second frame respectively and compares the warped result with real frame. The comparison error serves as the intrinsic reward signal. The results are demonstrated on 7 environments: SuperMario + 5 Atari games + ViZDoom. On those environments, the proposed method performs better or on-par with ICM and RND baselines. \n\nI am leaning towards rejecting this paper. Two key factors motivate this decision. \nFirst, the motivation for this work is not fully clear: why would the error in flow prediction be a good driving force for curiosity? Optical flow has certain weaknesses, e.g. might not work well for textureless regions because it's hard to find a match. Why would those weaknesses drive the agent to new locations? \nSecond, the choice of tasks where the largest improvement is shown (i.e. 5 Atari games) seems not well-motivated and rather crafted for the proposed method. Those 5 Atari games are not established hard exploration games.\n\nDetailed arguments for the decision above:\n[major concerns]\n* Analysis is need on how the method deals with known optical flow problems: occlusion, large displacements, matching ambiguities. Those problems don't fully go away with learning and it is unclear how correlated corresponding errors would be with state novelty.\n* \"Please note that ri is independent of the action taken by the agent, which distinguishes FICM from the intrinsic curiosity module (ICM) proposed in Pathak et al. (2017)\" - but would it then be susceptible to spurious curiosity effects when the agent is drawn to motion of unrelated things? Like leaves trembling in the wind. ICM was proposed to eliminate those effects in the first place, but what is this paper's solution to that problem? Furthermore, the experiments on BeamRider show that this concern is not a theoretical one but quite practical.\n* \"CrazyClimber, Enduro, KungFuMaster, Seaquest, and Skiing\" - none of those Atari environments are known to be hard exploration games (which are normally Gravitar, Montezuma Revenge, Pitfall!, PrivateEye, Solaris, Venture according to Bellemare et al \"Unifying count-based exploration and intrinsic motivation\"). I understand that every game becomes hard-exploration if the rewards are omitted but then there is a question why those particular games. Moreover, if you omit the rewards the question remains how to select hyperparameters of your method. Was the game reward used for selecting hyperparameters? If not, what is the protocol for their selection? This is a very important question and I hope the authors will address this.\n* \"These games are characterized by moving objects that require the agents to concentrate on and interact with.\" - this looks like tailoring the task to suit the method.\n* Figure 6 - those results are not great compared to the results of Episodic Curiosity: https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02274 . Maybe this is because of the basic RL solver (A3C vs PPO) but that brings up another question: why are different solvers used for different tasks in this paper? PPO is normally significantly better than A3C, why not use throughout the whole paper?\n[minor concerns]\n* Figures are very small and the font in them is not readable. Figure 2 is especially difficult to read because the axes titles are tiny.\n* \"complex or spare reward\" -> sparse\n* \"However, RND does not consider motion features, which are essential in motivating an agent for exploration.\" - this is unclear, why are those features essential?\n* \"We demonstrated the proposed methodology and compared it against a number of baselines on Atari games, Super Mario Bros., and ViZDoom.\" - please state more clearly that only 5 out of 57 Atari games are considered, here and in the abstract.\n* \"Best extrinsic returns on eight Atari games and Super Mario Bros.\" - but only 5 games are shown, where are the other 3?\n\nSuggestions on improving the paper:\n1) Better motivating the approach in the paper would help. Why using the flow prediction error as a curiosity signal?\n2) Better motivating the choice of the environments and conducting experiments on more environments would be important for evaluating the impact of the paper."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2276/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2276/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["hellochick@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "ymmoy999@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "romulus@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "cylee@gapp.nthu.edu.tw"], "title": "Exploration via Flow-Based Intrinsic Rewards", "authors": ["Hsuan-Kung Yang", "Po-Han Chiang", "Min-Fong Hong", "Chun-Yi Lee"], "pdf": "/pdf/68041685527637e028c9025779e0dcf2222fd5a3.pdf", "abstract": "Exploration bonuses derived from the novelty of observations in an environment have become a popular approach to motivate exploration for reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the past few years.

The authors propose a new intrinsic curiosity-based method that deploys the methods developed in optical flow. Following this algorithm, the agents utilize the reconstruction error in the optical flow network to come up with intrinsic rewards. The authors show that this approach boosts up the behavior of the RL agents and improves the performance on a set of test environments. \n\nA few comments that I hope might help the authors to improve the clarity of their paper. \n\n1) While the paper is nicely written, I would encourage the authors, of course, if they think necessary, to make the paper slightly more self-contained by explaining the optical flow problem, FlowNet, and warping approach. While a cruise reader might be required to either know literature in optical flow or go and study them along with this paper, it might be helpful for a bit more general readers to have these tools and approaches in access.\n\n2) Regarding the first line of introduction, I would recommend to rephrase it to one imply that the mentioned \"aim\" is one of the aims of the DRL study. \n\n3) In the fourth line of the intro, the authors mention that the current DRL methods are \"constraint\" to dense reward. I believe the authors' aim was to imply that these methods perform more desirably in dense reward settings rather than being constrained to such settings.\n\n4) I would also recommend to the authors to elaborate more on the term \"attention area\" Greydanue et al 2018.\n\n5) It would be helpful to have a better evaluation of this paper if the authors could clarify and motivate the choice of games in their empirical study. For example the empirical study in Fig 5.\n\n\n6) While I find this study interesting and valuable, the novelty of the approach might fall short to be published at a conference like ICLR with a low acceptance rate. This does not mean that there is anything unscientific about this paper, in fact, the scientific value of this work is appreciated and this work adds a lot to the community. \n\n7) It would also be useful to explicitly explain the advances of this approach over the next frame predictions approaches in stochastic environments. And also, if there is a shortcoming, what are those.\n\n8) Also, what the authors think would happen when the action directly does not change the scene, at least immediately. \n\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2276/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2276/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["hellochick@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "ymmoy999@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "romulus@gapp.nthu.edu.tw", "cylee@gapp.nthu.edu.tw"], "title": "Exploration via Flow-Based Intrinsic Rewards", "authors": ["Hsuan-Kung Yang", "Po-Han Chiang", "Min-Fong Hong", "Chun-Yi Lee"], "pdf": "/pdf/68041685527637e028c9025779e0dcf2222fd5a3.pdf", "abstract": "Exploration bonuses derived from the novelty of observations in an environment have become a popular approach to motivate exploration for reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the past few years.
