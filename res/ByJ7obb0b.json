Instead of using second-order information to compute the update directly (as is done in e.g. Newton method), it is used to estimate the change of the objective function in a pre-computed direction. This is computationally much cheaper than full Newton because (a) the Hessian does not need to be inverted (b) vector-Hessian multiplication is only O(#parameters) for a single sample.\n\nThere are many issues.\n\n### runtime and computational issues ###\n\nFirstly, the paper does not clearly specify the algorithm it espouses. It states: \"once the step direction had been determined, we considered that fixed, took the average of gT Hg and gT \u2207f over all of the sample points to produce m (\u03b1) and then solved for a single \u03b1j value\" You should present pseudo-code for this computation and not leave the reader to determine the detailed order of computation for himself. As it stands, it is not only difficult for the reader to infer these details, but also laborious to determine the computational cost per iteration on some network the reader might wish to apply your algorithm to. Since the paper discusses the computational cost of CR only in vague terms, you should at least provide pseudo-code.\n\nSpecifically, consider equation (80) at the very end of the appendix and consider the very last term in that equation. It contains d^2v/dwdw. This is a \"heavy\" term containing the second derivative of the last hidden layer with respect to weights. You do not specify how you compute this term or quantities involving this term. In a ReLU network, this term is zero due to local linearity, but since you claim that your algorithm is applicable to general networks, this term needs to be analyzed further.\n\nWhile the precise algorithm you suggest is unclear, it's purpose is also unclear. You only use the Hessian to compute the g^THg terms, i.e. for Hessian-vector multiplication. But it is well-known that Hessian-vector multiplication is \"relatively cheap\" in deep networks and this fact has been used for several algorithms, e.g. http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/ECML2011_CAE.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04859.pdf. How is your method for computing g^THg different and why is it superior? \n\nAlso note that the low-rank structure of deep gradients is well-known and not a contribution of this paper. See e.g. https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc17/atc17-zhang.pdf\n\n### Experiments ###\n\nThe experiments are very weak. In a network where weights are initialized to sensible values, your algorithm is shown not to improve upon straight SGD. You only demonstrate superior results when the weights are badly initialized. However, there are a very large number of techniques already that avoid the \"SGD on ReLU network with bad initial weights\" problem. The most well-known are batch normalization, He initialization and Adam but there are many others. I don't think it's a stretch to consider that problem \"solved\". Your algorithm is not shown to address any other problems, but what's worse is that it doesn't even seem to address that problem well. While your learning curves are better than straight SGD, I suspect they are well below the respective curves for He init or batchnorm. In any case, you would need to compare your algorithm against these state-of-the-art methods if your goal is to overcome bad initializations. Also, in appendix A, you state that CR can't even address weights that were initialized to values that are too large.\n\nYou claim that your algorithm helps with \"overcoming plateaus\". While I have heard the claim that deep network optimization suffers from intermediate plateaus before, I have not seen a paper studying / demonstrating this behavior. I suggest you cite several papers that do this and then replicate the plateau situations that arose in those papers and show that CR overcomes them, instead of resorting to a platenau situation that is essentially artificially induced by intentionally bad hyperparameter choices.\n\nI do not understand why your initial learning rate for SGD in figures 2 and 3 (0.02 and 0.01 respectively) differ so much from the initial learning rate under CR. Aren't you trying to show that CR can find the \"correct\" learning rate? Wouldn't that suggest that initial learning rate for SGD should be comparable to the early learning rates chosen by CR? Wouldn't that suggest you should start SGD with a learning rate of around 2 and 0.35 respectively? Since you are annealing the learning rate for SGD, it's going to decline and get close to 0.02 / 0.01 anyway at some point. While this may not be as good as CR or indeed batchnorm or Adam, the blue constant curve you are showing does not seem to be a fair representation of what SGD can do.\n\nYou say the minibatch size is 32. For MNIST, this means that 1 epoch is around 1500 iterations. That means your plots only show the first epoch of training. But MNIST does not converge in 1 epoch. You should show the error curve until convergence is reached. Same for CIFAR. \n\n\"we are not interested in network performance measures such as accuracy and validation error\" I strongly suspect your readers may be interested in those things. You should show validation classification error or at least training classification error in addition to cross-entropy error. \n\n\"we will also focus on optimization iteration rather than wall clock time\" Again, your readers care more about the latter. You need to show either error curves by clock time or the total time to convergence or supplement your iteration-based graphs with a detailed discussion of how long an iteration takes.\n\nThe scope of the experiments is limited because only a single network architecture is considered, and it is not a state-of-the art architecture (no convolution, no normalization mechanism, no skip connections).\n\nYou state that you ran experiments on Adam, Adadelta and Adagrad, but you do not show the Adam results. You say in the text that they were the least favorable for CR. This suggests that you omitted the detailed results because they were unfavorable to you. This is, of course, unacceptable!\n\n### (Un)suitability of ReLU for second-order analysis ###\n\nYou claim to use second-order information over the network to set the step size. Unfortuantely, ReLU networks do not have second-order information! They are locally linear. All their nonlinearity is contained in non-differentiable region boundaries. While this may lead to the Hessian being cheaper to compute, it means it is not representative of the actual behavior of the network. In fact, the only second-order information that is brought to bear in your experiments is the second-order information of the error function. I am not saying that this particular second-order information could not be useful, but you need to make a distinction in your paper between network second-order info and error function second-order info and make explicit that you only use the former in your experiments. As far as I know, most second-order papers use either tanh or a smoothed ReLU (such as the smoothed hinge used recently by Koh & Liang (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04730.pdf)) for experiments to overcome the local linearity.\n\n### The \\sigma hyperparameter ###\n\nYou claim that \\sigma is not as important / hard to set as \\alpha in SGD or Adam. You state: \"We also found that this ap- proach requires less problem-specific information (e.g. an optimal initial learning rate) than other first-order methods in order to perform well.\" You have not provided sufficient evidence for this claim. You say that \\sigma can be chosen by considering powers of 10. In many networks, choosing \\alpha by considering powers of 10 is sufficient! Even if powers of 2 are considered for \\alpha, this would reduce the search effort only by factor log_2(10). Also, what if the range of \\sigma values that need to be considered is larger than the range of \\alpha values? Then setting \\sigma would take more effort.\n\nYou do not give precise protocols how you set \\sigma and how you set \\alpha for non-CR algorithms. This should be clearly specified in Appendix A as it is central to your argument of easing hyperparameter search.\n\n### Minor points ###\n\n- Your introduction could benefit from a few more citations\n- \"The rank of the weighted sum of low rank components (as occurs with mini-batch sampling) is generally larger than the rank of the summed components, however.\" I don't understand this. Every sum can be viewed as a weighted sum and vice versa.\n- Equation (8) could be motivated a bit better. I know it derives from Taylor's theorem, but it might be good to discuss how Taylor's theorem (and its assumptions) relate to deep networks.\n- why the name \"cubic regularization\"? shouldn't it be something like \"quadratic step size tuning\"?\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nThe reason I am giving a 2 instead of a 1 is because the core idea behind the algorithm given seems to me to have potential, but the execution is sorely lacking. \n\nA final suggestion: You advertise as one of your algorithms upsides that it uses exact Hessian information. Howwever, since you only care about the scale of the second-order term and not its direction, I suspect exact calculation is far from necessary and you could get away with very cheap approximations, using for example techniques such as mean field analysis (e.g. http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6322-exponential-expressivity-in-deep-neural-networks-through-transient-chaos.pdf).", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Understanding and Exploiting the Low-Rank Structure of Deep Networks", "abstract": "Training methods for deep networks are primarily variants on stochastic gradient descent.  Techniques that use (approximate) second-order information are rarely used because of the computational cost and noise associated with those approaches in deep learning contexts.  However, in this paper, we show how feedforward deep networks exhibit a low-rank derivative structure.  This low-rank structure makes it possible to use second-order information without needing approximations and without incurring a significantly greater computational cost than gradient descent.  To demonstrate this capability, we implement Cubic Regularization (CR) on a feedforward deep network with stochastic gradient descent and two of its variants.  There, we use CR to calculate learning rates on a per-iteration basis while training on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.  CR proved particularly successful in escaping plateau regions of the objective function.
