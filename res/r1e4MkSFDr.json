We have noticed that there might be some misunderstandings of the concept of a non-uniform time series. We hope our response below will help clarify these misunderstandings.\n\n1. Motivation of CCNN\nOur target applications are non-uniform time series, where the time intervals between any adjacent timestamps can be different. For example, a possible set of time stamps could be {0, 0.01, 5, 7.23, 11.1...}. For such non-uniformly-sampled signals, resampling requires first interpolating the signal. As we have shown in the experiment in section 5.1 and appendix D, the selection of interpolation kernels has a direct influence on the performance, and applying any existing preset interpolation kernels can lead to a compromise in the performance. Motivated by this observation, we proposed the end-to-end method to learn the interpolation kernel in a data-driven way, to eliminate the need of trying through preset interpolation kernels and to overcome the challenge when the underlying interpolation for some time-series is unknown. \n\nPlease note that we are not directly applying continuous convolution, but rather use continuous convolution, together with the sampling theory, to derive the basic CCNN operation, as shown in section 3. The reason why continuous convolution is indispensable in this derivation is that its convolution kernel is well-defined on any possible time stamps, and so it can align with the non-uniform timestamps in the input signal.\n\n2. Stacked CCNN v.s. CCNN + standard CNN\nContinuous convolution layers can be stacked, but it is necessary only when the output timestamps in the previous layers are non-uniform. If the output time intervals of the intermediate CCNN layer are uniform, then applying standard CNN and CCNN in the subsequent layers are equivalent.\n\n3. Strict generalization to standard CNN\nAppendix B provides a theoretical analysis of the relation between standard CNN and CCNN. In short, when the input timestamps and output timestamps are both uniformly sampled, CCNN would be equivalent to standard CNN. Please refer to Appendix B for the formal statement of the theorem and the proof.\n\n4. CCNN v.s. Dilated CNN\nThese two methods have fundamental differences on assumption. Dilated CNN deals with multi-resolution situation, in which for each scale the signal should still be uniformly sample but of difference resolution. CCNN releases the uniform sampling assumption and requires neither the input signal being uniformly sampled nor the intervals sharing some common factor (which could be regarded as finest resolution). \n\n5. Two hot encoding seems another way to discretize, no?\nYes\n\n6. Experiment Result\nCCNN did have spikes in prediction in figure 5, which indeed confirmed its good performance on that task. The y axis of the line chart in figure 5 represents the time interval to the next event, and a spike indicates some events happen after a long time interval from the previous one. We can see the spike of prediction aligns with the spikes of ground truth data, which is the intuitive evidence of CCNN learned the pattern of the temporal point process. Meanwhile, the quantitative performance evaluation also shows its advantage over existing methods on all of the four datasets. \n\n7. Why two hot encoding does not perform that well\nOur experiment controls that all architectures have the same number of hyperparameters. Since the two hot encoding requires more hyperparameters at the input layers, we have reduced the filter size to match the number of hyperparameters to the other architectures. That is why the performance is sometimes compromised.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1575/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1575/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Continuous Convolutional Neural Network forNonuniform Time Series", "authors": ["Hui Shi", "Yang Zhang", "Hao Wu", "Shiyu Chang", "Kaizhi Qian", "Mark Hasegawa-Johnson", "Jishen Zhao"], "authorids": ["hshi@ucsd.edu", "yang.zhang2@ibm.com", "haowu11@illinois.edu", "kqian3@illinois.edu", "jhasegaw@illinois.edu", "jzhao@ucsd.edu"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Convolutional neural network (CNN) for time series data implicitly assumes that the data are uniformly sampled, whereas many event-based and multi-modal data are nonuniform or have heterogeneous sampling rates.

The model learns the interpolation and the convolution kernel functions in an end-to-end manner, so that it can capture the signal patterns and be flexible. A layer has three networks, which learn a kernel function to represent the combination of interpolation and convolution, a bias function to represent the error correction with convolution, and then produce the output based on them. The authors introduce two assumptions and a two-hot encoding scheme for the input to control the model complexity. The paper also introduces an application of the proposed CCNN by combing with temporal point process. Experiments on simulated data compares the proposed method with some degenerative baselines show the advantage of learning the interpolation and the two-hot encoding configuration. The authors compare the performance on time interval prediction task based on real world dataset to show the model produces a better history embedding for the task.\nOverall, the paper has some incremental improvements on the existing methods that dealing with the nonuniform time series data. Instead of using preset interpolation kernels, the proposed model can learn it with the convolution in a data-driven manner.\nThe paper includes clear explanation on module structure and detailed experiment settings.\nThe experiments of signal value prediction support the claims of the advantages of the proposed model.\nThe notation in the caption of figure 1 is a little confusing: is x(t_i\u2019) the same as hat x(t) in the algorithm?\nIt is good that the related works section mentioned the adapted RNNs that are used as baselines in the real-world dataset experiment, and the differences between the proposed model and the related SNNs are introduced.\nHowever, this section and the introduction can be better organized to distinguish the novelty and the contribution of the work.\nIn page 7, the purpose of the reference in the sentence \u201cThe time information is either two-hot encoded (Adams et al., 2010) (CCNN-th), or not encoded (CCNN).\u201d is not very clear.\nIt will be better if there are a little more analysis of the experiment on predicting time intervals to next event.\nThe upper plots in the figure may be not convincing enough to support the claims.\nThe advantage of two-hot encoding seems subtle in the figure 5. Is there any reason for the significantly higher deviation of CCNN-th in StackOverflow?\nSometimes the usage of \u201cCCNN\u201d is not clear, for example, the experiment on speech interpolation compares the \u201cCCNN-th\u201d method with baselines, but uses \u201cCCNN\u201d in the analysis. Also, it could be better to show the \u201cCCNN-th\u201d result in the upper plots of figure 5 instead of \u201cCCNN\u201d.\nMinor comment:\nThere are some typos in the paper, for example, missing the right parenthesis in page3 \u201c(refer to Appendix A.1\u201d, in page4 section 4.1 \u201cAccording to Eq.(4), the input is \u2026\u201d.\n\u201cThe left plot shows\u201d in the last line of the caption of figure 3 should be \u201cright\u201d."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1575/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1575/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Continuous Convolutional Neural Network forNonuniform Time Series", "authors": ["Hui Shi", "Yang Zhang", "Hao Wu", "Shiyu Chang", "Kaizhi Qian", "Mark Hasegawa-Johnson", "Jishen Zhao"], "authorids": ["hshi@ucsd.edu", "yang.zhang2@ibm.com", "haowu11@illinois.edu", "kqian3@illinois.edu", "jhasegaw@illinois.edu", "jzhao@ucsd.edu"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Convolutional neural network (CNN) for time series data implicitly assumes that the data are uniformly sampled, whereas many event-based and multi-modal data are nonuniform or have heterogeneous sampling rates.
