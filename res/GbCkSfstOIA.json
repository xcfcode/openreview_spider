However, the paper has several serious issues with the empirical evaluations. The paper is not at the bar to be accepted.", "review": "This paper attempts to address the semi-supervised learning topic by proposing a method based on an aggregated loss considering both cross-entry and Davies-Bouldin Index. Cross-entropy is used to ensure the maximum margin between classes and Davies-Bouldin Index is applied to the labeled data and to the whole dataset, respectively, to ensure a high quality of clustering. Evaluations in four small and simple datasets are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nThe idea behind the proposed method is pretty simple and straightforward. It makes sense and so I believe that the method proposed is correct conceptually. However, a correct method may not necessarily be effective, which would require an extensive evaluation. That is what the paper lacks. Let me elaborate in detail.\n\nFirst, all the four datasets used in the evaluations are small in scale and simple in class distributions. This is NOT the sate-of-the-art anymore. There are larger in scale and more complex datasets available and why did the authors fail to use these datasets instead?\n\nSecond, the comparison studies reported in Fig. 4 are not clearly documented and possibly are not fair either. Which specific supervised learning method did you use in this comparison? Did you use the same number of labeled data samples for the supervised learning method? The same questions are also raised for the toy example experiment reported in Fig. 3. If the supervised learning method uses the same number of the labeled samples, it is not a fair comparison obviously as your method uses more regularization constraints in the loss function. If a different number of the labeled samples is used, it is not a fair comparison either. Note that more constraints you use in the loss function, the number of labeled samples required can vary more, depending upon the different data distributions. Consequently, the comparison studies as well as the ablation studies reported in Fig. 4 can be misleading, possibly just showing the best case. More datasets with varying complexity in distributions may need to further the comparison studies before any meaningful conclusion can be reached.\n\nThird, Davies-Bouldin Index is just one of the intrinsic evaluation metics for cluster analysis and there are others such as silhouette coefficient and Calinski-Harabasz score. In principle, you may also use these metics. I wonder whether you have investigated this and why you picked up Davies-Bouldin index.\n\nFinally, the paper has a lot of grammatical errors and typos that should have been fixed before the paper was sent in for review.\n\nAs a minor comment, I don\u2019t like the acronym MCMC for this proposed method. The same acronym is already in use as a very popular statistical machine learning method in the literature.

Arguing that SOTA semi-supervised learning methods neglect spatial information (latent clustering structure) in the data, the authors propose a loss function which combines clustering objectives with classification objectives. The proposed loss function combines the cross-entropy loss, the within-cluster scatter as known from k-means, the distance between centroids and the margin between classes. The proposed loss is notably non-continuous since it makes use of the maximum function. The authors employ  ADAM with a learning rate of 0.001 with exponential decay to optimize the novel loss function. Experiments on MNIST and three comparably small datasets show that the proposed method is able to achieve high accuracy with only few labeled data points.\n\nReview:\nCombining the elements of clustering and classification makes total sense for the case of semi-supervised learning. In that view, I find the conducted approach very interesting. However, the paper leaves many details unclear to the reader - in particular with regard to the definition of the loss function and the optimization (see minor issues below). I am missing a discussion about the optimization issues of the proposed loss function. The loss function is not continuous and in practice, this makes a loss susceptible to local minima. There might also be cases where numerical instabilities occur, for example if the centroids are close to each other and the DB loss is dividing by a small constant. In addition, I wonder about the sensitivity to the optimization parameters, such as the learning rate scheduling.\nThe experiments on synthetic data (half moons and three circles) look nice, but don't add much value. The classes/clusters in the datasets can be detected by simple clustering algorithms, additional information by a few labeled data points is not needed. Hence, these datasets are not suitable for demonstrating the power of semi-supervised methods. I would be more interested in examples where the points in one class are actually not connected/close to each other. \nThe experiments on real world data show a good performance of the proposed optimization of the novel loss function. Although  I don't believe that one always has to show experiments on a big, big dataset like imagenet, I think that at least a dataset of the magnitude of Cifar-10 and Cifar-100 should be considered. The learning rate is chosen to be comparatively small. How does that affect the convergence rate of the method on larger datasets? In addition, I would encourage a description of characteristics of the real world datasets which shows why they pose an interesting case (balanced/unbalanced classes, number of classes, easy/difficult to classify). \n\nMinor issues:\n* How are the centroids computed and when? If not all the data is labeled, then we can not compute the centroids as the average of points assigned to one cluster/class, because we need the centroid to determine the assignment of points to clusters/classes. Since DB is also reflecting the distance between centroids, the centroids are apparently additionally learned parameters? This aspect would become more clear if the loss functions would be denoted as functions. That is, instead of denoting a loss as, e.g., DB, denote it as DB(A,X). In Algorithm 1, L_{DB} is defined as DBI(Z_L,y). DBI is not defined as far as I see. I assume that DBI should actually reflect DB. Z are described as the network parameters, but what that entails is unclear.\n* In deep learning, there is actually an inherent connection to k-means clustering. In fact, SOTA deep networks compute a latent embedding where every class is represented by a centroid. This is discussed here:\nHess, Sibylle, Wouter Duivesteijn, and Decebal Mocanu. \"Softmax-based Classification is k-means Clustering: Formal Proof, Consequences for Adversarial Attacks, and Improvement through Centroid Based Tailoring.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.01987 (2020).\nThis insight might be useful, since it says that the embedded space induced by cross-entropy learning *just* has to be tweaked in order to reflect a suitable clustering as well. This might lead to a more simple loss function. In addition, it puts the proposed approach more in perspective and adds theoretical value.\n* What is the definition of k pairs single link distance in Eq.(5)?\n* I wouldn't call the method MCMC, this is known as Markov Chain Monte Carlo.\n* Table 1 returns the test error and Table 2 the test accuracy, use the same metric!\n* Use the citation in the text, instead of saying \"X et al.

Authors exploit inherent knowledge on the samples distribution via clustering to improve the latent space. The work heavily relies on well-studied concepts including the  Davies-Bouldin index and maximum margin clustering.\n\n\n[Cons]\n-- The general idea to improve the semi-supervised classification task by exploiting knowledge from the data through clustering constraints.\n\n\n[Pros]\n-- The lack of a formalist to describe the technique turns down the paper. This also makes unclear the level of novelty.\n-- The results are ultimately less informative than one would like and the experimental setting is limited. This leads to the results being no more than case studies which demonstrates only limited advantages in both qualitative and quantitative terms. \n\n\n\nDetailed comments for authors:\n\n\n--  [Novelty] The novelty in the proposed technique is unclear as it leverages on already well-studied principles including Davies-Bouldin index and maximum margin clustering. Authors need to strongly  detail the main advantages and key insights of the technique. As it is described so far, it is hard to appreciate the level of contribution.\n\n-- [Lack of formalism] A major drawback that turns down the paper is the lack of formalism to describe the proposed technique (which also makes unclear the level of novelty). That is, the core part of the technique is  (6) and previous expressions (1)-(5) are drawn from already well-studied concepts (Davies-Bouldin index and maximum margin clustering). One would expect that the authors provide further details (6) such as explicitly define the optimisation process.  Not only that, but several expressions are not properly set -- for example (5) authors needs to set the explicit definition rather that the text \u2018k pairs single link distance\u2019 as there are several works using the principles of maximum margin clustering, the reader needs to see the specifics of each component in the technique (even (5) draw from a very well-studied principle yet it is not defined properly). Overall, it is not enough to set (6) but authors should reduce (1)-(5) which are well-established expressions and detail (6) along with important parts such as the optimisation. \n\n-- A major drawback of the components are not considered. For example, it is well-known that the Davies-Bouldin index can report good results, however, it does not imply the best information retrieval. Why then chose Davies-Bouldin index? There are several works such as [*] that can be used to generalise the latent space well whilst avoiding the disadvantage of the authors proposed components and affect positively the outcome from SSL [**].  \n\n[*]Caron, M., Bojanowski, P., Joulin, A., & Douze, M.

The results are ultimately less informative than one would like and the experimental setting is limited. This leads to the results being no more than case studies which demonstrates only limited advantages in both qualitative and quantitative terms. \n-- Authors open the paper with a big statement \u201cthe comparison results confirm our model\u2019s outstanding performance over semi-supervised learning\u201d However, authors use very small and not well-representative datasets such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet (or even a smaller version mini-ImageNet). Likewise the comparison setting is limited, there are no comparisons with recent other techniques such as FixMatch, UDA. Deep Label propagation etc. Otherwise the strong claims of the authors are unsupported. \n-- The findings are less ultimate than one would like. The results from the tables are far from being well-explained. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper735/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper735/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Semi-Supervised Learning via Clustering Representation Space", "authorids": ["jeffpapapa@gmail.com", "~Yuh-Jye_Lee1", "~Chih-Chi_Wu1", "~Yi-Wei_Chiu1", "george851101@gmail.com", "chuck30621@gmail.com", "kphong19.iie08g@nctu.edu.tw"], "authors": ["Yen-Chieh Huang", "Yuh-Jye Lee", "Chih-Chi Wu", "Yi-Wei Chiu", "Yong-Xiang Lin", "\bCHENG-YING LI", "Po-Hung Ko"], "keywords": ["semi-supervised learning", "deep learning", "clustering", "embedding latent space"], "abstract": "We proposed a novel loss function that combines supervised learning with clustering in deep neural networks.
