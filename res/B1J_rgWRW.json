I summarize the main results as below:\n\n(1) Any piece-wise linear function can be represented by a ReLU-acteivated DNN. Any smooth function can be approximated by such networks.\n\n(2) The expressiveness of 3-layer DNN is stronger than any 2-layer DNN.\n\n(3) Using a polynomial number of neurons, the ReLU-acteivated DNN can represent a piece-wise linear function with exponentially many pieces\n\n(4) The ReLU-activated DNN can be learnt to global optimum with an exponential-time algorithm.\n\nAmong these results (1), (2), (4) are sort of known in the literature. This paper extends the existing results in some subtle ways. For (1), the authors show that the DNN has a tighter bound on the depth. For (2), the \"hard\" functions has a better parameterization, and the gap between 3-layer and 2-layer is proved bigger. For (4), although the algorithm is exponential-time, it guarantees to compute the global optimum.\n\nThe stronger results of (1), (2), (4) all rely on the specific piece-wise linear nature of ReLU. Other than that, I don't get much more insight from the theoretical result. When the input dimension is n, the representability result of (1) fails to show that a polynomial number of neurons is sufficient. Perhaps an exponential number of neurons is necessary in the worst case, but it will be more interesting if the authors show that under certain conditions a polynomial-size network is good enough.\n\nResult (3) is more interesting as it is a new result. The authors present a constructive proof to show that ReLU-activated DNN can represent many linear pieces.  However, the construction seems artificial and these functions don't seem to be visually very complex.\n\nOverall, this is an incremental work in the direction of studying the representation power of neural networks. The results might be of theoretical interest, but I doubt if a pragmatic ReLU network user will learn anything by reading this paper.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Understanding Deep Neural Networks with Rectified Linear Units", "abstract": "In this paper we investigate the family of functions representable by deep neural networks (DNN) with rectified linear units (ReLU).

", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "review": "The paper presents a series of definitions and results elucidating details about the functions representable by ReLU networks, their parametrisation, and gaps between deep and shallower nets. \n\nThe paper is easy to read, although it does not seem to have a main focus (exponential gaps vs. optimisation vs. universal approximation). The paper makes a nice contribution to the details of deep neural networks with ReLUs, although I find the contributed results slightly overstated. The 1d results are not difficult to derive from previous results. The advertised new results on the asymptotic behaviour assume a first layer that dominates the size of the network. The optimisation method appears close to brute force and is limited to 2 layers. \n\nTheorem 3.1 appears to be easily deduced from the results from Montufar, Pascanu, Cho, Bengio, 2014. For 1d inputs, each layer will multiply the number of regions at most by the number of units in the layer, leading to the condition w\u2019 \\geq w^{k/k\u2019}. Theorem 3.2 is simply giving a parametrization of the functions, removing symmetries of the units in the layers. \n\nIn the list at the top of page 5. Note that, the function classes might be characterized in terms of countable properties, such as the number of linear regions as discussed in MPCB, but still they build a continuum of functions. Similarly, in page 5 ``Moreover, for fixed n,k,s, our functions are smoothly parameterized''. This should not be a surprise. \n\nIn the last paragraph of Section 3 ``m = w^k-1'' This is a very big first layer. This also seems to subsume the first condition, s\\geq  w^k-1 +w(k-1) for the network discussed in Theorem 3.9. In the last paragraph of Section 3 ``To the best of our knowledge''. In the construction presented here, the network\u2019s size is essentially in the layer of size m. Under such conditions, Corollary 6 of MPCB also reads as s^n. Here it is irrelevant whether one artificially increases the depth of the network by additional, very narrow, layers, which do not contribute to the asymptotic number of units. \n\nThe function class Zonotope is a composition of two parts. It would be interesting to consider also a single construction, instead of the composition of two constructions. \n\nTheorem 3.9 (ii) it would be nice to have a construction where the size becomes 2m + wk when k\u2019=k. \n\nSection 4, while interesting, appears to be somewhat disconnected from the rest of the paper. \n\nIn Theorem 2.3. explain why the two layer case is limited to n=1. \n\nAt some point in the first 4 pages it would be good to explain what is meant by ``hard\u2019\u2019 functions (e.g. functions that are hard to represent, as opposed to step functions, etc.) \n", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Understanding Deep Neural Networks with Rectified Linear Units", "abstract": "In this paper we investigate the family of functions representable by deep neural networks (DNN) with rectified linear units (ReLU).

Our construction utilizes the theory of zonotopes from polyhedral theory.", "pdf": "/pdf/ef130169da75dc874b3bd718136cccdd8c98bf06.pdf", "TL;DR": "This paper 1) characterizes functions representable by ReLU DNNs, 2) formally studies the benefit of depth in such architectures,  3) gives an algorithm to implement empirical risk minimization to global optimality for two layer ReLU nets.", "paperhash": "arora|understanding_deep_neural_networks_with_rectified_linear_units", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\narora2018understanding,\ntitle={Understanding Deep Neural Networks with Rectified Linear Units},\nauthor={Raman Arora and Amitabh Basu and Poorya Mianjy and Anirbit Mukherjee},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1J_rgWRW},\n}", "keywords": ["expressive power", "benefits of depth", "empirical risk minimization", "global optimality", "computational hardness", "combinatorial optimization"], "authors": ["Raman Arora", "Amitabh Basu", "Poorya Mianjy", "Anirbit Mukherjee"], "authorids": ["arora@cs.jhu.edu", "basu.amitabh@jhu.edu", "mianjy@jhu.edu", "amukhe14@jhu.edu"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "duedate": 1511845199000, "tmdate": 1515642473269, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper584/Official_Review", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper584/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper584/AnonReviewer3", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper584/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper584/AnonReviewer2"], "reply": {"forum": "B1J_rgWRW", "replyto": "B1J_rgWRW", "writers": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper584/AnonReviewer[0-9]+", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "review": {"required": true, "order": 2, "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}"}, "rating": {"required": true, "order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"]}, "confidence": {"required": true, "order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"]}}}, "nonreaders": [], "expdate": 1519621199000, "cdate": 1515642473269}}}], "count": 5}
