Unclear what is meant be \"equivalent\" in first paragraph. \n2. The model does not assign an explicit probability to the tree structure - rather it seems to rely on the distinction between terminal and non-terimal symbols and the restriction to binary trees to know when closing brackets are implied - this is not made clear, and a general model should not have this restriction, as there are many cases where we want to generate non-binary trees.\nThe production rule notation used is incorrect and confusing, mixing sets with non-terminals and terminal symbols: \nA better notation for the rules in 2.1.1 would be something like S -> P | v | \\epsilon; P -> Q R | Q u | u Q | u w, where P, Q, R \\in O and u, w \\in v.\n2.1.2. Splitting production rules as ->_left, ->_right is not standard notation. Rather introduce intermediate non-terminals in the grammar:\nO -> O_L O_R; O_L -> a | Q, O_R -> b | Q. \n2.1.3 The context-sensitively here arise when conditioning on the entire left sibling subtree (not just the top non-terimal).\nThe rules should have a format such as O -> O_L O_R; O_L -> a | Q; \\alpha O_R -> \\alpha a | \\alpha Q, where \\alpha is an entire subtree rooted at O_L.\n2.1.4 Should be g(x|.) = exp( ), the softmax function includes the normalization which is done in the equation below. \n\n3. Note that is is possible to restrict the decoder to produce tree structures while keeping a sequential neural architecture. For some tasks sequential decoders do actually produce mostly well-formed trees, given enough training data. \nRNNG encodes completed subtrees recursively, and the stack LSTM encodes the entire partially-produced tree, so it does produce and condition on trees not just sequences. The model in this paper is not more expressive than RNNG, it just encodes somewhat different structural biases, which might or might not be suited for real tasks.  \n\n4. In the examples given, the same set of symbols are used as both terminals and non-terminals. How is the tree structure then predicted by the decoder?\nDetails about the training setup are missing: How is the training data generated, what is the size of the trees during training (compared to testing)?\n4.2 The steep drop in performance between depth 5 and 6 indicates that model is very sensitive to its memorization capacity and might not be generalizing over the given training data.\nFor real tree-to-tree applications involving these operations, there is good reason to believe that some kind of attention mechanism will be needed over the input tree during decoding. \n\nReference should generally be to published proceedings rather than to arxiv where available - e.g. Aharoni and Goldberg, Dong and Lapata, Erguchi et al, Rush et al.
