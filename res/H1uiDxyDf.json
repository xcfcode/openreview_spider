Overall the results are extremely underwhelming on the public benchmarks, and the gains on the in-house cattle dataset are very small. Most importantly, the novelty of the approach is non-existent. See below for clarifications.\n\n* Details*\nThe authors build on FCN, a method designed for instance segmentation as they correctly mention in the intro. During the description of the approach, they mention that they predict blobs from the FCN output. There is no mention of what that is, how they obtain it from the semantic mask predictions. Unless I am missing this information, this is a crucial point. Moving beyond that important detail, the authors propose two modules, which are essentially hard negative mining (similar to Training Region-based Object Detectors with Online Hard Example Mining, Shrivastava et al., CVPR 2016) and another layer of classification. \nIf I were to ignore the extremely limited novelty of the proposed approach, the results (Table 1) are not compelling at all. The authors build on a shallow architecture and show underwhelming results on the public benchmarks. On top of that, the hyper-parameters used for computing published approaches are suboptimal (e.g. image size) which lead to lower performance than the ones reported by the original papers. \n\nLast, while the above review sounds harsh I want to emphasize that it is quite legitimate to study a problem of particular interest (here image of beef cattle) and to care to obtain good results with low compute and at a low cost presumably. However, a publication is not necessarily justified based on the observations. I truly believe that there is people that will be interested in this approach (e.g. farmers, producers etc.) but a publication at an ICLR workshop is not the right venue for this paper.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dense Pixel-level Beef Cattle Instance Segmentation Using a Fully Convolutional Network", "abstract": "We present an instance segmentation algorithm trained and applied to a video of a group of heifers recorded in a winter finishing feedlot.

Omission of crucial details makes understanding of what's going on very difficult. The problem is never defined clearly, and the description of the two modifications ('MaskExtractor' and 'BadOverlapsExtractor') is so condensed, and devoid of formulas or clarifying diagrams or pictures, that it is hard to follow. Both seem like fairly ad-hoc additions; especially then, proper justification is warranted.\n\nIt is never described where exactly the two modules are added to the existing pipeline. Both Algorithm 1 and 2 are never referenced in the text. It is unclear how Algorithm 2 fits to the description of the BadOverlapsExtractor module; I do not see any 1x1 kernels mentioned in Algorithm 2. It is unclear how backpropagation through these two modules might work.\n\nDespite the lack of clarity, I believe that better results compared to a fine-tuned Mask R-CNN may have been achieved; the problem is clearly more constrained and quite different to what the pre-trained networks were trained on.\n(On a side note, it seems the whole data set (training, validation & test sets) was created using data from one enclosure. Generalization to other enclosures may not work very well, due to different scene geometry and/or camera angles.)\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this submission for acceptance. I believe the clarity of presentation should be significantly improved. \n\nThere are several typos in this submission:\n- \"If there are more tha*n* two predictions...\"\"\n- \"In this publicati*o*n we presented...\"\n- \"MaskRCNN\" should be \"Mask R-CNN\" (several times -- please cite names properly!)\n- and potentially more", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dense Pixel-level Beef Cattle Instance Segmentation Using a Fully Convolutional Network", "abstract": "We present an instance segmentation algorithm trained and applied to a video of a group of heifers recorded in a winter finishing feedlot.
