We have lots of empirical evidence Q-learning and TD can work with NNs, and even empirical work that attempts to characterize when we should expect it to fail. Such empirical work is always limited and we need theory to supplement our empirical knowledge. This paper attempts to extend recent theoretical work on the convergence of supervised training of NN to the policy evaluation setting with TD.\n\nThe main issue revolves around the presentation of the work. The reviewers found the paper difficult to read (ok for theory work). But, the paper did not clearly discuss and characterize the significance of the work: how limited is the lazy training regime, when would it be useful? Now that we have this result, do we have any more insights for algorithm design (improving nonlinear TD), or comments about when we expect NN policy evaluation to work? \n\nThis all reads like: the paper needs a better intro and discussion of the implications and limitations of the results, and indeed this is what the reviewers were looking for. Unfortunately the author response and paper submitted were lacking in this respect. Even the strongest advocates of the work found it severely lacking explanation and discussion.  They felt that the paper could be accepted, but only after extensive revision.\n\nThe direction of the work is important. The work is novel, and not a small undertaking. However, to be published the authors should spend more time explaining the framework, the results, and the limitations to the reader.\n\n", "title": "Paper Decision"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Temporal-difference learning for nonlinear value function approximation in the lazy training regime", "authors": ["Andrea Agazzi", "Jianfeng Lu"], "authorids": ["agazzi@math.duke.edu", "jianfeng@math.duke.edu"], "keywords": ["deep reinforcement learning", "function approximation", "temporal-difference", "lazy training"], "TL;DR": "Proof of convergence for TD learning with nonlinear value function approximation when parameters undergo little displacement during training.

The authors show that in the \u201clazy training\u201d regime both over- and under-parametrized approximators converge exponentially fast, the former to the global minimum of the projected TD error and the latter to a local minimizer of the same error surface. Simply put, the lazy regime refers to the approximator behaving as if it had been linearized around its initialization point. This can happen if the approximation is rescaled, but can also occur as a side-effect of its initialization. The authors present simple numerical examples illustrating their claims.\n\nAlthough I did not carefully check the math, this seems like a solid contribution on the technical side. My main concern about the paper is that it falls short in providing intuition and contextualizing its technical content. Regarding the presentation, I believe it is possible to have a less dry prose without sacrificing mathematical rigor. If some of the technical material is moved to the appendix --like auxiliary results, discussion on proof techniques, etc--, the additional space could be used to discuss the implications of the theoretical results in more accessible terms.\n\nFor example, a subject that ought to be discussed more clearly is the nature of the approximation induced by the lazy training regime. As far as I understand, this regime can be thought of as a sort of regularization that severely limits the capacity of the approximator.  Although the authors mention in the conclusion that \u201c...convergence of lazy models may come at the expense of their expressivity\u201d, after reading the paper I do not have a clear sense of how expressive such models actually are. In their experiments, Chizat et al. (2018) observed that the performance of commonly used neural networks degrades when trained in the lazy regime --to a point that they consider it unlikely that the successes of deep learning can be credited to this regime of training. It seems to me that this subject should be more explicitly discussed in a paper that sets out to provide theoretical support for deep reinforcement learning.\n\nStill regarding the behavior of lazy approximators, my intuitive understanding is that they work as a linear model using random features. If this interpretation is correct, this makes the theoretical results a bit less surprising. They are still interesting, though, for they can be seen as relying on a \u201csmoother\u201d version of the linearity assumption often made in the related literature. Maybe this is also something worth discussing? Still on this subject, it seems to me that one potential disadvantage of lazy models with respect to their linear counterparts is that it is less clear how to enforce the lazy regime in practice. In Section 4.2 the authors discuss how this can naturally happen as a side-effect of the initialization, but it is unclear how applicable the particular strategy used to illustrate this phenomenon, with the \u201cdoubling trick\u201d, is in practice. This is another example of a less technical discussion that would make the paper a stronger contribution.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I did not assess the derivations or theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper759/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper759/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Temporal-difference learning for nonlinear value function approximation in the lazy training regime", "authors": ["Andrea Agazzi", "Jianfeng Lu"], "authorids": ["agazzi@math.duke.edu", "jianfeng@math.duke.edu"], "keywords": ["deep reinforcement learning", "function approximation", "temporal-difference", "lazy training"], "TL;DR": "Proof of convergence for TD learning with nonlinear value function approximation when parameters undergo little displacement during training.

The authors proved that for the both over-parameterized case (state number is fixed finite number) and the under-parameterized case (state number is sufficiently large or infinite), the value function can converge to some stationary point with exponential convergence rate. Moreover, the authors also characterized the error when the value function is under-parameterized.\n\nOverall, this is a good paper. But the paper organization is awful. There are many places that are ambiguous or with notations that not formally defined. It may not due to the page limit as the authors currently use only 8 pages. I think the authors should polish the whole paper and make it more readable. Below are some main clarity issues I find, but the authors should not only solve the issues I mentioned.\n\n1. For better presentation, I suggest the authors include a notation paragraph in the main text, which will be very helpful for the readers.\n2. I think it would be better to mention (7) returns w that V_w = V^* / \\alpha in Sec. 2 for better reading.\n3. In Theorem 3.5, it is unclear that the estimation \\tilde{V}^* is from \\alpha V_{w}.\n4. The WP1 in the paragraph after Theorem 3.5 means with probability 1?\n5. In Equation (11), what is the definition of the measure \\pi? If I understand correctly it is still \\mu as the invariant measure should be fixed for a given policy?\n6. The last paragraph in the proof of Theorem 3.5 is hard to follow. It can be better to introduce the result from the textbook and list the condition that need to verify, then give the lemmas show that the conditions can be verified.\nWhat is the functional X in (12)? Should mention it in the main text, not in the appendix.\n7. Figure 2 is somehow hard to understand. Maybe better show how the projection of TD error vector field outwards along the spiral in (a) and inwards in (b) in the figure.\n\nFrom my point of view, the proof is almost correct and most of the lemmas are standard. This result is meaningful as it shows how and when the nonlinear function approximation will converge in temporal-difference learning (under the context of lazy training, and I think it is also correct under the context of NTK). The perspective on viewing the TD learning as linear dynamic system on functional space can inspire several new research in this field. My main concern is about the paper organization.

The reason for this assumption is that it guarantees sufficient exploration of the phase speace, a fundamental requirement for the convergence of reinforcement learning algorithms. Indeed, if the MRP does not visit all the states with positive probability, then it may never visit some key states for the evaluation of the value function, and the algorithm would therefore necessarily converge to a wrong estimate of such function. We therefore don't think it is reasonable to relax this assumption in our setting.\n\n2) The results obtained in our paper combine results and techniques from various previous works, improving them in various aspects, for example extending the techniques developed in [COB19] to a non-gradient setting (a structure heavily leveraged in that paper) and quantifying the error between the nonlinear approximator and the limiting, linear one. As guarantees of convergence are of fundamental importance in the setting of deep reinforcement learning, and since the rationale developed in this paper has a wide applicability, in particular in that subject, we believe that the results presented here are relevant in the setting of RL.\n\n3) The theory ensures for example that the population dynamics of Temporal-Difference learning using deep neural networks of a sufficient width (and any depth), initialized in the Xavier regime is convergent on with probability one to a global minimum in the discrete setting, and not divergent in the continuous setting. We believe this to be an example of interest for practicionners and a novel result.\n\n[COB19] Chizat, Oyallon, Bach ``On Lazy Training in Differentiable Programming'', 2019\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper759/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper759/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Temporal-difference learning for nonlinear value function approximation in the lazy training regime", "authors": ["Andrea Agazzi", "Jianfeng Lu"], "authorids": ["agazzi@math.duke.edu", "jianfeng@math.duke.edu"], "keywords": ["deep reinforcement learning", "function approximation", "temporal-difference", "lazy training"], "TL;DR": "Proof of convergence for TD learning with nonlinear value function approximation when parameters undergo little displacement during training.

Similar to deep learning theory, the key idea is that in the lazy regime, for an overparameterized network, if initialized in a certain manner, weights do not change significantly during training. The paper heavily draws upon techniques from n Chizat & Bach (2018) and adapts them to the setting with value functions, and policy evaluation. In order to get a strongly convex objective in function space, they consider a strongly convex Lyapunov function for the analysis. In the under-parameterized regime, the paper shows convergence to local optimum, by showing that convergence is exponentially fast to a local minimum where the key insight is that standard differential geometry can be applied to analyze the behavior of the projection on top of TD-lambda operator using past existing analyses. Finally, Section 4 shows numerical examples -- a divergent function approximator and some empirical results on a single-layer neural net.\n\nOverall, I lean in favor of rejection for this paper. I am mainly concerned with the significance of the content in the paper and positioning with respect to past theoretical/empirical work. My specific concerns are:\n\n1. Assumption 1 is strong, it assumes full support over the state-space, however, in any situation of practical relevance, this is not the case. There are many papers at this point (for example, [1], [2]) which show empirically that even with Q-learning (Fitted Q), divergence is not common if the function approximator is large/wide enough, and the support of the state space is full, however, these methods can diverge if the support is not full/ skewed. I am not sure if this assumption is very realistic then.  (The results are for specific function approximation in this paper, and hence it is unclear if that is the case we use in practice)\n\n2. I am not sure if the techniques used in the paper are relatively novel (from a theoretical point of view), and I would appreciate if the authors can elaborate a bit on this. It seems like most of the proof is drawn from past work (although past work has theoretical results in a different problem setting -- supervised learning). While the setting of policy evaluation is novel, I am concerned about how many new techniques are to be gained from a theoretical point of view here.\n\n3. What assumptions are needed for Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 3.2, from a deep-learning standpoint? What recommendations does the theory give to practitioners? I find a discussion on both of these points missing from the paper. It would be appreciated if the authors can elaborate on these points.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Deep Reinforcement Learning and the Deadly Triad, van Hasselt et.al.\n[2] Diagnosing Bottlenecks in Deep Q-learning Algorithms, Fu et.al."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper759/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper759/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Temporal-difference learning for nonlinear value function approximation in the lazy training regime", "authors": ["Andrea Agazzi", "Jianfeng Lu"], "authorids": ["agazzi@math.duke.edu", "jianfeng@math.duke.edu"], "keywords": ["deep reinforcement learning", "function approximation", "temporal-difference", "lazy training"], "TL;DR": "Proof of convergence for TD learning with nonlinear value function approximation when parameters undergo little displacement during training.
