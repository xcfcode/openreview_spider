To this end, a three steps approach called FWL (Fidelity Weighted Learning) is proposed. In particular, FWL consists in constructing a \u201cstudent\u201d and a \u201cteacher\u201d interacting to refine the quality of the prediction.\n\nSome numerical experiments supporting the approach are proposed. In particular, the FWL algorithm is tested on the problem of document ranking. \nAn investigation of the sensitivity of the approach to the quality of the weak annotator is also proposed.\n\n\nA few comments and questions:\n-the fact that the algorithm uses a Neural Net should be emphasized more in the introduction\n-Can the proposed approach be extended to other learning algorithm (i.e. not only a NN)?\n-Why specifically use a Gaussian process? Can another approach be used?\n-concerning the investigation on the \u201csensitivity of the FWL to the quality of the weak annotator\u201d (sic),\ndoes a \u201cphase transition\u201d occur? i.e. is there a threshold on the quality of the weak annotator below which FWL does not yield any improvement?\n\nReviewer\u2019s assessment:\nI found the paper to be fairly well written. The ideas are exposed clearly and the numerical results support the approach. Since the topic of this work clearly falls within the scope of the workshop, I recommend to accept this paper.\n\n", "rating": "4: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper7/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper7/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning from Samples of Variable Quality", "authors": ["Mostafa Dehghani", "Arash Mehrjou", "Stephan Gouws", "Jaap Kamps", "Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf"], "authorids": ["dehghani@uva.nl", "amehrjou@tuebingen.mpg.de", "sgouws@google.com", "kamps@uva.nl", "bs@tuebingen.mpg.de"], "keywords": ["fidelity-weighted learning", "semisupervised learning", "weakly-labeled data", "teacher-student"], "TL;DR": "We propose Fidelity-weighted Learning, a semi-supervised teacher-student approach for training neural networks using weakly-labeled data.", "abstract": "Training labels are expensive to obtain and may be of varying quality, as some may be from trusted expert labelers while others might be from heuristics or other sources of weak supervision such as crowd-sourcing.
