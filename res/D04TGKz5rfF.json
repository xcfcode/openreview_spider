The authors argue that the perturbation deltas are largely concentrated in the high frequency domain and suggest a low pass filtering technique to improve the robustness of image classifiers. Reviewers raised several concerns as to how broadly applicable the given claims will hold, noting that these findings will be largely dependent on how the model was trained, what data the model is trained on, and how the adversarial perturbation will be constructed. Additionally, the proposal to apply a low pass filter to improve robustness is not new---it has been attempted in several works in the past and current consensus is this only provides improved robustness to high frequency perturbations/corruptions. As a recent example, Yin et. al. studied the robustness properties of models trained with a low pass filter and found that while robustness to high frequency noise and perturbations is improved, this procedure also degrades robustness to low frequency corruptions and perturbations. By focusing the analysis quite narrowly to restricted l2-perturbations the work is missing critical nuances that are well known in the literature studying distribution shift. This AC recommends the authors connect their analysis to the broader issue of distribution shift, for example can the theory provide understanding into how to improve robustness to both high and low frequency corruptions?"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A frequency domain analysis of gradient-based adversarial examples", "authorids": ["bochen.lv@gmail.com", "1700010695@pku.edu.cn", "~Zehao_Wang2", "~Zhanxing_Zhu1"], "authors": ["Bochen Lv", "Pu Yang", "Zehao Wang", "Zhanxing Zhu"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "It is well known that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples.

The authors show that the low frequency component (LFC) of adversarial perturbation is increasing during training, but it is not increasing fast enough, so the LFC of adversarial perturbation is not as dense as the input natural images which obey the power law. Therefore, the log-spectrum difference of adversarial examples will express a HFC-concentrated phenomenon. The authors used theory and experiments to demonstrate this point.\n\nThe theoretical analyses look correct to me and they look useful since rigorous understanding of frequency spectrum is useful to the robustness research community. However, I have the following concerns:\n\n1) This paper analyzes the frequency spectrum of normal training. Thus it aims to understand the adversarial perturbation for naturally-trained (i.e., non-robust model). The authors indeed provide an iterative equation showing how the frequency pattern changes across training, but it is only for a very specific case: the network is two-layer, trained with gradient descent algorithm, and the adversarial perturbation is FGM. As we know, the naturally trained models are very non-robust, which means that there are potentially many different ways to attack the model. If we constrain the attack direction to low/high frequency matrices, we may always be able to find a direction to attack the model. In fact, Ford et al (Adversarial Examples Are a Natural Consequence of Test Error in Noise) show that the existence of adversarial example is equivalent to test error under Gaussian noise, and therefore an adversarial perturbation that has uniform Fourier spectrum may be a valid perturbation direction (although it is not necessarily a direction computed from FGM). Therefore, I don't think the theory and experimental observation can be applied in a wide range of problems.\n\n2) I think the paper is not written very clearly. When I read the second paragraph on page 2, I found the three main contributions kind of contradicting with each other. The first point says the adversarial perturbation concentrates on the low frequency domain and the second point says it concentrates on the high frequency domain. I was only able to roughly understand it when reading page 6, the paragraph after Theorem 2. I think the authors should spend more effort to make their main point clearly delivered.\n\n3) I think the most misleading part in this paper is the claim that low pass filter improves robustness. This experiment was done by first attack the natural images on normal models, without knowing that there will be a low pass filter, and then pass the attacked images to the low pass filter. This is not consistent with the commonly used white box attack protocol, i.e., the adversary should know all the components of the model. The authors got the results by hiding the low pass filter from the adversary, and thus I think claiming the filtering improves robustness is very misleading to the readers.\n\n===============\n\nAfter author response:\nI would like to thank the authors for providing response. For the second point, I am still a bit confused about spectrum of perturbations vs log-spectrum of adversarial examples. The authors agreed that my third point was correct, i.e., the current results do not give enough insights on how to improve robustness against adversarial examples, in the real-world white box setting. Given the above reasons, I decided to keep my score.\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1561/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1561/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A frequency domain analysis of gradient-based adversarial examples", "authorids": ["bochen.lv@gmail.com", "1700010695@pku.edu.cn", "~Zehao_Wang2", "~Zhanxing_Zhu1"], "authors": ["Bochen Lv", "Pu Yang", "Zehao Wang", "Zhanxing Zhu"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "It is well known that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples.

Unfortunately there are some misunderstandings on our main contributions and we hope we can clarify them here.\n\n\"adversarial perturbations mainly affect high-frequency content of the images \"\n-> First of all, we did not make such a claim. On the contrary, we formally showed that the gradient-based adversaries actually concentrate more in the low-frequency domain gradually during the normal training. \n\n \"The core idea of the paper is actually old.\"\n-> The core contribution of our paper is, as we showed, theoretical analysis of gradient-based adversarial perturbations in the frequency domain. It is actually a misunderstanding that \"perturbations must be mainly impinging on high-frequency content\". Therefore, our claim--low-pass filter improves robustness against adversarial examples--is not an obvious conclusion and our theories can explain it.\n\n\"What is the value of a defense method if it decreases accuracy for clean images?\" \n-> [1] discovered the trade-off between robustness and standard accuracy and many defense methods indeed cause clean accuracy decrease. There are also a series of works [2][3] devoting to understanding and explaining this phenonmenon. Decrease of clean accuracy did not make these defense methods valueless to the researcommunity.\n\n\"the experiments are rather limited in only using CIFAR-10 (which is a subset of CIFAR) and PGD attack.\"\n-> CIFAR-10 meets our assumption of natural images which is enough and appropriate for our work.

We hope to solve your concerns here.\n\n1. Our article foucses on the theoretical understanding of the gradient-based adversarial examples in the frequency domain which is still missing in the existing literature. The setting of two-layer neural network trained with gradient descent method is a good start for this purporse: we provide a feasible way to theoretically crack the problem for general depth neural networks. For other gradient-based adversaries, we presented the results for $l_2$ PGD attack (the information of gradient of the network which is necessary in this case has been analyzed in the FGM attack) in the Appendix. \nWe now provide some values of our work to the community as follows. Future work can explore other types of gradient-based adversaries, e.g. FGSM, with similar methods not only for normally trained neural networks but also for adversarially trained ones and design new defense methods against gradient-based adversaries from the perspective of frequency which will be of great importance and novel. It is also possible to formally understand adversarial training in the frequency domain following our settings. \n\n2. Sorry for the confusion on our contributions. Perhaps this is due to our claims that perturbations concentrate in LFC while log-spectrum difference concentrates in HFC in Sec.1 P.2. We will revise the structure of the article: clarifying these two terms, spectrum of perturbations and log-spectrum of adversarial exmaples, before demonstrating their distinct conclusions to avoid possible confusion. \n\n3. Thanks for pointing out this point. The experiment of low-pass filter improving robustness is a verification of our main result that although gradient-based adversaries concentrate in the low-frequency domain they do not concentrate as dense as the natural images. Thus it is more appropriate to say that \"the filter improves model's robustness with a cheatsheet\" in the white-box setting.

In fact, our work on two-layer nerual network is the first step towards this direction--theoretically understanding the gradient-based adversaries themselves in the frequency domain. And our theoretical findingings are supported by experiments on neural networks with more complicated architectures (ResNet-32): in Fig 2(a), the ratios of LFC of $l_2$ FGM perturbations gradually increase during the normal training as claimed by Theorem 1; Fig 6(b) indicates that the expectation of log-spectrum difference of adversdarial examples indeed expresses a high-frequency concentration which is demonstrated in Theorem 2. The assumption of weights $a_r$ being not learnable has been widely used in earlier works of theoretical analysis for neural networks e.g. [1]. To better support these assumptions and results in Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, we will supplement experiments on a two-layer neural network model with fixed weights $a_r$. \n\nIt is important to show that low-pass filter will not significantly hurt the accuracy: Considering the dense-concentration in low frequency of natural images, the model would have surprisingly high accuracy with significantly low cuf-off frequency as showed by [2] and our experiment where the model achieves 82% clean accuracy with the cut-off chosen as approximately half of the maximum frequency (Fig. 3). Therefore, setting the cut-off frequency to the desired value will not hurt the accuracy much while rejecting the adversarial perturbations a lot. However, we can not provide the theoretical guarantees on the exact clean accuracy of the model preprocessed by low-pass filtering with a particular cut-off frequency. \n\n[1] Sanjeev Arora et al. \"Fine-Grained Analysis of Optimization and Generalization for Overparameterized Two-Layer Neural Networks\".\n[2] Haohan Wang et al. \"High-frequency Component Helps Explain the Generalization of Convolutional Neural Networks\"."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1561/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1561/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A frequency domain analysis of gradient-based adversarial examples", "authorids": ["bochen.lv@gmail.com", "1700010695@pku.edu.cn", "~Zehao_Wang2", "~Zhanxing_Zhu1"], "authors": ["Bochen Lv", "Pu Yang", "Zehao Wang", "Zhanxing Zhu"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "It is well known that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples.

In particular, the fact that adversarial perturbations are mostly a high-frequency phenomenon is not true for ImageNet or MNIST trained CNNs.\n\nIn our recent NeurIPS paper [1] we show that the distance to the boundary (margin) in different frequency bands is heavily dependent of the distribution used for training, and that in the case of ImageNet and MNIST classifiers it is mostly low in the low frequency subspaces. Meanwhile, we also show that during adversarial training on CIFAR-10 the l2-PGD adversarial perturbations have always higher energy in the low-frequency subspaces.\n\nWe also show that training on a low-pass version of CIFAR-10 mostly affects the margin in the high frequency spectrum. Thus, the adversarial examples of a network trained on low-pass CIFAR-10 are not high-frequency. This is due to the tendency of neural networks to create invariances along subspaces where the input data has no energy. This again shows that the claim in this submission (adversarial perturbations are high frequency) is not true in general.\n\nIn another workshop paper at ICML [2], we show in fact that inducing invariance along the high frequencies using a low-pass transformation can induce robustness to certain types of distribution shifts. However, we never observed any improvement in l2-PGD adversarial robustness.\n\nWe believe that these two papers are very relevant for the study presented in this submission. In fact, we would appreciate if the authors could clarify their claims with respect to our previous analysis.
