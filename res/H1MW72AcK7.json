We address reviewer\u2019s concern as follows:\n\n1) One limitation that is now present in the revised version of the paper that was not present in the original submission is that these dynamics models do *not* subsume linear dynamics models. This is because the dynamics are being approximated with convex and non-decreasing functions over the state space, while linear models *are* able to model decreasing functions over the state space while retaining convexity of the overall control problem. I would like an updated version of this paper to highlight this limitation of the method as I expect it to hurt some applications (although it is fine in other contexts).\n\nWe thank the reviewer for this insightful comment and we agree that the proposed input convex neural networks do not subsume linear dynamics models completely. Specifically, the proposed ICNN/ICRNN could only capture the dynamics convex and non-decreasing over the state space. But since we are not restricting the control space (system state at any time can be viewed as a function of the initial system state and all previous control inputs if one unrolls the system dynamics equation entirely), and we have explicitly included multiple previous states in the state transition dynamics $s_t = g(s_{t-n_w:t-1}, u_{t-n_w:t})$, so the non-decreasing constraint should not hurt the representation capacity by much.\n\nIn the revised manuscript, we add the following discussion in page 5 under Eq. (5) to emphasize the differences between input convex neural networks and linear models. \u201cNote that as a general formulation, we do not include the duplication tricks on state variables, so the dynamics fitted by Eq. (5b) and (5c) are non-decreasing over state space, which are not equivalent to those dynamics represented by linear systems. However, since we are not restricting the control space (dynamics can be both increasing or decreasing on control variables), and we have explicitly included multiple previous states in the system transition dynamics, so the non-decreasing constraint over state space should not restrict the representation capacity by much. In Section 3, we theoretically prove the representability of proposed networks.\u201d\n\n2) I think it should be made clearer that the motivation of the \u2018input duplication trick\u2019 over the control space is to restrict the networks to be non-decreasing over the state space while not restricting the control space. I think the duplicated inputs unnecessarily complicates the presentation at parts e.g.  the end of Section 2.1.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out this misleading presentation at the end of Section 2.1 about the duplication. In the revised manuscript, we write out explicitly the convex and non-decreasing properties over the expanded control variable \\hat{u} rather than u.

It's not clear which one of these is improving the accuracy, as taking a few gradient steps over the non-convex MPC problem in Nagabandi et al. is also reasonable and would likely also improve the performance, even if the true optimum is not reached. Did you try comparing to this as a baseline?\n\nWe agree with the reviewer\u2019s insights that both convexity and gradient descent steps could bring benefits in the locomotion tasks. Similar to the energy consumption case, we also tried to directly do gradient steps using a normal neural network to represent dynamics. It would improve the reward than the random search method but the reward is lower than our proposed ICNN method. We are still working on more experiments to gain a deeper understanding of the contributions from these two factors, and the general tradeoff between model accuracy and solution traceability in model predictive control (MPC) would be an important direction for our future work. Moreover, since of computation efforts of Nagabandi et al\u2019s method have been taken on the random search step, to make a fair comparison in the paper we only show the comparison with their original method on the task rewards and computation time.\n\n4) On the energy consumption experiment, is the RC model a linear dynamics model that only looks at single-step states and actions as g(x_t, u_t)? If so, comparing an ICNN that uses a previous trajectory as g(x_{t-n_w:t}, u_{t-n_w,t}) to this seems somewhat unfair as another reasonable baseline would be a linear model that also uses the previous trajectory. It could be interesting to include some portions in the paper about the ways you've seen the non-convex MPC with the RNN dynamics model fail that the ICNN model overcomes. For example, does the lack of smoothness cause the control problem to get stuck in bad local minimum?\n\nThe RC model is linear dynamics using single-step states, yet has been used as a standard method in building energy management. In order to demonstrate where the non-convex MPC with the RNN dynamics model fails and the ICNN model overcomes, we actually included a comparison of the control performance of ICRNN with normal RNN in Figure. 4. We think the most interesting result is shown in Fig. 4(c). By using ICRNN, the final control actions (in red) is stable, while control signals founds by normal RNN (in green) have many oscillations, which seems to be stuck in some local minima, and such drastic control variations is not desirable for physical system control.\n\n5) As a minor comment, please add parenthetical citations where appropriate to the paper.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion and we have modified the citation format in the revised paper. \u2028"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1332/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1332/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1332/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Optimal Control Via Neural Networks: A Convex Approach", "abstract": "Control of complex systems involves both system identification and controller design.

Proposition 2 is wrong and the proposed input-convex recurrent\n   neural network architecture not input-convex.\n   To fix this, the D1 parameters should also be non-negative.\n   To show why the proposition is wrong, consider the convexity of y2\n   with respect to x1, using g to denote the activation function:\n\n       z1 = g(U x1 + ...)\n       y2 = g(D1 z1 + ...)\n\n   Thus making\n\n       y2 = g(D1 g(U x1 + ...) + ...)\n\n   y2 is *not* necessarily convex with respect to x1 because D1 takes\n   an unrestricted weighted sum of the convex functions g(U x1 + ...)\n\n   With the ICRNN architecture as described in the paper not being\n   input-convex, I do not know how to interpret the empirical findings\n   in Section 4.2 that use this architecture.\n\n2. I think a stronger and more formal argument should be used to show\n   that Equation (5) is a convex optimization problem as claimed.\n   It has arbitrary convex functions on the equality constraints that\n   are composed with each other and then used in the objective.\n   Even with parts of the objective being convex and non-decreasing\n   as the text mentions, it's not clear that this is sufficient when\n   combined with the composed functions in the constraints.\n\n3. I have similar concerns with the convexity of Equation (6).\n   Consider the convexity of x3 with respect to u1, where g is\n   now an input-convex neural network (that is not recurrent):\n\n       x3 = g(g(x1, u1), u2)\n   \n   This composes two convex functions that do *not* have non-decreasing\n   properties and therefore introduces an equality constraint that\n   is not necessarily even convex, almost certainly making the domain\n   of this problem non-convex. I think a similar argument can be\n   used to show why Equation (5) is not convex.\n\nIn addition to these significant concerns, I have a few other\nminor comments.\n\n1. Figure 1 hides too much information. It would be useful to know,\n   for example, that the ICNN portion at the bottom right\n   is solving a control optimization problem with an ICNN as\n   part of the constraints.\n\n2. The theoretical results in Section 3 seem slightly out-of-place within\n   the broader context of this paper but are perhaps of standalone interest.\n   Due to my concerns above I did not go into the details in this portion.\n\n3. I think more information should be added to the last paragraph of\n   Section 1 as it's claimed that the representational power of\n   ICNNs and \"a nice mathematical property\" help improve the\n   computational time of the method, but it's not clear why\n   this is and this connection is not made anywhere else in the paper.\n\n4. What method are you using to solve the control problems in\n   Eq (5) and (6)?\n\n5. The empirical setup and tasks seems identical to [Nagabandi et al.].\n   Figure 3 directly compares to the K=100 case of their method.\n   Why does Fig 6 of [Nagabandi et al.] have significantly higher rewards\n   for their method, even in the K=5 case?\n\n6.

Below, we respond to the comments in detail.\n\n1) For Lemma 1 and Theorem 1, I wonder whether similar results can be established for non-convex functions. Intuitively, it seems that as long as assuming Lipschiz continuous, we can always approximate a function by a maximum of many affine functions, no matter it is convex or not. Is this right or something is missing?\n\t\nThis is an interesting and subtle question. If we restrict ourselves to \u201cmaximum\u201d of affine functions, then we cannot construct functions that are not convex. This is from the fact that a pointwise max of convex functions (which include affine functions) is convex. As the reviewer points out, if we allow other types of operations, we can construct other types of functions. For example, if we change the pointwise max to the pointwise min, then we can approximate all Lipschiz concave functions. If we allow both max and min, we get all Lipschiz functions, but this just recover the result that neural networks can approximate most function types. We anticipate that different applications may require different function types to be approximated, and this is an active research direction for us. \n\n2) In the main paper, all experiments were aimed to address ICNN and ICRNN have good accuracy, but not they are easier to optimize due to convexity. In the abstract, it is mentioned \"... using 5X less time\", but I can only see this through appendix. A suggestion is at least describing some results on the comparison with training time in the main paper.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out this piece of missing information on running time in the main text. In the revised manuscript, we have added discussions on computation time in Section 4.1 to show our controller design would achieve both computation efficiency and performance improvement.\n\n3) In Appendix A, it seems the NN is not trained very well as shown in the left figure. Is this because the number of parameters of NN is restricted to be the same as in ICNN? Do training on both spend the same resource, ie, number of epoch? Such descriptions are necessary here.\n\nIn the toy example on classifying points in 2D grid, we used a 2-layer neural networks for both conventional neural networks and ICNN, with 200 neurons in each layer.

We observe the results given by conventional neural networks are quite unstable by using different random seeds and are prone to be overfitting.

In the revised version, we have added the fitting result comparison (Fig. 7 in Appendix D.4) for ICNN and a normal neural network, which shows that ICNN is able to learn the MuJoCo dynamics efficiently.\n\n-The comparison with end-to-end RL approach\n\nWe thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion. Conventional end-to-end RL approach directly learns the mapping from observations to actions without learning a system dynamics model. Such algorithms could achieve better performances, but are at the expense of much higher sample complexity. The model-free approach we compare with is the rllab implementation of trust region policy optimization (TRPO) [JL], which has obtained state-of-the-art results on MuJuCo tasks. We added Fig. 9 in Appendix D of the revised paper to compare our results with TRPO method and random shooting method [Nagabandi et al]. TRPO suffers from very high sample complexity and often requires millions of samples to achieve good performance. But here we only provided very few rollouts (since for physical system control, the sample collection might be limited by real-time operations, or it is difficult to explore the whole design space because suboptimal actions would lead to disastrous results), therefore, the performance by ICNN is much better than TRPO. Similarly to the model-based, model-free (MBMF) approach mentioned in [Nagabandi et al], the learned controller via ICNN could also provide good rollout samples and serve as a good initialization point for model-free RL method. \n\n\nReferences\n[JL] Schulman, John, Sergey Levine, Pieter Abbeel, Michael Jordan, and Philipp Moritz. \"Trust region policy optimization.\" In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 1889-1897. 2015.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1332/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1332/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1332/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Optimal Control Via Neural Networks: A Convex Approach", "abstract": "Control of complex systems involves both system identification and controller design.

We also appreciate the opportunity to clarify our presentation of theorems, figures and experiment setups, as well as some unclear writing in the manuscript. We agree with the reviewer that the original manuscript contained several parts that were not clear and some typos, and it resulted in some confusion on the technical results. Overall, we note that the results of the paper remain unchanged: deep (recurrent) neural networks can be made input convex and effectively used in control of complex systems. Based on the comments made by the reviewers, we have made the figures more illustrative, and the formulations and the theorems more rigorous. Our implementation of the algorithms is consistent with the updated manuscript, so we stress that these changes are made to clarify the writing of the paper and all of the simulation and numerical results remain unchanged. Below we provide a point-by-point account of the comments. \n\n-\tConcerns on the correctness of Proposition 2\n\nWe thank the reviewer for bringing up this important question and agree this was a point of confusion in our original manuscript. In Proposition 2 of the original submission, we stated that we only need to keep V and W non-negative and this will result in a network that is convex from input to output. This is true for a single step, but as the reviewer correctly points out, negative weights cannot go through composition and maintain convexity. Actually, Proposition 1 and Proposition 2 in our original submission give the sufficient condition for a network to be input-convex for a single step; when used for control purpose, these network structures (both ICNN and ICRNN) should be modified to their equivalent variants: restricting all weight matrices to be non-negative (element-wise) and augmenting the input to include its negation. Such network structure variants and \u201cduplicate trick\u201d have been mentioned in Section 3.1 Sketch of proof for Theorem 1 in our original manuscript, \u201cWe first construct a neural network with ReLU activation functions and both positive and negative weights, then we show that the weights between different layers of the network can be restricted to be nonnegative by a simple duplication trick. Specifically, since the weights in the input layer and passthrough layers can be negative, we simply add a negation of each input variable (e.g. both x and \u2212x are given as inputs) to the network\u201d. We apologize for not making this point clear and the notational confusions in our previous manuscript. To clarify, for both the MuJoCo locomotion tasks and the building control experiments, we used the modified input-convex network structures with all weights non-negative and input negation duplicates instead of the conventional input-convex structure for single step (but these two structures could be equivalently transformed). \nIn the revised paper, we explicitly explain the sufficient conditions for ICNN/ICRNN variants that can be used for control purpose. We also update Proposition 1 and 2 to ease the confusions of convexity under control settings. Also, we have updated Figure 2 accordingly to demonstrate the modified ICNN/ICRNN structure, input duplication, operations and activation functions used for our control settings. For all the empirical experiments, we will release our code after the openreview process for result validation, which demonstrated that proposed control framework via input-convex networks obtain both good identification accuracies and better control performance compared with regular neural networks or linear models. \n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1332/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1332/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1332/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Optimal Control Via Neural Networks: A Convex Approach", "abstract": "Control of complex systems involves both system identification and controller design.

Firstly, as stated in Theorem 2, compared to model based method which often employs piecewise linear functions, we could train ICNN or ICRNN (with exponentially less variables/pieces) using off-the-shelf deep learning packages such as PyTorch and Tensorflow, while the optimal control can be achieved by solving convex optimization; Secondly, compared to model-free (deep) reinforcement learning algorithms, which usually takes an end-to-end settings and requires lots of samples and long training time, our model is learning and controlling based on the system dynamics \u2013 this can be much more sample efficient. There is also an ongoing debate on the model-free and model-based reinforcement learning algorithms [BR], and we look forward to incorporating learning into control tasks with optimality guarantees.\n\n-\tWhat method are you using to solve the control problems in Eq (5) and (6)?\n\nIn Eq (5) and (6), since both the objectives and the constraints contain neural networks, we set up our networks with Tensorflow and solve the control problem using projected gradient descent method with adaptive step size. The gradients can be calculated via existing modules in Tensorflow for backpropagation. In both cases the optimization problems can be solved fairly fast and we observe the solution convergence after around 20 iterations. As shown in Figure 4 (c) of the original manuscript, the control actions outputted by solving (5) are stable and much better than the results achieved from regular neural network + MPC (which has no optimality guarantee). In the revised paper, we have included more details on the solution algorithm of Eq. (5) in the last paragraph of Section 2.\n\n-\tWhy does Figure 6 of [Nagabandi et al.] have significantly higher rewards for their method, even in the K=5 case?\n\nWe thank the reviewer for carefully proofreading the figure, and we also thank Nagabandi et al open sourced their code. We re-run their simulations using all the default parameters and observed the reward for their cases are all around 10x less than they showed in Figure 6. We also refer to [KC], where their rewards on swimmer case are significantly smaller than the case as [Nagabandi et al]. We are not sure what is causing the difference in the performances, although we believe there may be difference in hyperparameter settings and the random starting points between our and [Nagabandi et al]\u2019s result. We make sure the comparison in Figure 3 of our paper are using the same hyperparameters and training data, except the differences on control methods.\n\n-\tThe experimental results in Figure 5\n\nWe thank the reviewer for bringing up this interesting point. In the toy example on classifying points in 2D grid, we used a 2-layer neural networks for both conventional neural networks and ICNN, with 200 neurons in each layer. We simulate the case when training data is small (100 training samples). We observe the results given by conventional neural networks are quite unstable by using different random seeds and are prone to be overfitting. On the contrary, by adding constraints on model weights to train the ICNN, fitting result is better using this small-size training data, while the learned landscape is also beneficial to the optimization problem. \nIn the revised manuscript, we added more details on the model and training setup, the learning task, and the optimization task to address the confusion.\n\nReferences\n\n[MP] Alessandro Magnani and Stephen P Boyd. \u201cConvex piecewise-linear fitting\u201d.

In the revised manuscript, we update Equation (5) to reflect the fact that we are using input-convex neural networks with all non-negative weights and the input negation trick. Equations (5d) and (5e) are added in the revised formulation which denote the augmented input variables and the consistency condition between u and its negation v.\n\nThen, in order to show Equation (5) is a convex optimization problem, we need to both the objective function and constraints are convex. Specifically,\n(i). The objective function J(\\hat{x},y) (Equation(5a)) is convex, non-decreasing with respect to \\hat{x} and y;\n(ii). The functions f and g are parameterized as ICRNNs with all weight matrices non-negative, which ensures f and g are convex and non-decreasing. Therefore rolling it out over time, the compositions remain convex with respect to the input.\n(iii). The consistency constraint (5e) that one variable is the negation of the other is linear, therefore it preserves the convexity of optimization problems.\n\nWe have clarified this discussion in the revised manuscript.\n\n-\tConvexity on Equation (6)\n\nAs a similar case to the optimization problem in Equation (5),  the system dynamics is governed  by Equation (6b). By restricting all weight matrices in ICNN to be non-negative and expanding  the inputs, the MPC formulation for MuJuCo case is convex with respect to control action vectors at different time. As shown in Fig. 3,  such convex properties also guaranteed that our  results on a series of control tasks outperformed current neural network based dynamical model. \n\n\nResponse to reviewer\u2019s other comments:\n-\tFigure 1 hides too much information\nWe agree and have revised Figure 1 to include more information about problem setup related to modeling objective, control objective and constraints. In the left plot of revised Figure 1, we describe how an input convex neural network can be trained to learn the system dynamics. Then the right plot demonstrates the overall control framework, where we solve a convex predictive control problem to find the optimal actions. The optimization steps are also based on objectives and dynamics constraints represented by the trained networks.\n\n-\tThe theoretical results in Section 3 seem slightly out-of-place within the broader context of this paper\n\nWe thank the reviewer for this question. The key idea for this section is by making the neural network convex from input to output, we are able to obtain both good predictive accuracies and tractable computational optimization problems. There are two main results presented in Section 3, Theorem 1 is about the representation capacity of ICNN (can represent all convex functions) and Theorem 2 is on the representation efficiency of ICNN (can be exponentially more efficient than conventional convex piecewise linear fitting [MP]). \n\nSince our proposed control framework involves two stages: 1) using ICNN/ICRNN for system identification; 2) design an optimal controller via solving a predictive control problem. For the system identification stage, obviously, one benefit of using input convex networks (instead of conventional neural networks) is its computational trackability and optimality guarantee for the subsequent optimization stage. However, besides the trackability, reasonable representation capacity to model complex relationships is also desired as a system identification model. Theorem 1 and 2, on this aspect, demonstrate such representability and efficiency of ICNN. In the revised manuscript, we have added the above discussion at the beginning of Section 3 to improve the coherence of the paper.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1332/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1332/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1332/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Optimal Control Via Neural Networks: A Convex Approach", "abstract": "Control of complex systems involves both system identification and controller design.

ICNN is a neural network that only contains non-negative weights. Thanks to this constraint, ICNN is convex with respect to an input, therefore MPC problem with an ICNN model and additional convex constraints on control inputs is a convex optimization problem.\nWhile it is not easy to solve such a convex problem, it has a global optimum, and a gradient descent algorithm will eventually reach such a point. It should also be noted that a convex problem has a robustness with respect to an initial starting point and an ICNN model itself as well. The latter is pretty important, since training ICNN (or NN) is a non-convex optimization, so the parameters in trained ICNN (or NN) model can vary depending on the initial random weights and learning rates, etc. Since a convex MPC has some robustness (or margin) over an error or deviation in system dynamics, while non-convex MPC does not, using ICNN can also stabilize the control inputs in MPC.\nOverall, I believe that using ICNN to from convex MPC is a sample-efficient, non-intrusive way of constructing a controller with unknown dynamics.

These types of networks, constructed based on either MLP or RNN, are shown to have similar representation power as their non-convex versions, thus are potentially able to better capture the dynamics behind complex systems compared with linear models. On the other hand, convexity on inputs brings much convenience to the later optimization part, because there are no worries on global/local minimum or escaping saddle points. In other words, convex but nonlinear provides not only enough search space, but also fast and tractable optimization. The compromise here is the size of memory, since 1) more weights and biases are needed to connect inputs and hidden layers in such nets and 2) we need to store also the negative parts on a portion of weights. \n\nEven though the idea of convex networks were not new, this work is novel in extending input convex RNN and applying it into dynamic control problems. As the main theoretical contribution, Theorem 2 shows that to have same representation power, input convex nets use polynomial number of activation functions, compared with exponential from using a set of affine functions. Experiments also show such effectiveness. The paper is clearly and nicely written. These are reasons I suggest accept.\n\n\nQuestions and suggestions:\n\n1) For Lemma 1 and Theorem 1, I wonder whether similar results can be established for non-convex functions. Intuitively, it seems that as long as assuming Lipschiz continuous, we can always approximate a function by a maximum of many affine functions, no matter it is convex or not. Is this right or something is missing?\n\n2) In the main paper, all experiments were aimed to address ICNN and ICRNN have good accuracy, but not they are easier to optimize due to convexity. In the abstract, it is mentioned \"... using 5X less time\", but I can only see this through appendix. A suggestion is at least describing some results on the comparison with training time in the main paper.\n\n3) In Appendix A, it seems the NN is not trained very well as shown in the left figure. Is this because the number of parameters of NN is restricted to be the same as in ICNN? Do training on both spend the same resource, ie, number of epoch? Such descriptions are necessary here.\n\n4) In Table 2 in appendix, why the running time of ICNN increases by a magnitude for large H in Ant case?\n\n\nTypos:\n\tPage 1 \"simple control algorithms HAS ...\"\n\tPage 7 paragraph \"Baselines\": \"Such (a) method\".\n\tIn the last line of Table 2, 979.73 should be bold instead of 5577.\n\tThere is a ?? in appendix D.4.\n\t\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1332/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Optimal Control Via Neural Networks: A Convex Approach", "abstract": "Control of complex systems involves both system identification and controller design.

It is known that convex optimization is always tractable, so if the true system can be convex, or almost exactly regressed by a convex function, we can make use of it. However, for modeling complex systems, where neural network becomes more popular, there is no guarantee that step 1 outputs a convex system -- even if the system is convex, we do not know whether the model is convex unless we can prove that they are close enough, which is usually difficult. So paper such as https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02596 use a non-convex model and have to search for the control strategy by griding and testing the entire space almost exhaustedly.\n\nThis paper propose an NN structure which is simply based on only Relu, but guarantees a convex modeling of the system. Compared with maximum piecewise linear modeling, it only introduces a fixed 2 piece linear activating module, but dramatically decreases the number of parameters from exponential to polynomial, which makes it realizable.\n\nBut if it's true, now something interesting might come up. The authors show that even for seemingly hard scenarios including Mujoco, it performances well to attempt a convex model, whose optimizer corresponds to good control scheme in true problems. It likely means that, despite the impossibility to show the model is everywhere accurate, the model well sketches the landscape of true loss around its minimizer (where is probably locally convex) and the trajectory of optimizing iterations, where people are interested. I'm not sure if that's true. NN always surprise people, but it's definitely worth rethinking and experimenting, based on the result on such complex tasks in this paper.", "title": "Efficient model based control of almost convex systems -- convexity comes in surprisingly"}, "signatures": ["(anonymous)"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1332/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["(anonymous)", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Optimal Control Via Neural Networks: A Convex Approach", "abstract": "Control of complex systems involves both system identification and controller design. Deep neural networks have proven to be successful in many identification tasks, however, from model-based control perspective, these networks are difficult to work with because they are typically nonlinear and nonconvex. Therefore many systems are still identified and controlled based on simple linear models despite their poor representation capability.\n\nIn this paper we bridge the gap between model accuracy and control tractability faced by neural networks, by explicitly constructing networks that are convex with respect to their inputs. We show that these input convex networks can be trained to obtain accurate models of complex physical systems. In particular, we design input convex recurrent neural networks to capture temporal behavior of dynamical systems. Then optimal controllers can be achieved via solving a convex model predictive control problem. Experiment results demonstrate the good potential of the proposed input convex neural network based approach in a variety of control applications.
