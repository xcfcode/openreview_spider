Post-training step: keeping the rest of the NN frozen (after training), the method trains the last layer in order to \"make sure\" that the representation learned is used in the most efficient way.\n2. Highlighting connections with kernel techniques and RKHS optimization (like kernel ridge regression).\n3. Experimental results.\n\nClarity:\nThe paper is well-written, the main ideas well-clarified. \n\nImportance:\nWhile the majority of papers nowadays focuses on the representation part (i.e., how we get to \\Phi_{L-1}(x)), this paper assumes this is given and proposes how to optimize the weights in the final step of the algorithm. This by itself is not enough to boost the performance universally (e.g., if \\Phi_{L-1} is not well-trained, the problem is deeper than training the last layer); however, it proposes an additional step that can be used in most NN architectures. From that front (i.e., proposing to do something different than simply training a NN), I find the paper interesting, that might attract some attention at the conference.\n\nOn the other hand, to my humble opinion, the experimental results do not show a significant gain in the performances of all networks (esp. Figure 3 and Table 1 are within the range of statistical error). In order to state something like this universally, either one needs to perform experiments with more than just MNIST/CIFAR datasets, or even more preferably, prove that the algorithm performs better.\n\nOriginality:\nIt would be great to have some more theory (if any) for the post-training step, or investigate more cases, rather than optimizing only the last layer.\n\nComments:\n1. I assume the authors focused in the last layer of the NN for simplicity, but is there a reason why one might want to focus only on the last layer? One reason is convexity in W of the problem (2). Any other? \n\n2. Have the authors considered (even in practice only) to include training of the last 2 layers of the NN? The authors state this question in the future direction, but it would make the paper more complete to consider it here.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Post-training for Deep Learning", "abstract": "One of the main challenges of deep learning methods is the choice of an appropriate training strategy.

The second phase involves freezing all but the last layer and optimizing the loss function with respect to the weights at the last layer over several additional iterations of training. The authors assert that this additional phase can lead to an improvement of performance in neural networks.\n\nWe attempted to reproduce the experiments performed by the authors in order to verify the claims in the paper. The paper is crisp, clear, and well-written in its explanations and hence facilitated the understanding and reproducibility process. In addition, the authors have kindly made their code public, and all experiments were conducted on either well-known datasets or those that could be generated with details provided in the paper. We found that the clarity of the code is also reasonable and any technical details lacking in the report could, for the most part, be found in the code.\n\nThe authors performed experiments on three major classes of neural networks, namely CNNs, RNNs, and Feed Forward Neural Networks, using different datasets to compare the performance of additional post-training with classical training. We observed a discrepancy between the paper and its implementation in the setting of these iterations. In general, in the provided code, the accuracy or error comparison (based on the experiment) is made between q iterations of regular training and q regularly-trained iterations + p iterations of post-training. In only the experiment of the CIFAR-10 dataset using CNN, q+100 iterations of regular-training were compared with q regularly-trained iterations + 100 iterations of post-training. Nonetheless, for all observed iterations and network complexities, we confirmed the authors\u2019 findings that applying post-training, on average, improves test accuracy, and executes faster than regular training per iteration. That being said, through our own experimentation, we found that in the Kernel Ridge Regression experiment, an additional number of iterations of regular training would, in-fact, result in lower test error than the equal number of additional iterations of post-training, without necessarily overfitting. For example, at 250 iterations on the fully-connected network using the Parkinson Telemonitoring dataset, the error claimed by the authors in Table 2 of the paper is 0.832. With an additional 200 iterations of post-training, the error reduces to 0.433, however if instead 200 iterations of regular training were performed, we found that the error would have reduced to 0.167. Also, for the CNN experiment on the MNIST dataset, there was no clear relationship between the number of training iterations in the paper and those run in the code, which meant we could not reproduce the training conditions with certainty.\n\nOverall, we believe that the paper is well presented and the experiments support the advantages of post-training stated by the authors. We conclude that the paper is reproducible.\n\nLink to full report: https://github.com/deekshaarya4/Post_training/blob/master/reproducing-post-training-deeplearning.pdf"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Post-training for Deep Learning", "abstract": "One of the main challenges of deep learning methods is the choice of an appropriate training strategy.

As such, the authors propose a final 'post training' step, which only updates the final layers of a network. One benefit of such an approach is that, given a fixed representation, learning the final layer weights is convex for many choice of the activation functions in the final layer. \n\nThe authors propose an interesting link with kernels. From reading the paper, it seemed to me that there was also a relationship between representation learning from the perspective of non-linear ICA, recently proposed by Hyvarinen & Morioka (2016), which I thought I would share with you.  \nIn their work, Hyvarinen & Morioka show that when a classification task is combined with a function approximator (eg a deep net) , the final representation learnt by the network (i.e., what the authors here refer to as $\\Phi_{L-1}(x)$) will be equal to the independent components which generated the data (roughly speaking). As a result, it may be possible/interesting to interpret post training as first learning the non-linear unmixing of independent components followed by post training which then performs classification on the original independent components. \n\nDisclaimer: I am not associated with the referenced paper, just wanted to provide an additional justification for the proposed method :)\n\nGood luck!\n\nReferences:\nHyvarinen & Morioka, \"Unsupervised Feature Extraction by Time-Contrastive Learning and Nonlinear ICA\", NIPS 2016"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Post-training for Deep Learning", "abstract": "One of the main challenges of deep learning methods is the choice of an appropriate training strategy.
