To clarify, Eq (8) corresponds to the GNN update rule in [Gilmer et al. 2017] (in which the read-out function is a GRU) and Eq (9) is our update rule (CIE). So Eq (8) and (9) are for different methods. We do not employ any GRUs in our algorithm. Instead, we adopt a Graph Convolutional Layer with ReLU activation.\n\nOur main contribution is to propose a Hungarian attention mechanism, which dynamically generates links in computational graph and proved beneficial to graph matching. Though the experiments are confined in vision for the relatively standard experiment protocol in this area and rich public benchmark, while as discussed in our response to review#4, graph matching itself is a fundamental problem in computer science. \n\nAnd more importantly, the added new results in response to review#1 (imposing Hungarian attention to [1])  showed that our Hungarian attention is a general and effective means to improve graph matching (in [1] geometric edge features are utilized). In fact, the paper is written in an abstractive level in terms of the technical approach (the edge embedding and Hungarian attention are both general and have nothing to do with images), and the related work. Though the experiments are concerned with vision setting for the reasons we mention above (and also due to space limitation). We will add more broad discussion in the introduction and add the new results in the experiment part.\n\n[1] Zhen Zhang, and Wee Sun Lee. \"Deep Graphical Feature Learning for the Feature Matching Problem.\", ICCV 2019\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper40/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper40/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning deep graph matching with channel-independent embedding and Hungarian attention", "authors": ["Tianshu Yu", "Runzhong Wang", "Junchi Yan", "Baoxin Li"], "authorids": ["tianshuy@asu.edu", "runzhong.wang@sjtu.edu.cn", "yanjunchi@sjtu.edu.cn", "baoxin.li@asu.edu"], "keywords": ["deep graph matching", "edge embedding", "combinatorial problem", "Hungarian loss"], "TL;DR": "We proposed a deep graph matching method with novel channel-independent embedding and Hungarian loss, which achieved state-of-the-art performance.", "abstract": "Graph matching aims to establishing node-wise correspondence between two graphs, which is a classic combinatorial problem and in general NP-complete.

Besides vision, it also has wide applications in protein alignment, software quality check, graphics, resource allocation, social network analysis etc. with many application papers using off-the-shelf graph matching techniques.\n\nWe mainly conduct experiments under the vision setting in line with the majority of literature in this area. This is because there are several public and well-maintained graph matching datasets and experiment protocol in vision community, which makes the evaluation more direct and convenient. \n\nTo further show the benefit of our method, we conduct an extra experiment (PASCAL-PF with only geometric edge features) by incorporating the proposed Hungarian Attention mechanism to the method in [1]. We observed performance enhancement consistently. Please refer to 'response to review#1' for more details.\n\nIn general, the extra parameters involved in our algorithm compared to PCA are on the calculation of edge embedding.

Similarly, I am a bit confused by equations (8) and (9) as there is a H^(t+1)_v in both equations. Does equation (9) make the function u_t explicit? Then what is \\Gamma_N and similarly what is \\Gamma_E in equation (11)?\nAs it is written, this paper seems more appropriate for a conference in vision.
