The resulting model is general-purpose and experiments demonstrate efficacy on few-shot image classification and a range of reinforcement learning tasks.\n\nStrengths\n\n- The proposed model is a generic meta-learning useful for both classification and reinforcement learning.\n- A wide range of experiments are conducted to demonstrate performance of the proposed method.\n\nWeaknesses\n\n- Design choices made for the reinforcement learning setup (e.g. temporal convolutions) are not necessarily applicable to few-shot classification.\n- Discussion of results relative to baselines is somewhat lacking.\n\nThe proposed approach is novel to my knowledge and overcomes specificity of previous approaches while remaining efficient.\n\nThe depth of the TC block is determined by the sequence length. In few-shot classification, the sequence length can be known a prior. How is the sequence length determined for reinforcement learning tasks? In addition, what is done at test-time if the sequence length differs from the sequence length at training time?\n\nThe causality assumption does not seem to apply to the few-shot classification case.

Some additional discussion of the results would be appreciated (for example, explaining why the proposed method achieves similar performance to the LSTM/OPSRL baselines).\n\nI am not following the assertion in 5.2.3 that MAML adaption curves can be seen as an upper bound on the performance of gradient-based methods. I am wondering if the authors can clarify this point.\n\nOverall, the proposed approach is novel and achieves good results on a range of tasks.\n\nEDIT: I have read the author's comments and am satisfied with their response.

The model interweaves attention layers, akin to those used by Vaswani et al, with temporal convolution. The authors demonstrate superior performance on a variety of benchmark problems, including those for supervised classification and for sequential decision making.\n\nUnfortunately, I am not an expert in meta-learning, so I cannot comment on the difficulty of the tasks (e.g. Omniglot) used to evaluate the model or the appropriateness of the baselines the authors compare against (e.g. continuous control).\n\nThe experiment section definitely demonstrate the effort put into this work. However, my primary concern is that the model seems somewhat lacking in novelty. Namely, it interweaves the Vaswani style attention with with temporal convolutions (along with TRPO. The authors claim that Vaswani model does not incoporate positional information, but from my understanding, it actually does so using positional encoding. I also do not see why the Vaswani model cannot be lightly adapted for sequential decision making. I think comparison to such a similar model would strengthen the novelty of this paper (e.g. convolution is a superior method of incorporating positional information).\n\nMy second concern is that the authors do not provide analysis and/or intuitions on why the proposed models outperform prior art in few-shot learning. I think this information would be very useful to the community in terms of what to take away from this paper. In retrospect, I wish the authors would have spent more time doing ablation studies than tackling more task domains.\n\nOverall, I am inclined to accept this paper on the basis of its experimental results.

Through intensive experiments on various settings including few-shot image classification on Omniglot and Mini-ImageNet, and four reinforcement learning applications, the authors show that the proposed structure can achieve highly comparable performance wrt the corresponding specially designed state-of-the-art methods. The experiment results seem solid and the proposed structure is with simple design and highly generalizable. The concern is that the contribution is quite incremental from the theoretical side though it involves large amount of experimental efforts, which could be impactful. Please see the major comment below.\n\nOne major comment:\n- Despite that the work is more application oriented, the paper would have been stronger and more impactful if it includes more work on the theoretical side. \nSpecifically, for two folds: \n(1) in general, some more work in investigating the task space would be nice. The paper assumes the tasks are \u201crelated\u201d or \u201csimilar\u201d and thus transferrable; also particularly in Section 2, the authors define that the tasks follow the same distribution. But what exactly should the distribution be like to be learnable and how to quantify such \u201crelated\u201d or \u201csimilar\u201d relationship across tasks? \n(2) in particular, for each of the experiments that the authors conduct, it would be nice to investigate some more on when the proposed TC + Attention network would work better and thus should be used by the community; some questions to answer include: when should we prefer the proposed combination of TC + attention blocks over the other methods? The result from the paper seems to answer with \u201cin all cases\u201d but then that always brings the issue of \u201coverfitting\u201d or parameter tuning issue. I believe the paper would have been much stronger if either of the two above are further investigated.\n\nMore detailed comments:\n- On Page 1, \u201cthe optimal strategy for an arbitrary range of tasks\u201d lacks definition of \u201crange\u201d; also, in the setting in this paper, these tasks should share \u201csimilarity\u201d or follow the same \u201cdistribution\u201d and thus such \u201carbitrariness\u201d is actually constrained.\n\n- On Page 2, the notation and formulation for the meta-learning could be more mathematically rigid; the distribution over tasks is not defined. It is understandable that the authors try to make the paradigm very generalizable; but the ambiguity or the abstraction over the \u201ctask distribution\u201d is too large to be meaningful. One suggestion would be to split into two sections, one for supervised learning and one for reinforcement learning; but both share the same design paradigm, which is generalizable.\n\n- For results in Table 1 and Table 2, how are the confidence intervals computed? Is it over multiple runs or within the same run? It would be nice to make clear; in addition, I personally prefer either reporting raw standard deviations or conduct hypothesis testing with specified tests. The confidence intervals may not be clear without elaboration; such is also concerning in the caption for Table 3 about claiming \u201cnot statistically-significantly different\u201d because no significance test is reported. \n\n- At last, some more details in implementation would be nice (package availability, run time analysis); I suppose the package or the source code would be publicly available afterwards?", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Simple Neural Attentive Meta-Learner", "abstract": "Deep neural networks excel in regimes with large amounts of data, but tend to struggle when data is scarce or when they need to adapt quickly to changes in the task.

For example, in Matching Networks [2], the authors pass the feature vectors through an LSTM before doing their attention operator. Without TCs or a LSTM, the embeddings on which we \u201cattend\u201d are myopic in the sense that each example is embedded independently of the other examples in the support set. The use of embeddings that are a function of the entire support set was found to be essential in [2].\n\nIn Appendix B Table 6, we conduct several ablation studies to evaluate how much each aspect of SNAIL contributed to its overall performance (in the few-shot classification domain). These suggest that both TC\u2019s and attention are both essential components of the SNAIL architecture.\n\nThe primary strength of SNAIL is that it is maximally generic, making no assumptions about the structure of the learned meta-algorithm. In domains such as few-shot classification, there exists human intuition about algorithmic priors. Methods built around particular inductive biases (such as Matching Networks [2] or Prototypical Networks [4], which learn distance metrics) work reasonably well; SNAIL is versatile enough to match or exceed this performance. \n\nHowever, the true utility of meta-learning is to learn algorithms for domains where there is little human intuition (which occurs in many RL tasks). Indeed, our experiments show that MAML [3], which uses gradient descent as the algorithmic prior, performs poorly. In contrast, SNAIL\u2019s lack of algorithmic prior offers the flexibility to learn an algorithm from scratch. Furthermore, in domains such as bandits or MDPs, we show that SNAIL is competitive with human designed algorithms.\n\nAs discussed in the paper, one caveat is that SNAIL\u2019s flexibility results in a large number of model parameters, which can lead to overfitting on extremely out-of-distribution tasks. For instance, the official Omniglot test set represents task distribution that are \u201cclose\u201d to the training task distribution, and MNIST could define another task distribution that is much farther away from the training distribution. Following Matching Networks [2], we took a SNAIL model trained on [20-way, 5-shot Omniglot] and tested it in [10-way, 5-shot, MNIST], achieving 68% accuracy. In contrast, [2], which use distance metric as the algorithmic prior, obtains 72%. \n\nOur analysis of thus: all meta-learning methods, given sufficient capacity, achieve roughly the same performance on the training task distribution (or when the distance between training and test distributions is zero). As this distance increases, any method\u2019s performance will necessarily decrease; as indicated by our empirical results, SNAIL\u2019s performance drops off slower than that of other methods, as SNAIL\u2019s versatility allows it to learn more expressive and specialized strategies. However, as the distance from the training distribution becomes very large, in the regime where there is less potential for meta-learning, methods with algorithmic priors have slightly \u201cheavier tails\u201d than SNAIL. A benchmark that allows more precise extrapolation along this axis (distance from training distribution) would likely offer more insight, although the curation of such a benchmark is beyond the scope of this work.\n\nBelow, we respond to the individual comments of the reviewers.\n\n[1] Finn et al. \u201cModel Agnostic Meta-Learning\u201d. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03400.pdf\n[2] Vinyals et al. \u201dMatching Networks for Few-Shot Learning\u201d. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04080.pdf\n[3] Vaswani et al. \u201cAttention is all you need\u201d. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf\n[4] Snell et al. \u201cPrototypical Networks for Few-Shot Learning\u201d. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05175.pdf\n[5] Santoro et al. \u201cMeta-Learning with Memory-Augmented Neural Networks\u201d. http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/santoro16.pdf\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Simple Neural Attentive Meta-Learner", "abstract": "Deep neural networks excel in regimes with large amounts of data, but tend to struggle when data is scarce or when they need to adapt quickly to changes in the task.

Here we respond to your specific comments.\n\n\u201cin general, some more work in investigating the task space would be nice. The paper assumes the tasks are \u201crelated\u201d or \u201csimilar\u201d and thus transferrable; also particularly in Section 2, the authors define that the tasks follow the same distribution. But what exactly should the distribution be like to be learnable and how to quantify such \u201crelated\u201d or \u201csimilar\u201d relationship across tasks?\u201d \n\n>>> Measures of task similarity would certainly be useful in understanding how well we can expect a meta-learner to generalize. However, it remains an open problem and beyond the scope of our work -- our contribution is the proposed class of model architectures, which we experimentally validate on a number of benchmarks (where there is a high degree of task similarity, and thus potential for meta-learning to succeed) from the meta-learning literature.\n\n\u201cOn Page 2, the notation and formulation for the meta-learning could be more mathematically rigid; the distribution over tasks is not defined. It is understandable that the authors try to make the paradigm very generalizable; but the ambiguity or the abstraction over the \u201ctask distribution\u201d is too large to be meaningful. One suggestion would be to split into two sections, one for supervised learning and one for reinforcement learning; but both share the same design paradigm, which is generalizable.\u201d\n\n>>> Our formulation of the meta-learning problem is consistent with prior work, as one can see in MAML [1] and Matching Networks [2].\n\n\u201cFor results in Table 1 and Table 2, how are the confidence intervals computed? Is it over multiple runs or within the same run? It would be nice to make clear; in addition, I personally prefer either reporting raw standard deviations or conduct hypothesis testing with specified tests. The confidence intervals may not be clear without elaboration; such is also concerning in the caption for Table 3 about claiming \u201cnot statistically-significantly different\u201d because no significance test is reported.\u201d\n\n>>> The confidence intervals in Tables 1 & 2 are calculated over 10000 episodes of the evaluation procedure described in Section 5.1 (95% confidence). The statistical significance in Table 3 is determined by a one-sided t-test with p=0.05.

In general, past work (and this work) consider such processing because it\u2019s compatible with streaming over incoming data (relevant for future large scale applications) and it aligns well with future extensions on few-shot active learning (where the model sequentially creates its own support set by querying an oracle to label a chosen image from the dataset). \n\n\u201cThe depth of the TC block is determined by the sequence length.

If the episode length is unbounded, or differs between training and test, we can simply choose a reasonable value (depending on the problem) and rely on the fact that the attention operation has an infinite receptive field.

(2017).\u201d\n\n>>>  Snell et al. [4] found that using more classes at training time than at test time improved their model\u2019s performance. Their best results used 20 classes at training time and 5 at test time. To make their results comparable to prior work, we reported the performance of Prototypical Networks when the same number of classes was used at training and test time (Appendix Tables 5 and 6 in their paper), as all of the methods we listed in Tables 1 & 2 might also benefit from this modification.\n\n\u201cI am not following the assertion in 5.2.3 that MAML adaption curves can be seen as an upper bound on the performance of gradient-based methods. I am wondering if the authors can clarify this point.\u201d\n\n>>> These set of experiments were conducted to demonstrate the advantage of having highly general meta-learners where the meta-algorithm is fully-learned, especially when it comes to task distributions with a lot of exploitable structure. These continuous control problems originally introduced by the MAML paper can be easily solved by the agent identifying which task it is in over the first couple timesteps and then proceeding to execute the optimal policy.  In the above comment, which we should reword, we meant to say that MAML\u2019s performance demonstrates that gradient-based methods which take their update steps after several test rollouts are fundamentally disadvantaged compared to RNN-like methods for this problem. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Simple Neural Attentive Meta-Learner", "abstract": "Deep neural networks excel in regimes with large amounts of data, but tend to struggle when data is scarce or when they need to adapt quickly to changes in the task.
