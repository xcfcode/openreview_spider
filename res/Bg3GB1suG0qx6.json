Moreover some datasets do not contain content information, or this information is so noisy that it cannot be used for prediction. But you are right, content is important.\r\n\r\nActually, the paper is a short paper proposing an extension of a previoulsy published model which is able to consider the content information. Due to the limited size of the short papers, we have decided to focus on the 'without content' version of our previous model which obtains reasonnably good performance in comparison to the 'with content' version. But using content information in the proposed approach is not so complicated.\r\n\r\nTo follow your remark, we will add a small paragraph in the current paper explaining how content information can be taken into account.\r\n\r\n Thank you"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Information Spread in Content Networks", "decision": "submitted, no decision", "abstract": "We introduce a model for predicting the diffusion of content information on social media.
