The model is a neural network, and the optimization is carried out through a genetic algorithm.\n\nPros:\n - One major issue with neural network classification is that of a lack of explainability. Many networks are currently \"black box\" approaches. By moving to the optimization problem to that of building a feature space for nearest neighbor classification, one can, to a degree, alleviate the \"black box\" issue by providing the discovered nearest neighbor instances as \"evidence\" of the decision.\n- Authors use established datasets.\n\nCons:\n- Authors do not properly cite previous work, as brought up by reviewers. There is much literature on optimization of feature spaces (such as the entire field of metric learning), as well as prior approaches using genetic optimization. The originality and significance here is therefore not clear.

The parameters of the FFNN are updated via a genetic algorithm with a fitness function defined as the error on the downstream classification, on a held-out set. The performance of this approach is measured on several UCI datasets and compared with baselines.\n\u2013 The paper\u2019s main contribution seems to be a neural network with a GA optimization for classification that can learn \u201cintelligent combinations of features\u201d, which can be easily classified by a simple 1NN classifier. But isn't this exactly what neural networks do \u2013 learn intelligent combinations of features optimized (in this case, via GA) for a downstream task? This has already been successfully applied in multiple domains eg. in computer vision (Krizhevsky et al, NIPS 2011), NLP (Bahdanau et al 2014), image retrieval (Krizhevsky et al. ESANN 2011) etc, and also studied comprehensively in autoencoding literature. There also exists prior work on optimizing neural nets via GA (Leung, Frank Hung-Fat et al., IEEE Transactions on Neural networks 2003). However, this paper claims both as novelties while not offering any improvement / comparison. \n\u2013 The claim \u201cthere is no need to use more powerful and complex classifier anymore\u201d is unsubstantiated, as the paper\u2019s approach still entails using a complex classifier (a FFNN) to learn an optimal intermediate representation.\n\u2013 The choice of activations is not motivated, and performance on variants is not reported. For instance, why is that particular sigmoid formulation used? \n\u2013 The use for a genetic algorithm for optimization is not motivated, and no comparison is made to the performance and efficiency of other approaches (like standard backpropagation). So it is unclear why GA makes for a better choice of optimization, if at all.\n\u2013 The primary baselines compared to are unsupervised methods (PCA and LDA), and so demonstrating improvements over those with a supervised representation does not seem significant or surprising. It would be useful to compare with a simple neural network baseline trained for K-way classification with standard backpropagation (though the UCI datasets may potentially be too small to achieve good performance).\n\u2013 The paper is poorly written, containing several typos and incomplete, unintelligible sentences, incorrect captions (eg. Table 4) etc.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ENRICHMENT OF FEATURES FOR CLASSIFICATION USING AN OPTIMIZED LINEAR/NON-LINEAR COMBINATION OF INPUT FEATURES", "abstract": "Automatic classification of objects is one of the most important tasks in engineering\nand data mining applications.

Since nature of data sets\nand their features impact on the effectiveness of combination and classification\nsystem, linear and non-linear activation functions (or transfer function) are used\nto achieve more reliable system. Experiments of several UCI data sets and using\nminimum distance classifier as a simple classifier indicate that proposed linear and\nnon-linear intelligent FFNN-based feature combination can present more reliable\nand promising results. By using such a feature combination method, there is no\nneed to use more powerful and complex classifier anymore.", "pdf": "/pdf/6688e99d4fcae355db8ba20fe76081f0346fd525.pdf", "TL;DR": "A method for enriching and combining features to improve classification accuracy", "paperhash": "taghipourgorjikolaie|enrichment_of_features_for_classification_using_an_optimized_linearnonlinear_combination_of_input_features", "_bibtex": "@misc{\ntaghipour-gorjikolaie2018enrichment,\ntitle={{ENRICHMENT} {OF} {FEATURES} {FOR} {CLASSIFICATION} {USING} {AN} {OPTIMIZED} {LINEAR}/{NON}-{LINEAR} {COMBINATION} {OF} {INPUT} {FEATURES}},\nauthor={Mehran Taghipour-Gorjikolaie and Seyyed Mohammad Razavi and Javad Sadri},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJqUtdOaZ},\n}", "keywords": ["Classification", "Feature Combination", "Feature Mapping", "Feed-Forward Neural Network", "Genetic Algorithm", "Linear Transfer Function", "Non-Linear Transfer Function"], "authors": ["Mehran Taghipour-Gorjikolaie", "Seyyed Mohammad Razavi", "Javad Sadri"], "authorids": ["mehran.tg.88@gmail.com", "razavism@gmail.com", "j_sadri@encs.concordia.ca"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "duedate": 1511845199000, "tmdate": 1515642434430, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper34/Official_Review", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper34/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper34/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper34/AnonReviewer3", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper34/AnonReviewer2"], "reply": {"forum": "HJqUtdOaZ", "replyto": "HJqUtdOaZ", "writers": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper34/AnonReviewer[0-9]+", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "review": {"required": true, "order": 2, "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}"}, "rating": {"required": true, "order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"]}, "confidence": {"required": true, "order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"]}}}, "nonreaders": [], "expdate": 1519621199000, "cdate": 1515642434430}}}], "count": 5}
