That\u2019s a very nice/simple idea that has the potential for improving the performance on rare labels. We implemented the standard 1/sqrt weighting scheme (used in other works such as Word2Vec) and re-performed our hyperparameter search for the protein models. We have noted this baseline within the paper and included the exact performance table in the appendix. \n\nThe reweighting does seem to somewhat improve performance on some of the codes (particularly those that are of medium frequency or above). However, it does not seem to help much in the more rare scenarios that we are investigating. The main issue is that these codes are rare enough that we believe that there are too few examples to even train the final classification layer.  It\u2019s possible that increased weight on those labels simply encourages more overfitting on those few examples.\n\nThe MeSH dataset certainly sounds interesting and seems to be a nice public multi-label dataset. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have the resources to run our experiments on that dataset for this paper. We already have two different datasets with a total of three distinct setups.

We have included said confidence intervals in the tables within the appendix. In general, even though there are a very small number of positive examples per label, the vast number of labels enables us to compute performance differences between methods with a certain amount of precision.\n\n2) You are correct that we do not currently deal with the issue of missing labels. Missing labels are definitely present in these datasets, as many protein annotations simply aren\u2019t recorded and many diseases aren\u2019t diagnosed (or at the very least coded). Our work is primarily focused only on improving the predictive power for the rare labels given the data we have. Exploring the missing label problem would be an interesting future extension and we do believe that this work might be able to help with those efforts.\n\n3) As for the baselines, our focus is to compare the bayesian network modification compared to the flat-sigmoid approach, which is the standard approach used in state-of-the-art methods. It is difficult to exactly replicate others\u2019 datasets, but the baseline was tuned equally heavily to provide a fair comparison. \n\n4) We are aware that there are features such as protein interaction networks that can improve prediction performance for specific tasks, but the focus of the paper is not protein function prediction. Rather, the focus is on a generic machine learning algorithm that could be applied to many non-biological tasks.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper136/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper136/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper136/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Using Ontologies To Improve Performance In Massively Multi-label Prediction", "abstract": "Massively multi-label prediction/classification problems arise in environments like health-care or biology where it is useful to make very precise predictions.

This is for use in massively multi-label situations where the class outputs are connected to some ontology.

The only issue I have with the features and model is when in 3.1.2 the weights for the medical labels as input to the encoder are said to be 'tied' to the output label embeddings. I would like to have seem more justification for this (perhaps just the keeping number of parameters down?) or evaluation as to whether it helped - I think it may have hindered because of how the output label is used in the dot product.\nThe stated difference between this work and previous hierarchical softmax models is that they use DAG structures, not just tree structures. However, of the two datasets they try, only one (proteins) has a DAG structure to the ontology, and they do not have a baseline comparison with a hierarchical softmax model.\nThe method does show improvements at low number of examples against a flat sigmoid model in the small disease prediction and protein function prediction, but other results are mixed, especially for the proteins with the DAG ontology, which is where one would have liked to see an advantage.\nI would like to have seen performance against a hierarchical soft max framework, or on some openly available or benchmark datasets, otherwise it is hard to judge the utility of the method.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper136/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Using Ontologies To Improve Performance In Massively Multi-label Prediction", "abstract": "Massively multi-label prediction/classification problems arise in environments like health-care or biology where it is useful to make very precise predictions.

Essentially, the probability of assigning the label (leaf node) should be account for the probability of it being observed, namely the prior. Thus it is not surprising that for the rare labels, the proposed method would yield higher precision. However, the experiments don\u2019t really include any significance measurement; especially for such tasks where the number of testing examples with rare labels is small (5~10 positive examples), significance measurement or some forms of hypothesis testing is a must-have in order to draw conclusion about the performance comparison. Answering such significance issue with tests for overfitting would be nice.\n\n2) My other major concern is for the protein function prediction task, the reason of why for certain labels, the number of instances is small, could be due to that a) there don\u2019t exist much biological web-lab evidence, or b) among the population, there indeed only exist small number of proteins associated with such labels. The proposed method can address b) but not necessarily address a).\n\n3) The paper discusses the other results very briefly in Section 5 but doesn\u2019t include any experiment comparison. Thus it is not convincing that the proposed method is making contribution to the field of disease prediction, protein function prediction or even general multi-label prediction. I would suggest to include the comparison with the state of the art methods for each application.\n\n4) Particularly for protein function prediction, another line of studies is to use protein protein interaction networks or other sources such as functional pathways rather than using sequence information alone (ref below).

The experimental design and description of the methods is excellent. \n\nWeaknesses:\nOverall the results are not consistently strong and there is a key baseline missing. The approach only seems help in the \"rare label, small data\" regime, which limits the applicability of the method but is still worthy of consideration. \n\nMy biggest reservation is that the authors did not include a baseline where the classes are reweighted according to their frequency. Multilabel binary cross-entropy is very easy to modify to incorporate class weights (e.g. upweight the minority class for each label) and without this baseline I am unable to discern how well the method works relative to this simple baseline.\n\nOne more dataset would also strengthen the results, and since I am suggesting more work I will also try to be helpful and be specific.
