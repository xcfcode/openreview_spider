The key idea is to regularize the learned feature space by forcing embeddings of states followed by the same action (or sequence of actions) to be more similar than embeddings of states followed by different actions. The method is evaluated on the Procgen and achieves superior performance relative to Rainbow, a standard RL algorithm.\n\n\nStrengths \n\nI do like the core idea of this paper and I think it makes sense intuitively. I also think the paper is trying to solve an important problem in RL which has been neglected until recently. In addition, the proposed method is simple and achieves much better generalization than Rainbow. However, I think the paper needs more work to be ready for publication for the reasons laid out below. \n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe main weakness of this paper is the lack of comparisons with previously proposed methods for improving generalization in RL. While the results are strong relative to Rainbow, no other baselines are included. I suggest adding comparisons to other methods which have recently shown good results on Procgen such as PPO (used as a baseline in the paper that introduced Procgen from Cobbe et al. 2020), DrAC (Raileanu et al. 2020), ITER (Igl et al. 2020), and DRIML (Mazoure et al 2020).  \n\nIn addition, various choices made by the authors make it difficult to compare with prior art.  For the hard mode, you only train the agents for 30m steps while the original paper trains them for 200m steps in order to achieve decent performance. You also only show results on 12 or 8 of the games instead of all 16. Following the same training practices and evaluation metrics as the ones proposed in Cobbe et al. 2020 would make comparisons with previous and future work easier and more transparent. \n\nYou mention using a 1-dimensional feature vector for the state representation. That seems very low and I don\u2019t understand how it could capture all the relevant details in an observation. Does the method work with higher dimensional representations? Additional experiments and discussion to motivate this choice would be useful. \n\nAs I understand, the embeddings are constrained using the CSSC at the same time as the policy is being learned. But at the beginning of training, the actions are random so constraining representations based on the actions taken doesn\u2019t seem ideal. Wouldn\u2019t this slow down training because the CSSC loss forces the \u201cwrong constraint\u201d at the beginning and thus lead to poor representations which would then make it harder to learn a good policy? Can you include some experiments and discussion about how the performance varies with the coefficient for the CSSC loss. \n\nHave you tried using trigrams? It seems like using bigrams is better than unigrams so it would be useful to see whether adding more actions continues to improve performance or not. \n\nWhile I liked the visualization of the learned embeddings, I think it would be more insightful to compare the embeddings of observations from train and test (colored by their actions) in order to understand how well the structure in the embedding space generalizes to unseen observations. Do you see similar structure in the embeddings of test observations as in the train ones?\n\nI found the related work section to be rather disconnected. The authors mention relevant works but do not discuss them in relation to the proposed approach. I suggest the authors discuss in more detail the limitations of current methods and explain why (and when) the proposed approach might be preferable. In addition, the section is missing a number of closely related papers that address representation learning for improving generalization in RL such as Farebrother et al. 2018, Igl et al. 2019 and 2020, Lee et al. 2020, Srinivas et al. 2020, Laskin et al. 2020, Roy et al. 2020, Mazoure et al. 2020, Zhang et al. 2020, Raileanu et al. 2020.\n\nI think the clarity of the paper can be significantly improved. For example, at the end of the intro you mention that there are significant improvements for most Procgen games, but it would be better to be more precise and mention exactly on how many of them it is better and even by how much (i.e. outperforms on X out of Y games and achieves z% better test performance on the entire benchmark). The following sentence can also be more specific: \u201c Inspired by the pair-wise structure used in BPR-opt(Rendle et al., 2012), we design the self-constraint based on our hypothesis and utilize implicit feedback between positive and negative state pairs in the replay buffer\u201c by replacing the word \u201chypothesis\u201d with something more descriptive. I would also more gently introduce the relation to BPR-opt for readers who don\u2019t know what that is -- this is the first mention of BPR and has no explanation of what it is, including what the acronym stands for. There are lots of other places in the paper where clarity needs to be improved. \n\n\nMinor Points\n\nSome of the formatting seems off e.g. there is no space before starting a parenthesis.\n\nSometimes you use \u201crepresentation feature space\u201d which seems redundant. Using \u201crepresentation space\u201d or \u201cfeature space\u201d would be more concise.\n\nThe use of \u201cvisualized input\u201d instead of \u201cvisual input\u201d sounds strange to me and it\u2019s not a common phrasing in this field as far as I know.\n\nTypos:\nIn equation 3, I believe it should be x_r instead of x_j\n\u201cHas conceived\u201d instead of \u201chas conceive\u201d in the intro\n\u201cNovel constraint that performs\u201d instead of \u201c...that perform\u201d in the intro\n\u201cRational agent behaves\u201d instead of \u201c...behave\u201d in intro\nSome letters are capitalized after a comma. \n\u201cThe most effective\u201d instead of \u201c...effect\u201d in related work\n\u201cDemonstrates\u201d instead of \u201cdemonstrates\u201d in 3.1\nMany others\u2026\n\n\nRecommendation\n\nWhile the proposed method is simple, sensible, and appears effective, the paper needs significant improvements as I explained above.

It was valuable to hear your insights about the CSSC coefficient and the use of trigrams. I also appreciated the additional experiments with PPO and on Atari. \n\nIt seems like the gains of CSSC over PPO are rather marginal. Do you have an intuition of why there is such a big difference between the boost in performance you get using CSSC with Rainbow v. PPO?\n\nGiven these additional experiments and clarifications, I will increase my score to 5. \n\nI also suggest reporting results over at least 5 seeds given the well known variance of RL algorithms. \n\nHowever, I believe the main limitation of this paper is the lack of comparisons with additional baselines (e.g., DrAC, DRIML, ITER etc.). As other reviewers have mentioned, CSSC seems orthogonal to other types of regularization so it would be useful to see how it compares with them as well as whether it can provide further benefits on top of other methods for generalization in RL. For these reasons, I cannot whole-heartedly recommend the paper for acceptance in its current form, but I encourage the authors to use this feedback to strengthen the paper.

The paper presents \"cross-state self-constraint(CSSC)\", a technique for regularizing the representation feature space by favoring representation similarity (scalar product between representations) between representations when the agent behaves similarly. The approach is tested with deep RL on the OpenAI ProcGen benchmark.\n\nThe method developped in this paper seems to provide interesting empirical results. The motivation of bringing in all cases the representation closer when the agent takes the same actions is not necessarily obvious because very different reasons might lead to the same sequence of actions, but this empirical study seems to shows the interest of this idea. \n\nMy main concern is related to the following remarks/questions that I believe require some clarifications:\n\n- In equation 3, what does j stands for? \n- Can $\\hat x_{pqr}$ be negative? In that case, what happens with the loss? \n- n sometimes correspond to \"a set of action series of length $n$\" and sometimes to the batch size. Usually a batch of tuples is selected randomly in the replay memory (without notion of sequence). What does n corresponds to in practice in the experiments?\n- In table 1 and 2: How many seeds are used? Why is the standard deviation not given?\n- No information on the neural network architecture seems to be given.

We deeply appreciate the insight and suggestions mentioned in the review. We\u2019ve added some modifications in the paper related to issues mentioned above: \n\n(1)\tThe lack of comparisons with previously proposed methods: We\u2019ve added the variance for experiments on Rainbow and PPO. Please refer to Table 6 and 7 in the Appendix A.3 for more details. We would also study other methods like DrAC, ITER and DRIML and try to add comparisons with them in the next few weeks.\n\n(2)\tVarious choices made by the authors make it difficult to compare with prior art: The Rainbow model we used in this work is trained in single-agent environment, which needs substantial wall-clock time to finish just one training process (about 5 days for 50 M steps). In the original ProcGen paper the authors mentioned about using 4 rainbow agents to speed up the training process but they did not reveal the corresponding code. We would try to build distributed training framework like that to speed up the training process in the following weeks.\n\n(3)\tUsing a 1-dimensional feature vector for the state representation: Sorry for using the ambiguous word. Here we actually mean 1-D \u201carray\u201d feature vectors having the shape like [ element 0, element 1, \u2026, element n]. In the case of Rainbow with IMPALA CNN network this 1-D array feature vectors have 2048 elements. In the case of PPO we follow the IMPALA CNN network structure mentioned in the original Procgen Paper and extract 1-D array feature vector of 256 elements for every input frame.\n\n(4)\t\u201cwrong constraint\u201d at the beginning: We do have considered using a variational CSSC coefficient by changing the coefficient during the training process (like that of epsilon-greedy exploration). To our surprise, the constant coefficient version of CSSC does provides measurable improvement across various games without too much fine-tuning. We would also study the effectiveness of CSSC using the variational coefficient in the future.\n\n(5)\tHave you tried using trigrams? : We have tested trigram CSSC on some ProcGen games but it does not outperform unigram or bigram in most cases. The valid number of positive pair in trigram is low because very few states would share identical action sequence of length 3 and thus having minimal effect on the learning process.\n\n(6)\tDo you see similar structure in the embeddings of test observations as in the train ones? : Great suggestion! We would conduct similar analysis on testing levels in the next few days if time permits.\n\nWe would further polish up the paper and add more analysis about the proposed method in the next few weeks. Please let us know if you have any other question about the revised paper and thanks again for your informative feedback. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper521/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper521/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Cross-State Self-Constraint for Feature Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning", "authorids": ["~Guan_Ting_Liu1", "~Pu-Jen_Cheng1", "r09944017@csie.ntu.edu.tw"], "authors": ["Guan Ting Liu", "Pu-Jen Cheng", "GuanYu Lin"], "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "generalization", "regularization"], "abstract": "Representation learning on visualized input is an important yet challenging task for deep reinforcement learning (RL).

In particular, it encourages latent representations of states to be more similar when those states lead the current agent to take the same sequence of future actions. \n\nPositive:\n(+)  Clear idea & description\n(+) Simple, but novel idea\n(+) Positive experimental results\n\nWeaknesses:\n(-) Insufficient comparison to baselines\n(-) Only one set of benchmark environments\n\nRecommendation: 5\nI'm currently recommending (weak) rejection but would change my score based on additional experimental results.\nIn particular: As noted by the authors, prior work has shown that \"standard\" regularization techniques like L2 (weight decay), Batchnorm or Dropout can improve performance on both training and testing. As the authors introduce a novel type of regularization technique, I believe it is important to not only compare against a \"vanilla\" (i.e. unregularized) agent, but agents utilizing various simpler regularization techniques. \nTheir technique would not even need to outperform agents which are, for example, regularized by weight decay, but I'd find it sufficient to show that CSSC can further improve the performance of such already regularized agents. \n\nMinor point: \nA second set of other procedurally generated environments, other than ProcGen, would help show that the method is not overfit to ProcGen. \n\nOther remarks (no need to answer, didn't have impact on evaluation):\n- I found section 4.2 hard to understand, maybe it could be reformulated?\n- Page 5, first line: I can't believe that e_\\theta maps to a 1d feature vector (i.e. a scalar)?\n- Equation (3): x_j should probably be x_r", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper521/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper521/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Cross-State Self-Constraint for Feature Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning", "authorids": ["~Guan_Ting_Liu1", "~Pu-Jen_Cheng1", "r09944017@csie.ntu.edu.tw"], "authors": ["Guan Ting Liu", "Pu-Jen Cheng", "GuanYu Lin"], "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "generalization", "regularization"], "abstract": "Representation learning on visualized input is an important yet challenging task for deep reinforcement learning (RL).

The notion of similarity is called in the paper \"cross-state self-constraint\" - CSSC. The CSSC loss looks very simple and can be applied with other RL algorithms. The loss is defined in terms of an embedding e of the visual input into a 1-dim space. Given three states x_p, x_q, and x_r, their similarity is defined as the scalar product of e(x_p) and e(x_q) minus the scalar product of e(x_q) and e(x_r). It would be useful if the authors include pseudocode how the loss is exactly computed for a given batch of samples. My understanding of the description is that for a given batch the authors generate triples with the same action set and then take as an auxiliary loss the weighted sum of the logarithms of sigmoids of similarities of these triples.\n\nThe results on the ProcGen suite of environments are reported in Tables 1 and 2 and they look promising. Unfortunately, the results are reported without information about the variance. Also, for some environments, e.g. for Chaser, the final numbers are weak compared to the ProcGen paper.  The inclusion of a more systematic comparison with PPO (using numbers from the ProcGen paper) would be helpful. \n\nThe visualizations look interesting, though I am not sure how the authors back their claim that  \"in figure 5 we can see that states of the same action are more clustered in bigram-CSSC\". Can you include some numerical information about clustering and/or add some extra annotations to figure 5?\n\nMy understanding of the paper is that the standard IMPALA architecture was equipped with an additional \"embedding head\" (I am inferring it from Figure 1). Though I cannot find a precise description of this architecture change, in particular how large are the embedding vectors. \n\nThe method looks simple and interesting, though the paper in my opinion needs a substantial re-write before publication at ICLR.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper521/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper521/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Cross-State Self-Constraint for Feature Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning", "authorids": ["~Guan_Ting_Liu1", "~Pu-Jen_Cheng1", "r09944017@csie.ntu.edu.tw"], "authors": ["Guan Ting Liu", "Pu-Jen Cheng", "GuanYu Lin"], "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "generalization", "regularization"], "abstract": "Representation learning on visualized input is an important yet challenging task for deep reinforcement learning (RL). The feature space learned from visualized input not only dominates the agent's generalization ability in new environments but also affect the data efficiency during training. To help the RL agent learn general and discriminative representation among various states, we present cross-state self-constraint(CSSC), a novel constraint that regularizes the representation feature space by comparing similarity of different pairs of representations. Based on the representation-behavior connection derived from the agent's experience, this constraint helps reinforce the general feature recognition during the learning process and thus enhance the generalization to unseen environment. We test our proposed method on the OpenAI ProcGen benchmark and see significant improvement on generalization performance across most of ProcGen games.", "one-sentence_summary": "A novel constraint that regularizes the representation feature space by comparing similarity of different pairs of representations.
