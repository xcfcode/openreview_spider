Their weakly supervised approach involves using a small set of seed words which describe these aspects. Their approach involves first showing that current weakly supervised approaches with neural networks are not suitable for learning the task under the setting used in the paper. To help with this issue, they turn to a variant of the paradigm of knowledge distillation, with the difference that they use a 'teacher' based on a bag-of-words classifier with seed words, and a student which is an embedding-based neural network.\n\nIn terms of the methodology used, the motivation for the simplicity of the student is somewhat lacking. While it is, of course, legitimate to leave more complicated formulations to future work, I am not certain of what exactly the authors mean when they find that that representations from the unweighted average of word embeddings is effective. Is the idea here simply that they tried a simple approach, and found the results to be sufficiently good to verify their approach?\nIt would have been interesting to see some more approaches here, in order to see whether improving the representations could yield better results, or whether perhaps the representations of the student do not matter so much. A relatively fast and simple thing to do, would be to embed the segments using a pre-trained BERT model.\n\nNonetheless, the results seem convincing, as their relatively simple distillation approach yields results which seem substantially above previous work.\n\n\nMinor comments:\n* The footnotes at ends of sentences should be written after punctuation\n", "rating": "4: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper16/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper16/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Training Neural Networks for Aspect Extraction Using Descriptive Keywords Only", "authors": ["Giannis Karamanolakis", "Daniel Hsu", "Luis Gravano"], "authorids": ["gkaraman@cs.columbia.edu", "djhsu@cs.columbia.edu", "gravano@cs.columbia.edu"], "keywords": ["aspect extraction", "distillation", "weakly supervised learning"], "TL;DR": "We effectively leverage a few keywords as weak supervision for training neural networks for aspect extraction.", "abstract": "Aspect extraction in online product reviews is a key task in sentiment analysis and opinion mining.

My assumption is that it could simply be that the model associates aspects with another set of seed words (seed words which are not among the 30 seed words per aspect and domain from MATE, but which occur regularly, along side the UNK token).\n\n* Few comments about the paper *\n- The paper is easy to read;\n- EMB and CLF abbreviations, although simple, are referred before being defined;\n- the multi-task learning training objective of the MATE-* models is not introduced (nor why did they authors not considered it);", "rating": "2: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper16/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper16/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Training Neural Networks for Aspect Extraction Using Descriptive Keywords Only", "authors": ["Giannis Karamanolakis", "Daniel Hsu", "Luis Gravano"], "authorids": ["gkaraman@cs.columbia.edu", "djhsu@cs.columbia.edu", "gravano@cs.columbia.edu"], "keywords": ["aspect extraction", "distillation", "weakly supervised learning"], "TL;DR": "We effectively leverage a few keywords as weak supervision for training neural networks for aspect extraction.", "abstract": "Aspect extraction in online product reviews is a key task in sentiment analysis and opinion mining.
