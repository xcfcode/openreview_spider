In particular, the feature representations of the patches from the same image are encouraged to be closer than the those from different images. The distance ratios of positive training pairs are optimized. The proposed method are empirically shown to be effective as an initialization method for supervised training. \n\nStrengths:\n\n- The training objective is reasonable. In particular, high-level features show translation invariance. \n\n- The proposed methods are effective for initializing neural networks for supervised training on several datasets. \n\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n- The methods are technically similar to the \u201cexemplar network\u201d (Dosovitskiy 2015). Cropping patches from a single image can be taken as a type of data augmentation, which is comparable to the data augmentation of positive sample (the exemplar) in (Dosovitskiy 2015). \n\n- The paper is experimentally misleading.\nThe results reported in this paper are based on fine-tuning the whole network with supervision. However, in Table 2, the results of exemplar convnets (Dosovitskiy 2015) is from unsupervised feature learning (the network is not finetuned with labeled samples, and only a classifier is trained upon the features). Therefore, the comparison is not fair. I suspect that exemplar convnets (Dosovitskiy 2015) would achieve similar improvements from fine-tuning; so, without such comparisons (head-to-head comparison with and without fine-tuning based on the same architecture except for the loss), the experimental results are not fully convincing. \n\nRegarding the comparison to \u201cWhat-where\u201d autoencoder (Zhao et al, 2015), it will be interesting to compare against it in large-scale settings, as shown by Zhang et al, ICML 2016 (Augmenting Supervised Neural Networks with Unsupervised Objectives for Large-Scale Image Classification). Training an AlexNet is not very time-consuming with latest (e.g., TITAN-X level) GPUs. \n\nThe proposed method seems useful only for natural images where different patches from the same image can be similar to each other. \n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Deep unsupervised learning through spatial contrasting", "abstract": "Convolutional networks have marked their place over the last few years as the\nbest performing model for various visual tasks.

The method is that of \u2018spatial constrasting\u2019, i.e. of building triplets from patches of input images and learning a presentation that assigns a high score for patches coming from the same image and a low score for patches from diferent images. The method is simple enough that I am surprised that no-one has tried this before (at least according to the previous work in the submission). Here are some comments:\n\n\nThe usage of P(f_i^1 | f_i^2) in Section 4.1 is a bit odd. May be worth defining mathematically what kind of probability the authors are talking about, or just taking that part out (\u201cprobability\u201d can be replaced with another word).\n\nI would like to know more about how the method is using the \u201cbatch statistics\u201d (end of Section 4.2) by sampling from it, unless the authors simply mean that the just sample from all the possible triples in their batch.\n\nShouldn\u2019t the number of patches sampled in Algorithm 1 be a hyper-parameter rather than just be 1? Have the authors tried any other value?\n\nI think there are some missing details in the paper, like the patch size or whether the authors have played with it at all (I think this is an important hyper-parameter).\n\nThe STL results are quite impressive, but CIFAR-10 maybe not so much. For CIFAR I\u2019d expect that one can try to pre-train on, say, Imagenet + CIFAR to build a better representation. Have the authors considered this?\n\n\nAll in all, this is an interesting piece of work with some obvious applications, and it seems relatively straightforward to implemenent and try. I think I would\u2019ve liked more understanding of what the spatial contrasting actually learns, more empirical studies on the effects of various parameter choices (e.g., patch size) and more attempts at beating the state of the art (e.g. CIFAR).\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Deep unsupervised learning through spatial contrasting", "abstract": "Convolutional networks have marked their place over the last few years as the\nbest performing model for various visual tasks.
