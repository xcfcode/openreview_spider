I appreciate the efforts to extend VFD to a larger function class.\n\nHowever, I am confused about the similarity to QPLEX [https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01062v1 ], which was published several months ago. One of the main contributions of the paper is the value function factorization stated in Theorem 2. However, it is identical to QPLEX, including notations. Specifically, Eq. 7 and 13 of FSV are the same as Eq. 8, 10, and 12 in QPLEX, including notations.\n\nMoreover, some statements in the paper and details of the figures are very similar to those in the QPLEX paper.  Eq. 33 of FSV is the same as Eq. 50 of QPLEX. These equations describe an implementation detail where QPLEX and FSV stop gradients at the same variables. Stopping gradients is reasonable in the context of QPLEX, and the reason for using this trick is well-motivated there. By contrast, why this trick is necessary for FSV remains largely unclear. I encourage the authors to explain why they stop gradients here in the context of soft reinforcement learning.\n\nIn summary, the similarity including theorems, equations, and notations (and even figures). Despite these similarities, the authors did not cite QPLEX, which has been online for several months before FSV is published.\n\nAdditionally, about the integration of QPLEX and soft Q-learning, I also have some concerns. The definition of soft value functions depends on the specific selection of the temperature parameter. In this paper, the temperature parameters are end-to-end learned by minimizing the temporal-difference error of Q-learning. Could the authors explain why this makes sense in the framework of soft Q-learning? The counterpart in QPLEX ($\\lambda$ in Eq. 10) is end-to-end learned to ensure the rich expressivity of QPLEX so that it can represent the complete IGM function class. This design is well-motivated in the original QPLEX paper.\n\n\n** Minor points\nSome of the claims in the paper need refinements. For example, in Para. 2 of the introduction, \"Centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) (Oliehoek et al. (2011)) is a common paradigm to address the partial observability\". This claim is not solid. Partial observability can still induce miscoordination in decentralized execution [Wang et al. ICLR 2020, https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJx-3grYDB]. That is to say, the framework of CTDE itself cannot solve the problem of partial observability. It is better to say something like \"CTDE with communication.\" I also find the claim \"Value function factorization methods have been an increasingly popular paradigm for solving the scalability in CTDE\" not convincing. In fact, QMIX, which is a VFD method, generally can not work very well in tasks with more than 20 agents.\n\nTypos: Last paragraph in the introduction: \"it significantly outperforms other baselines, SMAC (Samvelyan et al. (2019)).\" SMAC is not an algorithm.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3791/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3791/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "FSV: Learning to Factorize Soft Value Function for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", "authorids": ["liyueheng@pku.edu.cn", "~Tianhao_Zhang5", "~Chen_Wang11", "~Jinan_Sun1", "~Shikun_Zhang2", "~Guangming_Xie1"], "authors": ["Yueheng Li", "Tianhao Zhang", "Chen Wang", "Jinan Sun", "Shikun Zhang", "Guangming Xie"], "keywords": ["cooperative MARL", "value function factorization", "stochastic policy", "continuous tasks"], "abstract": "We explore energy-based solutions for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) using the idea of function factorization in centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE).

Thus, we compare the factored methods in SCII.\nIn the Max of Two Quadratics game, MASQL[3] which also utilized soft policy can only converge the global optima for 72$\\%$ of the time while MADDPG never converged to it. \nThe factored methods which are admitted new such as WQMIX[4] MAVEN[5] and QPLEX[6] can\u2019t be applied in continuous action space. [1] and [7] (of which we follow the implementation in our experiments) extended QMIX and VDN to continuous action space, however, they also inherit their shortcomings as shown in Max of Two Quadratics game.\n\nThe relative overgeneralization problem represents a phenomenon that a sub-optimal joint action is preferred than the global optimum. This may be due to a lack of expressive ability to represent the optimum or just getting stuck in the sub-optimum. The previous work [8] have shown that giving higher weight to the larger reward helps to overcome relative overgeneralization. This idea is generally the same as MAVEN[5] which visits the global optimum more often and WQMIX[4] which gives a higher weight to the loss of larger $Q_{tot}$. Therefore, we think its beneficial to consider relative overgeneralization problem in factorize method.\n\n[1]de Witt, C. S., Peng, B., Kamienny, P. A., Torr, P., B\u00f6hmer, W., & Whiteson, S.

First, we propose the definition of decomposable tasks from the perspective of policy rather than of Q-value, called IGO, which extends greedy-policy-based (value-based) IGM to arbitrary policy.\nSecond, based on the IGO, we proposed a new factorize method with an energy-based policy. It should be mentioned that it is the first time to factorize soft policies.\nThird, FSV is not only suitable for discrete action space tasks but also for continuous action space tasks. In addition, FSV solved the relative overgeneralization problem of factorizing methods in continuous action space.\n\nIn fact, although IGO requires the consistency of policy which seems like requiring the consistency of all actions, it is not a stronger definition than IGM. The requirement comes from the task itself. That is to say, if achieving the best performance in a given task requires greedy joint action selection, IGO is equivalent to IGM. But if achieving the best performance requires a stochastic joint policy, IGO works while IGM doesn't. In other words, IGO doesn't give a stronger constraint on a given task but extends the definition of factorizability in more tasks. To realize IGO, we adopt soft policy and end-to-end learn the weight vector $\\lambda$. Considering that soft policy can collapse into greedy policy when $\\alpha=0$, we guarantee IGM constraint in this special case.\n\nThere are two reasons for the sub-optimal action selection (relative overgeneralization). First, as QTRAN pointed out, QMIX and VDN cannot represent the optimal due to its lack of expressive ability. Second, as MASQL [1] pointed out, relative overgeneralization prevents policy gradient methods from achieving better coordination. Therefore, there are two ways to solve this problem. One is to enhance the expressive ability of the function class such as QTRAN and QPLEX, which can solve this problem in discrete action space.\nAnother is adopting a more explorative approach than a simple epsilon-greedy action selection as [2] says. We have shown in the matrix game that expressive ability is the key to solve this problem in discrete action space. However, in continuous tasks, even with a fully centralized critic that has the best expressive ability like MADDPG, it will still suffer relative overgeneralization [1]. MASQL integrated MADDPG and soft policy and improves its performance, which motivates us to adopt a soft policy under IGO constrain. In conclusion, FSV with the full expressive ability and more explorative soft policy is reasonable to have a better performance.\n\nThe multi-head attention structure is inspired by Qatten.\n\n[1] Wei, E., Wicke, D., Freelan, D., & Luke, S.

QPLEX followed the IGM principle and proposed a duplex dueling network to achieve a complete IGM function class. However, IGM cannot be applied to continuous action space since its argmax operator requires the discreteness of Q-values. \nThus, QPLEX is not suitable for continuous works.\nTo address the continuous tasks, we rethink factorizability in a policy-based manner.\nIn addition, considering that [1] claimed that overcoming relative overgeneralization required a more explorative approach than simple epsilon-greedy action selection, we introduced a novel factorization algorithm based on the soft policy, called FSV.\nIn summary, QPLEX considers the Q value decomposition under the IGM architecture. Its policy is epsilon-greedy, which is suitable for discrete tasks. Our proposed FSV considers the soft policy factorization under the IGO architecture which is not only suitable for discrete but also for continuous tasks.\nTherefore, our work and QPLEX has different motivation and contribution.\n\nAlthough some details of our work look similar to QPLEX, they are actually different. \nEquation 7 in FSV (FSV:equ7) seems similar to equation 10 in QPLEX (QPLEX:equ10). However, the meanings of Q and V are different in the two papers. The Q in FSV represents the expected return with entropy term, and the V in FSV is the log partition function of Boltzmann distribution, while the Q and V in QPLEX come from the dueling Q structure. In addition, FSV deduced FSV:equ7 directly from the integration of IGO and soft policy, while QPLEX devised QPLEX:equ10 to enforce IGM consistency.\nBoth our work and QPLEX utilized an end-to-end learning architecture to approximate weight vectors, the weight vectors represent different meanings in the two papers. \nIn QPLEX, the weight vector motivation may origin from Qatten [2]. In our work, the weight vector reveals the connection between credit assignment and exploration. \nSpecifically, the larger $\\lambda_i$ (which means its $\\alpha_i$ is smaller and its policy has less randomness) the more important this agent contributes to the team, thus its policy should be more greedy to keep the team return. Agents with smaller $\\lambda_i$(which means its $\\alpha_i$ is larger and its policy has more randomness) can explore more arbitrarily because their performance doesn\u2019t matter much. \nIn fact, such an end-to-end architecture has been widely used in previous works, such as QMIX and Qatten.\n\nTheorem 2 was regarded as one of the main contributions because the counterpart in QPLEX is its main contribution by the reviewer. However, theorem 2 in FSV is a simple corollary of the integration of IGO and soft policy, since soft policy degenerate to the greedy policy when $\\alpha=0$ and IGO degenerate to IGM when the policy is greedy. Therefore, it is clear that FSV can achieve IGM in such a special case.\n\nWe stop the gradient there because we found such a trick helps when we duplicated Qatten. This trick will not change the gradient of the weight vector, and it only removes the coefficient $\\lambda_i$ of $Q_i's$ gradient of backpropagation which helps to reduce variance especially when $\\lambda_i$ is not normalized.\n\n[1] Wei E, Luke S.

Considering that IGM in general corresponds to greedy action selection, whose form of argmax can\u2019t be applied with continuous Q-value, we redefine IGO for continuous space from the perspective of arbitrary policy. This means IGO\u2019s optimal policy can be chosen as not only greedy policy (at which we prove IGO collapse into IGM) but also soft policy if we need. \n\nQ2:How does the local soft policy iteration guarantee joint policy improvement? \n\nConsidering that $\\pi_{tot}=\\prod_{i=1}^N\\pi_i$ and IGO gives that $\\pi_{tot}^*=\\prod_{i=1}^N\\pi_i^*$, we have \n\n\\begin{equation}\\nonumber\n    D_{KL}(\\pi_{tot}(u|\\tau)||\\pi_{tot}^*(u|\\tau)) =\\int\\pi_{tot}(u|\\tau) log\\frac{\\pi_{tot}(u|\\tau)}{\\pi_{tot}^*(u|\\tau)}du = \\int\\prod_{i=1}^N\\pi_i(u_i|\\tau_i)\\sum_{i=1}^Nlog\\frac{\\pi_i(u_i|\\tau_i)}{\\pi_i^*(u_i|\\tau_i)}du =\\sum_{i=1}^N\\int\\pi_i(u_i|\\tau_i)\\pi_{-i}(u_{-i}|\\tau_{-i})log\\frac{\\pi_i(u_i|\\tau_i)}{\\pi_i^*(u_i|\\tau_i)}du_idu_{-i} =\\sum_{i=1}^N\\int\\pi_i(u_i|\\tau_i)log\\frac{\\pi_i(u_i|\\tau_i)}{\\pi_i^*(u_i|\\tau_i)}du_i =\\sum_{i=1}^ND_{KL}(\\pi_{i}(u_i|\\tau_i)||\\pi_{i}^*(u_i|\\tau_i))\n\\end{equation}\nwhere we rewrite $\\pi_{tot}=\\pi_i\\pi_{-i}$ and $du=du_idu_{-i}$. The integral of -i equals 1 due to the probability normalization. Thus, minimizing the KL of individual policies through soft policy iteration will minimize the KL of joint policy. The following proof is the same as in SAC's paper.\n\nQ3:What is the meaning of * in sec 3.2? What does eq12 imply?\n\nThe $\\pi$ with * represents the optimal policy. The $\\pi$ without * represents the actual policy during training. The Q with * represents the ideal Q value. The Q without * represents the actual Q value during training. \nEq12 represents the soft policy improvement of each agent, where $\\Pi$ is some set of policies such as a parameterized family of Gaussian distributions.\n \nQ4:How did eq 18 come about?\n\nJust like Eq12 in SAC, Eq18 is the way we realize soft policy improvement, where we minimize the KL of the current individual policy and optimal individual policy. \n\nQ7.Proof of theorem2.\n\n$\\epsilon-greedy$ indeed cannot be matched by a soft policy in general. But it can be matched when $\\epsilon=\\alpha=0$, which is all the proof need. In fact, eq7 can hold without IGM if $\\lambda$ is well constructed by a neural network.

Q-functions are formulated as soft value functions with the energy parameters, and this adoption renders the function factorization more flexible compared to existing ones. The proposed solution applies to continuous-action tasks, a feat left unconquered by some of the existing methods. Authors exhibit that FSV outperforms others in various environments characterized by local optima.\n\nStrengths:\n\n+ The formulation of Q-functions as soft functions, despite appearing simple, shows some effectiveness in a number of MARL tasks.\n\n+ The network architecture is intuitive.\n\n\nMajor Concerns:\n\n- Neither energy-based policies nor soft value functions is an original contribution of this work. True, the authors do not claim so. But the reviewer is left unsure as to what then the primary contribution of the paper would be.\n\n- The method generalizes IGM to IGO but in doing so, foregoes the simplicity of the IGM condition. The reviewer would then expect to be met with a somewhat strong guarantee, but is instead presented with approximations on \\lambda_i. It is not clear from the paper how much insightful value the method has, when its criticism of a previous work (QTRAN) was based on intractability but the FSV method itself still relies on approximations. It would seem as though QTRAN and FSV each chose different paths to approximate different components of an MARL training scheme - the former takes may stronger assumption on the value functions while the latter takes assumptions on the nature of value functions being parametrized by approximated weights.\n\n- The effectiveness of the proposed method is not yet well-accounted for. Issues are raised, but little explanation (or any attempt thereof) is provided. For example, the reviewer would have very much liked to gain an understanding of the relevance between IGO and its ability to alleviate relative overgeneralization. How does taking on greedy policies (which makes IGO collapse into IGM) make MARL agents more prone to overgeneralize with respect to each other? What kinds of findings would the authors present? What evidence could support those findings? The evaluation, while illustrating great performance gaps, needs a careful redesign so as to construct solid grounds for the soft value function factorization under IGO to be \"explainably\" better than existing works.\n\n- The paper could be better positioned. The Related Works section could be put to better use to clearly distinguish two very different lines of research: value function factorizing MARL works and maximum entropy principle.\n\n- There needs to be some justification about multi-head attention being used to \"enable efficient learning\" in Section 3.3. The reviewer is left hanging as to why and how such a choice was made.\n\n\nMinor Concerns:\n\n* A few parts of the paper were difficult to follow. For example, there is an unfinished sentence in Related Works. In Section 2.1, there is an incomplete clause beginning with \"the reward function [...] shared by all agents\".

The approach uses energy-based policies to generate this factorization. The method is presented and experiments are given for smaller domains as well as starcraft. \n\nThe idea of learning factored value functions is promising for learning separate value functions for each agent that allow them to learn in a centralized manner and execute in a decentralized manner (centralized training and decentralized execution). Several methods have been proposed along these lines, but as the paper points out, they have limitations that makes them perform poorly in some problems. \n\nThe proposed approach in this paper has some promising experimental results, but there are questions about the novelty and significance of the method. Furthermore, evaluating these contributions is difficult due to the lack of clear details in the paper. \n\nIn particular, the details of the approach itself in 3 are not clear. Starting with Definition 1, it seems like IGO is using an optimal *centralized* policy. Is this what is meant? If so, why is this needed (as opposed to an optimal decentralized policy). It will typically be impossible to achieve a centralized policy with decentralized information. Furthermore, the energy-based policies are defined in 3.2, but 'key' ideas such as approximating the weight vector aren't fully explained making the exact approach hard to determine. Also, it is beneficial that the current theorems and proofs are included, but the lack of sufficient detail makes it hard to parse and evaluate them. \n\nThere are also similar max entropy approaches, such as the paper below. \n\nIqbal, S. & Sha, F.. (2019). Actor-Attention-Critic for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Machine Learning, in PMLR 97:2961-2970\n\nAs well as other factorized methods, such as the papers below (which are admittedly new). \n\nWeighted QMIX: Expanding Monotonic Value Function Factorisation for Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.

In terms of comparisons, the paper should also need to compare with non-factored state-of-the-art methods. It is, of course, natural to compare with other factored methods, but what matters is general state-of-the-art performance of the domains. \n\nAs noted, the clarity and writing of the paper should be improved. Beyond the examples above, some other instances are below. \n\n- If the reader doesn't already understand the relative overgeneralization problem, Section 2.3 probably isn't sufficient. Figure 1 is helpful, but it should be described in the text to make the issue clear. \n\n- The connection between the overgeneralization problem and factored representations isn't completely clear. Factored representations have problems because they typically cannot represent the optimal value function (or policy). That is a separate issue than getting stuck in a local optimum (which can happen with any type of method).", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3791/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3791/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "FSV: Learning to Factorize Soft Value Function for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", "authorids": ["liyueheng@pku.edu.cn", "~Tianhao_Zhang5", "~Chen_Wang11", "~Jinan_Sun1", "~Shikun_Zhang2", "~Guangming_Xie1"], "authors": ["Yueheng Li", "Tianhao Zhang", "Chen Wang", "Jinan Sun", "Shikun Zhang", "Guangming Xie"], "keywords": ["cooperative MARL", "value function factorization", "stochastic policy", "continuous tasks"], "abstract": "We explore energy-based solutions for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) using the idea of function factorization in centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). Existing CTDE based factorization methods are susceptible to the relative overgeneralization, where finding a suboptimal Nash Equilibrium, which is a well-known game-theoretic pathology. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel factorization method for cooperative MARL, named FSV, which learns to factorize the joint soft value function into individual ones for decentralized execution. Theoretical analysis shows that FSV solves a rich class of factorization tasks. Our experiment for the well-known task of the Max of Two Quadratics game shows that FSV fully converges to global optima in the joint action space in the continuous tasks by local searching in the joint action space. We evaluate FSV on a challenging set of StarCraft II micromanagement tasks, and show that FSV significantly outperforms existing factorization multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "li|fsv_learning_to_factorize_soft_value_function_for_cooperative_multiagent_reinforcement_learning", "one-sentence_summary": "We propose a novel stochastic-based policy solution in CTDE for cooperative MARL by factorizing the soft value function, which significantly outperforms existing factorization MARL methods in discrete and continuous tasks.", "pdf": "/pdf/f76b637100bfb948967e8cb4058225f58825f2db.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=Hx5ET-W05", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nli2021fsv,\ntitle={{\\{}FSV{\\}}: Learning to Factorize Soft Value Function for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning},\nauthor={Yueheng Li and Tianhao Zhang and Chen Wang and Jinan Sun and Shikun Zhang and Guangming Xie},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ijVgDcvLmZ}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
