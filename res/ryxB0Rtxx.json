There is a typo in the equation 3.4 (and at several related places). There shouldn\u2019t be q_j in Eqn 3.4. In other words, the last layer doesn\u2019t use identity parameterization because we need to change the dimension to match the number of labels. We will update the paper very soon to correct these typos. \n\n2. As far as we know, the proof for finite sample expressivity for feedforward nets requires the network to have a very large width (the width needs to be larger than the number of examples). The benefit of ResNets is that it allows such construction to use a network with a small width. We think this is a more natural construction, which is also both more similar to the nets used in practice, and exemplifies the appealing properties of ResNets.\n\n3. Indeed, finite sample expressivity result does show that representational power of the net is great, though it doesn\u2019t imply overfitting. (As a matter of fact, such nets don\u2019t overfit). Moreover, as argued before, such expressivity result is not easily obtained for other architecture like feed-forward neural nets or linear model (specifically, with a linear model, one can use effectively at most d (=dimension) parameters, and we mainly consider the case when n is much larger than d). \n\n4. Our construction suggests that if we want the width of the net to be smaller, it would be better to use deeper nets.  \n\n5. We don\u2019t expect our construction to be used as an initialization of the training. Moreover, we don\u2019t expect this construction is be close to what is found by the SGD. It serves mainly as theoretical evidence that the network is powerful in its residual parameterization.\n\nRegarding experiment: yes, the linear layer before softmax is not trained \u2014 this is motivated by our construction where the last layer is independent of the data, and it helps improves the result by roughly 1%. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Identity Matters in Deep Learning", "abstract": "An emerging design principle in deep learning is that each layer of a deep\nartificial neural network should be able to easily express the identity\ntransformation.

However, we show that the norm of the weights for the linear network can be very small if the number of layers is deep. When the weights are small, we can hope that the non-linear case can be approximated by the linear version via Taylor expansion. However, there are technical difficulties to make this intuition precise and rigorous, and these are the major bottleneck of the theoretical understanding of deep learning. One concrete thing we can say about the benefit of re-parameterization in the non-linear case is this: With standard feed-forward networks, all zero weights form an obvious bad critical point. However, with the re-parameterization, such an obvious bad critical point no longer exists. This may be seen as mild evidence that our result may be true more generally. Adding this discussion is a good suggestion!\n\nSection 3:  As far as we know, the proof for finite sample expressivity for feedforward nets requires the network to have a very large width (the width needs to be larger than the number of examples).

What does an existence result of such a network tell us about its representation power ? \nA simple linear model under the assumption that points can not be too close can overfit the data, and get fast convergence rate (see for instance tsybakov noise condition).\n\n4- What does the construction tell us about the number of layers? \n\n5- clustering the activation independently from the label, is an old way to pretrain the network. One could use those centroids as weights for the next layer (this is also related to Nystrom approximation see for instance https://www.cse.ust.hk/~twinsen/nystrom.pdf ). Your clustering is very strongly connected to the label at each residual block.\nI don't think this is appealing or useful since no feature extraction is happening.

Can you weaken the clustering to be independent to the label at least in the early layers? then one could you use your construction as an initialization in the training. \n\n\u2014 Experiments : \n\n- last layer is not trained means the layer before the linear layer preceding the softmax?\n\nMinor comments:\n\nAbstract:  how  the identity mapping motivated batch normalization?\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Identity Matters in Deep Learning", "abstract": "An emerging design principle in deep learning is that each layer of a deep\nartificial neural network should be able to easily express the identity\ntransformation.

This has been shown to perform well in practice (eg. ResNet). The discussions and experiments in the paper are interesting. Here's a few comments on the paper:\n\n-Section 2: Studying the linear networks is interesting by itself. However, it is not clear that how this could translate to any insight about non-linear networks. For example, you have proved that every critical point is global minimum. I think it is helpful to add some discussion about the relationship between linear and non-linear networks.\n\n-Section 3: The construction is interesting but the expressive power of residual network is within a constant factor of general feedforward networks and I don't see why we need a different proof given all the results on finite sample expressivity of feedforward networks. I appreciate if you clarify this.\n\n-Section 4: I like the experiments. The choice of random projection on the top layer is brilliant. However, since you have combined this choice with all-convolutional residual networks, it is hard for the reader to separate the affect of each of them. Therefore, I suggest reporting the numbers for all-convolutional residual networks with learned top layer and also ResNet with random projection on the top layer.\n\nMinor comments:\n\n1- I don't agree that Batch Normalization can be reduced to identity transformation and I don't know if bringing that in the abstract without proper discussion is a good idea.\n\n2- Page 5 above assumption 3.1 : x^(i)=1 ==> ||x^(i)||_2=1\n\n ", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Identity Matters in Deep Learning", "abstract": "An emerging design principle in deep learning is that each layer of a deep\nartificial neural network should be able to easily express the identity\ntransformation.

We can choose the last layer weight matrix (with dimension k\\times d) so that it contains arbitrary orthogonal vectors as rows. We fix the last layer throughout the training. The rest of layers consist of weight matrices with dimension d by d. We can show that i) for any choice of the last layer with orthogonal rows, there exist weight matrices for the rest of layers with small norms that achieve the global minimum error (the minimum possible error achievable by any choices of all of the weight matrices) ; ii) when the last layer is fixed, all the critical points with small norm weights are global minima. \n\nQuestion 2: Our construction is fairly robust to the perturbation in the input. Concretely, when the weighted are constructed in Thm. 3.2, we can perturb any training data point x with Euclidean norm \\delta < (1-\\rho)/4, so that the output on the perturbed data point is still approximately the correct label.
