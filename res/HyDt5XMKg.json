Within the first part of the paper, we built up several insights towards understanding the mechanism of learning by provided key notes on the structure and dynamics of the nervous system during the learning process. \n\n-\tWe have constructed a detailed mathematical simulation platform for our analyses and tried to draw a general overview on the principles we found by using our simulator, in such a compact report. However, as the reviewer is fully aware, explaining the details of a neuronal model and synaptic connectivity models is extremely difficult in such a compact version. We therefore, structured our work to be understandable for a larger audience who are not much familiar with the field. We also planned to include the details of the equations and analyses, within the poster-session at the ICLR workshop in order to establish a clear picture on our novel work, interactively. \n\n-\tThe first Key finding states the novel fact that an additional layer of input neurons can be placed in a network and their properties and state can depend on the structure of the input features and data. The second key finding states that synapses can have states and that can significantly changes the behavior of the entire network. We have precisely followed the effects of the gene modifications on the global behavior of the worm in several biological experiments and correspondingly added suitable dynamics variables in the model (which were noted within the text). Figures illustrates a small example of such experiments and comparison. \n\n-\tWithin the paper, we stated that our findings may lead to new learning algorithms. This is explained in the text within the concepts introduced in the first part of the paper as well as the key findings. The reader can potentially get inspired to include our findings in the existing learning algorithms and correspondingly improve the quality of the learning. This is of course on the priority-list of our future works.\n\n-\tThe workshop track of ICLR this year \u201cwill focus and favor\u00a0late-breaking developments and very novel ideas.\u201d I believe that designing a simulation platform with which one can easily turn attractive behavioural features such as learning various representations, to mathematical equations and useful conclusions, can be extremely interesting for the well-regarded ICLR Audience.\n\nFurthermore, our extended abstract tries to introduce a novel principle on modelling the sources of learning in the brain of C. elegans considerably compact. The topic can easily get sophisticated to comprehend for the majority of the ICLR audience without providing proper background information.  We therefore attempted to provide a high-level background description on the topic, while including novel findings even within the introductory part. examples include:\n\n \"Sensory (input) neurons within the network are subjected to a mediation during the non- associative training process (repeated tap stimulation) (Kindt et al., 2007). \" \nThis indicates that one can set a layer of input-neurons which their threshold of activation is tunable depending on the type of the input features to be learned. \n\n\u201cWithin a neural circuit, only some of the interneurons are proposed to be the substrate of memory (Sugi et al., 2014).\u201d\nThis implies that only some neurons within the nervous system can have states and some of them are stateless. That makes the process of learning faster and more efficient. Like other biological sources of optimal networks such as beta cell hubs in islet functional architecture [1], C. elegans\u2019 brain network consists of hubs (neurons with states) which are actively involved in learning.\n\n\nI would like to sincerely ask the reviewer to reevaluate our short paper, given our recent comments. \n\nThank you very much for your consideration. \n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Johnston, Natalie R., et al. \"Beta cell hubs dictate pancreatic islet responses to glucose.\"\u00a0Cell Metabolism\u00a024.3 (2016): 389-401.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Non-Associative Learning Representation in the Nervous System of the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans", "abstract": "Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) illustrated remarkable behavioral plasticities including complex non-associative and associative learning representations.

Authors attempted to provide a compact clear picture over the idea of sources of biological learning and simultaneously pointed out several notes and findings which can build up well-founded understanding for readers with any areas of expertise. \n\n-\tAuthors intentionally structured the paper to make it possible for the ICLR readers which are mostly computer scientists, get connected to the overall picture of the non-associative learning mechanism in C. elegans, within the extended abstract, and provide the details of the equations in the poster and discuss it interactively during the workshop.\n\n-\tWe believe that the reviewer is totally right about including the equations. Accordingly, I mention some of them here and would demand the reviewer\u2019s opinion about how to integrate them inside the text with their proper explanation? \n\nWe have mentioned within the text of the abstract where we can modify in the neuron model in order to create the effect of gene modifications in a sensory neuron habituation. examples include:\n\n1)\tConductance of K-Channel decreases over time, due to the gene functions described in [1]. We then proposed to have the following expression for the maximum conductance of the potassium channel, G_K:\n\nG_K, is set to a dynamic variable expressed as follows:\nG_K = 10 exp(-0.02*t) +3, \nwhere parameters are determined empirically.\n\nWe also hypothesised that the calcium pump plays a key-role in the suppression of the calcium level in the sensory neuron. For the Calcium pump, its maximum conductance has been set to a dynamic variable in a sigmoid-like function: \nG_pump = 10 / (exp(-0.01(t+200)) + 1)\n\nFurthermore, We hypothesised that an inactivation-calcium gate should play a role in the learning mechanism. \nTherefore, we design an inactivation gate, h, as follows: \n\ndh/dt = (h_inf \u2013 h) / tau_h,\nwhere h_inf = 1 / 1 + H * exp((v-v_half)/k_h),\nwhere the h_inf is the steady state value of the inactivation gate, with gate rate parameters H, v_half and k_h. \nv_half = -45 mV, H = 1/, tau_h = 2 s, k_h =1  1/mV.\nFigure 1C in the paper is generated by including all the three dynamics described above, within the model of the neuron.\n\n2)\tWe have also mentioned that considering S(t) and G_max of a synapse and their modifications, result in similar habituation and dishabituation behavior on a postsynaptic cell observed in the experimental results:\nThe overall synaptic current: I_syn = G_max G(V_pre) S(t) (E_Syn \u2013 V_Post)\nWhere G(V_pre) = m(t) \nAnd dm/dt = (m_inf \u2013 m) / tau_m\nAnd m_inf = 1/(exp((V_shift \u2013 V_pre)/V_range) +1)\nAnd S(t) = n(t). s(t)\nAnd dn/dt = (n_inf \u2013 n). k_n \u2013 n.k_r \u2013 n. m(t)\n\nn(t) describes the amount of available neurotransmitter vesicles. With each firing of the neuron, n \u00b7 m vesicles are removed. Vesicles are refilled from a reserve pool with a rate k_n and move to the reserve-pool with a rate k_r. This type of model is described in [2]. With the right choice of parameters (Below), this leads to a decrease in the postsynaptic signal after a series of pulses. Without stimulation, the signal strength recovers over time.\ns(t) is modelled in the following and provides the probability of the neurotransmitters arriving at the postsynaptic receptors [3]:\nds/dt = -s/tau_F + h\ndh/dt = -h/tau_R \u2013 h0 . delta(t-t0)\nwhere t0 is the time of the beginning of neurotransmitter release. \n\u2022\tParameters of m(t): tau_m = 5 ms, V_range = 4 mV, V_shift = -30 mV.\n\u2022\tParameters of S(t): n_inf = 10000, k_r = 0.01 1/ms and k_n = 0.08 1/ms, tau_R = 2.5 ms, tau_F = 5ms, h0 = 10, t0 = recorded at V_pre > 59mV, \n\nThis is part of the analyses we have conducted fully quantitative. We kept the paper in a high-level description for the readability.

Understanding the principles of such mechanisms presumably leads to constructive inspirations for the design of efficient learning algorithms. In the present study, we postulate a novel approach on modeling single neurons and synapses to study the mechanisms underlying learning in the C. elegans nervous system. In this regard, we construct a precise mathematical model of sensory neurons where we include multi-scale details from genes, ion channels and ion pumps, together with a dynamic model of synapses comprised of neurotransmitters and receptors kinetics. We recapitulate mechanosensory habituation mechanism, a non-associative learning process, in which elements of the neural network tune their parameters as a result of repeated input stimuli. Accordingly, we quantitatively demonstrate the roots of such plasticity in the neuronal and synaptic-level representations.
