Why is it enough to be uniformly random on $\\{ 0,1 \\}^D$?\n\nI am not sure if I understood this question correctly, but note that we have fixed a bijection between $\\{ 0, 1 \\}^D$ and the packing set $S$, so the distribution $\\zeta$ can be thought of being the uniform distribution on $S$. For the proof to go through, we need $\\zeta$ to be a hard distribution for the MEAN problem, and $\\mu$ to be a product of independent $\\zeta$ distributions.\n\n> Page 11, last line of Lemma 8 proof: Should $\\zeta$ be $\\zeta_{1/2}$?\n\n$\\zeta$ as is defined to be $\\zeta_{1/2}$ at the start of the proof; we will clarify this (see line 4 of the proof).\n\n\n> Page 13, definition of $f_b(x)$: I had a bit of difficulty understanding the definition of $f_b(x)$ as it is. Maybe define a mapping function $g$ from $S$ to $[|S|]$, then use $g(s)$ when indexing the bit-string $\\{ 0,1 \\}^{|S|}$?\n\nWe will try to make the definition a bit clearer.\n\n> Page 15, line 2 to 3 in proof of Q1: It seems that the proof from lines 2 to 3 assumes that $x^{(t+1)}=x^{(t)}\u2212\\gamma \\nabla F(x^{(t)})$. While this is true for performing gradient descent directly, why is it still true after the quantization stuff?\n\nThere is yet another typo ($x^{(t+1)}$ -> $x^{(t)}$) on line 3. That is, the inequality applied to the second term is $|| x^{(t)}\u2212\\gamma \\nabla F(x^{(t)}) - x^* ||_2 \\le \\sigma || x^{(t)} - x^* ||_2$, i.e. the standard gradient descent convergence bound. Note that this term is what an exact gradient descent would obtain without the quantisation error, and the quantisation error is isolated to the first term in the inequality; intuitively, the second term is distance bound for the exact step the algorithm tries to take, and the first term is the loss of convergence caused by the quantisation. The value $x^{(t)}\u2212\\gamma \\nabla F(x^{(t)})$ is not actually computed by the algorithm.\n\n> Page 15 (last text line) and Page 16 (4th text line): There are references to \"definition of $q^{(t+1)}$ and Lemma 10\". There is no Lemma 10 but only Corollary 10, which refers to the prior quantization result from Alistarh et al. What is this definition referring to and why does it suffice to only show what is shown in the proofs?\n\nLemma 10 should refer to Corollary 10. In the Local quantisation (Q2) step of the proof, we want to show that\n\n$|| \\nabla f_i(x^{(t+1)}) - q^{(t+1)}_i ||_2 \\le \\delta R^{(t+1)}/(2N)$.\n\nAs defined on page 15, $q^{t+1}_i$ is defined as\n\n$q^{(t+1)}_i = Q(\\nabla f_i(x^{(t+1)}), q^{(t)}_i, R^{(t+1)}/N, \\delta R^{(t+1)}/(2N))$,\n\ni.e it is $\\nabla f_i(x^{(t+1)})$ quantised wrt. $q^{(t)}_i$. By the accuracy property of the quantisation scheme (Corollary 10(2)), $|| \\nabla f_i(x^{(t+1)}) - q^{(t+1)}_i ||_2 \\le \\delta R^{(t+1)}/(2N)$ holds when $\\nabla f_i(x^{(t+1)})$ and $q^{(t)}_i$ are sufficiently close to each other, i.e. $||\\nabla f_i(x^{(t+1)}) - q^{(t)}_i||_2 \\le R^{(t+1)}/N$ holds.\n\n\n> Page 16, first 2 lines in the first chunk of equations: should $f_i(x^{(t+1)})$ have $\\nabla$'s in front of them?\n\nYes.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2018/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2018/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improved Communication Lower Bounds for Distributed Optimisation", "authorids": ["~Janne_H._Korhonen2", "~Dan_Alistarh7"], "authors": ["Janne H.

Thus, it is relevant to large-scale solvers for regression or generalized linear models, as well as distributed neural network training, though we note that the practical applications often further complications that are may  captured by the abstract model. We note that, in both these settings, the dimension $d$ is usually larger than the number of nodes N. \n\nMore concretely, in the regression setting the dimension $d$ can vary in order of magnitude between 10 and 1000 (see e.g. [Stich 2018; arxiv 1805.09767] for an example), whereas neural networks regularly have millions of parameters.

Why not from the beginning say that it uses the \"coordinator model\"?\n\nWhile for total communication cost, the models are equivalent, these are generally speaking two different models; typically, \"message-passing\" allows direct point-to-point messages between any pair of nodes, while the coordinator model allows only communication with the coordinator. If one considers complexity measures such as round complexity under limited bandwidth $B$, the models are not always equivalent.\n\nWhile this distinction does not matter for our work, we felt it was important to distinguish between the models.

We are revising the discussion of this paper in the revision.\n\nTo give further context for our comparison, we wrote the comparison from a machine learning perspective, where the input functions are allowed to be essentially arbitrary real-valued functions, which do not necessarily have natural encodings. (More precisely, certain kids of circuits  could be used to represent restricted function classes, but we would still want to allow constant real terms in the circuit representation). In particular, the upper bound holds for arbitrary real functions as long as the model conforms to the setting described in Section 2. However, it is a fair point that the lower bounds are ultimately based on a discrete instance, though it uses a rather unnatural encoding of the input/output point sets. \n\nWe also note that the additive approximation is necessary in the real-valued setting, as we cannot send arbitrary real numbers exactly over a binary channel. One can, roughly speaking, view the approximation factor $\\varepsilon$ as a precision parameter of the output. We would also mention that additive approximation constraints appear to be more common in machine learning applications. \n\nResponses to minor comments:\n\n> \\sigma used as a standard deviation in the introduction, and something confusing in technical sections\n\nCorrect, we will revise.\n\n> Proof of Theorem 3: how do you get the factor of N in log|S|?\n\nThis is an editing error, there should be no N in the expression. Will fix.\n \n> Proof of Theorem 3: \u201cSince communication is only used for the simulation of \u03a0\u201d Your reduction also needs communication to decide whether F(y)=0 or not.\n\nThis is an excellent point; we are implicitly making a (standard) assumption that the algorithms also output the (approximate) value of the target function $F(x)$. That is, upon the completion of the algorithm, the coordinator should output a point $z$ satisfying $\\sum_{i = 1}^N f_i(z) \\le \\inf_{x \\in [0,1]^d} \\sum_{i = 1}^N f_i(x) + \\varepsilon$, as well as an value $r$ satisfying \n$\\sum_{i = 1}^N f_i(z) \\le r \\le \\sum_{i = 1}^N f_i(z) + \\varepsilon$. \nIn practice, this means that the coordinator returns the \"trained\" machine learning model, and the corresponding value of the loss function, which is what one would expect. \n\nWe apologise for not making this clear, and will make this explicit in the revision.\n\n> ED not formally defined\n\nED is the expected distributional expected communication complexity, defined in Section 2 (page 5, line 3.)

However, as we discuss in the related work, there was no non-trivial lower bound for the N-machine setting, and existing proof techniques do not generalize, leaving this basic question open for some decades. \n\nBased on prior state of the art, one might conjecture for instance that the amount of information which needs to be sent by an individual machine could go down when the number of machines increases, as each local input function has less of an impact on the result; however, our results show that this is not the case. Indeed, one way to interpret the lower bounds is that the current quantised gradient descent methods are in fact the correct way to approach the problem. In general, this is what complexity lower bounds contribute to algorithm design: understanding the fundamental limits, allowing to distinguish between a case where we are facing hard limits of what is possible from the case where our algorithm development is stuck in a \"local optimum.\" \n\nWith the above discussion in mind, we view the main contributions of this paper to be (a) defining a rigorous model for studying the communication complexity of continuous optimisation, (b) the formal proofs of the lower bounds, and (c) connecting the machine learning setting to communication complexity; the technical details are a necessary secondary contribution. The current state of the art in communication complexity seems mostly sufficient to provide the technical tools we need for our results. However, as evidenced by the fact that these fundamental questions were not answered before, we argue that our conceptual contributions were exactly what was missing.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2018/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2018/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improved Communication Lower Bounds for Distributed Optimisation", "authorids": ["~Janne_H._Korhonen2", "~Dan_Alistarh7"], "authors": ["Janne H.

It provides deterministic and randomized lower-bounds on the communication bit complexity and a quantized-based algorithm with asymptotic matching upper-bounds (for constant $\\beta/\\alpha$).\n\nOn the positive side, the paper contributes to a line of work which has significant practical relevance -- performing optimization over a set of functions distributed across many independent computing devices. It studies a specific task in this context from the point of minimizing the communication cost.\n\n\nRegarding the model: I don't understand why the paper makes a setup about \"message-passing model\" just to say that their setup is equivalent to \"coordinator model\". Why not from the beginning say that it uses the \"coordinator model\"?\n\nTheorem 4 seems to assume a (rather strict) regime where $d > O(N)$. That is, for $d \\beta / (N^2 \\varepsilon)$ to be a constant, and where $\\beta = \\beta_0 N$, we have $d > O(N \\varepsilon / \\beta_0)$. Is it justified to assume that the input dimension is at least as large as the number of devices? I would expect the situation to be the opposite.\n\nThis is a mainly theoretical work, but it still would be nice to motivate why the setup/task considered in this work (e.g., minimizing $\\sum_i f_i(x)$ where each machine/device holds potentially different functions) is practically relevant. If it is mainly of theoretical relevance, then it would be nice to give reasons why this optimization task is an important one. This is not necessarily a critic on the relevance of the problem, but rather a comment that having more background would enable a reader to put the results into a broader perspective.\n\nRegarding related work, what are other optimization tasks on a set of functions that would \"make sense\" to consider next?

The motivation for this is large optimization tasks that have to be solved often in machine-learning problems: the hope is to learn the limits to which the number of bits communicated in popular machine learning tasks can be optimized. \n\nWhile the problem studied in the rest of the paper is cast purely in theoretical terms in the classical Message-Passing setting in distributed optimization, and therefore a conference with more theoretical bent seems more appropriate, given the many prior works that have appeared in machine learning conferences I am not too worried on this count. \n\nAs the main result, the paper shows that for quadratic optimization (i.e., even if all the f_i's are guaranteed to be quadratic functions),  to obtain an additive epsilon approximation (to the minimum of \\sum_i f_i(x)) deterministically requires \\Omega(Nd*log(beta*d/epsilon)) bits and the same for randomized approximation is \\Omega(Nd*log(beta*d (N*epsilon))) bits. Here beta is the smoothness parameter of \\sum_i f_i. The closest related earlier work showed that in the 2-node setting one requires \\Omega(d*log(beta*d/epsilon)) bits. The generalization to N machines of this earlier result is a natural extension to study. \n\nA couple of concerns:\n\n1) Given the result for the two machine setting, what would one expect to be the lower bound in the N machine setting? Perhaps the proof maybe involved, but are there reasons to expect the lower bound to take any other form? If there are, they don't seem to be present in the paper. \n\n2) Even if the result is not unexpected, proving it could well be complicated. So if there are clear technical innovations compared to prior work that would be a good plus. However the degree of technical advance is not quite clear to me --- I have not worked in this area to say for sure. The authors point out that the innovation is here is the connection built to communication complexity in the context of real-valued optimization-tasks, but I am not so sure if there is enough to clear the ICLR bar.\n\nOverall this is a problem whose answer is good to know. The paper is written quite well, and is situated well in the landscape of related work. I am not sure if it clears the ICLR bar, perhaps accept if room.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2018/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2018/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improved Communication Lower Bounds for Distributed Optimisation", "authorids": ["~Janne_H._Korhonen2", "~Dan_Alistarh7"], "authors": ["Janne H.

Such tasks arise naturally in  large-scale optimisation, where a standard solution is to apply variants of  (stochastic) gradient descent.  As our main result, we show that $\\Omega( Nd \\log d / \\varepsilon)$ bits in total need to be communicated between the machines to find an additive $\\epsilon$-approximation to the minimum of $\\sum_{i = 1}^N f_i (x)$. The results holds for deterministic algorithms, and randomised algorithms under some restrictions on the parameter values. Importantly, our lower bounds require no assumptions on the structure of the algorithm, and are matched within constant factors for strongly convex objectives by a new variant of quantised gradient descent. The lower bounds are obtained by bringing over tools from communication complexity to distributed optimisation, an approach we hope will find further use in future.\n", "one-sentence_summary": "We give the first tight bounds for the communication complexity of optimizing a sum of quadratic functions in a distributed setting; the result has non-trivial extensions and implications for the fundamental limits of distributed optimization.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "korhonen|improved_communication_lower_bounds_for_distributed_optimisation", "pdf": "/pdf/9e95755f92176d8519fd749f94488cf5454a7507.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=aBavn671PV", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkorhonen2021improved,\ntitle={Improved Communication Lower Bounds for Distributed Optimisation},\nauthor={Janne H.
