We reply to the reviewer\u2019s comments.\n\n\n(1) Trade-off between the number of distribution parameters and performance\nIn general, we need a large number of iterations when we optimize a large number of distribution parameters. The previous study (Shirakawa et al. 2018) shows that the method could solve the problem of 3,000 bits in 1M iterations. We note that the number of bits corresponds to the total dimension of the one-hot vectors in our categorical distribution case. Considering the modern deep learning setting, the number of iterations for network training is up to about 1M. In summary, we can propose the guideline that PDAS should be applied to the problem with up to 3,000 dimensions.\n\n\n(2) Comparison with E-CAE in inpainting task\nAs the reviewer pointed out, the performance of E-CAE is superior to our method, while the running time (GPU time) of E-CAE is about 14 times slower than PDAS. We note that PDAS can be parallelized for the sample size and mini-batch size. It means that PDAS users can try another setting and tune several hyper-parameters by using this spare time. One of the important points for the final performance is the search space design, e.g., the design of modules and the encoding scheme of the architecture. Since we propose the architecture search method in this paper, we applied the proposed method to the same search space used in the previous studies. However, practical users can spend the spare time to try other search spaces.\n\nWe have added the explanation about this point to Section 4.\n\n\n(3) Sample size\nWe used just two samples to estimate the gradients. From the viewpoint of stochastic approximation theory, the small learning rate has a similar effect of the large sample size\u3000(Nishida et al. 2018). Therefore, even if the sample size equals two, we can optimize the distribution parameters properly with the appropriate small learning rate. In fact, we have observed that the learning rate decreases by the learning rate adaptation mechanism. In the CIFAR-10 case, the learning rate starts from 0.0845 and decreases to about 0.003. In the work of Nishida et al. (2018), the sample size adaptation mechanism for a fixed learning rate is also introduced. One possible future direction is to investigate the effect of the sample size adaptation instead of the learning rate adaptation.\n\nWe have added the explanation about this point to Section 2."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1130/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1130/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1130/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Probabilistic Model-Based Dynamic Architecture Search", "abstract": "The architecture search methods for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising results.

We reply to the reviewer\u2019s comments.\n\nFirst of all, we believe that it is worthwhile that the simple proposed method can achieve competitive performance with complicated architecture search methods. This implies that the previous methods are overcomplicated and simple probabilistic modeling is sufficient for architecture search. This aspect helps us to reduce the effort in tuning the hyper-parameters of the architecture search method itself. Also, the proposed method is the fastest among the existing architecture methods.\n\n\n(1) Novelty and contribution\nAs the reviewer pointed out, this paper is an extension of Shirakawa et al. (2018). The previous work only derived the algorithm for Bernoulli distribution and only applied it to simple tasks, e.g., layer selection and connection pruning. The contribution of this paper is as follows:\n\n(i) We derived the algorithm for categorical distribution and made it possible to apply the framework to architecture search spaces represented by categorical variables. To the best of our knowledge, the natural gradient of categorical distribution has not been introduced in the context of stochastic natural gradient methods.\n\n(ii) We showed PDAS, which has fewer hyper-parameters than ENAS, is fast and can reach state-of-the-art performance. The intrinsic hyper-parameters of PDAS are the sample size and the learning rate, but the learning rate can be adaptive.\n\nWe have added the explanation about the novelty and contribution to Section 1.\n\n\n(2) Theoretical justifications\nWe split the dataset into two datasets with the same number of items for updating the weight and distribution parameters. As each dataset is sampled from the original one, the losses of mini-batch samples from both datasets approximate the original loss of all of the data if the dataset size is sufficiently large. Therefore, even if we use split datasets, we can view that the losses in the equations of (2) and (3) approximate the original loss. Of course, we can formulate the update rules with different datasets by starting from different original objectives for the weight and distribution parameters as done in ENAS. We have added the sentence about this point to Section 2.\n\n\n(3) Relation to ENAS\nAs the reviewer pointed out, the main difference between PDAS and ENAS is the probabilistic model of architectures, i.e., PDAS uses the categorical distribution, and ENAS uses the LSTM network. We make this point clear by adding the sentence to Section 3.\n\nAs the search space of CIFAR-10 is the same in ENAS and PDAS, we assume that both methods can find quasi-optimum architectures. We would like to emphasize that PDAS can provide competitive performance with lower computational cost compared to ENAS though it is simple. The simple modeling of architecture makes it possible to derive the natural gradient in PDAS. As ENAS uses the LSTM network as the controller, it cannot derive the analytical natural gradient. The natural gradient method can update the model parameters to the steepest direction with respect to KL-divergence and has a big advantage in the optimization of a probabilistic model.\n\nThe intrinsic hyper-parameters of PDAS are the sample size and the learning rate. In addition, the learning rate can be adaptive by the method in Nishida et al. (2018). Meanwhile, ENAS has more hyper-parameters, e.g., the sample size, the learning rate, the regularization coefficient, the number of units in LSTM, and the architecture design of the controller. Moreover, ENAS tuned such hyper-parameters depending on the tasks, e.g., they used the regularization coefficients of 0.0001 for PTB and 0.1 for CIFAR-10. However, our method did not change the hyper-parameters for the image classification and inpainting tasks. Our method has such attractive properties because it is designed based on the stochastic natural gradient method, which is theoretically well studied, for example, in Akimoto and Ollivier (2013). We would like to emphasize that our method is handier than ENAS in practice because PDAS showed the decent performance without problem-specific hyper-parameter tuning as ENAS does.\n\nY. Akimoto and Y. Ollivier, \u201cObjective Improvement in Information-Geometric Optimization,\u201d Foundations of Genetic Algorithms XII (FOGA XII) (2013).\n\nWe have added the sentence about this point to Section 3.\n\n\n(4) Minor issues\nAs the reviewer pointed out, it is meaningless to report the \"best\" test error. We have removed it from Table 1.\n\nAlso, the proposed method is not really \u201cparameterless.\u201d Specifically, our method is parameter-adaptive or pseudo parameterless. We would like to say that our method can achieve decent performance with low computational cost without special hyper-parameter tuning. We have modified the explanation about this point in Section 1 and Section 5."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1130/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1130/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1130/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Probabilistic Model-Based Dynamic Architecture Search", "abstract": "The architecture search methods for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising results.

The approach is a straightforward extension of Shirakawa et al. 2018. The main algorithm is essentially the same except minor differences in gradient derivations.\n- Lack of theoretical justifications. It seems all the derivations at the beginning of Section 2 assume the architecture is optimized wrt the training set. However, the authors ended up splitting the dataset into two parts in the experiments and optimize the architecture wrt a separate validation set instead. This would invalidate all the previous derivations.\n- The method is a degenerated version of ENAS. A closer look at eq (2) and (3) suggests the resulting iterative algorithm is almost the same as that in ENAS, where the weights are optimized using GD wrt the training set and the architecture is optimized using the log-derivative trick wrt the validation set. The only distinction are (i) using a degenerated controller/policy formulated as categorical distributions (ii) using the validation loss instead of the validation accuracy as the reward (according to eq. (3)). This is also empirically reflected in Table 1, which shows the proposed PDAS is similar to ENAS both in terms of efficiency and performance. The mathematical resemblance with ENAS is not necessarily bad, but the authors need to make it more explicit in the paper. \n\nMinor issues:\n* I'm not sure whether it's a good practice to report the \"best\" test error among multiple runs in Table 1.\n* The method is not really \"parameterless\" as claimed in the introduction.

These methods require significant computational resources, as they repeat the neural network training many times to evaluate and search the architectures. Developing the computationally efficient architecture search method is an important research topic. In this paper, we assume that the structure parameters of CNNs are categorical variables, such as types and connectivities of layers, and they are regarded as the learnable parameters. Introducing the multivariate categorical distribution as the underlying distribution for the structure parameters, we formulate a differentiable loss for the training task, where the training of the weights and the optimization of the parameters of the distribution for the structure parameters are coupled. They are trained using the stochastic gradient descent, leading to the optimization of the structure parameters within a single training. We apply the proposed method to search the architecture for two computer vision tasks: image classification and inpainting. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture search method is fast and can achieve comparable performance to the existing methods.", "keywords": ["architecture search", "stochastic natural gradient", "convolutional neural networks"], "authorids": ["yoshinari-nozomu-ry@ynu.jp", "uchida-kento-nc@ynu.jp", "saito-shota-bt@ynu.jp", "shirakawa-shinichi-bg@ynu.ac.jp", "akimoto@cs.tsukuba.ac.jp"], "authors": ["Nozomu Yoshinari", "Kento Uchida", "Shota Saito", "Shinichi Shirakawa", "Youhei Akimoto"], "TL;DR": "We present an efficient neural network architecture search method based on stochastic natural gradient method via probabilistic modeling.", "pdf": "/pdf/377b10ff3fc872fc033381c01348d8b259e7f666.pdf", "paperhash": "yoshinari|probabilistic_modelbased_dynamic_architecture_search", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nyoshinari2019probabilistic,\ntitle={Probabilistic Model-Based Dynamic Architecture Search},\nauthor={Nozomu Yoshinari and Kento Uchida and Shota Saito and Shinichi Shirakawa and Youhei Akimoto},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Ske1-209Y7},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1130/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234299256, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "Ske1-209Y7", "replyto": "Ske1-209Y7", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1130/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335879386, "tmdate": 1552335879386, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1130/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 9}
