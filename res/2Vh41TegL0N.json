While for two layer ReLU networks with random Gaussian weights it can be shown theoretically\nthat  local metric properties are approximately preserved, we experimentally study the discrimination capability in this Hamming space for deeper ReLU networks and look also at the non-local behavior.\nIt turns out that the discrimination capability is approximately preserved as expected, but showing small saturation effects that differ from standard metrics based on full activation information.\nThese effects are explained based on the fact that the binarized activation states induce a tessellation of polyhedral cells in the input space.", "pdf": "/pdf/45181e56c58753da49f77779264770b5a7d9e2aa.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|on_the_discriminability_of_samples_in_the_hamming_space_of_binarized_relu_activations", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021on,\ntitle={On the discriminability of samples in the Hamming space of  binarized Re{\\{}LU{\\}} activations},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to ICLR 2021 Workshop on Geometrical and Topological Representation Learning},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=2Vh41TegL0N},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615225929161, "tmdate": 1615967298665, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
