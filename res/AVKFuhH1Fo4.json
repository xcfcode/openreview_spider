We are glad that we were able to resolve some of the confusion regarding emphasis on the Transformer query/key embedding and attention/importance weights, vs. the Transformer value embedding's set kernel-like operation.\n\nWe agree that there is more room to perform more Banach space-rooted analysis on Transformer-type calculations than what we were able to cover in this paper. The extension from shallow kernel learners like SVMs, which have been well characterized over the years, to deep kernel-like operations like our characterization of Transformers, leads to much of the associated theory needing extension as well. For example, as the reviewer notes in their response and as we discuss in detail in Appendix A, a Transformer-type attention calculation is not yet easily characterizable as a regularized risk minimization problem, since, e.g., the explicit characterization of regularization methods commonly used in deep networks (e.g., dropout) in terms of norm penalties on activations or weights is context-dependent and not fully understood (as we note in our references, authors have been working to characterize dropout in the context of a deep network as a norm penalty for some time).

The part about regularized risk minimization problem in RKBS and Transformers is not directly connected. For example, the considered risk minimization problem is not taken into account when optimizing Transformers. Another weakness in the argument is the fact that the kernel changes with every step of stochastic gradient descent. Namely, the parameters W^Q and W^K are updated and that changes the kernel function. As a result, training of Transformers does not operate in a single RKBS. \n\nThe claimed contribution boils down to the fact that final (trained) Transformer model will have importance weights that can be associated with some RKBS.

The sketch the reviewer presents, that the output of the Transformer value embedding is a weighted sum of instance embeddings of the source elements, seems to parallel an embedding of a bag in the set kernel terminology.\n\nOur paper focuses on a kernel interpretation of the query and key components of the Transformer, rather than the value embedding component (the value embedding being that which, the reviewer notes, parallels a set kernel). In our view, this query and key pair that produces the attention weights (i.e., the importance weights for the value embedding weighting over the source elements) is the key part of the Transformer. The attention/importance weights are exactly how an attention model can take the target context into account and fixate on the relevant source elements for each of the target elements. The original Vaswani paper was surprising in how these attention weights seemed to, e.g., resolve the noun to which a pronoun was referring.\n\nOur motivation in this paper was to give a mathematical explanation for why the attention weights seemed so powerful. The genesis of this inquiry was the question of why \"Luong-style\" attention of the query-key dot-product type used in Transformers seemed to perform on par with the \"Bahdanau-style\" attention that computes attention scores via an MLP: shouldn't the MLP perform better than a linear method? The RKBS story in this paper is the answer at which we arrived.\n\nThe representer theorem is presented to make firm the connection between the \"Luong-style\" attention and kernel methods, as well as to establish the existence and uniqueness of an optimal solution to the Transformer attention calculation, which we feel is not obvious. As we note in the paper, it would not be feasible to use a representer-theorem-based attention weight formula in practice since Transformers tend to deal with much larger datasets than a representer-theorem-based kernel method. Theorem 2 also establishes that this is unnecessary, since the Transformer can approximate this optimal solution arbitrarily well.\n\nThe reviewer's note on studying the asymmetry in RKBS learning touches on some of our other interest. In the context of Transformers and attention models, to the best of our knowledge there has not been a rigorous study of the asymmetry between the query and the key embedding routes. Whether, e.g., knowledge of how a query relates to a key could be shared if the direction were to be swapped is an important question in generalization.\n\nWe hope we were able to communicate how the RKBS analysis in our paper is motivated by understanding Transformers.

These results and updated analysis have been added to the new version of the PDF in Section 6. The results on this dataset seem in agreement with the ones on IWSLT14 English-German, with the \"infinite-dimensional\" kernels performing the best, and the lower-dimensional ones degrading in performance in the same order.\nWe are working on adding some experiments on text classification datasets.\n\nAs the reviewer notes, our proof of our representer theorem does draw on earlier works in the RKBS literature. The preliminaries on Banach spaces draw from earlier works and the outline of the proof can be traced back to at least the original RKHS representer theorem proof by Scholkopf et al. However, our problem and theorem are new in the binarization of the kernel learning problem, similar to how the works we mention in our Remark immediately after Definition 3 considered a similar extension to multiple RKHS's. However, as we note in our Appendix A, the weaker conditions on Banach spaces vs Hilbert spaces means we cannot reuse earlier techniques in our setting and needed to create new analysis to handle the Banach space pair.

The paper contains several contributions on top of this link : it provides a novel kernel machine that can deal with data from 2 distinct input domains and a cross domain output, it show that Transformer can learn such kernels, and it also give hints on what make Transformer efficient.\n\nThe paper manages to present different backgrounds (transformers and exotic kernels) to mix them in a quite clear manner. Notations from two worlds are respected such that, as far as I can say, people from each side can catch things quickly. \nFrom the transformer's perspective, being able to plug any well designed kernel in place of the dot-product attention can have some interesting practical application. The observation that the efficiency of transformer could be linked to the infinite feature map brought be some kernel shapes is appealing but quite weak. \nFrom the kernel machine's perspective, the proposed kernel machine in RKBS is elegant and comes with solid theoretical proofs. It might have been a paper by itself. \nThe choice of content in paper/in supplementary seems good to me.\n\nI vote for accepting the paper, as I find the idea interesting, I can see some applications and the theoretical part seems correct to me. My main concern is about section 6, which contains only one experiment. It illustrates the fact that one can change the kernel in transformers, but not much more. \nI also have difficulties to see how section 5.2 is done in practice, as I find the description of implementation details do not consider those aspects : I would be happy to have more details on the algorithms\n\n- Details :  \n* section 6 : I suggest the order of kernels be the same in table and in text, it would be easier to follow. \n* section 5.2 : I think this reference (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2017.06.003) introduces Nystrom for RKKS a couple of years earlier.

The focus of the paper is on the scaled dot-product attention, reviewed in Eq. (1). In my understanding, the whole mechanism can be seen as an instance of the set kernel. The inputs are bags of items, where an item is denoted with $s_j$. The items are embedded into some feature space via matrix multiplication $W^V s_j$. The set kernel representation of a bag is obtained by weighted averaging of item embeddings, where the item-specific weight is the output of an exponential family model. The latter model is obtained by combining embeddings of items and corresponding context vectors, denoted with $t_i$ (see Eq. 1 for more details).\n\nThe paper in itself does not explain this mechanism as a whole but focuses on the un-normalized exponential family model that provides importance weights in the set kernel embedding. In particular, the main focus of the work is to find a bilinear form and, thus, a mathematical structure that could give rise to non-symmetric similarity function defining the un-normalized importance weights in the set kernel described above. More formally, the work seeks a kernel function\n$$\nk(t,s) = \\exp(\\frac{(W^Qt)^{\\top}(W^Ks)}{\\sqrt{d}}) \\ ,\n$$\nwhere $d$ is the rank of W-matrices.\n\nThis is achieved by introducing the so called reproducing kernel Banach space (Sections 3 and 4). Following this, the paper introduces a form of regularized risk minimization problem in reproducing kernel Banach spaces. I fail to see a direct link to transformers and backpropagation used in training of such models. The conclusion is that transformers learn a kernel or similarity function that can be assigned to a reproducing kernel Banach space. I disagree with this because the whole attention mechanism is a set kernel, with the supplied bilinear form amounting to importance weights only. The section 5 concludes with a representer theorem and regularized risk minimization problem in reproducing kernel Banach spaces. Again, this is a completely disconnected part of the paper from the introduction and provided motivation.\n\n#### clarity\nI find the paper clear in most parts and have not had problems following the main arguments. Related work on learning with similarity measures, indefinite symmetric kernels, and general similarity functions seems to be well covered.\n\n#### quality\nI think this paper should really be focusing on learning in reproducing kernel Banach spaces with non-symmetric similarity measures. It is difficult to tell how much novelty it brings compared to relevant related work and how useful it would be in practice. If the authors decide to take this direction, then there should be a detailed experiments section where trade-offs between effectiveness and computational complexity are carefully studied. \n\nIt is unclear to me why this work would be associated with attention models and transformers. The story just does not hold and it does not explain the scaled dot-product attention. At the moment, it just seems as an unfinished work that is unnecessarily associated with attention and transformers.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2896/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2896/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Transformers are Deep Infinite-Dimensional Non-Mercer Binary Kernel Machines", "authorids": ["~Matthew_A_Wright1", "~Joseph_E._Gonzalez1"], "authors": ["Matthew A Wright", "Joseph E.

In this article, we present a new perspective towards understanding how Transformers work. In particular, we show that the ``\"dot-product attention\" that is the core of the Transformer's operation can be characterized as a kernel learning method on a pair of Banach spaces. In particular, the Transformer's kernel is characterized as having an infinite feature dimension. Along the way we generalize the standard kernel learning problem to what we term a \"binary\" kernel learning problem, where data come from two input domains and a response is defined for every cross-domain pair. We prove a new representer theorem for these binary kernel machines with non-Mercer (indefinite, asymmetric) kernels (implying that the functions learned are elements of reproducing kernel Banach spaces rather than Hilbert spaces), and also prove a new universal approximation theorem showing that the Transformer calculation can learn any binary non-Mercer reproducing kernel Banach space pair. We experiment with new kernels in Transformers, and obtain results that suggest the infinite dimensionality of the standard Transformer kernel is partially responsible for its performance. This paper's results provide a new theoretical understanding of a very important but poorly understood model in modern machine learning.", "one-sentence_summary": "We obtain theoretical results relating Transformer models to generalizations of kernel methods, and empirical results concerning the importance of characteristics of the standard Transformer's kernel.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "wright|transformers_are_deep_infinitedimensional_nonmercer_binary_kernel_machines", "pdf": "/pdf/f74f64a37a8da695d70254ba4711835a68801485.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=p5P5WzwoVZ", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nwright2021transformers,\ntitle={Transformers are Deep Infinite-Dimensional Non-Mercer Binary Kernel Machines},\nauthor={Matthew A Wright and Joseph E.
