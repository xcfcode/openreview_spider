The experiments, however, are not fully convincing.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "review": "SUMMARY\n\nIn this work, the \"prototype matching network\" is proposed for modeling transcription factor binding mechanisms. Since there are two dominating classes of such binding mechanisms, the model proposed uses a specific encoder (based on a CNN) for modeling \"motif-like\" features, and a certain dependency model (based on an LSTM) to describe co-binding patterns. The purpose of this dependency model is to update an embedded sequence based on matches to prototypical transcription factors. This \"combinationLSTM\" uses the cosine similarity function, \"squashed\" through the logistic function to produce a similarity score.  The final model is applied to a  large-scale prediction problem involving\n86 transcription factors.\n\nEVALUATION\nThe paper is relatively easy to read. The motivation is clear, and the proposed memory-augmented network for a multilabel classification problem is certainly interesting. Although it shares some similarities with the model in [Munkhdalai & YU, 2016], this \"combinationLSTM\" can be considered as a interesting novel contribution. My main point of criticism, however, concerns the experimental evaluation. In particular, I am not fully convinced that the results in table 1 show indeed any significant improvement of the PMN model over the CNN baseline: first, the standard errors reported are much bigger than the differences. Second, the use of one-tailed pairwise t-tests is probably not appropriate here. How can you be certain that the consequences of missing an effect in the untested opposite direction is negligible? Are there still any significant differences in a two-tailed test remaining?    \n\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Prototype Matching Networks for Large-Scale Multi-Label Classification", "abstract": "One of the fundamental tasks in understanding genomics is the problem of predicting Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs).

We use the notion of support set of prototypes and an LSTM to learn how TFs interact and bind to genomic sequences. On a TFBS dataset with 2.1 million genomic sequences, the PMN significantly outperforms baselines and validates our design choices empirically.
