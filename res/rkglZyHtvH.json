On the guarantee of improvement. Thanks for adding the formal proof, which is helpful and addresses my doubts. The discussion on the improvement over ELBO_init is still a bit hard to follow, due to the different notations involved and the order in which things are presented. I would therefore suggest to refactor this part as follows: start by stating that ELBO_aux = ELBO_init if q_phi1(w) = q_phi(w|a_1), then ELBO_aux >= ELBO_init would follow thanks to optimizing ELBO_aux over phi_1, and finally discuss the necessary conditions to initialize q_phi1(w) with q_phi(w|a_1).\n\n2. On the generality. The paper only treats the case where the conditional posterior is accessible analytically, and it would benefit from discussions/analysis of situations where q(w|a1) is implicit, i.e., we cannot evaluate its density. Ideally, experiments under the latter setting should also be included, especially since the inequality ELBO_aux >= ELBO_init may no longer hold.  Otherwise, it would be hard to convince one to consider the proposed method beyond settings where the conditional posterior is accessible. \n\n3. On missing baselines. HVM, for instance, can be reasonably considered in the experiments of sections 4.2 and 4.3. As you mentioned it has been applied to Deep Exponential Families (DEFs), which generalizes Bayesian feedforward neural nets by using stochastic layers. In other words, under comparable architectures, inference is even more challenging with DEFs than Bayesian neural nets. Moreover, I could not find empirical comparisons with HVM or Auxiliary Deep Generative models in (Louizos and Welling, \u200e2017). \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1531/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1531/AnonReviewer3", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Refining the variational posterior through iterative optimization", "authors": ["Marton Havasi", "Jasper Snoek", "Dustin Tran", "Jonathan Gordon", "Jos\u00e9 Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato"], "authorids": ["mh740@cam.ac.uk", "jsnoek@google.com", "trandustin@google.com", "jg801@cam.ac.uk", "jmh233@cam.ac.uk"], "keywords": ["uncertainty estimation", "variational inference", "auxiliary variables", "Bayesian neural networks"], "TL;DR": "The paper proposes an algorithm to increase the flexibility of the variational posterior in Bayesian neural networks through iterative optimization.", "abstract": "Variational inference (VI) is a popular approach for approximate Bayesian inference that is particularly promising for highly parameterized models such as deep neural networks.

Motivated by the limited expressivity of mean field variational inference the author suggests to iteratively refine a \u2018proposal\u2019 posterior by conditioning on a sequence of auxiliary variables with decreasing variance. The key requirement to set the variance of the auxiliary variables such that the integrating over them leaves the original model unchanged. As noted by the authors this is a variant of auxiliary variables introduced by Barber & Agakov. The motivation and theoretical sections seems sound and the experimental results are encouraging, however maybe not completely supporting the claim of new \u2018state of the art\u2019 on uncertainty prediction. \n\nOverall i find the motivation and theoretical contribution interesting. However I do not find the experimental section completely comprehensive why I currently think the paper is borderline acceptance. \n\nComments\n1) The computational demand using the method seems quite large by adding O(NumSamples * NumAuxiliary) additional computational cost on top of the standard VI. Here each factor M is quite large e.g. 200 epochs for CIFAR10 (if i understand the algorithm correctly?)\n2) For the UCI experiments the comparison is only made against DeepEnsembels or other VI methods, however to the best of my knowledge MCMC methods are superior in this setting given the small dataset size? \n3) The results on CIFAR10 do seem to demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to DeepEnsembles and standard VI in one particular setting where VI is only performed over a small subset of layers in a ResNet (why doesn\u2019t it work for when doing VI on all the parameters?). However generally looking at the best obtained results of ~86% acc this is quite far from current best probabilistic models (see e.g. Heek2019 that gets 94% acc). Some of this can probably be attributed to differences in data-augmentation and model architecture however in general it makes it very hard to compare with other methods when the baselines are not competitive. \n\nMinor Comments:\n In relation to comment 3) above I think you should reword the sentence \u201cIt sets a new state-of-the-art in uncertainty estimation at ResNet scale on CIFAR10\u201d in the conclusion.\n\n\n\u201cIn  order  to  get  independent  samples  from  the  variational  posterior,we have to repeat the iterative refinement for each ensemble member\u201d: Does this imply that if we want M samples we first have to optimize using the standard VI and then to M optimizations to get q_k(w)?\n\n\nHow sensitive is the method to sequence of variances for a?\n\n[Heek2019]: Bayesian Inference for Large Scale Image Classification\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1531/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1531/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Refining the variational posterior through iterative optimization", "authors": ["Marton Havasi", "Jasper Snoek", "Dustin Tran", "Jonathan Gordon", "Jos\u00e9 Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato"], "authorids": ["mh740@cam.ac.uk", "jsnoek@google.com", "trandustin@google.com", "jg801@cam.ac.uk", "jmh233@cam.ac.uk"], "keywords": ["uncertainty estimation", "variational inference", "auxiliary variables", "Bayesian neural networks"], "TL;DR": "The paper proposes an algorithm to increase the flexibility of the variational posterior in Bayesian neural networks through iterative optimization.", "abstract": "Variational inference (VI) is a popular approach for approximate Bayesian inference that is particularly promising for highly parameterized models such as deep neural networks.

We appreciate that you found the paper interesting. \n\n1. The refinement steps can be computationally demanding, but any amount of refinement is guaranteed to improve the approximate posterior. In our experiments, the computational cost of the refinement steps is roughly 25% of the cost of training the initial mean-field approximation, which represents a non-trivial, but feasible computational overhead. For the LeNet-5 experiments, the refinement steps amount to 50 epochs, while in the ResNet experiments, we have more relaxed computational constraints so the refinement steps add up to 200 epochs. See Section 4.5 for cost comparisons, where the SOTA in expressive posteriors (multiplicative normalizing flows) is more compute-expensive.\n\n2. MCMC methods can show strong performance on small scale regression tasks, and given enough time, they might converge to a better posterior approximation (May we ask for a citation for exact numbers on the UCI benchmarks?). Gaussian processes and deep Gaussian processes (Salimbeni and Deisenroth, 2017) are also known to be competitive on these benchmarks. In our paper, the regression experiments are meant to serve as a comparison to other variational approaches and we do not claim SOTA performance.\n\n3. We believe that the core contribution of our paper is an interesting and original approach to VI, rather than the specific SOTA results.\n\nThe baselines that we compare against at ResNet scale are Deep Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017), Variational Inference (Ovadia et al., 2019) and Variational Gauss-Newton  (Osawa et al., \u200e2019) which can be considered state-of-the art. Refined VI outperforms these on ResNet20. We agree that our wording, \u201cIt sets a new state-of-the-art in uncertainty estimation at ResNet scale on CIFAR10\u201d suggests a more general result and we are going to adjust the phrasing to reflect the model size and the setting. We are changing the phrasing of our introduction and conclusion sections to put less emphasis on the specific results and focus on the benefits of the core idea instead.\n\n(Heek and Kalchbrenner, 2019) shows very strong results, however, as the review also mentions, a direct comparison is problematic, since they use a significantly larger model (ResNet56), proposed changes to the architecture, and use significantly more compute (1000 epochs). They are also a concurrent ICLR submission. Nevertheless, we are impressed by the results and we are eager to see this paper being published soon.\n\n4. The refinement steps have to be repeated for each ensemble member meaning that with K auxiliary variables and M ensemble members, one has to refine MK times after training the initial mean-field approximation. This amounts to a ~25% computational overhead compared to standard VI.\n\n5. The method is not sensitive to the variances of a1,..,a5. We set their variances so that they form a decreasing geometric sequence with factor 0.7, but any factor between 0.3 and 0.9 performed similarly.\n\nIf this reply addressed your main comments, please consider revising your score, otherwise let us know the remaining concerns you might have.\n\n(Salimbeni and Deisenroth, 2017) Salimbeni, Hugh, and Marc Deisenroth. \"Doubly stochastic variational inference for deep Gaussian processes.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2017.\n\n(Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) Lakshminarayanan, Balaji, Alexander Pritzel, and Charles Blundell. \"Simple and scalable predictive uncertainty estimation using deep ensembles.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2017.\n\n(Ovadia et al., 2019) Ovadia, Yaniv, et al. \"Can You Trust Your Model's Uncertainty?

We appreciate that you found the paper interesting.\n\n1. The argument is that there exists a phi_1, for which ELBO_aux = ELBO_init. Therefore, by further optimizing phi_1, we can ensure that ELBO_aux >= ELBO_init. If the optimizer were to produce a phi_1 for which ELBO_aux < ELBO_init (since it is a stochastic optimizer), we can simply discard the result of the optimizer and proceed with the value of phi_1 for which ELBO_aux = ELBO_init. This guarantees that ELBO_aux >= ELBO_init.\n\nTo further clarify the claim, we are going to include a formal proof in the appendix stating that max(ELBO_aux(phi_1), ELBO_aux(optimized(phi_1))) >= ELBO_aux(phi_1) = ELBO_init.\n\nThe phi_1 where ELBO_aux = ELBO_init can be analytically computed (formula given in the Appendix) by ensuring that q_phi(w|a1)=q_{phi_1}(w). In the experiments, we use this formula to initialise phi_1 for the SGD training.\n\nRegarding Figure 2, the drops are due to optimiser artefacts. When we initialise phi_1, the momentum term of Adam is reset and it takes a few iterations to find a good local optima. If we used a smaller learning rate these drops would not occur, but convergence would be slower. \n\n2. One of the benefits of the approach is that it is very general. It can be applied to any probabilistic model with any joint distribution p(w, a1, \u2026, aK) (obeying the constraints specified in the paper), meaning that the auxiliary variables do not have to be additive or independent, they can have arbitrary distributions. We showcased the method in Bayesian neural networks, because they have a challenging posterior distribution. Application to variational autoencoders, latent variable models etc. with different variational distributions is certainly interesting and we are considering it for future work.\n\nThe existence of the analytical conditionals is only used once in the paper when we show the guarantee of improvement (ELBO_aux >= ELBO_init). In the case when the conditional posterior is not analytically computable, this guarantee does not hold, but the algorithm can still be applied and it might provide an improvement.\n\n3. [1,2] are indeed relevant and interesting papers and we discuss them in the related works section. However, an open challenge is how to apply auxiliary variables for Bayesian neural networks, which have a significantly large parameter space . (HVM is applied to Deep exponential families and Auxiliary deep generative models is used for generative models where posterior dimensions are <1000.) Multiplicative Normalizing Flows (Louizos and Welling, \u200e2017) builds on those papers for Bayesian neural networks and is a method we compare to.

We share your intuition that at the limit of infinitely many auxiliary variables, the variational posterior can be very flexible and might approximate the exact posterior exactly in some cases but we were unable to prove this. The strongest statement we can state is that each refinement step is guaranteed to make the refined posterior better. Figure 2 depicts how the ELBO improves with the introduction of each new auxiliary variable (K=1..5). \n\n2. In our experiments, we train independent Gaussians for all weights (for both the initial and refined posteriors) parameterized by their means and variances. The dimensionality of w, a1, a2, \u2026, ak is the same as the number of weights. The correlations and multi-modality are introduced through the refinement steps as demonstrated in the toy example. The method requires no full matrix inversion (only inversion of diagonal matrices).\n\n3. Thank you for bringing our attention to this related paper.

The focus is on Gaussian latent variables, and the method is applied to Bayesian neural nets to perform variational inference (VI) over the weights. Empirical results show improvements upon the performance of the mean-field approach and some other baselines, on classification and regression tasks.\n\nMain comments.\n \nOverall, this paper is well written and easy to follow. It tackles an important topic in VI and proposes an interesting idea to improve the flexibility of the approximate distribution. I have the following comments/questions.\n\n- On the guarantee of improvement. I still have some doubts regarding the inequality \u201cELBO_aux >=  ELBO_init\u201d. Can you please elaborate more on this and provide a detailed formal proof? Figure 2 shows that ELBO_aux can go below ELBO_init.\n- The focus of the paper is on Gaussian variables and a configuration where some key distributions, q(a_1) and q(w|a_1), are accessible in closed from. The generalization of the proposed method beyond these settings should be discussed and explored in experiments. \n- Important baselines are missing in the experiments. I would recommend including at least the other VI techniques relying on auxiliary variables to build flexible variational families [1,2]. This would help to better assess the impact/importance of the proposed method.\n\n[1] Ranganath, Rajesh, Dustin Tran, and David Blei. \"Hierarchical variational models.\" ICML.

The q(w) is an integral over multiple auxiliary variables. These auxiliary variables can be specified at different scales that can be refined to match different scales of details of the true posterior. They show better performance regression and classification benchmark datasets. They also show that the training time is at a reasonable scale when being parallelized.\n\nI think the idea is quite interesting. They did a good illustration of the difference between their model and related works. They also compare with the state-of-art variational approximation methods. \n\nOne concern I have is the complexity. I don't think it's just O(MK) since it has to optimize for each phi_k for each posterior sample w. This could be quite large depending on problems. \n\nAlso is the refining only run for once or run after each update of the mean field q(w)? If it's the latter, the overhead would be much larger.\n\nWhen w is very high-dimensional, the number of auxiliary variables should be exponentially larger. Is that true? Or it's actually invariant to the dimensionality of the posterior distribution?\n\nThe paper proves that the refined ELBO is larger than the auxiliary ELBO which is larger than the initial mean field. But the initial ELBO should be a tight lower bound of the true log likelihood. Would that be a problem that ELBO_ref actually spill over the true log likelihood which is a dangerous sign?\n\nOverall I think the paper is well written. The experiments are carefully designed. The idea is interesting and useful."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1531/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1531/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Refining the variational posterior through iterative optimization", "authors": ["Marton Havasi", "Jasper Snoek", "Dustin Tran", "Jonathan Gordon", "Jos\u00e9 Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato"], "authorids": ["mh740@cam.ac.uk", "jsnoek@google.com", "trandustin@google.com", "jg801@cam.ac.uk", "jmh233@cam.ac.uk"], "keywords": ["uncertainty estimation", "variational inference", "auxiliary variables", "Bayesian neural networks"], "TL;DR": "The paper proposes an algorithm to increase the flexibility of the variational posterior in Bayesian neural networks through iterative optimization.", "abstract": "Variational inference (VI) is a popular approach for approximate Bayesian inference that is particularly promising for highly parameterized models such as deep neural networks.
