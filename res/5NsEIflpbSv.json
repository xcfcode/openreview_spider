Our theoretical results motivate using more structured smoothing distributions to achieve better generalization and LORAS provides a specific recipe for achieving that.\n\n> I would suggest the authors conduct one/two more experiments on other tasks, like language modeling with large vocab.\n\nWe have now added results for Overnight which is a structured prediction task and also evaluated our approach on top of slot tagging model (which is a sequence tagging task) for ATIS and SNIPs. We believe LM might not be an appropriate task since the label space doesn't appear to have obvious structure.\n\n> In most cases, the low-rank assumption is applied when the vocab size is huge. However, the proposed method requires to have to NxN matrix - S to calculate the L. If the N is 1M, like in language modeling, will it be a bottleneck here?\n\nWe would like to clarify that we do not compute the S matrix directly but work with the L matrix which is N x r where N is the vocab size and r is the rank parameter. When using BART for ATIS, SNIPS, TOPv2, and Overnight, our vocab is the GPT2 vocab plus the ontology tokens which makes the vocab size larger than 50k. As pointed in the paper the memory requirement of our method scales linearly with the vocab. Current LMs use the same BPE vocab. However, we can imagine learning smoothing distributions for a subset of the vocab (e.g. those corresponding to ontology tokens) can also be useful since our analysis reveals that LORAS ends up learning a smoothing distribution that is close to uniform for non-ontology tokens."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2910/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2910/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Better Structured Representations Using Low-rank Adaptive Label Smoothing", "authorids": ["~Asish_Ghoshal2", "~Xilun_Chen1", "sonalgupta@fb.com", "~Luke_Zettlemoyer1", "~Yashar_Mehdad2"], "authors": ["Asish Ghoshal", "Xilun Chen", "Sonal Gupta", "Luke Zettlemoyer", "Yashar Mehdad"], "keywords": ["label smoothing", "calibration", "semantic parsing", "structured prediction"], "abstract": "Training with soft targets instead of hard targets has been shown to improve performance and calibration of deep neural networks.

The label smoothing term can also be set to 0.2 (typically 0.1 is used in the literature). The only parameter that is important is the rank parameter but we observed improvements with multiple values of rank parameter.\n\n> More analysis of few shot setting.\n\nThank you for the suggestion. We have now added transfer learning results on another data set together with an analysis of the results.\n\n> assumption that the embeddings and most of the network is frozen except the last linear layer\n\nWe focus on this setting because Mueller et al. 2019 (When does label smoothing help) empirically argue that label smoothing impacts the last layer. We believe our PAC Bayesian analysis can be carried forward to the case when the embeddings are not fixed by putting priors over the embeddings (similar to Neyshabur et al 2018). This would lead to another KL divergence term in the generalization bound but it wont reveal any additional insights about the effect of label smoothing. Lastly, we would like to highlight that existing PAC Bayesian analysis of neural networks focus on margin losses, whereas we show that label smoothing introduces a regularization term that depends on the data, which introduces new challenges for theoretical analysis.\n\n> unclear about its contribution toward understanding the effect of label smoothing\n\nOur analysis reveals the role of the noise distribution in achieving good generalization performance \u2014 specifically that more informative noise distribution reduce the generalization error. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that \"as the number of samples N \u2192 \u221e, \u03b1 \u2192 0 and less smoothing of the hard targets is needed to achieve generalization\". We actually observe this in practice where we see the most benefit of LORAS in low-resource settings.\n\n> prior knowledge to hand-design the noise distribution\n\nThis is an interesting suggestion which needs further in-depth exploration. However from our visualization of the learned noise distributions for TOPv2 and Overnight, the most informative noise distributions are learned for ontology tokens like closing braces \"]}, \")\", special tokens like end of sentence \"</s>\", \".\" among others.

Frame accuracy is common for the task, but semantic accuracy seems not to be used in the prior work. \nFrom my perspective, evaluating the performance based on semantic accuracy simplifies the task, and the classification models should easily achieve better performance compared to the generation based methods.\nThis also implies that the authors should perform classification models in addition to generation-based models.\n\nMoreover, in TOPv2, the paper adds LORAS on BART and show the small improvement and mentions that the results are comparable to the meta-learning method designed for domain adaptation. Is it possible to add the proposed LORAS above the model proposed by Chen et al. (2020) and further improve the performance?\n\nAnother issue to be addressed is that the datasets this paper uses are not well-known structure prediction task, because ATIS and SNIPS only contain very flat structures for the semantic frames, which may not be suitable to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for structure prediction.\nOther structure prediction datasets can be included in the experiments, and probably the improvement can be more significant due to the complex latent structure in the label space.\n\nIn sum, this paper proposes a sound method for label smoothing and claims that it can benefit the generalization capability based on learning the latent structure in the label space. The experiments on semantic parsing are not very convincing, because the results cannot directly compare with the prior work's or the improvement is relatively subtle.\nTo better align with the claim, structure prediction datasets should be considered in the paper.\n\nAfter reading the responses and checking the additional experiments, I changed the score for this paper.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2910/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2910/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Better Structured Representations Using Low-rank Adaptive Label Smoothing", "authorids": ["~Asish_Ghoshal2", "~Xilun_Chen1", "sonalgupta@fb.com", "~Luke_Zettlemoyer1", "~Yashar_Mehdad2"], "authors": ["Asish Ghoshal", "Xilun Chen", "Sonal Gupta", "Luke Zettlemoyer", "Yashar Mehdad"], "keywords": ["label smoothing", "calibration", "semantic parsing", "structured prediction"], "abstract": "Training with soft targets instead of hard targets has been shown to improve performance and calibration of deep neural networks.

As suggested by reviewers, we have added results on a new data set: Overnight (\"Building a semantic parser overnight\", Wang et al) where the goal is to predict an executable logical form that can be executed against a database to answer a natural language query. We also evaluated our method on ATIS and SNIPS as a joint intent and slot tagging task ( in addition to the seq2seq formulation ) as suggested by R3. The results are summarized below:\n\n## Overnight\n\n1. Table 3 describes our results on Overnight in the transfer learning setting where we select the four largest domains as source domains and the four smallest domains as the target domains. LORAS improves over no label smoothing and vanilla label smoothing by 1% on an average over 4 target domains and on the \"housing\" domain the improvement is around 6%.\n2. Figure 2 also includes a visualization of the noise distribution learned on Overnight and the same observations that we had for TOPv2 hold for Overnight as well where we observe distinct noise distributions for ontology and special tokens and other tokens.\n3. We report significantly higher exact match accuracy of logical form than previous work (improvement around ~ 20%).\n\n## Joint Intent prediction and slot tagging on ATIS and SNIPS\n\n1. The last row of Table 1 shows the results of vanilla label smoothing and LORAS on top of the BERT based slot tagging model of Chen et al (2019) where we only use smoothing for the slot tagging component (and not the intent classification component since the number of intents is too small for smoothing to be useful). LORAS performs better than no label smoothing and vanilla label smoothing.\n2. The numbers that we report on ATIS and SNIPS are slightly lower than those reported in Chen et al (2019). We give an explanation for this in footnote 2 in page 7. We further investigate if the improvements by LORAS are meaningful or due to chance. Towards that end we visualize the noise distribution learned by LORAS over SNIPS in Fig. 4 (Appendix, page 14). We observe that LORAS learns distinct noise distributions for \"B\"  and \"I\" tags and the noise distribution makes intuitive sense since the model is more likely to confuse one B tag with another B tag (e.g. B-city vs B-state) rather than one B tag with another I tag."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2910/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2910/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Better Structured Representations Using Low-rank Adaptive Label Smoothing", "authorids": ["~Asish_Ghoshal2", "~Xilun_Chen1", "sonalgupta@fb.com", "~Luke_Zettlemoyer1", "~Yashar_Mehdad2"], "authors": ["Asish Ghoshal", "Xilun Chen", "Sonal Gupta", "Luke Zettlemoyer", "Yashar Mehdad"], "keywords": ["label smoothing", "calibration", "semantic parsing", "structured prediction"], "abstract": "Training with soft targets instead of hard targets has been shown to improve performance and calibration of deep neural networks.

The contribution of this work is two folds: first, highlighted the importance of informative label smoothing through better bound, and second, proposed one label smoothing with low-rank assumption. It is overall a good paper but there are a few concerns: \n\n1. I didn't go through the theoretic proof in detail but it is not obvious how this theoretic motivation is correlated with the low-rank assumption. It will be better for the authors to highlight more about the theoretic result and the empirical algorithms. \n\n2. The experiments are only conducted on parsing tasks, but the authors have claimed the possibility in other areas. I would suggest the authors conduct one/two more experiments on other tasks, like language modeling with large vocab. If additional experiments are presented, I will increase my score. \n\n3. Low-rank output dimension is a common assumption in many papers and it seems there are some mission citations.

This matrix is parametrized via a low-rank approximation which prevents it from collapsing to a diagonal matrix and become ineffective.\n\n-- This approach  introduces more hyperparameters and the tuning of these hyperparameters appears to be non-trivial\n\n-- This approach is empirically compared to vanilla label smoothing and no LS on the task fo semantic parsing which has natural groups of types in the vocabulary.\n\n-- The approach seems to be learning appropriate correlations among the vocabulary items (as seen in the visualization).\n\n-- The improvement over LS is consistent but small on the two semantic parsing datasets. Additionally, uniform LS seems to be hurting performance in many cases when compared to no LS, hence the improvements of the proposed approach over no-LS are modest.\n\n-- The utility of the proposed approach becomes apparent in the few-shot setting where the gains seem significant. More analysis of this would strengthen the paper.\n\n-- The approach also seems to improve model calibration.\n\n-- The theoretical analysis is reasonable but it is unclear about its contribution toward understanding the effect of label smoothing, mainly because of the assumption that the embeddings and most of the network is frozen except the last linear layer which is never the case during training of these models. It is a straightforward extension of analysis provided in prior work and is limited in terms of explaining the effect of the noise distribution/ proposed approach on the optimization of the models.\n\n-- Another straightforward experiment would have been to use prior knowledge to hand-design the noise distribution. For example, a simple baseline would be: manually cluster types based upon their membership as an intent, slot , or a word and use uniform distributions within these groups. It would be interesting to compare how the learned similarity matrix is different form hand-designed prior matrices.
