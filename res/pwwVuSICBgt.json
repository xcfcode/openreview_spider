Whether or not such an accuracy degradation is acceptable will be application-dependent, as we now make explicit in Section 6. In Tables 3 and 5 (now 4 and 6), we found broadly similar degradation across models spanning a range of sizes, thereby demonstrating the generality of our approach.\n\n>The tradeoff between accuracy and memory footprint/energy consumption is not carefully evaluated. For example, a smaller network model with fewer parameters and activations can be trained using the baseline BNN training scheme to reduce memory and energy consumption.\n\nThese tradeoffs can be found in Tables 4 and 5 (now 5 and 6). While training cost reductions are possible through the selection of different network models, this observation is largely orthogonal to our work: by applying our approach to the training of a smaller model, one can obtain the advantages of both optimized network selection and training, effectively benefiting twice. In Tables 3 and 5 (now 4 and 6), we showed significant savings across models spanning a range of sizes, thereby demonstrating the generality of our approach. We have rephrased and expanded the relevant discussion in Section 6 to more clearly emphasize these points.\n\n>Besides, the baseline networks (BinaryNet and ResNet) used for comparison are out-of-date. Many recent works [1-3] propose new BNN architectures, which improve the accuracy of BNNs significantly. It is useful to justify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme for these SOTA BNN architectures.\n\nSince the works the reviewer highlights share architectural features with networks for which we obtained positive results -- particularly ResNetE-18's skip connections -- we see no fundamental reason why our approach would not be favorable with these models as well. Moreover, ResNetE-18 was published in 2019, and is therefore more current than Bi-Real Net (2018). We now cite the works highlighted by the reviewer in Section 2, and have added text to Section 6 to explain that ResNetE-18 is representative of a broader class of modern network models.\n\n>To evaluate the energy consumption of the traditional and the proposed BNN training scheme, the authors assume that the two training schemes have the same convergence rate. Although the traditional BNN training scheme consumes higher power during training, it might take fewer epochs to reach the same accuracy. Therefore, the saving in energy consumption can be lower than the reported numbers.\n\nWe included a subset of our experiments' training curves in Appendix A.2 to show that our method does not result in convergence rate deterioration vs the baseline. To further support this claim, we now include the training curves for all of our experiments in Appendix A.2, and have highlighted the lack of induced convergence rate deterioration in the abstract and Section 1.\n\n>In addition, the estimated energy consumption of BNN training obtained from using QKeras is very rough, which makes the improvement in energy consumption less convincing. The authors can mainly improve the paper's strength by prototyping the proposed BNN training scheme on an embedded CPU and measuring real-world performance and power.\n\nWe chose to use QEnergy since it provides platform-agnostic energy estimates. While we acknowledge that a platform-specific implementation would have allowed us to obtain more accurate energy consumption figures than reported in the paper, we believe that our QEnergy-derived estimates are more useful from a high-level perspective in quantifying relative energy changes in a platform-agnostic manner. We have rephrased our description of the energy estimator in Section 6 to emphasize this point."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3413/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3413/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Enabling Binary Neural Network Training on the Edge", "authorids": ["~Erwei_Wang1", "james.davis@imperial.ac.uk", "danielemoro@google.com", "~Piotr_Zielinski1", "claudionor.coelho@alumni.stanford.edu", "~Satrajit_Chatterjee1", "p.cheung@imperial.ac.uk", "~George_Anthony_Constantinides1"], "authors": ["Erwei Wang", "James J.

In Table 5 (now 6), for example, \"bool $\\partial\\boldsymbol{W}$ only\" is equivalent to SignSGD (Bernstein et al., 2018).

Compared to the traditional BNN training algorithm, the proposed scheme achieves a significant reduction in memory footprint and energy consumption on multiple datasets.", "review": "I agree with the key contributions listed in the paper, especially the binarization of weight gradients and activations. The paper is well written and clearly articulates a contribution to the literature. The proposed BNN training scheme can have a significant practical impact. The experimental evidence is provided for several standard image classification tasks. Most of the related works are cited. The paper does not contain a theory part, but wherever possible, equations are provided to illustrate how the method works.\n\nConcerns: \nThis paper includes a detailed empirical evaluation of the proposed BNN training scheme. The major concern is that the proposed low-cost BNN training scheme can cause a nontrivial accuracy degradation (2.25%) as shown in Table 5. The tradeoff between accuracy and memory footprint/energy consumption is not carefully evaluated. For example, a smaller network model with fewer parameters and activations can be trained using the baseline BNN training scheme to reduce memory and energy consumption. Besides, the baseline networks (BinaryNet and ResNet) used for comparison are out-of-date.  Many recent works [1-3] propose new BNN architectures, which improve the accuracy of BNNs significantly. It is useful to justify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme for these SOTA BNN architectures.\n\nTo evaluate the energy consumption of the traditional and the proposed BNN training scheme, the authors assume that the two training schemes have the same convergence rate. Although the traditional BNN training scheme consumes higher power during training, it might take fewer epochs to reach the same accuracy. Therefore, the saving in energy consumption can be lower than the reported numbers. In addition, the estimated energy consumption of BNN training obtained from using QKeras is very rough, which makes the improvement in energy consumption less convincing. The authors can mainly improve the paper's strength by prototyping the proposed BNN training scheme on an embedded CPU and measuring real-world performance and power.\n\nReasons for score: In general, I like the idea of enabling low-cost BNN training by identifying unnecessary high-precision data. However, the improvement numbers presented in the paper need better justification. I would consider raising my score if the authors could address the aforementioned concerns.\n\n[1] Bi-Real Net: Enhancing the Performance of 1-bit CNNs With Improved Representational Capability and Advanced Training Algorithm\n\n[2] ProxyBNN: Learning Binarized Neural Networks via Proxy Matrices\n\n[3] ReActNet: Towards Precise Binary Neural Network with Generalized Activation Functions\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3413/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3413/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Enabling Binary Neural Network Training on the Edge", "authorids": ["~Erwei_Wang1", "james.davis@imperial.ac.uk", "danielemoro@google.com", "~Piotr_Zielinski1", "claudionor.coelho@alumni.stanford.edu", "~Satrajit_Chatterjee1", "p.cheung@imperial.ac.uk", "~George_Anthony_Constantinides1"], "authors": ["Erwei Wang", "James J.
