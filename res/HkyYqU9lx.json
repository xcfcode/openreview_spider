It is assumed that the alignment can be provided as a part of training data, with Chinese Restaurant process being used in the actual experiments. \n\nThe idea makes sense, although its applicability is limited to the domains where a monotonic alignment is available. But as discussed during the pre-review period, there has been a lot of strongly overlapping related work, such as probabilistic models with hard-alignment (Sequence Transduction With Recurrent Neural Network, Graves et al, 2012) and also attempts to use external alignments in end-to-end models (A Neural Transducer, Jaitly et al, 2015). That said, I do not think the approach is sufficiently novel. \n\nI also have a concern regarding the evaluation. I do not think it is fair to compare the proposed model that depends on external alignment with the vanilla soft-attention model that learns alignments from scratch. In a control experiment soft-attention could be trained to match the external alignment. Such a pretraining could reduce overfitting on the small dataset, the one on which the proposed approach brings the most improvement. On a larger dataset, especially SIGMORPHON, the improvements are not very big and are only obtained for a certain class of languages.\n\nTo sum up, two main issues are (a) lack of novelty (b) the comparison of a model trained with external alignment and one without it. \n", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Sequence to Sequence Transduction with Hard Monotonic Attention", "abstract": "We present a supervised sequence to sequence transduction model with a hard attention mechanism which combines the more traditional statistical alignment methods with the power of recurrent neural networks.

They are all indeed very relevant and are now addressed in the latest revision of the paper, in the introduction section and the related work section.  \n\nOur approach is strongly related to the first two works, but differs from them by allowing direct dependency between the encoder and decoder networks through the hard attention mechanism, while in those works the two RNNs are kept independent to allow tractable inference. We also compare our results to the reported results in Yu et. al. and show that our approach provides better overall accuracy over the Wiktionary inflection generation dataset.\n\nWe also added reference to the works by Chorowski and Bahdanau et. al. in https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04395 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07503, which adapted the soft attention model to perform more focused, local attention over the long input sequences in speech recognition.
