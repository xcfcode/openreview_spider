Empirically, for the 2-cluster case, across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, the algorithm is shown to achieve comparable performance in terms of clustering accuracy with respect to an existing algorithm that comes with theoretical guarantee, with the added benefit that it can easily incorporate pre-labeled pairs.\n\nWhile the results presented are encouraging, the description of the algorithm itself is unclear to me. In particular, how is each sigma_i initialized and updated? I assume it is perhaps random initialization followed by SGD updates but what about the constraints? It is also not clear to me how the algorithm works asymptotically, e.g. with respect to (1). Also, it seems that for the labeled pairs (semi-supervised setting), the suggested embedding implies working with a full n-by-n matrix instead of m-by-n matrix. Computationally and storage-wise, it is not clear how the algorithm compares to other\nspectral clustering approaches.\n\nI believe that the author has a promising algorithm but I am afraid I cannot recommend acceptance in its current state, since it is not clear enough in the sense that an interested reader could implement and test it.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Community Detection with the Triplet Loss", "abstract": "We present a scalable approach for unsupervised learning on graph-structured data based on a simple graph embedding learned via the triplet loss.
