The authors conduct experiments on datasets including ImageNet to evaluate their scheme.\nMuch of the concern from reviewers relates to baseline comparison and details around that. Specifically, R1 believes that the submission could have a bigger impact if authors could conduct more thorough experiments, e.g. compressing more widely-used and challenging architecture of ResNet-50, or trying tasks such as image detection (Mask R-CNN). The authors' responded to that and mentioned their choice of the current experimental setting is to facilitate comparison with previous works (baselines), which use similar experimental settings. Nevertheless, the baseline methods could have been attempted by the authors on broader tasks, or more widely-used architectures could have been investigated by authors on the baseline methods. As a result, R1 was not convinced.

We could not introduce and discuss lots of exciting quantization techniques such as vector quantization due to the limited space. We feel that introducing other quantization techniques in details would make the paper distracted since those techniques cannot be compared with compression ratio only (i.e., inference architecture, computation methods, and storage design would be different). Instead, we added more thorough introduction to binary codes in Section 1 to explain unique computational advantages of using binary codes.\nWe introduced \"Hardware-aware Automated Quantization with Mixed Precision\" in Section 1 since fractional quantization on average is available as you pointed out, while FleXOR can also employ different quantization bits for each layer (i.e., we believe HAQ method can be applied on top of FleXOR).\n\nQ2: More extensive and thorough experiments could improve the impact of the paper.\nA2: We agree that including extensive quantization methods and model architectures would greatly improve the impact of the paper. Unfortunately, as we discussed above, our goal in this paper is to improve quantization schemes based on binary codes. Including quantization methods of different assumptions may require much lengthy discussions that make comparisons a lot complicated. For example, \"Hardware-aware Automated Quantization\" could be additionally applied to binary codes, and FleXOR is not conflicted with such an architectural techniques to improve compression ratio. Deep compression, TTQ, and TWN involve weight pruning that deserves large space for discussions (nonetheless, we compared TWN, TTQ, and BinaryRelax using ternary quantization scheme in Table 5 of Appendix). Deep compression also includes CSR format and Huffman coding which would make comparisons more complicated.\nWe chose a few representative quantization methods mainly based on binary codes to facilitate fair and focused comparisons, and correspondingly, ResNet models on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet are selected for our experiments since most previous works (of binary codes) commonly include those models. For example, we could not include HAQ in the paper for experimental results, because HAQ chooses MobileNet and ResNet-50 only as model architectures while comparisons are made with only PACT and Deep Compression methods.\n\nQ3: Providing some code and numbers for inference time would be great.\nA3: Due to the internal policy of our organization, we cannot open our codes publicly at this moment. Hence, we provide a link to anonymous code to the reviewers only until we get an approval for public release. Please refer to our message available to the reviewers only.\nOverhead of weight decryption on-the-fly is extremely small even with CPUs or GPUs, since decryption involves only a binary matrix multiplication over GF(2), which can be easily supported by existing SIMD or vector operations. Since a binary matrix is too small (e.g., 10x8), computational overhead is just ignorable compared with other computations."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper700/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper700/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "FleXOR: Trainable Fractional Quantization", "authors": ["Dongsoo Lee", "Se Jung Kwon", "Byeongwook Kim", "Yongkweon Jeon", "Baeseong Park", "Jeongin Yun", "Gu-Yeon Wei"], "authorids": ["dslee3@gmail.com", "mogndrewk@gmail.com", "quddnr145@gmail.com", "dragwon.jeon@gmail.com", "qkrqotjd91@gmail.com", "yji6373@naver.com", "gywei@g.harvard.edu"], "keywords": ["Quantization", "Model Compression", "Trainable Compression", "XOR", "Encryption"], "TL;DR": "We propose an encryption algorithm/architecture to compress quantized weights in order to achieve fractional numbers of bits per weight", "abstract": "Parameter quantization is a popular model compression technique due to its regular form and high compression ratio.

Now, the paper has full 8 pages that is a soft limit.\n\nQ2: There likely no computational savings when compared to lookup tables.\nA2: As we added in Section 1, if weights are quantized in binary codes, then the number of multiplications is significantly reduced (even though scaling factors have full precision) or most computations can be replaced with bit-wise operations, which have been introduced and discussed as unique advantages of using binary codes in previous works. Since we do not suggest new computation methods using binary codes, computational savings using quantized weights become the same as those of previous binary-codes-based quantization techniques. FleXOR, however, saves on- and off-chip memory requirements significantly if $N_{in}$ is smaller than $N_{out}$, and reducing memory bandwidth/footprint is crucial to designing energy-efficient inference systems. We included this discussion in the evaluation parts.\n\nQ3: The evaluation section lacks experiments that evaluate the computational savings.\nA3: Since binary codes and lookup table would be associated with vastly different inference architecture, computation methods, and storage design, it is difficult to analyze detailed comparisons on FleXOR and lookup-table methods. We chose quantization schemes using binary codes in the experimental results because 1) binary codes are being widely studied and 2) we can focus on the practical issues on binary codes. Since all of quantization techniques in Table 1 and Table 2 follow the form of binary codes with the same q bits, comparisons have been made under the same computational savings (thus, model accuracy is emphasized). FleXOR, however, provides not only higher model accuracy but also additional storage savings due to the proposed encryption algorithm/architecture using XOR logic.

They use a network of differentiable XOR gates that maps encrypted weights to higher-dimensional decrypted weights to decode the parameters on-the-fly and learn both the encrypted weights and the scaling factors involved in the XOR networks by gradient descent.\n\nStrengths of the paper:\n- The method allows for a fractional number of bits per weights and relies of well-known differentiable approximations of the sign function. Indeed, virtually any number of bits/weights can be attained by varying the ratio N_in/N_out.\n- The papers displays good results on ImageNet for a ResNet-18.\n\nWeaknesses of the paper:\n- Some arguments that are presented could deserve a bit more precision. For instance, quantizing to a fractional number of bits per weights per layer is in itself interesting. However, if we were to quantize different layers of the same network with distinct integer  ratio of bits per weights (say 1 bit per weight for some particular layers and 2 bits per weight for the other layers), the average ratio would also be fractional (see for instance \"Hardware-aware Automated Quantization with Mixed Precision\", Wang et al., where the authors find the right (integer) number of bits/weights per layer using RL). Similarly, using vector quantization does allow for on-chip low memory: we do not need to re-instantiate the compressed layer but we can compute the forward in the compressed domain (by splitting the activations into similar block sizes and computing dot products). \n- More extensive and thorough experiments could improve the impact of the paper. For instance, authors could compress the widely used (and more challenging) ResNet-50 architecture, or try other tasks such as image detection (Mask R-CNN). The table is missing results from: \"Hardware Automated Quantization\", Wang et al ; \"Trained Ternary Quantization\", Zhu et al ; \"Deep Compression\",  Han et al; \"Ternary weight networks\", Li et al (not an extensive list).\n- Similarly, providing some code and numbers for inference time would greatly strengthen the paper and the possible usage of this method by the community. Indeed, I wonder what the overhead of decrypting the weights on-the-fly is (although it only involves XOR operations and products)\n- Small typos: for instance, two points at the very end of section 5.\n\nJustification fo rating:\nThe proposed method is well presented and illustrated. However, I think the paper would need either (1) more thorough experimental results (see comments above, points 2 and 3 of weaknesses) or (2) more justifications for its existence (see comments above, point 1 of weaknesses)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper700/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper700/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "FleXOR: Trainable Fractional Quantization", "authors": ["Dongsoo Lee", "Se Jung Kwon", "Byeongwook Kim", "Yongkweon Jeon", "Baeseong Park", "Jeongin Yun", "Gu-Yeon Wei"], "authorids": ["dslee3@gmail.com", "mogndrewk@gmail.com", "quddnr145@gmail.com", "dragwon.jeon@gmail.com", "qkrqotjd91@gmail.com", "yji6373@naver.com", "gywei@g.harvard.edu"], "keywords": ["Quantization", "Model Compression", "Trainable Compression", "XOR", "Encryption"], "TL;DR": "We propose an encryption algorithm/architecture to compress quantized weights in order to achieve fractional numbers of bits per weight", "abstract": "Parameter quantization is a popular model compression technique due to its regular form and high compression ratio.

It looks at binary codes for quantization instead of the usual lookup tables because quantization approaches that rely on lookup tables have the drawback that during inference, the network has to fetch the weights from the lookup table and work with the full precision values, which means that the computation cost is remains the same as the non-quantized network. The paper presents FleXOR gates, a fast and efficient logic gate for mapping bit sequences to binary weights. The benefit of the gate is that the bit sequence can be shorter than the binary weights which means that the code length can be less than 1 bit per weight.\n\nThe paper also proposes an algorithm for end-to-end training of the quantized neural networks. It proposes the use of tanh to approximate the non-differentiable Heaviside step function in the backward pass.\n\nNovelty\n\nThe idea of using logic gates for dequantization is interesting and (as far as I know) novel. One can imagine, that specialized hardware build on this idea could very efficient for inference (in terms of energy cost).\n\nWriting\n\nThe paper is very well written and completed with great visualizations and pseudocode. Kudos to the authors, I really enjoyed reading it. However, I do not think it is justified to go over the 8 page soft limit. I would recommend that the authors perhaps shorten section 3 or remove figure 9 to fit it into 8 pages.\n\nSignificance/Impact\n\nThe paper is motivated by the high computation cost of working with full precision values. But this paper also works with full precision weights, since it has a full precision scaling factor (alpha) and, as far as I understood, works with full precision values during forward propagation. This means that there likely are no computational savings when compared to lookup tables.\n\nThe evaluation section lacks experiments that evaluate the computational savings. The baselines should include quantization methods based on lookup tables, and there should be a comparison of computational costs. The baselines that are presented (BWN etc.) offer a tradeoff between accuracy and computational costs, yet they are only compared in accuracy.

Previous attempts, however, only allow for integer numbers of quantization bits, which ends up restricting the search space for compression ratio and accuracy. Moreover, quantization bits are usually obtained by minimizing quantization loss in a local manner that does not directly correspond to minimizing the loss function. In this paper, we propose an encryption algorithm/architecture to compress quantized weights in order to achieve fractional numbers of bits per weight and new compression configurations further optimize accuracy/compression trade-offs. Decryption is implemented using XOR gates added into the neural network model and described as $\\tanh(x)$, which enable gradient calculations superior to the straight-through gradient method. We perform experiments using MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet to show that inserting XOR gates learns quantization/encrypted bit decisions through training and obtains high accuracy even for fractional sub 1-bit weights.", "pdf": "/pdf/6b7e44432aff63964bf47c7957697066041e4fc3.pdf", "paperhash": "lee|flexor_trainable_fractional_quantization", "original_pdf": "/attachment/d263da16fc71a866082bf8f657effc58ab76346f.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nlee2020flexor,\ntitle={Fle{\\{}XOR{\\}}: Trainable Fractional Quantization},\nauthor={Dongsoo Lee and Se Jung Kwon and Byeongwook Kim and Yongkweon Jeon and Baeseong Park and Jeongin Yun and Gu-Yeon Wei},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJlQ96EtPr}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
