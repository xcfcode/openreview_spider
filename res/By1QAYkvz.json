The basic idea is that a base image classifier, ResNet, is trained to recognize the moprhokinetics from single images.  However, predictiong in single images means that subsequent frames might be labelled differently, and also that later on frames might receive labels that refer to earlier developmental stages than previously predicted, implying developmental regression, which is not \"allowed\" in this dataset. For this reason an intelligent post-processing step is proposed based on dynamic programming to correct for prediction inconsistensies.\n\nThe problem is interesting and practical. The solution proposed is a logical one, although not great technical contribution can be claimed. That is still ok, posing the question is more relevant than answering one, for such a problem.\n\nThe main problem of this paper is that it does not discuss results. Instead, the results are merely aggregated in a table, however, there is no analysis. I would expect the authors to be more detailed in this aspect.\n\n- Interesting problem\n- If the problem is not modelled as sequence classification, can't the model predict different labels within a sub-sequence, thus indicating \"embryo regression\"?\n- ", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Predicting Embryo Morphokinetics in Videos with Late Fusion Nets & Dynamic Decoders", "abstract": "To optimize clinical outcomes, many fertility clinics select embryos strategically, based on how quickly they reach certain developmental milestones.
