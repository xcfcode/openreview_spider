Instead, our claim is that pooling is not *always* necessary and that there is an alternative mechanism that can lead to stability to deformation, namely smooth filters.\" \n\nThanks for clarifying your assertion! However, 'Pooling is neither necessary nor sufficient for deformation stability' is a very strong claim. 'Pooling is not always necessary and smooth filters can sometimes be used for deformation stability' shows little contribution and would require an air-tight analysis to be considered above acceptance. When does pooling fail? When does smooth filter initialization outperform pooling? When does smooth filter initialization fail? I do not see a one-one comparison between smooth filters with different pooling methods. Figure 5a comes close but it doesn't compare to average pooling and it seems to be on a different task as compared to Figure 2d. Figure 5b is misleading when looked alongside Figure 5a as they deal with totally different tasks. Also, the purpose of pooling is more than just deformation invariance and a comparison of how other properties of network are affected by replacing pooling with smooth filters is also necessary to reach a conclusion, such as the downstream performance of discriminator.\n\n\"It would be very helpful to us if you could expand on this statement.\"\n\nYou have understood the comment correctly. Given the network (VGG) and training data (CIFAR 10), in figure 2d, the cosine sensitivity may be a property of the training task i.e. a low training error could be correlated to cosine similarity of around 0.2. For a similar training error, how does the smooth filter initialization compare? If smooth filter initialization is consistently superior to pooling (even under certain controlled conditions), on a wider variety of datasets, tasks and architectures, it would indeed be a very interesting result."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper367/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper367/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper367/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Pooling Is Neither Necessary nor Sufficient for Appropriate Deformation Stability in CNNs", "abstract": "Many of our core assumptions about how neural networks operate remain empirically untested.

It addresses an interesting and important question at the interface between signal processing and CNNs. \n\nThat said, the paper does not produce any clear novel results. It does not provide any theoretical result, nor any new algorithm. Its contributions consist of three empirical studies, demonstrating that (i) the benefits of pooling in terms of deformation stability can be achieved through supervised learning the filters instead (sec 3), (ii) the mechanism to obtain stability through learning essentially consists on reducing the bandwidth of (some) filters (sec4), and (iii) that this mechanism is data-dependent (sec 5). None of these studies strike the reviewer as particularly revealing. Moreover, the reviewer felt that the authors could have built on those findings to ask (and hopefully answer) a few interesting questions, such as:\n-- Nowhere in the paper there is a discussion about critical Nyquist sampling and the need to reduce the bandwidth of a signal prior to downsampling it in order to avoid aliasing. Average pooling provably does it, and learnt filters do it provided they indeed become bandlimited. What are the links between deformation stability and the ability to avoid aliasing? \n-- How many lowpass antialiasing filters are needed per layer to provide sufficient stability? \n-- Also, the authors should relate this study with similar works that do the same in speech (e.g. https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2018/abstracts/1371.html). \n\nIn conclusion, my impression is that this paper requires a major iteration before it can be of widespread interest to the community.

Results are presented on CIFAR 10 to show the same, albeit on a trained network. However, CIFAR 10 is not a difficult dataset and the level of cosine sensitivity (shown as same with and without pooling) could very well be a steady state for the specific classification task.

It shows different pooling strategies reach to similar levels of deformation stability after sufficient training. It also offers an alternative technique with smoothness filters with to CNNs more stable. \nPros:\nThe paper considers a wide variety of pooling strategies and deformation techniques for evaluation.  Fair experiments with conclusion of similar stability of different pool layers after training is very evident.\nCons:\ni) Results on CIFAR 10 show pooling has little effect but is it unnecessary for harder problems as well? What about human pose datasets where deformation is inherent?\niii) Although, the results presented on smoother filter initialization are interesting, but these are results are not compared in a one to one setting to different pooling methods, convolutions or residual networks. \n\nThis paper tries to argue that pooling is unnecessary for deformation invariance, as title suggests, and proposes initialization based on smooth filters as an alternative. Results are presented on CIFAR 10 to show the same, albeit on a trained network. However, CIFAR 10 is not a difficult dataset and the level of cosine sensitivity (shown as same with and without pooling) could very well be a steady state for the specific classification task. Imagenet dataset doesn't seem to show ablative studies. So this little evidence is insufficient to conclude that pooling is unnecessary.  Also as mentioned in the conclusion of the paper, the effect of pooling through the course of training would add more weight.

One common assumption is that convolutional neural networks need to be stable to small translations and deformations to solve image recognition tasks. For many years, this stability was baked into CNN architectures by incorporating interleaved pooling layers. Recently, however, interleaved pooling has largely been abandoned. This raises a number of questions: Are our intuitions about deformation stability right at all? Is it important? Is pooling necessary for deformation invariance? If not, how is deformation invariance achieved in its absence? In this work, we rigorously test these questions, and find that deformation stability in convolutional networks is more nuanced than it first appears: (1) Deformation invariance is not a binary property, but rather that different tasks require different degrees of deformation stability at different layers. (2) Deformation stability is not a fixed property of a network and is heavily adjusted over the course of training, largely through the smoothness of the convolutional filters. (3) Interleaved pooling layers are neither necessary nor sufficient for achieving the optimal form of deformation stability for natural image classification. (4) Pooling confers \\emph{too much} deformation stability for image classification at initialization, and during training, networks have to learn to \\emph{counteract} this inductive bias. Together, these findings provide new insights into the role of interleaved pooling and deformation invariance in CNNs, and demonstrate the importance of rigorous empirical testing of even our most basic assumptions about the working of neural networks.", "keywords": ["Convolutional Neural Networks", "Deformation Stability", "Pooling", "Transformation Invariance"], "authorids": ["aruderman@google.com", "ncr@google.com", "arimorcos@gmail.com", "danielzoran@google.com"], "authors": ["Avraham Ruderman", "Neil C.
