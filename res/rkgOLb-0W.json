This information is then used to define skip connections in the language model, to capture longer dependencies between words. The update of the hidden state does not depend only on the previous hidden state, but also on the hidden states corresponding to the following words: all the previous words belonging to the smallest subtree containing the current word, such that the current word is not the left-most one. The authors propose to parametrize trees using \"syntactic distances\" between adjacent words (a scalar value for each pair of adjacent words w_t, w_{t+1}). Given these distances, it is possible to obtain the constituents and the corresponding gating activations for the skip connections. These different operations can be relaxed to differentiable operations, so that stochastic gradient descent can be used to learn the parameters. The model is evaluated on three language modeling benchmarks: character level PTB, word level PTB and word level text8. The induced constituency trees are also evaluated, for sentence of length 10 or less (which is the standard setting for unsupervised parsing).\n\nOverall, I really like the main idea of the paper. The use of \"syntactic distances\" to parametrize the trees is clever, as they can easily be computed using only partial information up to time t. From these distances, it is also relatively straightforward to obtain which constituents (or subtrees) a word belongs to (and thus, the corresponding gating activations). Moreover, the operations can easily be relaxed to obtain a differentiable model, which can easily be trained using stochastic gradient descent.\n\nThe results reported on the language modeling experiments are strong. One minor comment here is that it would be nice to have an ablation analysis, as it is possible to obtain similarly strong results with simpler models (such as plain LSTM).\n\nMy main concern regarding the paper is that it is a bit hard to understand. In particular in section 4, the authors alternates between discrete and relaxed values: end of section 4.1, it is implied that alpha are in [0, 1], but in equation 6, alpha are in {0, 1}, then relaxed in equation 9 to [0, 1] again. I am also wondering whether it would make more sense to start by introducing the syntactic distances, then the alphas and finally the gates? I also found the section 5 to be quite confusing. While I get the\tgeneral idea, I am not sure what is the relation between hidden states h and m (section 5.1). Is there a mixup between h defined in equation 10 and h from section 5.1? I am aware that it is not straightforward to describe the proposed method, but believe it would be a much stronger paper if written more clearly.\n\nTo conclude, I really like the method proposed in this paper, and believe that the experimental results are quite strong.\nMy main concern\tregarding the paper is its clarity: I will gladly increase my score if the authors can improve the writing.", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Language Modeling by Jointly Learning Syntax and Lexicon", "abstract": "We propose a neural language model capable of unsupervised syntactic structure induction.

The idea is very creative and interesting. The paper is well written.\n\nBesides the official comment that the authors already replied, I have some more:\n- I was still wondering how to compute the left hand side of eq 3 by marginalizing over all possible unfinished structures so far. (Of course, what the authors do is showed to be a fast and good approximation.)\n- Using CNN to compute d has a disadvantage that the range of look-back must be predefined. Looking at fig 3, in order to make sure that d6 is smaller than d2, the look-back should have a wide coverage so that the computation for d6 has some knowledge about d2 (in some cases the local information can help to avoid it, but not always). I therefore think that using an RNN is more suitable than using a CNN.\n- Is it possible to extend this framework to dependency structure?\n- It would be great if the authors show whether the model can leverage given tree structures (like SPINN) (for instance we can do a multitask learning where a task is parsing given a treebank to train)\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Language Modeling by Jointly Learning Syntax and Lexicon", "abstract": "We propose a neural language model capable of unsupervised syntactic structure induction.

The main idea of this model is to add skip-connections to integrate syntax relationships into the context of predicting the next word (i.e. language modeling task).\n\nTo model this, the authors introduce hidden variable l_t, which break down to the decisions of a soft version of gate variable values in the previous possible positions. These variables are then parameterized using syntactic distance to ensure that the final structure inferred by the model has no overlapping ranges so that it will be a valid syntax tree.\n\nI think the paper is in general clearly written. The model is interesting and the experiment section is quite solid. The model reaches state-of-the-art level performance in language modeling and the performance on unsupervised parsing task (which is a by-product of the model) is also quite promising.\n\nMy main question is that the motivation/intuition of introducing the syntactic distance variable.

We\u2019d like to address your issues as follows:\n\nRegarding \"marginalizing over all possible unfinished structures so far\"\nMarginalizing over all possible unfinished structure is very difficult due to the fact that our model stacks multiple recurrent layers. One better approximation is that we compute left-hand side of both eq2 and eq3 by marginalizing over all possible local structures at each time step. In other words, we can sampling all possible l_t, then compute the weighted sum of the right-hand side of eq2 and eq3 with respect to different l_t and using p(l_{t}=t'|x_0, ...,x_t) as weights.\n\nRegarding \"using an RNN is more suitable than using a CNN\"\nWe totally agree with that. Using an LSTM can provide an unbounded context information for the gates, and that is definitely a good direction to try. We will probably try that in the future iterations of our model.\n\nRegarding \"extend this framework to dependency structure\"\nParsing network can only give boundary information for constituent parsing. However, it's possible to extract dependency information from attention weights, which remains an open question to study.\n\nRegarding \"leverage given tree structures\"\nWe also have thought about this. One possible way is to infer a set of true distances using the given tree structure and train the parsing network to generate a set of distances which align with the true distances. We haven\u2019t done that in this work since we want to focus on unsupervised learning. This will be explored in our next work.\n\nThanks again for the comments and review!\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Language Modeling by Jointly Learning Syntax and Lexicon", "abstract": "We propose a neural language model capable of unsupervised syntactic structure induction.

In order to make the motivations and explanations to syntactic distance clearer, Section 4.2 has been rewritten accordingly to include the points we\u2019ve mentioned here. \n\nThe syntactic distance (d value) is motivated by trying to learn a scalar which indicates how semantically close each pair of words is. Our basic hypothesis is that words in the same constituent should have closer syntactic relation within themselves, and the syntactical proximity can be represented by a scalar value. From the tree structure point of view, the distance can be interpreted as positively correlated with the shortest path in the tree (in terms of the number of edges) between the two words. Syntactically the closer the two words are, the shorter this distance will be. Further, with the proof in Appendix C, we proved that by just using this scalar distance, a valid tree can be inferred. \n\nMathematically the syntactic distance can also be naturally introduced from the stick breaking process, as a parametrization of \\alpha in Eq. 6.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of computational linguistics, we did an extensive search and found some related work which tries to identify the beginning and ending words by just using local information, for example, Roark & Hollingshead, (2008). We have cited this work in the updated version.\n\nThanks again for your kind review!\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Language Modeling by Jointly Learning Syntax and Lexicon", "abstract": "We propose a neural language model capable of unsupervised syntactic structure induction.

Thus, we can have a computationally less expensive approximation for p(x_t+1|x0...x_t).\n\nRegarding \"linguistic theory for 'syntactic distance'\"\nThe idea of using a \"syntactic distance\" is inspired by the binary parse tree, which is related to linguistic theory. We introduced the \"syntactic distance\" while trying to render the binary parse tree into a learnable, soft tree structure in the framework of language modeling. So it can be deemed as a set of boundaries which defines the binary parse tree.\n\nRegarding \"try other activation functions\"\nThank you for this enlightening comment. We recently tried to replace sigmoid by ReLU, which makes the model achieve more stable performance regardless of different temperature parameter \\tau.\n\nRegarding \"try any word embedding\"\nIn this experiment, we want to prove the model's ability to learn from scratch, but pretrained word embedding can contain syntactic information. We will use word embedding in future work that focuses on obtaining better syntactic distance.\n\nThis article will be further revised and polished according to your suggestions.\n\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Language Modeling by Jointly Learning Syntax and Lexicon", "abstract": "We propose a neural language model capable of unsupervised syntactic structure induction.
