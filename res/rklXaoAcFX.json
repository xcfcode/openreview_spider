We answer their concerns regarding the novelty, practicality and use of the package. In summary, we feel that the reviewers have focused too much on the \u201cRiemannian optimization\u201d side of Geomstats, thus partly neglecting our package\u2019s novelty which is its completeness and flexibility in terms of Riemannian geometry. \n \n# Novelty with respect to other softwares\n\nR1 and R2 expressed concerns on the novelty of Geomstats in light of other existing softwares to perform optimization on manifolds. We contend that Geomstats was built with a completely different purpose than these softwares: its objective is to foster research and use of \u201cRiemannian\u201d data models. This translates into a set of unique specificities:\n\n1. Geometry : the package\u2019s object-oriented design of Riemannian geometry is in itself a (novel) mathematical contribution. Having common categories of objects and operations for differential geometric structures such as affine connection spaces, Riemannian spaces, Lie groups, etc. is not easy to realize and requires an important effort to verify if theorems and notions continue to hold for each structure (done in our unit tests). This is not at all present in any other packages.\n\nOur package is also the first to provide a flexible choice of Riemannian metrics and corresponding methods: metrics and left- or right- invariant metrics on Lie groups are not implemented in any of the other packages. R1 argues that these metrics could be easily added to Pymanopt and we disagree. The metrics would come within Pymanopt only for the purpose of optimization, which considerably restricts their use. Moreover, they wouldn\u2019t come with exponential and logarithm maps, inner products at each tangent space, tangent pca, etc., because Pymanopt focuses on efficient optimization rather than completeness.\n\nOur package thus positions itself as a package of Riemannian modelization, with significantly more geometric features than Pymanopt which reflect this specific purpose.\n\n2. Flexibility: Geomstats is uniquely flexible and modular enough to allow researchers to contribute their code. For instance, a researcher recently contributed an algorithm for optimal quantization on Riemannian manifolds, making use of our exponential maps and enriching the package with new methods. This could not have been implemented in the context of Pymanopt. This flexibility is also reflected in the multiple use of Riemannian geometry that Geomstats permits. It is in particular the only package that draws a heavy accent on statistical analysis of manifolds (new notion of mean, variance, etc.), which come readily implemented in Geomstats--making it a unique gateway to principled inference on manifolds.\n \nIt seems that the reviewers would have preferred one specific objective for Geomstats (e.g. optimization, or one specific example of its use), but this would have been against its purpose which is meant to be broad, as a fertile ground for geometry in machine learning.\n \n3. Practicality \n \nGeomstats is in python and fully integrated with numpy, while Manopt and  Roptlib are being mainly devised for Matlab or Julia, thus severely  hindering the adoption of Riemannian geometry by the machine learning community.\n \nGeomstats is yet the only Riemannian software directly integrated with Tensorflow and Keras, allowing GPU computations and thus computational efficiency and the use of Riemannian geometry in large scale problems, as shown in Sec 5.3 and [1]. Using Geomstats in this large scale deep learning application improves the performance in all image metrics ([1] Table 2), while training time is comparable (communication from [1]). \n\n# Software document\n \nR3 considers our submission as more of a software document than a scientific paper. We introduce a software meant for machine learning research, being conform to ICLR\u2019s call for papers on \u201csoftware platforms\u201d.\n \nWe thank the reviewers again for the attention given to our contribution and hope that we have lifted their objections to our manuscript. We believe this package is of general interest with a potentially broad impact for the ML community and should get visibility at ICLR conference to foster collaborative work around geometry.\n\n[1] Hou, B., Miolane, N., Khanal, B., Lee, M., Alansary, A., McDonagh, S., Hajnal, J., Ruecket, D., Glocker, B., Kainz, B.: Deep pose estimation for image-based registration.

Like theanogeometry, geomstats provides a backend for fast computation. Instead of theano, they interface tensorflow and numpy.\n\nThe core problem the author\u2019s have to argue against is the existence of various other packages like pymanopt (which are mentioned in the paper) providing similar functionality.\n\nThe main advantage to pymanopt is stated to be lower computational cost. Unfortunately, this is not evaluated empirically. Pymanopt similarly provides the option to provide the cost function with tensorflow and uses numpy/scipy internally, therefore also making use of vectorization. A favorable empirical comparison would have been a compelling case for geomstats. While geomstats provides some more metrics than pymanopt, it lacks in other areas in comparison. Such metrics could be added relatively easily to pymanopt (or some of the other competing libraries).\n\nTruly novel is the update for Keras which allows Riemannian gradient descent on parameters living on manifolds. Unfortunately, this is not directly shown and discussed further in the paper, but the reader is referred to the code base. While plenty of examples were provided in the supplementary material, I\u2019d have preferred to see specific example(s) being shown and discussed in the paper. In the end, the main paper alone only gives an overview of what exists, but gives me no idea on how the package is used.\n\nIn parts, the paper reads more like an argument in favor of Riemannian modelization and optimization, instead of advocating for the specific package. While it is very important to demonstrate potential applications for the framework - an area in which this paper excelled - other, more important parts (mentioned above), were omitted because of it. Similarly, a lot of time is needlessly spent on defining well-known manifolds.\n\nOn the formal side, the formatting of the citations within the text don\u2019t adhere to the official style guide which prescribes the use of authors\u2019 last names and year.\n\nOverall, the software package seems to provide nice functionality with integration into a currently popular machine learning framework, but it\u2019s novelty compared to existing software packages is limited.

The paper proposes a Python package for optimization and applications on Riemannian manifolds.  \n\nComments: \n\nC1.\nThe main concern of the package is on novelty. That there exist other packages, e.g., Pymanopt [1], Manopt [2], ROPTLIB [3], which do a similar job as Geomstats. It is hard to understand from the paper on what is the key contribution of the present package. The paper does try to highlight the differences between the Goemstats package and others by emphasizing the lack of \u201cchoice of other metrics and high computational costs of\u201d others. This is, however, not shown in the paper as to how Geomstats is better in terms of computational complexity. On the choice of the metrics too, it should be noted that all the new geometries of the manifolds (for different metrics) can be easily added to the toolboxes [1,2,3]. Those toolboxes are modular and come with a lot of solvers and have already been used in many large-scale applications.\n\nHaving said that, one key strength of the Geomstats package is that it can be used in a deep learning framework in a relatively straightforward manner. This is mentioned in the paper but is not properly emphasized. However, here also, the paper does not say what algorithms can be used as part of Geomstats (except the stochastic gradient descent optimizer). \n\nOverall, I got the impression that the proposed package positions itself as a package of Riemannian manifolds (and all of the differential geometric notions). If that is so, then this is problematic. Pymanopt and others already do that fairly well, and consequently, the justification for a new package on that basis is difficult.  \n\n[1] https://pymanopt.github.io/\n[2] https://www.manopt.org/\n[3] https://www.math.fsu.edu/~whuang2/Indices/index_ROPTLIB.html\n\n\nC2.\nThe citations are not properly rendered. It is hard to distinguish between the equations in the paper and the references in the paper.\n\nC3.\nInstead of multiple use cases in the paper, could the paper focus one particular use case to show the important functionalities of Geomstats?

In comparison to previous packages such as manopt and pymanopt, the paper claims that the proposed software provide more efficient implementations, and is integrated with deep learning backends. Several potential applications settings for the software are explored, introducing some performance gains on specific problems when one resorts to the geometry of the space. An example setting for deep learning on SE(3) is also presented.\n\nStrengths: The use of such a toolbox could be a significant step to leveraging geometric models in deep learning.\n\nWeakness: \n\n1. The paper is written as more of a software document than a scientific paper. Several well-known manifolds are presented in the setting of Geomstats, however what is lacking is a treatment of some of the internals of how backpropagation can be implemented effectively for such a toolbox. For example, many of the Riemannian geometric algorithms need to resort to numerical algorithms such as SVD and such; how effective or feasible is automatic differentiation in dealing with such cases? \n\n2. The paper discusses computational advantages in the introduction -- however such advantages are not quantitatively analyzed across different platforms or prior softwares. \n\nOverall, it is not clear why this work needs to be treated as a scientific paper? It appears to be more of a tutorial on the use of the proposed software.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper785/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Geomstats: a Python Package for Riemannian Geometry in Machine Learning", "abstract": "We introduce geomstats, a Python package for Riemannian modelization and optimization over manifolds such as hyperspheres, hyperbolic spaces, SPD matrices or Lie groups of transformations.
