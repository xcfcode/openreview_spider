The task of generating natural language answers is new as far as I know. This paper addressed this task using an end-to-end neural network with trainable question interpreter, knowledge base enquirer, and answer decoder. The question interpreter and the knowledge base enquirer can be found in previous work. But it is somewhat novel to propose the answer decoder that can generate both KB words (i.e. words represent factors retrieved from a knowledge base) and common words (i.e. words used to connect KB words to form a natural language answer). The paper also validated the effectiveness of training all the three components in an end-to-end way.\n\nI am curious about the choice of K_Q for the knowledge base enquirer. How long does it take to train a model? It seems that it might be slow especially when K_Q is large.

More specifically, the model is built on the encoder-decoder framework for sequence-to-sequence learning, while equipped with the ability to access an embedded knowledge-base through an attention-like mechanism. The model is trained on a corpus of question-answer pairs, with their associated triples in the given knowledge-base. Empirical study shows the proposed model can effectively deal with the language variation of the question and generate a right answer by referring to the facts in the knowledge-base. The experiment on question answering demonstrates that the proposed model can outperform the embedding-based QA model as well as the neural dialogue models trained on the same data.", "pdf": "/pdf/OM0vWYM7Eup57ZJjtNql.pdf", "paperhash": "yin|neural_generative_question_answering", "conflicts": ["huawei.com", "pku.edu.cn"], "authors": ["Jun Yin", "Xin Jiang", "Zhengdong Lu", "Lifeng Shang", "Hang Li", "Xiaoming Li"], "authorids": ["jun.yin@pku.edu.cn", "jiang.xin@huawei.com", "lu.zhengdong@huawei.com", "shang.lifeng@huawei.com", "hangli.hl@huawei.com", "lxm@pku.edu.cn"]}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 6, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "tmdate": null, "cdate": 1454464564200, "ddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "duedate": 1455833700000, "tcdate": 1454464564200, "id": "ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/-/submission", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"pdf": null, "forum": null, "replyto": null, "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*", "description": "Your displayed identity associated with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"pdf": {"order": 4, "description": "Either upload a PDF file or provide a direct link to your PDF on ArXiv.", "value-regex": "upload|http://arxiv.org/pdf/.+"}, "title": {"order": 3, "description": "Title of paper.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "abstract": {"order": 4, "description": "Abstract of paper.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}, "authors": {"order": 1, "description": "Comma separated list of author names, as they appear in the paper.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "author_emails": {"order": 2, "description": "Comma separated list of author email addresses, in the same order as above.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "conflicts": {"order": 100, "description": "Semi-colon separated list of email domains of people who would have a conflict of interest in reviewing this paper, (e.g., cs.umass.edu;google.com, etc.).", "value-regex": "^([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))+(;[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))*$"}, "CMT_id": {"order": 5, "value-regex": ".*", "description": "If the paper is a resubmission from the ICLR 2016 Conference Track, enter its CMT ID; otherwise, leave blank."}}}, "invitees": [], "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "expdate": 1463609700000}}}], "count": 7}
