We indeed refer to the Dual-0 column in Table 3.\n\n[Reply to #3]\nAgreed. We will add the same sets of results for both experimental settings, making sure that we are using the same setup for both.\n\n[Reply to #4 and #5]\nThe reinforcement learning training hits a peak quite fast and after spending some time at this performance level, it deteriorates. That is why we are analyzing how to stabilize the RL training process so we can leverage more monolingual data and potentially improve peak performance. We are happy to add (in the appendix) a learning curve to show how the RL learning progresses. Is this the quantitative result you're looking for?\n\n[Reply to #6]\nWe apologize for the confusion. We refer to the first bullet point of the reply, as we found that our latest results (26.36 and 26.04 BLEU for WMT14 en -> fr and fr -> en) exceed those obtained with Transformers from Lample et al.

Specially, a multilingual model is first trained following (Johnson et al 2016) and then the dual learning (He et al 2016) is applied to the pre-trained model using monolingual data only. Experiments on MultiUN and WMT are carried out to verify the proposed algorithm. \n\n[Details]\n1.\tThe idea is incremental and the novelty is limited. It is a simple combination of dual learning and multilingual NMT. \n\n2.\tMany important multilingual baselines are missing. [ref1, ref2]. At least one of the related methods should be implemented for comparison.\n\n3.\tThe Pseudo NMT in Table 3 should also be implemented as a baseline for MultiUN experiments for in-domain verification.\n\n4.\tA recent paper [ref3] proves that using more monolingual data will be helpful for NMT training. What if using more monolingual data in your system? I think using $1M$ monolingual data is far from enough.\n\n5.\tWhat if using more bilingual sentence pairs? Will the results be boosted? What if we use more language pairs?\n\n6.\tTransformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) is the state-of-the-art NMT system. At least one of the tasks should be implemented using the strong baseline.\n\n[Pros] (+) A first attempt of dual learning and multiple languages; (+) Easy to follow.\n[Cons] (-) Limited novelty; (-) Experiments are not enough.\n\nReferences\n[ref1] Firat, Orhan, et al. \"Zero-resource translation with multi-lingual neural machine translation.\" EMNLP (2016).\n[ref2] Ren, Shuo, et al. \"Triangular Architecture for Rare Language Translation.\" ACL (2018).\n[ref3] Edunov, Sergey, et al. \"Understanding back-translation at scale.\"EMNLP (2018). \n\nI am open to be convinced.\n\n==== Post Rebuttal ===\nThanks the authors for the response.

We'd argue that our approach is unsupervised in the sense that we are training a model without data for the task we are training. From a practical perspective, having parallel data for another language pair is not always possible, as is, to a lesser extent, having monolingual data. We do agree that we should stress that our approach is zero-shot to avoid confusion with unsupervised learning.\n\n2. We do not pretrain the embeddings on their own; they are trained with the rest of the baseline multilingual model. That is, the zero-shot training (before RL) performs the embedding pre-training as the initialization step. This step initializes not only the embeddings but also the weights of the translation model, which could be considered a stronger variant of the unsupervised lexicon induction via word vectors. Apart from the initialization, our approach also leverages language models and back-translation to learn the zero-shot translation directions in the form of rewards.\n\n3. We use the bilingually aligned data for each language pair. They are approximately of size 18M, 25M and 22M for en-es, en-fr and es-fr, respectively. Each of the development and test sets contain 4000 sentences.\n\n4. It is indeed high. We did not tune the hyperparameters of the language model (we use the default ones for the big model in the Tensorflow RNN tutorial) since the weight that we currently use for its reward (the one presented in He et al.) is so low (0.005). However, we plan to analyze its role and we will then need to analyze all hyperparameters more in depth to obtain a better performance.\n\n5. For a single direction model with the same capacity, es->fr and fr->es achieve 42.50 and 44.86 respectively. These models were trained on the same 1M sentences used for RL (also using their corresponding translations). As for the pivoting experiments on the UN setup, we do not have the exact numbers but they were slightly below the Dual-0 performance.\n\n6. All the years that include Spanish: 2007-2013.\n\n7. The NewsCrawl is monolingual and thus, we cannot train a supervised NMT system on it. We did not use the News Commentary corpus, which, while more 'newsy', still differs in style. The Pseudo-NMT is the closest scenario to supervised in-domain training for this setting and we do report these numbers.\n\n8.

It is actually unfair to compare with the completely unsupervised NMT, because the existence of the pivot language can enrich the information between two zero-resource languages. The general unsupervised NMT is often considered as ill-posed problem. However, with parallel corpus, the uncertainty of two language alignment is greatly reduced, making it less ill-posed.

The proposed method is essentially to bootstrap a Dual Learning process using a multilingual translation model that already has some degree of zero-shot translation capabilities. The idea is simple, but the approach improves the zero-shot translation performance of the baseline model, and seems to be better than either pivoting or training on direct but out-of-domain parallel data.\n- The paper is mostly well written and easy to follow. There are some missing details that I've listed below.\n\nCons:\n- There is very little comparison to related work. For example, related work by Chen et al. [1], Gu et al. [2] and Lu et al. [3] are not cited nor compared against.\n\nMisc questions/comments:\n- In a few places you call your approach unsupervised (e.g., in Section 3: \"Our method for unsupervised machine translation works as follows: (...)\"; Section 5.2 is named \"Unsupervised Performance\"). But your method is not unsupervised in the traditional sense, since you require lots of parallel data for the target languages, just not necessarily directly between the pair. This may be unrealistic in low-resource settings if there is not an existing suitable pivot language. It'd be more accurate to simply say \"zero-shot\" (or maybe \"semi-supervised\") in Section 3 and Section 5.2.\n- In Section 3.1 you say that your process implements the three principles outlined in Lample et al. (2018b). However, the Initialization principle in that work refers to initializing the embeddings -- do you pretrain the word embeddings as well?\n- In Section 4 you say that the \"UN corpus is of sufficient size\". Please mention what the size is.\n- In Section 4.2, you mention that you set dropout to p=0.65 when training your language model -- this is very high! Did you tune this? Does your language model overfit very badly with lower dropout values?\n- In Section 5.2, what is the BLEU of an NMT system trained on the es->fr data (i.e., what is the upper bound)? What is the performance of a pivoting model?\n- In Section 5.3, you say you use \"WMT News Crawl, all years.\" Please indicate which years explicitly.\n- In Table 3, what is the performance of a supervised NMT system trained on 1M en-fr sentences of the NC data? Knowing that would help clarify the impact of the domain mismatch.\n- minor comment: in Section 4.3 you say that you trained on Tesla-P100, but do you mean Pascal P100 or Tesla V100?\n\n[1] Chen et al.: http://aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1176\n[2] Gu et al.: http://aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1032\n[3] Lu et al.: http://www.statmt.org/wmt18/pdf/WMT009.pdf", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper918/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Zero-shot Dual Machine Translation", "abstract": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems rely on large amounts of parallel data.This is a major challenge for low-resource languages.
