The idea that a DNN 'is free to have any output' for an unseen example is also false, because DNNs have limited capacity.  I think these claims need to be rethought, not rephrased. I'm familiar with the lines of work that you mention, but I don't consider them conclusive evidence against DNNs being able to generalize appropriately, when given sufficient (and sufficiently diverse) data.\"\n\n\nA1) \n\n- We understand the concern and have changed \u201cundefined\u201d to \u201cunderspecified\u201d, which is a technical term that should clarify the reviewer\u2019s concern. \n- Our argument is not controversial. It is the same argument made in domain adaptation (covariate shift adaptation, to be more exact) (Ben-David et al., 2006; Ben-David et al., 2010; Glorot et al., 2011; Long et al., 2015). We also give specific examples related to symmetries. The difference between covariate shift adaptation and environment-invariant work (as described in our Related Work) is that covariate shift adaptation is a data-driven approach, not a structural causal one (hence, it needs the shifted test data $X^\\\\text{(te)}$ for the adaptation). Zero-shot learning is similar to covariate shift adaptation, but through an observable proxy variable.\n- It would be controversial, however, if we equated counterfactual learning with domain adaptation and zero-shot learning, since these approaches rely on data and adapt to a specific covariate shift. Hence, we tried to avoid the parallel. Counterfactual models do not need test data because the potential shift is described in the structural causal equations, such that the resulting counterfactual model would adapt to any such potential shift.\n\nReferences:\n\n- Ben-David, Shai, John Blitzer, Koby Crammer, and Fernando Pereira. \"Analysis of representations for domain adaptation.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 19 (2006): 137-144.\n- Ben-David, Shai, John Blitzer, Koby Crammer, Alex Kulesza, Fernando Pereira, and Jennifer Wortman Vaughan. \"A theory of learning from different domains.\" Machine learning 79, no. 1-2 (2010): 151-175.\n- Glorot, Xavier, Antoine Bordes, and Yoshua Bengio. \"Domain adaptation for large-scale sentiment classification: A deep learning approach.\" In ICML. 2011. \n- Long, Mingsheng, Yue Cao, Jianmin Wang, and Michael Jordan. \"Learning transferable features with deep adaptation networks.\" In International conference on machine learning, pp. 97-105.

You said: \"For us, the causal model must describe the group transformations that can affect the data.\" This seems like another way of saying what I said: that the designer must specify possible invariances. I think my framing is more general.  After all, you can apply this technique when the groups are unknown using a best guess.  I'd like to see experiments of that nature, or at least experiments that show how the method performs when the possible invariances specified by the designer are not well-matched to the actual invariances in the data. Having the set of possible invariances be known a priori seems like a strong assumption, which could easily be violated. Do you agree? If not, why not? Note that my question is about the general applicability of this method, not about specific types of data, such as images, or sequences of tokens.\"\n\nA2) **\u201cDo you agree? If not, why not?\u201d** We will politely disagree, because something in this case is better than nothing.\nFirst, we clarify that the transformations need not be present in the training data. Then, if the set of possible transformations specified by the designer only contains a subset of the transformations that are seen during test time, using our method is still better than not using it, since it will extrapolate at least to a subset of the test examples that use the transformations given in the causal model. Clearly, the examples with transformations that are never known to the method and applied during test time will be missed (it is unclear to us how one could adapt to something that it has never seen in the training data and was never described to the model). \n\nWe can add experiments with missing transformations in a group if the reviewer feels these are necessary, but they will essentially show what we are describing above.

We believe the reviewer gave an unintended interpretation of our claims, arguing we overstated our contributions.

These claims (i) and (ii) need to be stated explicitly, and with appropriate modesty. After all, both (i) and (ii) seem contentious.\u201c\n\nA1. It is unfair to say we \u201coverstate the contributions or created strawman arguments\u201d, when it all looks like an unintended interpretation. \n\nWhen we say \u201cThis unseen-is-forbidden learning hypothesis is currently preventing neural networks from assuming symmetric extrapolations without evidence\u201d we want to convey that, if one does not actively teach a DNN the symmetry, there is no guarantee the DNN will simply spontaneously learn it (in our experiments, they do not. We never found one example where the DNN was able without being forced to). Right above, we write \u201cthe prediction $P(Y^\\\\text{(te)}=C|X^\\\\text{(te)} = (B,A))$ is undefined, since $P(X^\\\\text{(tr)} = (B,A)) = 0$.\u201d That means, the DNN is free to have any output for $(B,A)$, since the optimization is not pushing any specific outcome for the output of $(B,A)$. There is nothing contentious. We will change the language to be more clear.\n\nRegarding extrapolations, there is growing evidence that DNNs have extrapolation shortcomings, such as \u201cspurious correlations\u201d and \u201cshortcut learning\u201d (see Arjovsky et al. (2019), de Haan et al. (2019) , Geirhos et al. (2020),McCoy et al. (2019), and Sch\u00f6lkopf (2019) among many other works (see updated paper)). This week, a wide-scale study at Google (D\u2019Amour et al. (2020)) concludes \u201cthat structural failure modes [of DNNs], [... are] a misalignment between the predictor learned by empirical risk minimization and the causal structure of the desired predictor (Sch\u00f6lkopf, 2019; Arjovsky et al., 2019), [...] being a key failure mode for machine learning models [in deployment].\u201d Underspecification Presents Challenges for Credibility in Modern Machine Learning, https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03395. Currently, the highest-score paper at ICLR https://openreview.net/forum?id=UH-cmocLJC is a paper about extrapolations in graph neural networks. Clearly, not everybody in the community believes these are issues, and certainly not an issue in all applications. But there is mounting evidence that extrapolation is one of the biggest challenges ahead. We believe our work is an important contribution in understanding how we can include causal structure in DNNs. \n\nWe do not claim to have the \u201conly correct way to extrapolate\u201d. In fact, there is really no \u201ccorrect way to extrapolate\u201d, since extrapolations are tied to a causal model. Different causal models will give different ways to extrapolate. Rather, we show a clear case of single-environment extrapolations tied to group transformations, the first of its kind.\n\nOur experimental setting is not \u201cdesigned to work with our method\u201d, rather, it is designed to validate the theory and method, since a method that cannot perform our task will clearly fail and one that can clearly succeeds.\n\n\n\nQ2) \"The framing is the model discovers invariances by itself without any data!\" \n\nA2.

When we say \"Any invariance to transformation groups is mandatory even without evidence, unless the learner deems it inconsistent with the training data.\" we mean \u201cAny invariance to (known) transformation groups is mandatory\u2026\u201d. In causality, there is provably no way to infer counterfactuals without a clear causal model (Pearl 2009). For us, the causal model must describe the group transformations that can affect the data. We have clarified this to avoid incorrect interpretations. \n\nWe like the reviewer\u2019s proposed sentence \"instead of enforcing a set of invariances, we propose a set of *possible* invariances, and assume that any input transformations that are not observed to affect the label should be enforced\", but the challenge is the potential *incorrect* interpretation \u201cthat the user must propose all overgroup invariances\u201d, which is not required.

I believe the following questions should be answered in the main text: Why are these results interesting?\"\n\nA6) \n- Single-environment extrapolation is a significant step towards bringing counterfactual learning to representation learning.\n- Theorems 1 & 2 are extremely important, showing that counterfactual extrapolations are not the same as G-invariant representations.\n- Existing works on G-invariances consider only a couple of linear automorphism groups with hand-selected bases (since it is difficult to hand-design bases for multiple groups). We show how to automatically create bases for all overgroups of a set of groups. \n\n\nQ7) \"What role do they play in your work? Not addressing these questions is an example of what I mean by 'insufficient context'\".\n\nA7) Lemma 1 and 2 allow us to construct neural networks strictly adhering to a given transformation group. Paragraph after Lemma 2 in the paper clarifies this: \n\n\u201cThe above property of the Reynolds operator can be leveraged to build neural networks that adhere to particular group symmetries, as done by Yarotsky (2018) and van der Pol et al. (2020). If we knew $\\\\mathcal{G}\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$, restricting the parameters of each neuron to the left 1-eigenspace of the Reynolds operator of $\\\\mathcal{G}\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$ would give us a way to build a $\\\\mathcal{G}\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$-invariant neural network.\u201d \n\nHowever, we do not know $\\\\mathcal{G}\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$. Thus, with the help of the eigenspaces found in Lemma 2, the role of Theorem 3 is to construct subspaces with different invariances (i.e., for all $M \\\\subseteq \\\\{1,\\\\ldots,m\\\\}$) partially ordered by their invariance strength. Paragraph before Theorem 3 in the paper clarifies this:\n\n\u201cAlas, we do not know $\\\\mathcal{I}$, and consequently we do not know $\\\\mathcal{G}\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$. Instead, we want to construct bases for the complete space such that they are partially ordered by their invariance strength: From most invariant bases to least. In other words, we construct bases for subspaces $\\\\mathcal{B}\\_M$ for $M \\\\subseteq \\\\{1,\\\\ldots,m\\\\}$ such that any weight vector $\\\\mathbf{w} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B}\\_M$ is **(a)** invariant to the groups $\\mathcal{G}_i$ for $i\\in M$, and **(b)** not invariant to any group $j \\\\in \\\\{1,\\\\ldots,m\\\\}\\\\setminus M$. \n\nLater, we will use this partial order to define a regularization term for our method.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nQ8) \"The construction is still unclear to me, and the updates didn't help me much. Equation 10 looks like the standard equation for computing the activation of a neuron, except that it constructs the weight using this sum over B elements. So it seems like this method might require a factor of B more parameters than a standard neural network, and I am not sure why you say: \"The number of parameters of the new neuron is the same as the old neuron\". Can you provide a clear, simple, and detailed example of how this construction works?\"\n\nA7) Let the input $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. Since the subspaces found in Theorem 3 are all orthogonal to each other, there are only 3 basis vectors for the space $\\text{vec}(\\mathcal{X}) = \\mathbb{R}^3$. For our neuron, there is one parameter for each of these basis vectors and a bias parameter, thus a total of 4 parameters. In a standard neuron, there are 4 parameters as well. \n\n**In Appendix C, we have provided a detailed step-by-step example describing the construction of the neuron. We also visualize the subspaces of Theorem 3 for the same example in Figure 5.**  \n\n\n\nQ9) \"Regarding the caption for the new Figure 1: you make it sound like only P(X) changes, but can't P(Y|X) change as well?\"\n\nA9) Our framework follows the independent casual mechanism principle (Sch\u00f6lkopf et al., 2012, Peters et al., 2017, Sch\u00f6lkopf, 2019): a mechanism describing a variable given its causes is independent of all other mechanisms describing other variables. \n\nIn our context, the mechanism to generate the data changes from $X^\\\\text{(obs)} | X^\\\\text{(hid)}$ to $X^\\\\text{(cf)} | X^\\\\text{(hid)}$.

We have provided an example of coupling before Definition 1 (Counterfactual coupling) and reworded the definition to improve clarity. The paragraph added after Definition 2 clearly describes the train and the test data.\n\n\n\nEvery result in Section 4 is presented along with the role it plays (in initial submission as well), for instance:\n\n- Before Theorem 1: \u201cTheorem 1 below shows that CG-invariances (Definition 2) are stronger than G-invariances. After that, Theorem 2 defines conditions under which G-invariances suffice as CG-invariances.\u201d\n- After Lemma 2: \"The above property of the Reynolds operator can be leveraged to build neural networks that adhere to particular group symmetries, as done by Yarotsky (2018) and van der Pol et al. (2020). If we knew $\\mathcal{G}_\\mathcal{I}$, restricting the parameters of each neuron to the left 1-eigenspace of the Reynolds operator of $\\mathcal{G}_\\mathcal{I}$ would give us a way to build a $\\mathcal{G}_\\mathcal{I}$-invariant neural network.\u201d\n- Before Theorem 3: \u201cAlas, we do not know $\\mathcal{I}$, and consequently we do not know $\\mathcal{G}_I$. Instead, we want to construct bases for the complete space such that they are partially ordered by their invariance strength: From most invariant bases to least.\u201d\n\nWe present a pseudocode for Theorem 3 in Appendix D. We have now added a detailed step-by-step example showing the construction of a CG-invariant neuron in Appendix C.  It also includes visualization of the subspaces found by Theorem 3 for the same example (Figure 5).\n\nBelow Equation (12), we have also clarified the intuitions behind the regularization penalty and show an example computation of the penalty in Figure 8 (Appendix F).\n\nFinally, we have updated Section 6 with a running example to clarify the experimental details. Due to space constraints, complete details of the experiments have been deferred to Appendix G. \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2315/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2315/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Networks for Learning Counterfactual G-Invariances from Single Environments", "authorids": ["~S_Chandra_Mouli1", "~Bruno_Ribeiro1"], "authors": ["S Chandra Mouli", "Bruno Ribeiro"], "keywords": ["Extrapolation", "G-invariance regularization", "Counterfactual inference", "Invariant subspaces"], "abstract": "Despite \u2014or maybe because of\u2014 their astonishing capacity to fit data, neural networks are believed to have difficulties extrapolating beyond training data distribution.

Specifically, because the training data may not contain any transformations from the groups that we may need to be invariant to.

Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf\u2019s work (and co-authors) has a number of examples in these two categories (we cite the ones most relevant to our task), including (Locatello et al., 2019) which uses causality describe the shortcomings of disentanglement methods (After observing x, we can construct infinitely many generative models which have the same marginal distribution of x), and one assuming group invariances in the causal model (Besserve et al., 2018).

I'm familiar with the lines of work that you mention, but I don't consider them conclusive evidence against DNNs being able to generalize appropriately, when given sufficient (and sufficiently diverse) data.  \nOf course, there can be generalization issues related to causality.  You said: \"For us, the causal model must describe the group transformations that can affect the data.\"  This seems like another way of saying what I said: that the designer must specify possible invariances.  I think my framing is more general. \u00a0After all, you can apply this technique when the groups are unknown using a best guess. \u00a0I'd like to see experiments of that nature, or at least experiments that show how the method performs when the possible invariances specified by the designer are not well-matched to the actual invariances in the data.  Having the set of possible invariances be known *a priori* seems like a strong assumption, which could easily be violated.  **Do you agree?  If not, why not?**  Note that my question is about the general applicability of this method, not about specific types of data, such as images, or sequences of tokens.  \n\nCan you please:\n* Explain and justify the causal assumptions you make? \n* Explain how you use them to derive which group transformations can affect the data?\n* Discuss the significance of these assumptions and derivations as contributions?\n\n3) I'm not satisfied with the updates.  I believe the following questions should be answered in the main text:\n* Why are these results interesting?\n* What role do they play in your work?  \nNot addressing these questions is an example of what I mean by \"insufficient context\".\n\n5) The construction is still unclear to me, and the updates didn't help me much.\nEquation 10 looks like the standard equation for computing the activation of a neuron, except that it constructs the weight using this sum over $B$ elements.  So it seems like this method might require a factor of $B$ more parameters than a standard neural network, and I am not sure why you say: \"The number of parameters of the new neuron is the same as the old neuron\".  Can you provide a clear, simple, and detailed example of how this construction works?  \n\n\n\n\nRegarding the caption for the new Figure 1: you make it sound like only P(X) changes, but can't P(Y|X) change as well?

Experiments on MNIST and toy sequence data are used to verify that this training method leads to improved extrapolation of predictions to unseen environments.\n\nStrengths:\nThe method introduced seems promising, as it doesn't require training data to exhibit symmetry, but can still verify (or reject) the invariance of data with respect to a collection of candidate symmetry groups. The training method also seems quite lightweight, and shouldn't require significant additional resources to check for the presence or absence of symmetry.\n\nAlthough the experiments are a bit limited, the authors include a detailed experiments section in the appendix with a larger selection of baselines and more information about choosing the magnitude of the applied CG-regularization.\n\nCritiques:\nThe explanation of the results has a lot of room for improvement, and I would recommend the authors revise the writing to follow standard best practices, such as defining/explaining new variables when they are introduced, giving the steps associated with novel algorithms, etc. I give a few specific examples below where this lack of clarity makes the authors' results hard to understand, but there are many other examples of this not listed.\n\nThe description of the underlying causal model in section 3 (from the end of page 3 to the start of page 5) is hard to follow owing to a lack of explanation in many places. For example, the overgroups $G_D$ and $G_I$ are introduced without any insight into the distinction between these groups, or what role they play in the context of extrapolation tasks. \n\nSimilarly, the central concept of CG-invariance lacks some crucial details in its definition (Def 2), making the following material harder to follow. In particular, it isn't stated if CG-invariance is defined relative to a specific $\\tilde{U}_I$, or else requires Eq. 6 to hold for any choice of $\\tilde{U}_I$ (the latent distribution which determines the counterfactual samples $X^{cf}$).\n\nTheorem 3 is difficult to make sense of, with the subspaces $B_M$ appearing at first glance to be circularly defined (the projection in Eq. 9 used to define the $B_M$ is itself defined in terms of these subspaces). The text below and above Theorem 3 helps to interpret this circularity as an inductive algorithm for calculating these subspaces, but it would have been much clearer to define this algorithm explicitly in terms of pseudocode (along with a runtime), and then reference this definition in Theorem 3.\n\nRecommendation:\nAlthough the techniques seem like a timely and useful contribution, the poor presentation makes these techniques difficult to follow, and limits the usefulness of the paper for readers. I'm recommending a weak accept, but this can be improved by clarifying the presentation and making the results easier for readers to understand.\n\n\n**UPDATE AFTER THE REBUTTAL:** The new material in the paper clarifies things quite a bit, especially the intuitive explanations appearing below Equation 2 and at the bottom of page 4.

I think the ideas in this paper are quite interesting - for this reason I continue to recommend acceptance.\n\nSummary: This paper describes an approach to embedded invariances in learned neural networks through defining linear automorphism groups. They define a fair amount of theoretical machinery for this task, proposing a model of image generation which includes a number of transformations from these defined groups, and defining the notion of a counterfactual G-invariance for the task. They discuss a method for practically learning a useful invariance even if that exact invariance you wish to have is unknown, by ordering subspaces which may be invariant, and discusses the practicalities of embedding these into neural architectures. Some experiments are described in an MNIST setting and on simulated experiments, showing success at embedding these invariances in toy-ish settings.\n\nRecommendation: I\u2019m recommending acceptance for the paper, since the ideas seem interesting, there appears to  be theoretical contribution and empirical evidence, and it is obviously written with care. My hesitance comes on two fronts: I may be lacking some background in the relevant group theory/invariance literature, and it is hard for me to understand a number of important ideas due to the information density in the writing (a result of ICLR restrictions but also some fault of the authors).\n\nStrong points:\n-\tThe paper is very detailed and interesting \u2013 while I am not particularly familiar with the group theory side of the literature, it seems like a good idea from a robustness perspective and the authors lay out their ideas carefully\n-\tThe notion of assuming an invariance unless contradicted is interesting at a high level, and provides some meat to the oft-discussed notion of \u201cextrapolation from a single environment\u201d\n-\tI appreciate the bridge made from the theory to the practical implementation\n-\tThe experiments mostly back up the point the authors assert in their theory \u2013 larger experiments for a mostly theoretical paper like this are not necessarily required \n\nWeak points:\n-\tMy sense is the authors are having a lot of trouble fitting their ideas into the 8 pages. I sympathize but I also think they can do better on this front \u2013 the first two pages can be much more compact, with more space to explicate complex ideas that get swept over quickly\n-\tIdeas which do not receive enough attention or explanation (but should) include: Eq 2, Theorem 3, the design of neural network weights, and even the bare minimum of experimental details. I know the format is short but some of this stuff is necessary, and I believe the authors can do better in terms of fitting important information in. As it is I am confused about some central ideas, even after checking the appendix\n-\tThe notion of \u201cforbidding examples in the learner\u2019s statistical model\u201d carries some intuitive weight but is not precise \u2013 what is this model for a discriminative classifier? This can be more clearly explicated\n-\tIt\u2019s not clear how much is packed in the \u201ceconomical data generation\u201d assumption, or how that is really connected to the method. Please be more clear.\n-\tThe definition of $T_{{U_D, U_I}}$ is not really clear \u2013 need another sentence on this indexing in the main body, as well as discussion of ordering!\n-\tDef 1: you don\u2019t actually define what it means for 2 variables to be counterfactually coupled, you just show what a counterfactual coupling is. Please reword this definition.\n-\tThm 3 \u2013 this is incredibly dense and I have a lot of trouble parsing this. I\u2019m not sure how to interpret the direct sum \u2013 you\u2019re combining all the subspaces which are supersets of M? Also not sure about the end \u2013 this is not G_j -invariant for j \\in M-bar. What is M-bar? Is that a Reynolds operator? Then what does it mean for j to be an element of it?\n-\tHow should I pick my groups G_1 \u2026 m? Not clear if this is important\n-\tBottom of p6: not clear how these neuron weights are specified \u2013 does it matter which layer we are in? what does the product of B_m \\omega_M,h mean \u2013 it looks like a subspace times a real number\n-\tSec 5: I really am confused about the relationship between architecture and which invariances can be realizable. There\u2019s not a lot of explanation on this.\n-\tSec 6: it\u2019s very hard to interpret anything in this section without the appendix \u2013 work more to make it stand alone\n-\tProof of Thm 1: maybe I am missing some group theory background but I don\u2019t understand this. For instance, there is no explanation of why this $\\tilde{U}_I$ can always be found to couple X^cf with X^obs.\n-\tProof of Lemma 1: Again, may be missing some background. But neither x nor $\\bar{T}$ is mentioned in this proof, so I don\u2019t know where it is going \u2013 please be more verbose.\n\nClarifications:\n-\tMiddle of p3 \u2013 we can \u201ccompose rotations and image flips\u201d \u2013 do you mean a union of the two sets of transformations? That\u2019s what is shown in the notation but I may be missing some group theory background here\n-\tTop of p4: not clear how $G_D \\cap G_I \\neq 0$ is possible \u2013 is the idea that $G_i \\cap G_j$ might be nonempty?\n-\tBelow Eq 3: \u201cthe training data may contaion on a few samples of the variable\u201d \u2013 do you mean only a few values of the variable may be observed?\n-\tBelow Eq 3: you use the term environment without defining it, not sure how to interpret it in this context\n-\tBelow Eq 7: should the samples of $\\hat{Y}  \\ X^{(obs)}$ be Y instead?\n-\tBelow Eq 7: in (i) you say you don\u2019t know the group \u2013 do you mean for which group Y should be considered invariant? If so, state that explicitly\n-\tIt\u2019s not clear how the statistical assumption at the end of Sec 3 really fits in with the argument, if you\u2019re going to use it need more here\n-\tTop of p6 \u2013 you say the eigenspace of the Reynolds operator gives us a way to build an invariant NN, but the Lemma is about a linear operator. Need more description here\n-\tYou say the method in Thm 3 is fast but the power set should grow exponentially \u2013 is that a problem?\n\nOther feedback:\n-\tNot sure why you define g as going to the image of the probability \u2013 can\u2019t it just be [0, 1]?\n-\tNot sure \u201cunseen is forbidden\u201d is quite right \u2013 wouldn\u2019t it be \u201cunseen is irrelevant\u201d or something?\n-\tSpecify whether Thm 1 only applies to linear automorphisms or if it is more general\n-\tThe recursion at the bottom of Sec 4 is unreadable \u2013 just put this in the appendix\n-\tBottom of p17 \u2013 describe more how the transformations are sampled.

We have clarified as follows: If the support of $U\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$ is a singleton set $\\\\{c\\\\}$ for some constant $c$, then $(Y, X^\\\\text{(obs)})$ are said to be sampled using an economical data generation process. In other words, the training data can contain just one value for the variable $U\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$ since the outputs $Y$ do not depend on $U\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$. \n\nQ15) \u201cBelow Eq 3: you use the term environment without defining it, not sure how to interpret it in this context\u201d\n\nA15. In our context, different environments correspond to different supports of $U\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$. The economical data generation process with a singleton support for $U\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$ results in a single environment. For example, if $Y$ is invariant to 90-degree rotations, then the set of upright images form one environment and the set of upside-down images can form another environment.\n\nQ16) \u201cBelow Eq 7: should the samples of $\\\\hat{Y} | X^{(obs)}$ be Y instead?\u201d\n\nA16. This was a typo. We have updated the notation in Section 3: $Y | X^\\\\text{(tr)}$ refers to the distribution in training and $Y | X^\\\\text{(te)}$ refers to the distribution in test. \n\n\n\nQ17) \u201cBelow Eq 7 (new equation number (6)): in (i) you say you don\u2019t know the group \u2013 do you mean for which group Y should be considered invariant?\u201d\n\nA17. Yes, we do not know $\\\\mathcal{I}$ (or $\\\\mathcal{G}\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$), thus we do not know which group $Y$ should be invariant to. \n\n\nQ18) \u201cIt\u2019s not clear how the statistical assumption at the end of Sec 3 really fits in with the argument, if you\u2019re going to use it need more here\u201d\n\nA18. We have clarified below Definition 1 that $\\\\tilde{U}\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$ can have very different support than $U\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$. Since $\\\\tilde{U}\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$, and thus $X^\\\\text{(cf)}$, are not observed, the statistical assumption at the end of Section 3 hinders learning of $\\\\Gamma\\_\\\\text{true}$. We believe that this is clear to the reader in the updated manuscript.\n\n\n\nQ19) \"Top of p6 \u2013 you say the eigenspace of the Reynolds operator gives us a way to build an invariant NN, but the Lemma is about a linear operator.\"\n\nA19. The Lemma describes a single neuron. If the first layer of a neural network is composed of these neurons and thus, is G-invariant, then we can use dense layers and non-linear activations on top of the first layer to obtain a G-invariant neural network.\n\n\nQ20) \u201cYou say the method in Thm 3 is fast but the power set should grow exponentially \u2013 is that a problem?\u201d\n\nA20. Practically, this does not pose a problem for two reasons: **(1)** Theorem 3 will stop after finding $\\\\text{dim}(\\\\text{vec}(\\\\mathcal{X}))$ number of bases (which does not depend on the number of groups), so it need not iterate over the entire power set. However, it is unclear whether the worst-case exponential runtime can actually happen in practice. **(2)** Regardless, for a collection of groups, we would only need to compute the bases once and reuse them for all experiments.\nWe have added this to the paper.\n\n  \n\nOther feedback:\n\nQ21) \"Not sure why you define g as going to the image of the probability \u2013 can\u2019t it just be [0, 1]?\"\n\nA21. $g$ returns a probability measure over the entire space of $Y$. In classification for example, $g$ returns the probabilities for all the classes. \n\n\n\nQ22) \u201cNot sure \u2018unseen is forbidden\u2019 is quite right \u2013 wouldn\u2019t it be \u2018unseen is irrelevant\u2019 or something?\u201d\n\nA22. We have replaced the phrase with \u2018unseen-is-unknown\u2019 to represent the fact that examples not explicitly observed with infinitely many training examples have undefined/unknown outcomes in the learner\u2019s model.\n\n\n\nQ23) \u201cSpecify whether Thm 1 only applies to linear automorphisms or if it is more general\u201d\n\nA23. Theorems 1 & 2 also apply to groups with non-linear automorphisms. However, to be consistent with the rest of the paper, we only discuss linear automorphisms. \n\nQ24) \u201cThe recursion at the bottom of Sec 4 is unreadable \u2013 just put this in the appendix\u201d\n\nA24. We have moved the differentiable approximation of the penalty to the Appendix and updated Section 4 with an intuition for the penalty instead.\n\nQ25) \u201cBottom of p17 \u2013 describe more how the transformations are sampled. I shouldn\u2019t have to work so hard to understand the experiments\u201d\n\nA25. We have updated Appendix F.1 further clarifying how the transformations are sampled to construct the training and test datasets. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2315/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2315/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Networks for Learning Counterfactual G-Invariances from Single Environments", "authorids": ["~S_Chandra_Mouli1", "~Bruno_Ribeiro1"], "authors": ["S Chandra Mouli", "Bruno Ribeiro"], "keywords": ["Extrapolation", "G-invariance regularization", "Counterfactual inference", "Invariant subspaces"], "abstract": "Despite \u2014or maybe because of\u2014 their astonishing capacity to fit data, neural networks are believed to have difficulties extrapolating beyond training data distribution.

I\u2019m not sure how to interpret the direct sum \u2013 you\u2019re combining all the subspaces which are supersets of M? What is M-bar?\u201d\n\nA6. We have updated the text around Theorem 3 to describe the two goals of the Theorem: We wish to construct bases $\\\\mathcal{B}\\_M$ for all $M \\\\subseteq \\\\{1,\\\\ldots,m\\\\}$ such that any weight vector $\\\\mathbf{w} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B}\\_M$ is **(a)** invariant to the groups $\\\\mathcal{G}\\_i$ for $i\\\\in M$, and **(b)** not invariant to any group $j \\\\in \\\\{1,\\\\ldots,m\\\\}\\\\setminus M$}.   \n\n $\\\\mathcal{B}\\_{\\\\supsetneq M}$ is computed as the direct sum of all the subspaces that correspond to the supersets of $M$. The reason is that we wish $\\\\mathcal{B}\\_M$ to be invariant to groups indexed by $M$ but none of the groups outside $M$. Thus, we need to remove from from $\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{B}}\\_M$ all weight vectors that are invariant to more groups in addition to those indexed by $M$ (i.e., supersets of $M$) . $\\\\bar{M}$ denotes the set complement $\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,m\\\\}\\\\setminus M$. Then, the theorem says that any nonzero vector $\\\\mathbf{w} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B}\\_M$ is invariant to all groups in $\\\\mathcal{G}\\_i ~\\\\forall i\\\\in M$ but not invariant to $\\\\mathcal{G}\\_j ~\\\\forall j\\\\in \\\\{1,\\\\ldots,m\\\\}\\\\setminus M$ . We have updated the notation to avoid confusion. \nWe have added these clarifications to the paper and refer the reader to a pseudocode in the Appendix.\n\n\n\nQ7) \u201cHow should I pick my groups G\\_1 \u2026 m? Not clear if this is important\u201d\n\nA7. A practitioner can pick any collection of groups that they wish to be invariant to. Our method will choose invariance to the largest overgroup without harming training accuracy. However, it is important that the overgroup representing the true invariance of the task satisfies Theorem 2, otherwise the method will not extrapolate (as G-invariance does not imply CG-invariance).\n\n\n\nQ8) \u201cBottom of p6: not clear how these neuron weights are specified \u2013 does it matter which layer we are in? what does the product of B\\_m \\\\omega\\_M,h mean \u2013 it looks like a subspace times a real number\u201d\n\nA8. Equation 10 only describes a single CG-invariant layer with $H$ neurons. Different architectures can be built using the neurons defined in Equation 10 for various types of input (architectures for images and sequences are described in Section 5). The parameter $\\\\omega\\_{M\\_i, h} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{d\\_{M\\_i} \\\\times 1}$ is a vector of dimension equal to the dimension of the subspace $\\\\mathcal{B}\\_{M\\_i}$, i.e., there is one scalar weight in $\\\\omega\\_{M\\_i, h}$ for every basis vector of $\\\\mathcal{B}\\_{M\\_i}$. The matrix-vector product $\\\\mathbf{B}\\_{M\\_i} \\\\omega\\_{M\\_i,h}$ simply gives a linear combination of these basis vectors (the basis vectors are the columns of matrix $\\\\mathbf{B}\\_{M\\_i}$). Any such linear combination is in the subspace $\\\\mathcal{B}\\_{M\\_i}$ and is invariant to $\\\\mathcal{G}\\_{M\\_i}$ (Lemma 2). \nWe have clarified this before presenting Equation (10). \n\n\n\nQ9) \u201cSec 5..There\u2019s not a lot of explanation on this.. \u201c\n\nA9.

Join of two groups is the smallest set of transformations that contains the union of the groups and also satisfies the group properties. The join is not simply a union of the two groups: for example, join of $G\\_\\\\text{rot}$ and $G\\_\\\\text{flip}$ will also include transformations such as $T^{(90^\\\\circ)} \\\\circ T\\_\\\\text{horiz-flip}$ which is not present in either of these groups.

First, we have fixed a typo: $G\\_D \\\\cap G\\_I$ always has the identity transformation and is never empty. In general however, $G\\_D \\\\cap G\\_I$ can also have transformations other than the identity, for example when $G\\_i \\\\cap G\\_j$ is nonempty.

We have updated the manuscript adding more details on these ideas. The text below Equation (2) discusses the indexing of $T\\_{U\\_\\\\mathcal{D}, U\\_\\\\mathcal{I}}$. We have updated the text around Theorem 3 to clarify the objectives of the theorem and present a pseudocode in the Appendix. We have added clarifications before the neuron definition in Equation (10) and also clarified the intuitions behind the regularization penalty (Equation 12). In Section 6, we provide a running example to clarify the experimental details. \n\n\n\nQ2) \u201cThe notion of 'forbidding examples in the learner\u2019s statistical model' carries some intuitive weight but is not precise \u2013 what is this model for a discriminative classifier? This can be more clearly explicated\u201d\n\nA2. We have further clarified our meaning in the paper. Our theory gives it a precise mathematical meaning, that we have now emphasized in the updated manuscript. A better description is \u201cunseen-is-unknown\u201d rather than \u201cunseen-is-forbidden\u201d.

Please be more clear.\u201d\n\nA3. We do not need to assume it. The method works without economical data generation. Economical data generation gives an intuition of why one may get only one environment in the training data. We have made the notion more clear in the theory (that the environment $U\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$ in training could be deterministic (a single value in the support) while in test, $\\\\tilde{U}\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$ could have larger support).\n\n\n\n\nQ4) \"The definition of TUD,UI is not really clear \u2013 need another sentence on this indexing in the main body, as well as discussion of ordering!\"\n\nA4. We have added a paragraph describing the indexing in the main text. We interpret $U\\_\\\\mathcal{D}$ and $U\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$ as the random seeds of a random number generator that generate ordered sequences of transformations from $\\\\mathcal{G}\\_\\\\mathcal{D}$ and $\\\\mathcal{G}\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$ respectively. If these ordered sequences are, say, $T^{(1)}\\_\\\\mathcal{D}, \\\\ldots, T^{(a)}\\_\\\\mathcal{D}$ and $T^{(1)}\\_\\\\mathcal{I}, \\\\ldots, T^{(b)}\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$, then $T\\_{U\\_\\\\mathcal{D},U\\_\\\\mathcal{I}}$ is the transformation obtained after interleaving the two sequences of transformations and composing them in order: $T\\_{U\\_\\\\mathcal{D}, U\\_\\\\mathcal{I}} = T^{(1)}\\_\\\\mathcal{I} \\\\circ T^{(1)}\\_\\\\mathcal{D} \\\\circ T^{(2)}\\_\\\\mathcal{I} \\\\circ \\\\ldots$. Note that $T^{(i)}\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$ or $T^{(i)}\\_\\\\mathcal{D}$ could be identity transformations. Appendix B.1 shows that this indexing is surjective, i.e., it can index every transformation in $\\\\mathcal{G}\\_{\\\\mathcal{D}\\\\cup \\\\mathcal{I}}$. \n\n\n\nQ5) \"Def 1: you don\u2019t actually define what it means for 2 variables to be counterfactually coupled, you just show what a counterfactual coupling is.

We have reworded the definition to explicitly describe the coupling of $X^\\\\text{(obs)}$ and $X^\\\\text{(cf)}$.

We have provided additional explanations throughout the paper. We have streamlined Section 3 and added the graph of the SCM (Figure 1). In Section 4, we have updated the text around Theorem 3 to clarify the objectives of the theorem and present a pseudocode in the Appendix. We have also clarified the intuitions behind the regularization penalty (Equation 12) and show an example computation of the penalty in Figure 6 of the Supplementary Material. We have updated Section 5 with more details about the architectures. In Section 6, we provide a running example to clarify the experimental details. \n\n\n\nQ2) \u201cThe description of the underlying causal model in section 3 (from the end of page 3 to the start of page 5) is hard to follow owing to a lack of explanation in many places. For example, the overgroups GD and GI are introduced without any insight into the distinction between these groups, or what role they play in the context of extrapolation tasks.\u201d\n\nA2. We have updated this section making it easier to follow and have included a graph of the structural causal model in Figure 1. We have clarified the role of groups $\\\\mathcal{G}\\_D$ and $\\\\mathcal{G}\\_I$: the target variable is defined as being invariant to the group $\\\\mathcal{G}\\_I$ but dependent on the group $\\\\mathcal{G}\\_D$. \n\n\n\nQ3) \u201cSimilarly, the central concept of CG-invariance lacks some crucial details in its definition (Def 2), making the following material harder to follow. In particular, it isn't stated if CG-invariance is defined relative to a specific U\\~I, or else requires Eq. 6 to hold for any choice of U\\~I (the latent distribution which determines the counterfactual samples Xcf).\u201d\n\nA3. We have updated Definition 1 (Counterfactual coupling) to make it clear that $X^\\\\text{(cf)}$ is obtained by counterfactually replacing $U\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$ by any choice of $\\\\tilde{U}\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$ in the SCM equations. Then Definition 2 (CG-invariant representations) is tied to that choice of $\\\\tilde{U}\\_\\\\mathcal{I}$ from Definition 1. \n\n\n\nQ4) Theorem 3 is difficult to make sense of, with the subspaces BM appearing at first glance to be circularly defined (the projection in Eq. 9 used to define the BM is itself defined in terms of these subspaces). The text below and above Theorem 3 helps to interpret this circularity as an inductive algorithm for calculating these subspaces, but it would have been much clearer to define this algorithm explicitly in terms of pseudocode (along with a runtime), and then reference this definition in Theorem 3.\n\nA4. We have updated the text around Theorem 3 to describe the two goals of the Theorem: We wish to construct bases $\\\\mathcal{B}\\_M$ for all $M \\\\subseteq \\\\{1,\\\\ldots,m\\\\}$ such that any weight vector $\\\\mathbf{w} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B}\\_M$ is **(a)** invariant to the groups $\\\\mathcal{G}\\_i$ for $i\\\\in M$, and **(b)** not invariant to any group $j \\\\in \\\\{1,\\\\ldots,m\\\\}\\\\setminus M$}.   \n$\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{B}}\\_M$ contains all the vectors $\\\\mathbf{w}$ that are invariant to $\\\\mathcal{G}\\_M$ but could also contain vectors that are invariant to some overgroup of $\\\\mathcal{G}\\_M$. Thus, each step of our inductive method performs a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization in order to satisfy condition **(b)** above: we need to remove from $\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{B}}\\_M$ all weight vectors that are invariant to more groups in addition to those indexed by $M$ (i.e., supersets of $M$). We also refer the reader to a pseudocode in Appendix C.

proposes an interesting and potentially quite impactful and valuable idea, which I believe is novel.\nThe idea is: instead of specifying invariances by hand in the architecture of a network, we can instead specify a set of possible invariances, and regularize the model to favor more invariance.\nThe authors describe how to structure and regularize a DNN in this way, and provide proof-of-concept experiments.\nThe experiments show that the proposed method outperforms networks that are fully-invariant or non-invariant when the true data is partially-invariant.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a number of weaknesses which lead me to recommend against acceptance.\u00a0 In no particular order:\n1) The crucial \"unseen is forbidden\" hypothesis is vague and seems to be a bit of a strawman.\u00a0\u00a0\n2)\u00a0The framing of the paper seems to oversell the method in a way that makes the contribution less clear.\u00a0\n3)\u00a0The writing is not very clear.\n4)\u00a0The experiments seem to be only proof-of-concept in scenarios where the method is designed to work.\u00a0\u00a0\n5) The method seems to incur an exponential cost, but this is not discussed.\n\nElaborating:\n1) The authors claim that, because DNN behavior is undefined on unseen datapoints, the \"unseen-is-forbidden learning hypothesis is currently preventing neural networks from assuming symmetric extrapolations without evidence.\"\u00a0 This claim is stated in various forms several times, but never made very precise, and it is crucial in motivating the authors' approach.\u00a0 Roughly, I take the authors to be claiming that (i) the correct way to \"extrapolate\" is to assume that: transformations that were not observed to change the target distribution should be assumed to NOT change the target distribution, (ii) DNNs will not extrapolate in this way by default, and must be explicitly designed to do so.\u00a0\u00a0\nThese claims (or whatever the authors actually mean) need(s) to be stated explicitly, and with appropriate modesty.\u00a0 After all, both (i) and (ii) seem contentious.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe claim about an \"economical data generating process\" supports (i), but is itself somewhat vague and dubious,\u00a0and should be discussed in\u00a0the introduction as motivation for (i).\n\n2) The authors claim that their method can discover invariances without any data supporting them.\u00a0 And their abstract claims: \"Any invariance to transformation groups is mandatory even without evidence, unless the learner deems it inconsistent with the training data.\"\u00a0 But in reality, the authors specify a small number of possible invariances which the method selects among (in a soft way).\u00a0 And the data is used to guide this selection process.\u00a0 So in reality, the designer is in charge of specifying a (restricted) set of (possible) invariances.\u00a0 So like previous works on enforcing invariances, it places a\u00a0 burden on the designer to identify plausible invariances.\u00a0 Overall, I found the framing in the work to be \"the model discovers invariances by itself without any data!\" whereas a more neutral version would be \"instead of enforcing a set of invariances, we propose a set of *possible* invariances, and assume that any input transformations that are not observed to affect the label should be enforced\"\n\n3) Besides the above issues (vagueness of \"unseen-is-forbidden\" and related discussion (1), overselling (2)), there were several other issues of clarity.\u00a0 The paper is not poorly written overall, but is much harder to read and understand than it needs to be.\u00a0 Some specific issues are:\u00a0\n- The results in Section 4 are presented with insufficient context or intuition.\u00a0 Theorems are stated without any proof intuition and should reference proofs in the appendix.\u00a0 The intuition for the penalty arrived at (eqn13) is unclear.\n- The flow is sometimes unclear.\u00a0 For instance, \"Learning CG-invariant representations without knowledge of G_I.\u00a0\" should be a subsection, not a (latex) paragraph, and should explain what the point of the subsection is before diving in.\u00a0 The authors seem to be using (latex) paragraphs (i.e. beginning with bolded phrases) as subsections and paragraphs beginning with italicized phrases as (latex) paragraphs.\u00a0 I suspect the paper was edited to fit into 8 pages without removing sufficient content.\u00a0 This impedes the flow and sacrifices clarity.\n- I think a graph showing the data generating process would be much clearer than the current explanations (e.g. eqn4/5)\u00a0 \u00a0\n-\u00a0it is unclear what equation 7 is saying... the text above makes it seem like a definition of a goal, but the following paragraph treats it as an assertion that the goal is possible to achieve.\u00a0\u00a0\n...Overall, I recommend stripping out some of the mathematical details and using more words and diagrams in the main text to describe the underlying issues/motivations/methods.\nThe overall story should be made clearer (e.g. by addressing (1) and (2)), and more space should be devoted to linking each part of the paper into the overall story.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n4) The experiments are synthetic tasks where the correct invariance group is included in the set of invariances being searched over.\u00a0 I don't think that showing that this method can bring some benefits on a real task is an absolute requirement, given the novelty of the approach.\u00a0 But without more meaningful results, the paper is held to a much higher standard.\u00a0 Even for synthetic experiments, these are rather weak; for instance, it would be interesting to see whether/how the method degrades when we consider much larger sets of possible invariances.\n\n5) It seems like the method might require including a set of parameters for each of the possible 2^m invariances.\u00a0 Is this in fact the case?\u00a0 If not, why not?\u00a0 If so, it should be discussed as a limitation.\u00a0\n\n\n-------------------------------\nSuggestions/Questions:\n- In Section 4 paragraph 1, are G-invariance and G_I-invariance used interchangeably?\u00a0 This was confusing.\n- say what I and D are as soon as they are introduced (top of page 4).\n- Typo: \"a somewhat a\"\n- Why a \"nonpolynomial\" activation function?\n- The definition of \"almost surely\" at the bottom of page 4 is not correct (it is possible to sample probability 0 events), and also it should say that samples of Gamma(X^(obs)/(cf)) (not X^(obs)/(cf)) are equal with probability 1 (these are not the same statement!).\n- \"level of invariance\" and \"non-extrapolated validation accuracy\", and several other phrases are not defined and should probably be replaced by something more clear and explicit.\n- It seems like you might need to assume that that different x^(hid) can't be used to generate the same x^(obs) or x^(cf).\u00a0 If so, this should be explicit.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},

data distribution. This work shows that, for extrapolations based on finite transformation groups, a model\u2019s inability to extrapolate is unrelated to its capacity. Rather, the shortcoming is inherited from a learning hypothesis: Examples not explicitly observed with infinitely many training examples have underspecified outcomes in the learner\u2019s model. In order to endow neural networks with the ability to extrapolate over group transformations, we introduce a learning framework counterfactually-guided by the learning hypothesis that any group invariance to (known) transformation groups is mandatory even without evidence, unless the learner deems it inconsistent with the training data. Unlike existing invariance-driven methods for (counterfactual) extrapolations, this framework allows extrapolations from a single environment. Finally, we introduce sequence and image extrapolation tasks that validate our framework and showcase the shortcomings of traditional approaches.", "one-sentence_summary": "This work introduces a novel learning framework for single-environment extrapolations, where invariance to transformation groups is mandatory even without evidence, unless the learner deems it inconsistent with the training data.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "mouli|neural_networks_for_learning_counterfactual_ginvariances_from_single_environments", "pdf": "/pdf/f68c8dcf4d107a320df0e519d96021379ed46828.pdf", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Poster", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nmouli2021neural,\ntitle={Neural Networks for Learning Counterfactual G-Invariances from Single Environments},\nauthor={S Chandra Mouli and Bruno Ribeiro},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=7t1FcJUWhi3}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
