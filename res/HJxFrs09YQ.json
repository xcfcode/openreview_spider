The introduction of the additional parameter q in Game is for balancing the effect of parameter p when using the information of gradient magnitude for training DNNs.  When a small parameter p is selected, one can consider the option of choosing a large parameter q to make the individual learning rates in a reasonable range. Conceptually speaking, the extension from AMSGrad to Game is similar to the generalization from l2 norm to lp norm. \n\n* In the revision, we have compared five methods:  SGD with moment, Adam, AMSGrad, PAdam, and Game for training three different neural networks over CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, which are VGG-16, ResNet-18, and wide ResNet. It is found that when the (p,q) of Game is set to be (0.25, 4), Game outperforms Adam and AMSGrad for all the three neural networks w.r.t. the validation performance. For the case of VGG-16,  the performance of Game is comparable to that of SGD with moment w.r.t. the validation peformance.  \n\n* Based on the comments of the authors of PAdam, the theoretical analysis is reshaped in the revision to differentiate our contribution from theirs. To briefly summarize, it is found in the current paper that, in principle, the parameter beta_2 can be chosen freely without considering beta_1 while traditional theoretical analysis for AMSGrad and PAdam requires that beta_1 < \\sqrt{beta_2}. We hope our new findings  can bring insights to develop more advanced training methods in the future."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper107/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper107/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper107/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "GENERALIZED ADAPTIVE MOMENT ESTIMATION", "abstract": "Adaptive gradient methods have experienced great success in training deep neural networks (DNNs).

Secondly, a new parameter q is introduced, that replaces the q=2 in the moment estimation phase of (P)Adam.\n\nA regret analysis is proposed in the convex case, while a vanishing bound on the gradient is derived in the non-convex smooth case.\n\nReview\n------\n\nAlthough improving optimization methods is certainly important for the machine learning community, the reviewer have strong concerns about this paper.\n\nFirst of all, the paper is hard to read as it contains too many approximations. What does 'SGD is known to work reasonably well regardless of their problem structure' means ? Same thing for 'Its performance deteriorates when the gradients are dense due to a rapid decay of the learning rates.' The authors uses many times elliptical discourse to detail the course of their analysis, which is non informative: for instance, 'one can easily derive the upper bound expression', and 'It is not difficult to conclude that when G_t [...]'. This level of writing is not professional. Some completely irrelevant argument are proposed to justify the method: 'For instance the extension from l_2 norm to l_p norm and generalization from Cauchy-Schwart to Holder inequality'.\n\nThe reviewer has interrogations about the relevance of the proposed algorithm. The additional parameter q needs to be tuned, which carries only the promise of further overfitting. I would have been convinced by an sequence of experiment where q is set automatically by considering a validation set, and then tested on a left out test set. However, the authors report only the results for the best q, with non significant differences (and not quantified, there is no result tables). Using q=2 at least made sense from the point of view of empirical Fisher matrix approximation.\n\nThe review also have several concerns aout the correctness of the proposed arguments. First, the major argument of memory usage stems from 1) a miscalculation and 2) a misunderstanding of memory bottlenecks in deep learning. 1) adam models keeps in memory x_t (the model parameter), g_t (the model gradient), m_t (momentum) \\hat v_t and v_{t-1} (the monotone and non monotone version of the second order moment estimation. In contrast, the proposed model do not track v_{t-1}: this amounts to a memory saving of 20% considering all model related parameters. 2) more importantly, the most important memory usage in deep leaning comes from the activations that need to be kept in memory during the forward pass to perform the backward pass. Even the biggest model are less than 1GB, and most of the memory used during training is dedicated to intermediary activations. This makes the major argument of the paper less convincing, and misleads the reader.\n\nSecond, even when disregarding the slightly abusive assumptions over the iterate sequences, that are common in the adaptive stochastic optimizers community, I think that the bound proposed in theorem 1 is non informative, as the second term behaves like T sqrt(T) assymptotically, due to the presence of 1 / \\alpha_t. This does not show the convergence of averaged regret R_T / T.\n\nRegarding the experiment section, I am afraid that testing a new optimizer over MNIST and CIFAR is not enough to show the relevance of the method for the whole deep learning community. An eperiment over a non-toy dataset (eg ImageNet), and on non computer-vision dataset (eg from NLP) would be a minimum, besides the overfitting concern described above.\n\nIn conclusion, it is the reviewer's opinion that significant rework in term of presentation and strong improvement of the experiment section to make the case for the Game optimizer.\n\nMinor comments\n------------\nTable 1: what do you bound when you compare results ? I think there is a typo in Zhou et al. result: 1/2 should read p.\n\nEq (1): it is rather surprising to use x_t as the model parameters in the ICLR community. \n\np 7: the dimension d could be larger than T when training large-scale neural networks: how does it relate to comparing sqrt(dT) to (dT)^s ?", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper107/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "GENERALIZED ADAPTIVE MOMENT ESTIMATION", "abstract": "Adaptive gradient methods have experienced great success in training deep neural networks (DNNs).

(2018) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05671.pdf  and Chen & Gu (2018) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06763.pdf) cited in this submission. The way this paper is written makes me really upset. \n\nThis paper is heavily built up on our papers, and literally copied a huge part of the theorems and proofs from our paper (even the layout of the equations such as equation breaks, term decomposition is highly similar to our proofs). For example, the following sentences/paragraphs/notations are copied from our papers, i.e., Zhou et al. (2018) and Chen & Gu (2018):\n\n1. In Theorem 2, the authors present their upper bound for \\|\\nabla f(x_{out})\\|_2 by several constant parameters M_i. Compared with Theorem 3.3 in Zhou et al. (2018), the definition of M_i and the upper bound itself are highly similar to what Theorem 3.3 in Zhou et al. (2018) presents. \n\n2. In the proof of Theorem 2, the use of notation is essentially the same as the proof of Theorem 3.3, section A.1 in Zhou et al. (2018). For instance, both of these two works set the output point as x_{out}, set the upper bound for \\|\\nabla f(x)\\|_2 as G_\\infty, etc.\n\n3. The main proof roadmap for Theorem 2 is the same as the proof roadmap for Theorem 3.3 in Zhou et al. (2018). Both of these two work aim to bound \\|\\nabla f(x_t)\\|_2^2 by the difference of H(t+1) and H(t), where H(t) = f(z_t) + \\frac{G_\\infty^2}{1-\\beta_1}\\|\\alpha_{t-1}\\hat{v}_{t-1}^{-p}\\|_1. To get the bound, both of these two work provide upper bounds for \\sum_{t=1}^T \\alpha_t^2 \\mathcal{E} \\|\\hat{V}_t^{-p} m_t\\|_2^2 and \\sum_{t=1}^T \\alpha_t^2 \\mathcal{E} \\|\\hat{V}_t^{-p} g_t\\|_2^2. However, the authors did not point out this part of proof is essentially a twist of our proof.\n\n4. In the proof of Theorem 2, the equation (27) at page 13 is essentially the same as the equation (A.13) at page 13 in Zhou et al. (2018), without appropriate reference. \n\n5. In the proof of Theorem 2, the equation (28) at page 13 is essentially the same as the equation (A.14) at page 14 in Zhou et al. (2018), without appropriate reference. \n\n6. In the proof of Theorem 2, the equation (29) at page 13 is essentially the same as the equation (A.15) at page 14 in Zhou et al. (2018), without appropriate reference. \n", "title": "A paper literally combined results from our papers "}, "signatures": ["(anonymous)"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper107/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["(anonymous)", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "GENERALIZED ADAPTIVE MOMENT ESTIMATION", "abstract": "Adaptive gradient methods have experienced great success in training deep neural networks (DNNs).
