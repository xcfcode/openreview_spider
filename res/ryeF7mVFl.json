At runtime, many of these terms are zero as they are generated when the multiplicand is combined with the zero-bits of the multiplicator. While conventional bit-parallel multipliers calculate all terms in parallel to reduce individual product latency, Pragmatic calculates only the non-zero terms resulting in a design whose execution time for convolutional layers is ideally proportional to the number of activation bits that are 1. Measurements demonstrate that for the convolutional layers on Convolutional Neural Networks and during inference, Pragmatic improves performance by 4.3x over the DaDiaNao (DaDN) accelerator and by 4.5x when DaDN uses an 8-bit quantized representation. DaDiannao was reported to be 300x faster than commodity graphics processors.
