The reviews are generally positive: they praise the generality of the method, the extensive experimental evaluation, and the good empirical results. Overall, no major concerns were raised, and all reviewers recommend acceptance.\n\nA couple of concerns remain, in my view:\n- The method is generally heuristic, and intuitively rather than theoretically motivated. This is compensated of course by the empirical evaluation, which is thorough.\n- The paper could be better written. The reviewers suggested some minor improvements which were implemented in the updated version, but I believe there is room for further improvement.\n\nDue to the above concerns, I consider the rating of reviewer #3 (10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper) to be unjustifiably high.

By using a set of domain-agnostic regression cost functions instead of the adversarial loss, it improves both the stability and eliminates the incompatibility between the adversarial and reconstruction losses, allowing more precise outputs while maintaining diversity.\n\nHowever, it would be interesting to see the qualitative and quantitative comparison with the latest related works. For example, the following two CVPR2020 papers(For reference only):\n[1] Zheng C, Cham T J, Cai J. Pluralistic image completion[C]//Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2019: 1438-1447.\n[2] Li J, Wang N, Zhang L, et al.

It starts off by pointing out the key shortcomings of the use of a combination of reconstruction and adversarial losses and then clarifies the framework proposed in this paper for modeling CMM spaces. Continuously, it explains the drawbacks of conditional GAN methods and illustrates the idea via a toy example. After that, with an extensive set of experiments, this paper experiment on several such tasks with different datasets. It illustrates the outperformance in both qualitative and quantitative experimental comparison and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance.\n\nBy the way, it may be more friendly for readers to read the paper if the layout of diagrams and tables can be reformatted in a clearer way. \n\nOriginality and Significance\uff1a\nDue to the ill-posed nature of conditional generation in multimodal domains, this paper proposed a novel generative framework with a simple and generic architecture instead of the adversarial loss. The proposed approach demonstrates faster convergence, scalability, generalizability, diversity, and superior representation learning capability for downstream tasks. At the same time, the comparable performance has been validated on different datasets both quantitatively and qualitatively. And in most of the experiments, it achieves state-of-the-art performance.\n\nBased on the above considerations, I think it is a good paper that marginally above the acceptance threshold. And it may be worthwhile to be accepted if more latest experimental comparison can be shown, and still have the outperformance.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCompared with the latest related work, the author added the qualitative and quantitative comparison against \"Recurrent Feature Reasoning for Image Inpainting\" in the image completion task. And it shows the outstanding performance of this paper. \nThey have also reformatted the paper so the paper becomes clearer for readers to read. \nConsider the above all, I think it\u2019s a good paper and is worthwhile to be accepted.\n\n\nSo I improving my rating to \u201c7: Good paper, accept\u201d\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2818/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2818/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Conditional Generative Modeling via Learning the Latent Space", "authorids": ["~Sameera_Ramasinghe1", "~Kanchana_Nisal_Ranasinghe1", "~Salman_Khan4", "~Nick_Barnes3", "~Stephen_Gould1"], "authors": ["Sameera Ramasinghe", "Kanchana Nisal Ranasinghe", "Salman Khan", "Nick Barnes", "Stephen Gould"], "keywords": ["Multimodal Spaces", "Conditional Generation", "Generative Modeling"], "abstract": "Although deep learning has achieved appealing results on several machine learning tasks, most of the models are deterministic at inference, limiting their application to single-modal settings.

The $l_1$ loss assumes the distributions are Laplacian and tries to minimize the distance between them (without accounting for the variance), while the adversarial loss tries to minimize the JS divergence between the distributions. This difference in the optimization objectives causes the model to come to an equilibrium point, which is not perfectly stationed in the optimal data manifold. Therefore, it can be assumed that in a multimodal output space, for a given input, the extracted features by the generator are not optimal. In other words, if $l_1$ loss is dominant, the features represent the median of all the observed data, and if the adversarial loss is dominant, the representation can have a poor dependency on the specific output. We believe that this can be one of the reasons our model outperforms other models that use the adversarial loss.\n\n**Comment: The authors can consider comparing and contrasting with the normalizing flow related work.**\n\nThank you for bringing our attention to this.

By varying the latent factor, VAE models can generate diverse data as well.**\n\nThank you for drawing our attention to this. A detailed comparison summary along with VAE, Normalizing flows and some other related works is now added to App. 1. \n\nTo summarise, in VAEs, the posterior distribution is typically sampled from the family of Gaussians. However, assuming the posterior distribution of the latent space as a Gaussian distribution can constrain the quality of the generated data distribution, as the true distribution may be far from a Gaussian (note that recent work such as [1] and [2] have been proposed to address this).\n\nIn contrast, we do not explicitly model our latent space as a probability distribution. However, we can draw some interesting analogies from a probabilistic perspective as follows: our latent space $\\zeta$ can be interpreted as a set of energy surfaces $E_{x_j}:\\zeta \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, as $E_{x_j} = ||{y^g_{j} - G(x,z_{j})}||$ for each ground truth mode $y^g_{j}$. From this perspective, Fig.~21 in the appendix illustrates the energy heatmaps for the toy example. As shown,  high energies are indicated by a brighter color. Since our system has a finite energy, the combined energy $E_x = \\sum_j E_{x_j}$ can be transformed to a probability distribution via the Gibbs measure as $p'(z) = \\frac{1}{T(\\beta)} \\exp (-\\beta E_x(z))$, where $T(\\cdot)$ is the partition function.This probability is not restricted to a Gaussian, as opposed to VAEs.\n\nAnother critical difference between the VAEs and our model is that we do not sample directly from $p'(z)$, since to obtain $p'(z)$, we need to integrate $E_x$ over the latent space. However, our predictor network $\\mathcal{Z}$ learns the high probability coordinates $\\{z^*}$ of $p'(z)$, and is able to converge to such locations at inference. This probabilistic perspective of our latent space  is intuitively justified by the convergence samples shown in Fig. 41 in appendix. The intermediate samples we obtain as we go from $z$ to $z^*$ also produce plausible results, however, the visual quality at the $z^*$ is maximized, indicating high $p'(z =z^*|x)$. Therefore, our model does not explicitly learns the probability distributions, rather the  predictor network learns to converge to the high probability areas in complex distributions. \n\n\n[1] - Maal\u00f8e, Lars, et al. \"Auxiliary deep generative models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1602.05473 (2016).\n[2] - Rezende, Danilo Jimenez, and Shakir Mohamed. \"Variational inference with normalizing flows.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1505.05770 (2015).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2818/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2818/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Conditional Generative Modeling via Learning the Latent Space", "authorids": ["~Sameera_Ramasinghe1", "~Kanchana_Nisal_Ranasinghe1", "~Salman_Khan4", "~Nick_Barnes3", "~Stephen_Gould1"], "authors": ["Sameera Ramasinghe", "Kanchana Nisal Ranasinghe", "Salman Khan", "Nick Barnes", "Stephen Gould"], "keywords": ["Multimodal Spaces", "Conditional Generation", "Generative Modeling"], "abstract": "Although deep learning has achieved appealing results on several machine learning tasks, most of the models are deterministic at inference, limiting their application to single-modal settings.

The proposed method is optimized to find multi-modal optimal solutions at inference time. This general method can be applied to a lot of down-stream tasks, improving inference performance without the need to carefully design a network structure.\n\nPros:\n1. The proposed method is very general. It is evaluated on quite a few different tasks, including sketch to image generation, image imputation. image colorization, etc.\n2. The proposed method shows superior results both qualitatively and quantitatively compared with baseline models. It is quite impressive how comprehensive the evaluation is. The multi-modality perspective is especially well presented.\n\nCons:\n1. The authors should carefully audit the paper. There are quite a few typos and presentation flaws, which makes it much harder to read. For example, the numbering of the figures is not consistent. There is not figure 2, 4, 6, 8 etc. \n2. I understand that the authors want to show as many results as possible, but the presentation becomes very crowded, especially on page 8. I would recommend the authors to leave the critical experimental results here and move some to the supplementary materials.\n3. Despite the impressive experimental results, I think readers would benefit more from a deep discussion. For example, what is the relationship between this model with a VAE model? The similarity is of course the continuous latent space. By varying the latent factor, VAE models can generate diverse data as well.

Also, this method can generate diverse outputs at inference with a single model. It was partially possible with many GAN methods, but there is a significant improvement in diversity.\n\n- Clear motivation and well-defined method\\\nThe problem of modeling the CMM space is well defined, and the limitation of the previous methods are described in detail. And the intuition to resolve this problem is also highly convincing.\n\n- Various and extensive experiments\\\nThe experimental settings and results support the effectiveness of the proposed method. The toy example in Figure 3 clearly shows that the proposed method can model CMM space properly.\nEach experiment for downstream tasks also has a detailed explanation, showing good qualitative and quantitative performance.\n\nThere are no major weaknesses in the overall content. However, it is necessary to correct that table 5 and table 6 are overlapped, and many figures and tables are mixed in a somewhat disorderly manner.\n\nIt is somewhat similar to [1,2] in that a separate variable is defined for generating multiple outputs in a deterministic function. It's good to discuss this.\n\nIt would be great if there is a follow-up study to see if it could be extended to generate an image from random variables, like Conditional GAN.

The authors also explained the `` 'generalizability' advantage over cGANS, that is capable of learning more task-agnostic representations.\nThis paper is very dense. The authors conducted many experiments to show 1) the presented conditional generative modeling approach is capable of learning diverse representation and hence lead to diverse generation, 2) the proposed methods worked quite well across different tasks, both subjectively and objectively. Ablation studies are also performed to show ```'momentum' as a supplementary aid\u201d is helpful.\n\nAt this moment, I don\u2019t have major concerns regarding this submission. I incline to accept this paper, and am willing to further change my rating. Below are some minor comments:\n1.\tBased on the description in section 2 to 4, and also the strong experimental results, I am convinced that the proposed approach converges faster than cGAN, and can learn diverse representations and enables multimodal generation. However, it is a bit surprising/interesting that proposed method worked consistently better than other prior methods in almost all the downstream tasks explored. Can you elaborate more on why learned representations worked consistently well in almost all downstream tasks that have tried in the paper.\n2.\tThe experimental study part is very dense. It would be good to have a short section clearly compare the model size/capacity of your models and the counterpart models. Also, is it good to move at least one model architecture you used to main text?\n3.\tThe authors can consider comparing and contrasting with the normalizing flow related work.
