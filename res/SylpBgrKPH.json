It makes use of Variational AutoEncoders (VAE) to learn the latent confounders from incomplete covariates. This also helps encoding complex non-linear relationships in the data, a capability that is missing in the work of Kallus et al. (2018) -- the work which this paper extends. They employ the Missing data Importance Weight AutoEncoder (MIWAE) approach (Mattei & Frellsen, 2019) to approximate the posterior of their latent factors Z given the observed incomplete covariates X*. The main contributions of this work are presented in sections 3.2 and 3.3, where they use the approximated posterior derived from MIWAE to sample Z to be used for estimating outcomes and finally calculating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE). This is done according to the doubly robust estimator developed for data with incomplete covariates (Mayer et al., 2019b). \n\nIn summary, I am not convinced that the contribution of this paper is enough, nor of its novelty. However, I will read the rebuttal carefully and am willing to increase the score if the authors address this concern.\n\nThere are several points that need further clarification; e.g., \n\t- Figure 1 as well as Figure 2 show a directed edge from X* to X_{miss}.

Previous work (Kallus et al. 2018) on similar settings assumed a low rank model connecting Z and X along with some entries missing at random which we do not observe. Further, Y (outcome) is related to the treatment and Z with a linear model. They actually show that matrix factorization techniques with these assumptions form an unbiased estimator for the Average Treatment Effect. There is prior work on doubly robust estimators under ignorability assumptions.\n\nIn this paper, the authors want to consider general non-linear relationships between Z and X with the same MAR (missing at random assumption) for missing entries.  So they fit a latent variable model in the form of VAE to find the P(Z| observed part of X) using a slightly modified version of the ELBO Lower Bound. For missing entries, they just replace those entries by a constant and do the usual VAE fit. After the VAE fit, multiple Z's are samples from the optimized P(Z| observed X) and then used in the doubly robust formula on each Z for estimating the average treatment effect and then finally the estimates averaged over the different Z's.\n\nThere is an alternative where the conditional mean of the latent variable is estimated from the VAE and used in the doubly robust computation.\n\nIn many synthetic examples, authors compare this with existing baselines and show that their method improves.\n\nPros: \n - Baselines compares are comprehensive enough from my perspective. \n - The paper is well written with clear pointer to existing work on doubly robust estimators with standard ignorability assumptions and the work for the linear, low rank model case by Kallus et al. 2018.\n\nCons:\n   Major Issues\n     - There is no reason to believe that even for the synthetic experiments, that the VAE posteriors would asymptotically yield unbiased ATE's which is provably the case in (Kallus et al. 2018) (of course for their restricted linear model/low rank assumptions). There is no reason to suppose Z's used in eq (9) from the VAE satisfy ignorability even in the asymptotic limit. In this light, the paper in essence just estimates Z's from some latent model that is fit and then use those latents to regress Y and then computes ATE. This seems a natural heuristic to try given such a problem. So I don't find a big methodological novelty. I would be willing to increase my scores if the authors could convince me on this point.\n\n  - For the LRMF model (Fig 4) the MF approach seems to do as well as the authors proposal and we have a guarantee for the MF case under those linear/low rank modeling assumptions. So the only demonstrated benefit is for the synthetic experiments for Fig 5 and Fig 3 (I agree that it is considerable particularly with large fraction of missing values in Fig 3) in whose settings we dont know about how unbiased it is in the limit. More synthetic experiments with different kind of generative models could be more convincing.\n\n- Some real world data set would have been more convincing - although I agree ground truth is hard to come by.\n\nMinor Issues:\n   - You have set B=200 for all the experiments for MDC-MI. Do the results change when B is increased or decreased ?? Does variance go down or the bias itself changes with B -  This would be a useful insight to have.\n\n  -  There is typo in the ELBO lower bound equation in page 11. There are other minor typos. Please correct for it.\n\n - Since the paper is about estimate treatment effect from measurements of an unobserved confounder - it is important to cite - https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r366-reprint.pdf from the causal DAG literature. \n\n - The covariance of X given Z for the DLVM model is not clear - It seems to say exp ( or some matrix vector products) * Identity. What does this mean ? \n\n- The feature dimensions seems to be set at 10 - so would we expect the same results in much higher dimensions - like say 100s for few tens of thousands of samples??\n\n********UPDATE after reading the rebutall,changes and the new experiment**********\n\nI appreciate the authors actually accepting that identifiability issues cannot be easily resolved even if one knows P*(Z|X).\nI recommend the authors to elaborate on this point in the camera ready version. However, showing that the proposed methods work on a real benchmark (semi-synthetic one used in Shalit et. al 2017) is commendable.  However, I find that the MF method is competitive (almost all the time) with their method when Doubly robust estimators are used.\n\nBut having matched an existing baseline (the MF method) that deals with confounders on real data and showing superior synthetic results and authors clarifying and toning down their theoretical claims, I am inclined to increase the score to Weak accept.\n\n\n\n \n\n ", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2302/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2302/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["julie.josse@polytechnique.edu", "imke.mayer@polytechnique.edu", "jpvert@google.com"], "title": "MissDeepCausal: causal inference from incomplete data using deep latent variable models", "authors": ["Julie Josse", "Imke Mayer", "Jean-Philippe Vert"], "pdf": "/pdf/e5327e8b9e5a2c8c429329f224d48ce511a2953d.pdf", "abstract": "Inferring causal effects of a treatment, intervention or policy from observational data is central to many applications.

The core challenge is that of confounders not directly observed, and accessible only via noisy proxys, in particular in the missingness. The contributed method relies on using the latent-factor model for multiple imputation in doubly-robust causal treatment effect estimators. As a consequence, it requires the missing at random assumption to control for the impact of imputation. Given that the confounders are not directly assumed, a first approach estimates their effect via an estimate of P(Z|X*)  (probability of confounder given observed data), which is then plugged in the doubly robust estimator in a multiple imputation strategy. A second approach uses heuristically the estimated latent confounders as regressors of non interest in a linear-regression model.

For example, if $X$ is independent from $Z$ (corresponding to a case where the observation is a very bad proxy for the latent confounder), then $P(Z|X)=P(Z)$ is perfectly known but the causal effect can not be estimated from the observation of $(W,Y)$ only and some noise $X^*$.\n\nOn the other hand, what we wanted to show with the new equations in our paper is that if one knows the treatment effect conditioned on $Z$ (or an unbiased estimate, as we write), then we can  derive the treatment effect conditioned on the observation $X^*$ by averaging the treatment effect given $Z$ according to $P(Z|X^*)$. This is useful to justify why in equation (9) we form an estimate of $\\tau$ for realizations of $Z$ according to $Z|X^*$, and then average these estimates over several realizations to estimate the average treatment effect. However, this does *not* tell us how to create an unbiased estimator of the treatment effect conditioned to $Z$; in particular, to compute the doubly robust estimator (9), this does not tell us how to correctly estimate the propensity score $\\hat{e}$ and the response function $\\hat{\\mu}$ that are needed . For that purpose, we propose a heuristic method inspired by the approach of Kallus et al (2018) in the linear case, which may be biased (as discussed above).\n\n- Regarding experiments: as you suggested, we applied our methods on a close to real data set, namely the IHDP data set used as well by Shalit et al. (2017) and Louizos et al. (2017). We added a new Section 4.4 in the updated version of the paper which shows the good behavior of MissDeepCausal.\n\nThank you again for your comments which help us improving the paper.

However, I have the following problem with this claim. May be I am not able to see it clearly.\n\nSuppose (to make my point clear and in a simple way) there are only two data points Y_1,X*_1,T_1 and Y_2,X*_2,T_2. Let us assume the *true* latent *realizations* behind these points were *Z_1* and *Z_2* - lets say we don't observe Z_1 and Z_2 directly. However, let us say we also know P (Z|X*) distribution exactly. Now my question is  - Is the estimator you propose even unbiased (even asymptotically) ?\n\nNow when you sample B times from P(Z|X*) and create B tables - there is no reason that in each of the B tables, you will get points Z that are even close to Z_1 or Z_2 most of the times while the targets Y's correspond to these specific unknown Z_1 and Z_2. So if you form your regression estimates along with the doubly robust estimator based on the Z's one generates - there is no reason to believe it is unbiased. In fact, let us even take a stronger case where we know the treatment assignment conditional also P (T|Z) exactly. But the doubly robust estimates use regressed mean of Y (obtained only under Z_1) on Z's (sampled) given X* under T=T_1. Why is this unbiased even asymptotically ? The point I am making is we only know Y according to one Z_1 (sampled from P (Z|X*) and unobserved). Regressing this target on Z's that are sampled from the distribution (P(Z|X*)) - will it not make it biased - why would it be unbiased? \n\n Is there a reference where this issue has been dealt which the authors are relying on ?\n\n Do you think you can get close to estimates formed by the unobserved realizations (Z_1 and Z_2) with a regression estimate based on Z's samples from P (Z|X*)??\n\n- The only idenitifability result I know when Z is unknown in general comes from https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r366-reprint.pdf (Kuroki and Pearl 2014). In fact they want to know P (X*|Z) and not P (Z|X*) [which might be counter intuitive] and they establish identifiability results. Again this is possibly through a different estimator since for them both Z and X* are discrete and there are no missingness issues. But to claim that P(Z|X*) alone is enough to identify through sampling with doubly robust estimator requires a proof.\n\nRegarding experiments: \n    I am happy that the authors did synthetic experiments with higher p and it shows better results. \n\nShalit et al 2017 used two real world datasets (one sort of semi synthetic) in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03976.pdf for their ITE work. Is it possible to hide some variables and introduce missingness to create the situation the authors have and then perform an experiment using their data ? Anything close to real world data would add value to the experimental claims given that I am still not convinced by the identifiability claims that seem strong even knowing P(Z|X*) (in Section 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n "}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2302/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2302/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["julie.josse@polytechnique.edu", "imke.mayer@polytechnique.edu", "jpvert@google.com"], "title": "MissDeepCausal: causal inference from incomplete data using deep latent variable models", "authors": ["Julie Josse", "Imke Mayer", "Jean-Philippe Vert"], "pdf": "/pdf/e5327e8b9e5a2c8c429329f224d48ce511a2953d.pdf", "abstract": "Inferring causal effects of a treatment, intervention or policy from observational data is central to many applications.

To strengthen the paper and highlight our contribution with multiple imputation, we have also included in the Appendix of the revised version of the paper the results of other simulations where we vary the number of covariates that highlight the fact that we get unbiased estimates of the ATE when $p$ increases. Finally, we would like to stress out that there are not so many methods that explicitly consider missing (covariate) values in causal inference tasks. The assumptions on the missing values mechanism (MCAR for Kallus et al., 2018) or on the unconfoundedness (unconfoundedness with missingness, Mayer et al., 2019) are strong and it is difficult to assess their suitability for a given problem. Therefore we believe that  there is room for our proposal which bears an innovative approach for exploiting the latent confounding assumption in the sense that using the multiple imputation approach, we exploit the posterior distribution of $(Z|X^*)$ instead of only the posterior expectation $\\mathbb{E}[Z|X^*]$.\n\n- Regarding Figures 1 and 2: We agree that the directed edge from $X^*$ to $X_{mis}$ is confusing. It stems from an alternative representation where we used $X_{mis}$ and $X_{obs}$, which is classical in the missing data literature. Nevertheless, we agree that the assumptions are clearer without any $X_{mis}$ in the graphical representation but only $X^{\\star}$ and $M$. Consequently, we have modified the graphs in Figure 1 and Figure 2 of the revised version and added also $Y(0)$ and $Y(1)$ to highlight the unconfoundedness assumption.\n \n- About the validity of using Z to predict ATE accurately: Like all methods for ATE estimation, MDC is only valid under some assumptions that we state in the paper, in particular, that there are no other confounding factors between treatment and effects beyond the (unobserved) Z factors (i.e., that the model shown on Figure 2 is correct). Ensuring and evaluating the validity of this hypothesis is unfortunately usually not possible without further assumptions, as for other methods for ATE estimation. If the model is correct, then we added a paragraph (Section 3 page 4) to justify by the MDC.mi estimator is a valid estimator for ATE.\n\n- About the training of the conditional response surfaces $\\mu_0$ and $\\mu_1$: As explained in Section 4.3.2, we estimate $\\mu_0$ and $\\mu_1$ by performing a predictive model of $Y$ on $Z$ using either a linear regression or a random forest.\n\n- We have corrected all the typos, thank you.

We clarify this original methodological contribution in the revised version of the paper, where we added a paragraph in Section 3 page 4 to state and prove this property. Of course, a complete answer to the question of asymptotic consistency would require us to answer point (i), i.e., study the asymptotic consistency of VAE and quantify how well we approximate the conditional distribution of the latent variables given the observed data when we sample with MIWAE, which is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n- Concerning the experiments: First, we would like to clarify that the experiment with LRMF model (Fig 4) mentioned by the Reviewer is precisely meant to give an advantage to the MF approach, since the simulated data follow precisely the model behind the MF method; hence it is not a surprise that the MF approach is competitive in this case. To the contrary, as we write in the text, the interesting observation in this experiment is that MDC approaches are competitive with MF, and even slightly better. Second, we agree that more experiments are needed to evaluate empirically the asymptotic biases of the different methods. In the revised version, we add new results (figures 6 and 7 in appendix B) showing that MDC outperforms other methods in terms of bias as the number of features increases. For instance, choosing $p=100$ and $n=1000$, we obtain unbiased estimations of the ATE with both MDC.process and MDC.mi coupled with the double robust estimator in both the low-rank and deep-latent variables settings. Regarding real world data, as noticed by the reviewer ground truth is hard to come by.\n- Regarding the influence of $B$, we only have preliminary results but these indicate that for a small number of covariates, choosing small ($B=50$) or large ($B=500$) values for $B$ does not have an impact on the final estimate, however for larger numbers of covariates, it seems better to pick a large $B$. We have added these results in Figure 8 in appendix B of the revised paper.\n\n- We have corrected the typos and added the reference, thank you.\n\n-  Regarding the covariance of X given Z for the DLVM model: we use the model suggested by Kingma and Welling (2014) who used a diagonal covariance matrix, i.e., conditionally on $Z$, we have independence between the (normally distributed) covariates $X$. Hence we could also  write $(\\mu_{(Z)},\\Sigma_{(Z)}) = (V\\tanh(UZ+a)+b, \\operatorname{diag}\\{\\exp(\\eta^T\\tanh(UZ+a) + \\delta\\})$\n\n- Regarding the feature dimension, as explained above we added in the revised version new results with $p=100$ and $n=1000$ where we show that MDC is unbiased (Figs 6-7)\n\n\nReferences:\n- Kallus, N., Mao, X., \\& Udell, M.
