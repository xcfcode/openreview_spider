We are glad that our clarifications and changes have made the paper better. Regarding the Oracle Top 5% criterion: It is true that for a single test sequence, the Oracle Top 5% criterion measures if in the \"longer\" future there are some predicted trajectories that are still close to the ground truth. However, note that it is the Top 5% of a limited \u201cbudget\u201d of 100 predictions and this criterion is averaged over the test-set. Therefore, to obtain a low Top 5% error, our model must generate likely (due to limited budget) future trajectories for all test-set examples (because it is averaged across the test-set) that are close to the ground-truth. In other words, the model must be able to predict the likely future outcomes. A model which assigns low probability to likely futures will not be able to generate future trajectories corresponding to the ground truth in the limited budget of 100 samples per test examples for the vast majority of the test-set sequences -- leading to a high Top 5% error. Therefore, the Top 5% error can measure the uncertainty. It has also been used in prior work for a relative comparison of techniques (Lee et al. (2017) and Bhattacharyya et al. (2018b)). We will better motivate the Oracle Top 5% criterion in the final version. Furthermore, note that we also include the Conditional log-likelihood (CLL) metric in Table 3 as an additional metric to measure uncertainty. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper730/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper730/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper730/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Bayesian Prediction of Future Street Scenes using Synthetic Likelihoods", "abstract": "For autonomous agents to successfully operate in the real world, the ability to anticipate future scene states is a key competence.

We are pleased that the results in Section 4 (and the Appendix) are convincing. \n\nWe now address the concerns and provide clarifications in detail,\n\n* Detailed description of the training process should be provided for better reproducibility.\n- We completely agree and we have added additional details in Appendix C Table 5.

I assume this would not be present in a real-world scenario?\n- Conditioning on the future odometry is important as the sequences are in the frame of reference of the vehicle. The future path of the vehicle thus has a impact on the future observed sequence. In real world scenarios, the future odometry can be seen as a candidate planned path of the vehicle. Thus, this would help the vehicle obtain more informative predictions conditioned on candidate paths and help the vehicle decide on the optimal path. \n\n* The differences in Figure 4.\n- Figure 4 depicts the long-term uncertainty calibration of our method and baselines -- how well  the predicted probability of a class 0.6sec into the future corresponds to the observed frequency. Uncertainty calibration of long-term predictions is a very important but difficult to achieve property (as we cannot directly optimize for it). Bayesian inference provides the only reliable approach to obtain calibration uncertainties. In Figure 4, we see that  standard dropout bayesian inference approach of Kendall & Gal (2017) already leads to improved results over the non-Bayesian ResG-Mean and CVAE approaches. The improvements are in line with improvements observed in Kendall & Gal (2017). Our Bayes-WD and Bayes-WD-SL further improves upon the approach of Kendall & Gal (2017). Furthermore, note that the differences are significant in the important regions: [0.0,0.2] and [0.6,0.95]. Other methods underestimate the probability of occurrence of classes in the region [0.0,0.2] (they fail to predict certain classes which potentially occur in special cases) and overestimate in the region [0.6,0.95] (they are overly confident of likely classes).\n\nWe have corrected the typos that were pointed out.

[2/2] ", "comment": "* In Table 2 it is not clear what is compared against what.\n- Here, we compare our proposed model against four important baselines - two state-of-the-art approaches of Luc et al. (2017) and Seyed et al. (2018), the standard dropout approach of Kendall & Gal (2017) (Bayes-S, using the same model architecture as our Bayes-WD-SL - Figure 2) and a baseline that uses Weight Dropout (Bayes-WD) but not synthetic likelihoods. We have updated the Table 2 at the additional time-steps as requested.\n\n* The Bayes-WD-SL does exactly on par with the Bayes-Standard.\n- We have added the additional results for +0.54sec in Table 2. We see that the mean prediction from the Bayes-WD-SL model has an advantage of 2.9 mIoU at 0.06sec and 0.2 mIoU at 0.54secs. The performance advantage of Bayes-WD-SL over Bayes-S(Standard) in this case shows that the ability to better model uncertainty does not come at the cost of lower mean performance. At larger time-steps as the future becomes increasingly uncertain, mean predictions (mean of all likely futures) drift further from the ground-truth. Therefore, we evaluate the models on their (more important) ability to capture the uncertainty of the future in Table 2 (last two rows) and Table 3 (full). We see clearly in Table 3, that Bayes-WD-SL shows a large performance advantage over the Bayes-S(Standard) model in capturing uncertainty with respect to both the Top 5% of predictions and the CLL metric (same criteria as in Lee et al. (2017) and Bhattacharyya et al. (2018b)). This shows that Bayes-WD-SL model can much better capture the range of likely futures.  Similarly, the Bayes-WD also performs better compared to the Bayes-Standard model. This shows the advantage of both our novel components - Weight Dropout and (more significantly) Synthetic Likelihoods in the ability to capture uncertainty.  We have updated the text in Section 4.2 to highlight these points.\n\n* Fair comparison to Luc et al. (2017)\n- In Table 1,  we use a PSPNet to generate training segmentations for our Bayes-WD-SL model to ensure fair comparison with the state-of-the-art Seyed et al. Note, that our Bayes-WD-SL model already obtains higher gains in comparison to Luc et al. with respect the Last Input Baseline, e.g. at +0.54sec, 47.8 - 36.9 = 10.9 mIoU translating to 29.5% gain over the Last Input Baseline of Luc et al. versus 51.2 - 38.3 = 12.9 mIoU translating to 33.6% gain over the Last Input Baseline of our Bayes-WD-SL model in Table 1. But as suggested for fairness,  we additionally include results in Table 6, Appendix C using the same Dialation 10 approach to generate training segmentations. We observe that our Bayes-WD-SL model beats the model of Luc et al. (2017) in both short-term (+0.18 sec) and long-term predictions (+0.54 sec). Furthermore, we see that the mean of the Top 5% of the predictions of Bayes-WD-SL leads to much improved results over mean predictions. This again confirms the ability of our Bayes-WD-SL model to capture uncertainty and deal with multi-modal futures.\n\n* Unclarities.\n- We have defined Z_K in eq. (4) in the text.\nIn eq (6) is the z x \u03c3 a matrix or a scalar operation?\n- It is a matrix operation as z is vector. We have clarified this in the text.\nConvolutions are not used in the first experiment?\n- We do not use convolutions in the first experiment as we want to highlight the advantage of synthetic likelihoods in modelling uncertainty. The results of the experiment show that synthetic likelihoods are applicable across model types and can successfully model uncertainty. Note that we use weight dropout (our first novelty) in the main experiments on street scenes.\n\t\nFinally, we thank AnonReviewer1 for voicing her/his concerns and helping us improve our work.

[1/2]", "comment": "We would like to thank AnonReviewer1 for finding our work interesting especially the novel ideas of Weight Dropout and Synthetic Likelihoods in a Bayesian context.\n\nWe now address the concerns and provide clarifications in detail,\n\n* The proposed model is a auto-encoder GAN.\n- We would like to clarify that our model is not an auto-encoder GAN. Although, \nthe objective function (11) does bear resemblance to the objective typically minimized by auto-encoder GANs. But, we do not use auto-encoders -- our models do not have explicit latent spaces. More importantly, unlike auto-encoder GANs which learn one single model for prediction, we learn the distribution of likely models in a Bayesian framework.\n\n* It is not clear where the architecture of section 3.4 is used.\n- We would like to clarify that this is the main architecture for all the street scene prediction experiments -- used by the ResG-Mean, Bayes-S, Bayes-WD and Bayes-WD-SL models. The architecture of section 3.4 is one and the same as the ResNet architecture. We have clarified this in the text.\n\n\n* Why considering the mean of the best 5% predictions helps with evaluating the predicted uncertainty?\n- As the future becomes increasingly uncertain, we would like to capture all the likely future outcomes rather than just the mean, as mean predictions drift further and further from the groundtruth into the future. As mentioned in the main paper, considering the mean of (oracle) best 5% of predictions helps us evaluate whether the learned model distribution contains likely models corresponding to the groundtruth. As this metric (also used by e.g. Lee et al. (2017) and Bhattacharyya et al. (2018b)) is also averaged across the test set, a higher value shows that the model distribution is able to better anticipate all the varied futures that occur in the test set. \n\n* The precise novelty of the first modification is not clearly explained. \n- The advantage of our proposed Weight Dropout scheme  does depend on the spatial resolution. The gain at a certain layer is significant if the spatial resolution is greater than the product of the number of filters  of in the current layer and the previous layer. We gain ~28x compared to standard (patch) dropout in the first and last group of layer of our model (Figure 2) and ~3x times in the second and fourth group of layers. While we do not gain in the third group of layers -- where the spatial resolution is the lowest, overall we gain ~3x compared to Standard Dropout. Thus, while it is true that the gains are mostly when the spatial resolution is high (typically more than 32x64). But, as the total number of parameters are also the highest when the spatial resolution is high, overall we make significant gains in both the convolutional architectures used for street scene and precipitation forecasting -- we have 68% lower total number of variational parameters compared to the Standard Dropout scheme of Gal & Ghahramani (2016a). We have added Table 11 Appendix E, where we discuss the gains at each layer in detail for the architecture on street scene prediction. Finally, in Table 12 we provide an overview of the variational parameters of both architectures for street scene and precipitation forecasting .\n\n* MNIST experiment reports results only from the best sampled model.\n- Note that we use a classifier to decide if the prediction comes from the correct mode. This is because it is difficult to decide with simple measures like L1/2 distance whether the prediction is even a coherent digit.  We use the best sampled model to maintain the crispness of the predicted images. Taking e.g. the mean of top 10 of 100 models, would lead to the generation of blurry digits potentially unrecognizable by a classifier. Furthermore, this same criteria is applied across all models, therefore, we do not give any unfair advantage to our model. Furthermore, we have updated Figure 3 to report the mean and standard deviation of the Top 10% metric across 10 splits of 1000 examples  from the MNIST test set. The results confirm the advantage of our Bayes-SL model over the Bayes-S and CVAE models."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper730/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper730/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper730/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Bayesian Prediction of Future Street Scenes using Synthetic Likelihoods", "abstract": "For autonomous agents to successfully operate in the real world, the ability to anticipate future scene states is a key competence.

Specifically, the paper starts from a Bayesian Neural Network model, as presented in Gal and Ghahramani, 2016 and makes two modifications.\n\nFirst, it proposes to define one Bernoulli variational distribution per weight kernel, instead  of per patch (in the original work there was one Bernoulli distribution per patch kernel). As the paper claims, this reduces the complexity to be exponential to the number of weights, instead of the number of patches, which leads to a much smaller number of possible models. Also, because of this modification the same variational distributions are shared between locations, being closer to the convolutional nature of the model.\n\nThe second modification is the introduction of synthetic likelihoods. Specifically, in the original network the variational distributions are designed such that the KL-divergence of the true posterior p(\u03c9|X, y) and the approximate posterior q(\u03c9) is minimiezd. This leads to the optimizer encouraging the final model to be close to the mean, thus resulting in less diversity. By re-formulating the KL-divergence, the final objective can be written such that it depends on the likelihood ratio between generated/\"fake\" samples and \"true\" data samples. This ratio can then be approximated by a GAN-like discriminator. As the optimizer now is forced to care about the ratio instead of individual samples, the model is more diverse.\n\nBoth modifications present some interesting ideas. Specifically, the number of variational parameters is reduced, thus the final models could be much better scaleable. Also, using synthetic likelihoods in a Bayesian context is novel, to the best of my knowledge, and does seem to be somewhat empirically justified. \n\nThe negative points of the paper are the following.\n\n- The precise novelty of the first modification is not clearly explained. Indeed, the number of possible models with the proposed approach is reduced. However, what is the degree to which it is reduced. With some rough calculations, for an input image of resolution 224x224, with a kernel size of 3x3 and stride 1, there should be about 90x90 patches. That is roughly a complexity of O(N^2) ~ 8K (N is the number of patches). Consider the proposed variational distributions with 512 outputting channels, this amount to 3x3x512 ~ 4.5K. So, is the advantage mostly when the spatial resolution of the image is very high? What about intermediate layers, where the resolution is typically smaller?\n\n- Although seemingly ok, the experimental validation has some unclarities.\n  + First, it is not clear whether it is fair in the MNIST experiment to report results only from the best sampled model, especially considering that the difference from the CVAE baseline is only 0.5%. The standard deviation should also be reported.\n  + In Table 2 it is not clear what is compared against what. There are three different variants of the proposed model. The WD-SL does exactly on par with the Bayes-Standard (although for some reason the boldface font is used only for the proposed method. The improvement appears to come from the synthetic likelihoods. Then, there is another \"fine-tuned\" variant for which only a single time step is reported, namely +0.54 sec. Why not report numbers for all three future time steps? Then, the fine-tuned version (WD-SL-ft) is clearly better than the best baselines of Luc et al., however, the segmentation networks are also quite different (about 7% difference in mIoU), so it is not clear if the improvement really comes from the synhetic likelihoods or from the better segmentation network. In short, the only configuration that appears to be convincing as is is for the 0.06 sec. I would ask the authors to fill in the blank X spots and repeat fair experiments with the baseline.\n\n- Generally, although the paper is ok written, there are several unclarities.\n  + Z_K in eq. (4) is not defined, although I guess it's the matrix of the z^{i, j}_{k, k'}\n  + In eq (6) is the z x \u03c3 a matrix or a scalar operation? Is z a matrix or a scalar?\n  + The whole section 3.4 is confusing and it feels as if it is there to fill up space. There is a rather intricate architecture, but it is not clear where it is used. In the first experment a simple fully connected network is used. In the second experiment a ResNet is used. So, where the section 3.4 model used?\n  + In the first experiment a fully connected network is used, although the first novelty is about convolutions. I suppose the convolutions are not used here? If not, is that a fair experiment to outline the contributions of the method?\n  + It is not clear why considering the mean of the best 5% predictions helps with evaluating the predicted uncertainty?

The formulation by Gal & Ghahramani is improved upon two-fold: via simplified modeling of the approximating variational distribution (on kernel/bias instead of on patch level), and by using a discriminator (i.e. classifier) for providing a \"synthetic\" likelihood estimate. The latter relaxes the assumptions such that not every data sample needs to be explained equally well by the models.\nResults are demonstrated on a variety of tasks, most prominently street scene forecasting, but also digit completion and precipitation forecasting. The proposed method improves upon the state of the art, while more strongly capturing multi-modality than previous methods.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, this is the first work w.r.t. future prediction with a principled treatment of uncertainty.

In real-world scenarios, future states become increasingly uncertain and multi-modal, particularly on long time horizons. Dropout based Bayesian inference provides a computationally tractable, theoretically well grounded approach to learn different hypotheses/models to deal with uncertain futures and make predictions that correspond well to observations -- are well calibrated. However, it turns out that such approaches fall short to capture complex real-world scenes, even falling behind in accuracy when compared to the plain deterministic approaches. This is because the used log-likelihood estimate discourages diversity. In this work, we propose a novel Bayesian formulation for anticipating future scene states which leverages synthetic likelihoods that encourage the learning of diverse models to accurately capture the multi-modal nature of future scene states.
