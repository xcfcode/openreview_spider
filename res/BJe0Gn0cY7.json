We found that the anti-causal encoder structure alone is not sufficient for preventing posterior collapse, while the delta-VAE alone (constraining the rate) is sufficient. Combining the anti-causal encoder with a beta-VAE objective prevents posterior collapse with small beta, but resulted in worse representations for downstream classification than delta-VAEs (see: new Figure 4).\n\n> ablations\nAblations were performed on a smaller model on CIFAR-10.

We have performed additional ablations and experiments on CIFAR-10 that shows that our proposed delta-VAE approach outperforms beta-VAE and free bits approaches for learning useful representations across a wide range of rates (Fig. 4).\n\n> lack of theory\nWhile we agree that different training methods may perform better in different settings, we present three reasons in the paper for why delta-VAEs may be preferable:\n\n\n1.  Throughout the text we highlight that delta-VAEs do not require altering the training objective of the ELBO. For beta-VAEs, deviations from the ELBO at beta=1 result in an encoder, prior, and decoder that do not obey Bayes rule (Hoffman & Johnson 2016), and thus lead to worse performance in terms of log-likelihood. \n\n2. For representation learning, the temporal-VAE approach of pairing an independent prior with a correlated prior resembles slow feature analysis which has been argued to learn more robust invariant features  (Turner & Sahani, 2007).\n\n3. Ease of hyperparameter tuning. Given a target rate, we can analytically determine and parameterize the variational family such that the the rate is greater than or equal to the minimum target rate. This takes the form of a constraint on the mean and variances for independent delta-VAEs, and a constraint on the correlation for temporal delta-VAEs. In contrast, the relationship between beta and rate is complicated and mode- and data-dependent, thus tuning beta in beta-VAEs can be challenging. Free bits can be unstable and difficult to train, as the gradient goes from 0 to large when the constraint becomes active (see: VLAE). This motivated the authors of VLAE to use beta-VAE (which they name \u201csoft free bits\u201d).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1316/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1316/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1316/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Preventing Posterior Collapse with delta-VAEs", "abstract": "Due to the phenomenon of \u201cposterior collapse,\u201d current latent variable generative models pose a challenging design choice that either weakens the capacity of the decoder or requires altering the training objective.

The idea of the paper relies on introducing a constraint on the family of variational posteriors in such a way that the KL term could be controlled.\n\nThe authors propose to use a linear autoregressive process (AR(1)) as the prior. Alternatively, they trained a single-layer LSTM network with conditional-Gaussian outputs as the prior (the auxiliary prior). Additionally, the authors claim that the encoder should contain anti-causal dependencies in order to introduce additional bias that may diminish the posterior collapse.\n\nThe experiments present various results on image and text datasets. Interestingly, the proposed techniques allowed to perform on a par with purely autoregressive models, however, the latent variables were utilized (i.e., no posterior collapse). For instance, in Figure 3(a) we can notice that a decoder is capable of generating similar images for given latent variable. A similar situation is obtained for text data (e.g., Figure 12).\n\nIn general, I find the paper interesting and I believe it should be discussed during ICLR.\n\nPros:\n+ The paper is well-written and all ideas are clearly presented.\n+ The idea of \u201chard-coded\u201d constraints is interesting and constitutes an alternative approach to utilizing either quantized values in the VAE (VQ-VAE) or a constrained family of variational posteriors (e.g., Hyperspherical VAE).\n+ The obtained results are convincing. Additionally, I would like to highlight that at the first glance it might seem that there is no improvement over the autoregressive models. However, the proposed approach allows to encode an image or a document and then decode it. This is not a case for purely autoregressive models.\n+ The introduction of the Slow Features into the VAE framework constitutes an interesting direction for future research.\n\nCons:\n- The quality of Figure 4 is too low.\n- I am not fully convinced that the auxiliary prior is significantly better than the AR(1) prior. Indeed, the samples seem to be a bit better for the aux. prior but it is rather hard to notice by inspecting quantitative metrics.\n- In general, the proposed approach is a specific solution rather than a general framework.

Specifically, the encoder, decoder, and prior distribution families are chosen such that the KL-term in the ELBO is bounded away from 0, meaning that the encoder output cannot perfectly match the prior. Assuming temporal data, the authors employ a 1-step autoregressive (across) prior with an encoder whose codes are independent conditionally on the input. Furthermore, they propose to use a causal decoder together with an anti-causal or non-causal encoder, which translates into a PixelSNAIL/PixelCNN style decoder and an anti-causal version thereof as encoder in the case of image data. The proposed approach is evaluated on CIFAR10, Imagenet 32x32, and the LM1B data set (text).\n\nPros:\n\nThe method obtains state-of-the-art performance in image generation. The paper features extensive ablation experiments and is well-written. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the code learns an abstract representation by repeatedly sampling form the decoder conditionally on the code.\n\nCons:\n\nOne question that remains is the relative contribution of 1) lower-bounding the KL-term 2) using causal decoder/anti-causal encoder to the overall result. Is the encoder-decoder structure alone enough to prevent posterior collapse?
