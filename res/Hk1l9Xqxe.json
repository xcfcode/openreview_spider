It's nice to see the model applied to an interesting dataset. My main issues with the paper have to do with structure and the choice of representation used in the model. Namely:\n\nThe organization of the paper could be significantly improved. There is a lot of repetitive introduction that adds little to the paper. The first and last two sentences of the abstract could be cut. Many other parts of the abstract basically repeat the introduction. The second paragraph of section 2.3 also repeats your introduction - by now we know what you're doing. I think most people reading this will have no idea what Kershenbaum (2014) is. The description of the data should go in the experiments section. \"Different hypotheses for the songs were emitted\" in the introduction is odd phrasing. Figure 4 should be the first figure and go in the introduction. Figure 5 should be in the methods section. A summary of Table 1 should be in the experiments section. Generally the writing could be tightened quite a bit, which would make space for these figures. The description of the HDP-HMM, which mostly follows the existing literature, is well done.\n\nSome general questions about the methods used:\n\nIf you're interested in scalable inference, why use Gibbs sampling? Why not the beam sampler (van Gael 2008), which at least recently was the state of the art for MCMC inference in the HDP-HMM? More generally, why use MCMC at all? For very large datasets, most of the Bayesian ML community has converged on stochastic variational inference as the most practical method (eg Wang, Paisley and Blei 2011).\n\nIf your interest is mainly in the number of clusters, how would you address the fact that DP mixture models are known not to be consistent for estimating the true number of clusters (Miller and Harrison 2013)?\n\nMFCC features are calibrated to the human auditory system, not bird or whale auditory systems. In your data, do you calibrate the MFCC scale to be closer to the auditory systems of the animals that generated the song?\n\nAnd a final suggestion for future work, which could use the results presented here as a baseline:\n\nGiven the success of LSTMs in speech recognition in recent years, it may be the case that deep learned representations are superior to linear features (like the means of each cluster in an HDP-HMM) for animal song as well. Have you considered a hybrid model, similar to recent work combining autoencoders and graphical models (Johnson, Duvenaud, Wiltschko, Datta and Adams 2016)?", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "BIOACOUSTIC SEGMENTATION BY HIERARCHICAL DIRICHLET PROCESS HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL", "abstract": "Understanding the communication between different animals by analysing their acoustic signals is an important topic in bioacoustics.

Fox et al. (2007, 2009) for dynamical systems including speech recognition problems (speaker  diarization). However, we think that the problem of bioacoustic signals analysis is much more challenging compared standard speech recognition problems, since the data heterogeneity comes from different complex and unknown sources (unknown species, unknown dynamics for each species, mixed species, etc), things which are not common for speech recognition models and for which flexible and completely unsupervised and non-parametric models are needed. This is we think what is offered by the HDP-HMM algorithm. On the other hand, we agree with you that in Bayesian analysis in general, the problem of choosing the hyper-parameter is ans issue. But we wish to argue that here the aspect of the flexibility of the model is privileged, for a reasonable computing time, regarding the one of choosing the hyper-parameters for which a solid experimental protocol is need, and thus leads to a strong computational load, especially in this large-scale context.
