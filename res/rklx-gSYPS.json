We are adding more experiments and benchmarks in response to your comments. \n\nQ: The techniques used to learn the preconditioner are heuristic, not scalable and without justification or ablation studies.\nA: The specific algorithm we build upon (DPGD, Maddison et. al 2019) is currently difficult to use practice: there is no theoretical or heuristical way of selecting a pre-conditioner for this algorithm. We propose the first existing method to chose such a pre-conditioner automatically. This method is motivated by a theoretical observation ($\\nabla f^*$ is a perfect pre-conditioner for the DPGD algorithm) and gives unmatched results on specific optimization problems.\n\nQ: It does not compare against \u201cstandard\u201d optimization techniques that construct data-driven preconditioners such as Adam or Adagrad or even to more Newton, natural gradient methods that use the Hessian or the Fisher information matrix as preconditioners.\nA: We agree that we could have compared our method with advanced optimization technics. However, the methods listed above might not be appropriate. Adam and Adagrad are known to be efficient with stochastic objectives (some convergence results even require stochasticity, cf arxiv: 1810.02263) which is not the setting of DPGD. Newton and natural gradient require matrix inversion at each step and are therefore even less scalable, but they would indeed have made good benchmarks. \n\nQ: Section 2: Please explain why Legendre functions are useful in ML. What constraints do you need on f? What functions satisfy these?\nA: Our objective is to efficiently solve convex optimization problems. This might seem restricted in the field of machine learning but has numerous applications. Legendre is a large class of convex functions. The Legendre assumption is one of the assumptions needed to ensure convergence of the dual-space preconditioning algorithm. It is the assumption made by Maddison et. al, 2019. We needed to make this assumption to be able to restate their results. \n\nQ: For assumption 1, 2; it needs to be explained why these hold for a given $f^*$.\nA: $f$ is Legendre iif  $f^*$ is Legendre (cf. Proposition 1)\n\nQ: Section 3: What is the number of points $x_i$ needed in high dimensions to learn?\nA: We do not have theoretical results, but this may be difficult to obtain in the context of deep learning.\n\nQ: Is it even possible to scale up this method to high dimensions?\nA: The method we use to correct the input distribution doesn\u2019t scale. However, we only need this method when $f$ is non-smooth / non-strongly convex. In other cases, our algorithm does scale.\n \nQ: Constructing $\\mu$ requires computing the determinant of the Jacobian. What is the computational complexity?\nA: The complexity varies depending on the nature of the objective function. It comes mainly from the computation of the determinant and the computation or approximation of the Jacobian.\n\nQ: Moreover, it seems that we need access to the $\\nabla f(x)$ for all x in $D(f)$?\nA: This is indeed required for gradient descent. Note that we are doing deterministic optimization and therefore suppose we have access to exact gradients for every x in the dataset.\n\nQ: It is unclear that the cost of an inverse Hessian matrix is more than the procedure proposed in this paper.\nA: Supposing we have free access to the Hessian, matrix inversion is more expensive than matrix multiplication. A step requiring matrix inversion is, therefore, less expensive than a step requiring the evaluation of a neural network.\n\nQ: Please explain what is the advantage of this learned optimizer compared to other methods? Note that there is literature on non-smooth optimization and methods like sub-gradient descent can be used in this case.\nA: The subgradient algorithm typically requires the sublinearity of subgradients. Subgradient cannot be applied in the setting we consider, for example, it would not converge for a power function objective like $f(x) = x^{50}$. In such a case, because f is differentiable, a subgradient step is simply a gradient descent step, which does not converge in this case. \n\nQ: What is the justification for the selection of the loss function and log-rescaling?\nA: The MSE loss function is standard for regression. The justification for the choice of log-rescaling is in Appendix D. In summary, log-rescaling seems empirically adapted to rescale the power function dataset as it reduces the scale of large gradients but not of gradients close to zero.\n\nQ: The result of Lemma 1 is standard. Please acknowledge this.\nA: It is indeed standard, we will provide a reference.\n\nQ: Section 4: \u201cThe step-size is set to 1\". It seems that the optimizer has been overfit and engineered to work on this specific problem.\nA: This choice is justified by theory: in the theoretical observation mentioned above, the perfect preconditioner $\\nabla f^*$ is used with step-size 1."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2122/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2122/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["selimsepthuit@gmail.com", "adil.salim@kaust.edu.sa", "samuel.horvath@kaust.edu.sa", "filip.hanzely@kaust.edu.sa", "richtarik@gmail.com"], "title": "Learning to Optimize via Dual space Preconditioning", "authors": ["S\u00e9lim Chraibi", "Adil Salim", "Samuel Horv\u00e1th", "Filip Hanzely", "Peter Richt\u00e1rik"], "pdf": "/pdf/83d8f8de11b7f9f5baa1dfd6cf98722b845126e8.pdf", "abstract": "Preconditioning an minimization algorithm improve its convergence and can lead to a minimizer in one iteration in some extreme cases.
