We address the comments one by one below. Please let us know if there are any further concerns. \n\nWith regards to the choice of L2 instead of L1 for the reconstruction losses, this is an unfortunate typo made in the manuscript, which is now corrected. We used L1 norm for both $L_{Recon2}$ (Eq. 8) and $L_{Recon1}$ (Eq. 5), (Eq. 6) and used L2 norm for the cycle loss (Eq. 9) as can be seen in the supplementary code submitted with the paper.\n\nWe added an experiment to the ablation analysis where for loss $L_{Recon1}$ (Eq. 5),(Eq. 6) and loss $L_{Recon2}$ (Eq. 8)  the L1 norm is replaced with the L2 norm. We found the result to be comparable for the losses in Eq. 5 and Eq. 6 and inferior for the one in Eq. 8. Intuitively, since L1 encourages sparsity better than L2, it supports well localized masks. The revised version addresses this in Ablation Analysis section 4.1\n\nOur formulation of the domain confusion loss is similar to that of \u201cAdversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation\u201d (Tzeng et al. 2017) except where for Eq. 3, $E_c$ (the encoder of the common part) attempts to fool the discriminator, so that the encodings of both domain A and domain B would be classified as 1. Namely, the discriminator tries to distinguish between encodings of domain A and B, while $E_c$ attempts to produce an encoding which is indistinguishable for the discriminator.\n\nWhile the loss in Eq. 7 directly affects the mask generation, the losses in Eq. 3 and Eq. 5 affect it indirectly. Without the loss in Eq. 3, no disentanglement is possible, and the common encoder would contain all of the image information including the separate information. This means that the image produced by $D_A(E_c(b))$ is close to b and, therefore,  the generated mask is empty. \n\nFurthermore, without the loss of Eq. 5, we empirically observe that $D_A(E_c(b))$ outputs the image with the specific part intact (for example, the facial hair is not removed). This indirect effect on the disentanglement probably stems from the fact that without this loss, there is reconstruction only on faces with facial hair (the specific part). Thus, $E_c$ can encode generic facial hair information for shaved faces and have $E_c(b)$ and $E_c(a)$ still indistinguishable. Eq. 5 makes sure that $E_c$ won\u2019t encode facial hair for shaved faces, since it requires reconstruction of an image without facial hair. This is an interesting phenomenon and is worth investigating as future work.\n\nThe loss introduced in the first term of Eq. 8 ($L_{Recon2}^A$) encourages a minimal distance between $z(a,a)$ and $a$, where\n $z(a,a)= z^{raw}(a,a) \\otimes m(a, a) + a\\otimes(1-m(a,a))$ . Ideally, $z^{raw}$ would be equal to a, but since we use an encoder and a decoder which cannot auto-encode perfectly, we get that there is some distance between $z^{raw}$ and a. Hence, in order to minimize the distance between $z(a,a)$ and a, the network minimizes the size of the mask. Similar argument holds for $L_{Recon2}^B$.\n\nWith regards to running the loss term introduced in (Press et al., 2019) on top of the network introduced in Fig. 2, we found that the network fails in this case. The loss function of (Press et al., 2019) contains a domain confusion term that is equivalent to our domain confusion loss and a reconstruction loss which is $||D(E_c(a)) - a||_1$ + $||D(E_c(b),E_s(b)) - b||_1$. Note that the first term of this reconstruction loss is identical to Eq. 5. The second term needs to be adjusted to a mask formulation, as is done in Eq. 6. As we show quantitatively in the ablation study, without further regularization, the mask produced is very large and the output is of low quality. \n\nThe model trained to add glasses would not add a mustache. As future work, it may be interesting to study generalization beyond the attributes seen during training  by learning multiple attributes at once. \n\nRegarding previous methods such as Mejjati et al, we thank the reviewer for this observation. We have changed the text to emphasize that the adaptation of the previous work is not performed on the specific information of a guide image, as is in our case.\n\nWith regards to the binary mask threshold, most values are very close to 0 or 1. Early on during the experiments we found the value of 0.6 is visually appealing and we kept it for all experiments. See fig. 38  for the effect of changing this threshold. As can be seen, the change is minimal.\n\nAs shown in Tab. 7, there is a 6% difference in the size of the mask when $L_{Cycle}$ is removed. Indeed other losses further affect the size of the mask. \n\nFollowing the review, the citation style has been corrected in the revised version.\n\nFor L2_reg, please refer to the discussion at the end of the ablation analysis of section 4.1 (last 10 lines before last paragraph). \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1866/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1866/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["sagiebenaim@gmail.com", "ron.mokady@gmail.com", "wolf@fb.com", "amit.bermano@gmail.com"], "title": "Masked Based Unsupervised Content Transfer", "authors": ["Ron Mokady", "Sagie Benaim", "Lior Wolf", "Amit Bermano"], "pdf": "/pdf/b13c0059577e9b0336cdb2648d98320b62954582.pdf", "abstract": "We consider the problem of translating, in an unsupervised manner, between two domains where one contains some additional information compared to the other.

Unlike the disentanglement work, the introduced mask allows the adaptation to focus on the relevant content which substantially reduce the complexity of the generation. On the other hand, the proposed method extends the attention guided translation from the domain level to the instance level which allows more specific and diverse translations. Experiments on benchmark data shows both improved qualitative and quantitative results comparing to existing methods. It is really nice that the authors also considered the situation of generalization to out of domain images.\n\nHowever, I would encourage the authors to spend more discussion on the \"Method\" and \"Ablation Analysis\" sections to give a better illustration. First is the choice of the L2 norm in all the reconstruction losses, which is different from L1 norm used in both (Press et al., 2019) and (Mejjati et al., 2018). What is the advantage of using L2 instead of L1 norm here? Does it work better with the mask generation? Second, the domain confusion loss. The presence of both equation (3) and (4) are quite confusing and the domain confusion loss (3) seems different from traditional ones. In Table 7, it shows that the learned mask is empty without any of the losses (3), (5), (7). But only loss (7) is directly related to the mask generation. How does the loss (3) or (5) impact the mask learning? It is also unclear why the losses introduced in (8) would encourage the mask to be minimal despite the quantitative results shown in Table 7. Actually, I am very curious about the performance of the loss introduced in (Press et al., 2019) on top of the network introduced in Figure 2.\n\nOther comments:\n- It would be nice to see the out of domain transfer in the \"attribute\" domain. Ideally, the network should be able to detect \"difference\" in the image from domain B and apply it to the image from domain A. For example, the model is trained on faces without and with glasses, but applied to faces without and with facial hair. Indeed, the introduction of mask alleviates the decoder to learn the attribute itself, and provides the ability to locate the place of difference.\n- Please unify the citation style: there are both Press et al. (2019) and (Press et al., 2019) used.\n- In Section 2 under \"Mask Based Approaches\", the authors argued that the existing attention guided translation \"does not allow for the adaptation of the image information in the masked area\". I do not think this is the case. The existing work also introduced adaptation of the image information in the masked area. For example, the equation (1) in (Mejjati et al., 2018).\n- How is the binarized mask generated in inference? Specifically, how to determine the threshold?\n- In Section 4.1, the authors argued that \"without L_{Cycle} the masks produced include larger portions of the face\". But this actually produces the second smallest mask in Table 7.\n- What is the \"L2 reg\" in Table 7?\n- It would be good to show the sensitivity of the lambdas in the overall loss."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1866/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1866/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["sagiebenaim@gmail.com", "ron.mokady@gmail.com", "wolf@fb.com", "amit.bermano@gmail.com"], "title": "Masked Based Unsupervised Content Transfer", "authors": ["Ron Mokady", "Sagie Benaim", "Lior Wolf", "Amit Bermano"], "pdf": "/pdf/b13c0059577e9b0336cdb2648d98320b62954582.pdf", "abstract": "We consider the problem of translating, in an unsupervised manner, between two domains where one contains some additional information compared to the other.

The proposed method is also able to add or remove separate contents, and to enable weakly-supervised semantic segmentation of the separate part of each domain.\nThis work relates to the problem of content transfer between images. The proposed method consists of five networks: one encoder for common domain invariant features, one encoder for separate domain specific information, one network for mapping encodings from common features from both domains undistinguishable, a decoder that generates sample in the origin domain and a decoder that generates the image that combines content from the origin image and domain specific content from the target image. This last decoder also outputs a mask that focuses the attention of the model to the specific part.\nThe proposed model is trained using a combination of different losses: domain confusion loss, reconstruction losses, and cycle consistency losses. Ablation studies reported in the paper nicely show the contribution of each loss. The final loss is obtained by a weighted sum of the losses: how are the lambda coefficient chosen/learned?\nThe proposed method is evaluated on guided content transfer, out of domain manipulation, attribute removal, sequential content transfer, sequential attribute removal and content addition, weakly supervised segmentation of the domain specific content. Experimental results are clear, thorough and satisfactory, both quantitative and qualitative results are reported, as well as a user study. Presented results demonstrate the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach, and the analysis of the results helps understanding and emphasizing the contribution of the paper.\nInformation in appendix also enable reproducibility by providing parameters and architecture structure. \nOther comments: did you observe overfit for some choice of parameter? is your validation/test set large enough for evaluating results? did you observe biases in your method (e.g. to specific features/domain specific information)?"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1866/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1866/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["sagiebenaim@gmail.com", "ron.mokady@gmail.com", "wolf@fb.com", "amit.bermano@gmail.com"], "title": "Masked Based Unsupervised Content Transfer", "authors": ["Ron Mokady", "Sagie Benaim", "Lior Wolf", "Amit Bermano"], "pdf": "/pdf/b13c0059577e9b0336cdb2648d98320b62954582.pdf", "abstract": "We consider the problem of translating, in an unsupervised manner, between two domains where one contains some additional information compared to the other.
