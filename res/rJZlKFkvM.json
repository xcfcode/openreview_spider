However, this method requires using a beam search to decode sentences from the plain decoder for the training set, and then training the actor to encourage decoder to generate the highest-BLEU output in a single greedy decoding operation. However, this makes the training more costly, and also, why not let the actor learn directly from the ground truth rather than from the beam-search-generated results?
