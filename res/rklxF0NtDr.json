Experiments on visual reasoning tasks and on a noisy citation network classification task indicate competitive performance.\n\nThere are many interesting ideas in this paper and I believe that the overall approach/idea has merit and is interesting for the community. In its current state, however, the paper has issues in terms of clarity of writing, technical and notational mistakes, unclear experimental settings and unclear implementation of baseline models, and needs a major revision, hence I recommend reject. This feedback is mostly meant as an encouragement to \u201cpolish\u201d the ideas outlined in the paper and their presentation, as I believe that these can be quite impactful, if presented well and once all technical issues have been addressed.\n\nDiscussion of the main idea outlined in this paper: \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThe proposed dynamic message passing procedure (termed \u201creasoning agents\u201d in the paper) can be understood as an extension of Neural Relational Inference (NRI; Kipf et al., ICML 2018), where a Gumbel softmax-based attention mechanism in parallel softly assigns a particular message function per edge in the graph. The main difference to NRI is that this is done sequentially over multiple message passing steps in the graph, whereas NRI (in the training phase) only performs one single such step (for all edges in the graph). \n\nGetting this to work well in practice is a challenging problem, as sequential sampling steps can accumulate biases in the approximate inference scheme. The authors propose to address this issue in a number of ways: the attention mechanism per edge is coupled over time steps via a local hidden state and coupled to all other edges via a global hidden state (this is novel), a vector of ones is added to the action probabilities and subsequently re-normalized to act as a regularizer (this appears to be a hack), they use a learned prior distribution instead of a fixed prior as in NRI, and lastly, the authors introduce a mixed sampling strategy which mixes samples from the (learned) prior distribution for edge types and the proposal distribution while re-weighing the objective with importance sampling weights \u2014 for this last contribution (mixing + reweighing) the description in the paper misses some details (how precisely is the mixing done over the course of training?).\n\nClarity, technical correctness, experimental evaluation\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n* The paper contains a lot of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors, making it difficult to read.\n* Notational issues: Eq 3 is unclear (no node/edge indices provided, function arguments unspecific \u2014 all three functions have the same arguments); Eq. 8/9 switches between posteriors p, true posteriors \\pi^* (what\u2019s the difference from p?) and priors \\pi without explanation\u2014 a derivation would be helpful. Eq. 10 only places a prior on the first time step \u2014 where does this come from? A derivation would be helpful.\n* \u201cBelief propagation or other neural message passing frameworks define a delta function where the prior is deterministic and fixed\u201d -> this is not the case for NRI\n* What temperature is used for the Gumbel softmax distribution? Does the forward pass use \u201chard\u201d (straight-through trick) or soft activations?\n* Eq. 5: Why condition B on the indices i and j? This will likely not generalize to new edges\n* Eq. 6: What is the motivation for adding a vector of ones? Wouldn't it be possible to achieve the desired regularization effect by increasing the softmax temperature?\n* How are the edge and global hidden states initialized?\n* The explanation for the mixed sampling procedure is unclear, please elaborate (potentially use an appendix)\n* What are the train/val/test splits, how are hyper parameters optimized in all experiments?\n* Why implement attention-based GNN baselines with sigmoid gates even though you cite Transformers and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) in this paragraph? I suspect that multi-head dot product attention (default for Transformers/GAT) instead of sigmoid gating would perform much better.\n* Please explain the architecture / experimental setting used in the GNN and RRN baselines in an appendix.

I think the motivation is reasonable and the experiment on Jigsaw Puzzle is impressive. But the writing and other experiments can be further improved, as detailed below.\n\nSec 3.1: What does ```````+1 mean in Eq. (6)?\n\nSec 3.2: The choice for the variational distribution q is not mentioned. Is q a parametric model (e.g., NN) or non-parametric? It is hard to connect prior, posterior and variational posterior in Sec 3.2 to the reasoning agent/message formulation in Sec 3.1. I suggest reformulating Sec 3.1 & 3.2 to give a thorough presentation of the training objective, model structure and optimization details of PMP.\n\nModeling graph using graph neural network with Bayesian framework has been investigated in several papers, e.g., [1-2]. They also take a probabilistic perspective. I think this paper should discuss the connections to previous Bayesian GNNs and compare their performance with PMP at least in Sec 4.2. Besides, GNN with edge information (e.g., [3]) has also been investigated in several papers. According to my understanding, PMP can also be regarded as a GNN with latent edge information (modeled with a learnable prior and inferred with a variational posterior). So I think adding discussion/experiment to them can better support your claim.\n\nAs for the experiment part, my major concern is whether the comparison with other models (e.g., GCN and GAT) is fair. It seems that the number of parameters of PMP is much larger than GCN and GAT. Could you provide details for the model size and the training/inference time cost?\n\nSec 4.2.

In this paper, we present the Policy Message Passing algorithm, which takes a probabilistic perspective and reformulates the whole information aggregation as stochastic sequential processes. The algorithm works on a much larger search space, utilizes reasoning history to perform inference, and is robust to noisy edges. We apply our algorithm to multiple complex graph reasoning and prediction tasks and show that our algorithm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph-structured models by a significant margin.", "keywords": ["graph inference algorithm", "graph reasoning", "variational inference"], "paperhash": "deng|policy_message_passing_a_new_algorithm_for_probabilistic_graph_inference", "original_pdf": "/attachment/56bdfd826120e5151de346a2afbb5b0e3230e801.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\ndeng2020policy,\ntitle={Policy Message Passing: A New Algorithm for Probabilistic Graph Inference},\nauthor={Zhiwei Deng and Greg Mori},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rklxF0NtDr}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
