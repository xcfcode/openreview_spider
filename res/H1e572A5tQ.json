If agents are sharing the reward then why should targeted communication be beneficial at all? Isn't the optimal strategy to just communicate everything to everyone? I understand that they should be selective at the listening side to properly integrate only the relevant information (so, attend over all received messages), but why should we expect the speaker to apriori know who this message should go to? Moreover, I don't really understand how targeted communication can even work (in the way the authors explain it) since the agents have partial information (e.g., in shapes they only see 5x5 around them), so they don't really know who is where -- but I could potentially see this working should the agents put information about their own identity and location. So, given the positive results that the authors get, my understanding is that the signature doesn't have information about who should the recipient of the information be but more about what where the properties of the sender of this information. So, based on my understanding, I don't feel that the flow of the story quite matches what is really happening and this might be very confusing for prospective readers. Can the authors elaborate on this, aim i getting things wrong?\u201d\n\nIn the SHAPES environment, in addition to a 5x5 image observation as input, the agents also get as input -- 1) an embedding of the goal they are supposed to navigate to, and 2) their own coordinates. 2 was missing from the description in the paper, we have added it in the revised version (apologies for this). So yes, agents do know where they are, and each agent is free to communicate any of this information with other agents.\n\nEach agent predicts three vectors for communication \u2014 signature, query, and value (Fig 1 and Eq 1). The communication is targeted because the attention probabilities are a function of both the sender\u2019s signature and receiver's query vectors. So it is not just the receiver deciding how much of each message to listen to. That is, it is not just targeted listening. The sender also sends out signatures that affects how much of each message is sent to each receiver. \n\nThe sender's signature could encode parts of its observation most relevant to other agents' goals (for example, it would be futile to convey coordinates in the signature). And the message value could contain the agent's own location. For example, in Fig 2a, we see that when agent 2 passes by blue, agent 4 starts attending to agent 2. Here, agent 2's signature encodes the color it observes (which is blue), and agent 4's query encodes its goal (which is also blue) leading to high attention probability. And agent 2's message value likely encodes coordinates for agent 4 to navigate to. We have included a discussion on this in Section 5.1.\n\n> \u201cThere is literally no information about model size (or at least I wasn't able to find any). Is there any weight-sharing across agents? Do you obtain CommNets by using the implementations of the authors or by ablating the signature-part of your model? \u201c\n\nEach agent's GRU hidden state is 128-d, message signature/query is 16-d, and message value is 32-d (unless specified otherwise). We have updated section 5 with model size details (in orange). And yes, as mentioned in section 4, all agents share the same set of parameters.\n\nResults for CommNets are from their paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07736), and we benchmark our models on the same environment configurations as their paper using code obtained from the authors.\n\n> \u201cMoreover, why do agents have a limited view window on the SHAPES -- is (targeted) communication redundant when agents have full observability?\u201d\n\nYes, communication is not needed when agents have full observability. In SHAPES and House3D, agents would know where the goal is, and in Traffic Junction, they would know the position of every other car, so they can navigate and maximize reward without having to communicate.\n\n> \u201cThe part about how multi-staged communication is implemented is quite cryptic at the moment -- is multi-staged the fact that the message is outputted by processing with a recurrent unit?\u201d\n\nMulti-stage communication refers to the fact that agents are allowed to aggregate and exchange messages multiple times before taking one action in the environment. Concretely, Eq 4 is used to compute an updated hidden state for each agent from the aggregated message at previous timestep, followed by repeating Eq 1-3 to perform the next round of exchange of messages."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1383/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1383/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1383/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "TarMAC: Targeted Multi-Agent Communication", "abstract": "We explore the collaborative multi-agent setting where a team of deep reinforcement learning agents attempt to solve a shared task in partially observable environments.

Although this is still with the factorization into two parts, it captures change in performance with increase in model parameters. We find that simply increasing message size has little change in performance, and most of the gains come from multiple rounds of communication.\n\n> \u201cFinally, if the premises of the paper is to define more effective communication protocols, evident in the use of continuous communication, (rather than studying what form can multi-agent communication etc etc), a necessary baseline (especially in cases where agents share reward), is to communicate the full observation (rather than a function of it). This baseline is not presented here and it's absolutely necessary.\u201d\n\nOn all 3 tasks studied in this work, a setting where each agent communicates its complete observation as the message, performs as well as TarMAC, and both outperform no attention (i.e. mean pooling messages). This is expected, since our environments are perceptually less complex than real-world scenarios. In principle, learning to communicate a function of the observation as in TarMAC allows compact representations of the observation to be transmitted, which is desirable in high-dimensional real-world observation spaces, where it would be infeasible and/or expensive to communicate complete observations, for example, a network of cars perceiving through a host of sensors, or a team of robots playing soccer."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1383/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1383/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1383/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "TarMAC: Targeted Multi-Agent Communication", "abstract": "We explore the collaborative multi-agent setting where a team of deep reinforcement learning agents attempt to solve a shared task in partially observable environments.

Why not use a gated architecture here?\u201d\n\nYes, for a fair comparison to CommNets (Sukhbaatar et al., 2016) we use a formulation similar to a vanilla RNN. Indeed, gated recurrent units and other techniques can be employed to stabilize training in RNNs in multi-stage communication and would be interesting to explore in the future.

Could the authors illustrate the benefit of multi-stage e.g. vs. the communication channel width?\u201d\n\nWe evaluated TarMAC on the hard variant of the traffic junction task with 1-stage and 2-stage communication and varying message value sizes. As can be seen in figure 3 in the revised draft, multiple rounds of communication leads to significantly higher performance than simply increasing message size, demonstrating the advantage of multi-stage communication. In fact, decreasing message size to a single scalar performs almost as well as when the message is 64-d (note that signature and query sizes were fixed at 32-d while we changed message value size), perhaps because even a single real number can be sufficiently partitioned to cover the space of meanings/messages that need to be conveyed for this task. We have added this discussion at the end of section 5.2.\n\n> \u201c2) In DIAL, the authors introduce a \"null\" action, what is the difference of that and multi-stage?\u201d\n\nOur understanding is that the reviewer is referring to the \"None\" action in the switch riddle game in DIAL. If that's the case, then the main difference is that the \"None\" action is an environment action that has an impact on the environment itself - whereas during our multi-stage communication, no environment actions are taken, but rather the agents are deliberating internally, sending back-and-forth messages multiple times before taking an environment action.\n\n> \u201c3) It is not clear to the reader what is the contribution of targeted communication vs. non-targeted as it looks a solution to the mean-pooling. Could the authors include at least one more experiment with on an architecture that doesn't use mean pooling. From an architecture perspective there is a scalability benefit of using pooling, but if that's the only one it has to be made more clear. 4) Following (3) based on Reddit there was a recent code release in python https://github.com/minqi/learning-to-communicate-pytorch. An alternative would be to evaluate TarMAC to one of the test beds, but the paper misses baselines.\u201d\n\nThe \"No attention\" baselines in tables 2 and 4, and CommNets in table 3 all rely on mean-pooling, as opposed to TarMAC, which makes use of attentional pooling. TarMAC outperforms all mean-pooling baselines across SHAPES, Traffic Junction, and House3D. Results for CommNets are from their paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07736), and we benchmark our models on the same environment configurations as their paper using code obtained from the authors.\n\nThe learnt communication is targeted because the attention probabilities are a function of both the sender\u2019s signature and receiver's query vectors. So it is not just the receiver deciding how much of each message to listen to. That is, it is not just targeted listening. The sender also sends out signatures that affects how much of each message is sent to each receiver. For example in SHAPES, the sender can direct a message to \u201cthose looking for red objects\u201d by encoding this in the signature. We have included a detailed discussion on this at the end of section 5.1 in the revised version.\n\nAn architecture with no message pooling mechanism (attentional, mean, etc.) and with message concatenation instead has several crucial limitations -- 1) number of parameters scale linearly with number of agents, 2) no support for variable number of agents at training/test time -- both severely limiting scalability. For instance, in the traffic junction environment, the number of active cars in the system keeps changing across timesteps (violet curve in Fig 4c), so this experiment just cannot be run in this environment.\n\nSo yes, TarMAC provides scalability benefits owing to attentional pooling -- by supporting a compact model size while allowing variable team sizes -- but also imparts intermediate interpretability to the communication channel through predicted attention probabilities, and outperforms mean-pooling across experiments."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1383/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1383/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1383/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "TarMAC: Targeted Multi-Agent Communication", "abstract": "We explore the collaborative multi-agent setting where a team of deep reinforcement learning agents attempt to solve a shared task in partially observable environments.

When receiving the message the listener produces an attention key that is used to selectively attend to some messages more than other using soft attention. This differs from the typical 'broadcasting' protocols learned in literature. \n\nQuestions / Comments: \n- Eqn (4) looks like a vanilla RNN. Did you experience any issues around exploding or vanishing gradients when doing multiple rounds of communication? Why not use a gated architecture here? \n- \"Centralized Critic\" section: This equation is from the COMA paper, ie. a centralised critic with policy gradients rather than DDPG. What did you use for the variance reduction baseline to estimate the advantage? Also, did you try conditioning the critic on the central state rather than the concat of observations? Formally this is required for the algorithm to be convergent. \n- How many independent seeds are the results averaged over? \n- The attention mechanism seems to provide very little value across all experiments: \n-- 84.9% vs 82.7% \n-- 89.5% vs 89.6% \n-- 64.3% vs 68.9% \nDid you check if any of these numbers are significant? This is my single biggest concern with the paper. Currently it's unclear whether attention is required at all in the settings presented. It would be good to see eg. the TarMAC 2-stage on the traffic junction (97.1%) ablated without attention.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1383/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "TarMAC: Targeted Multi-Agent Communication", "abstract": "We explore the collaborative multi-agent setting where a team of deep reinforcement learning agents attempt to solve a shared task in partially observable environments.

Isn't the optimal strategy to just communicate everything to everyone? I understand that they should be selective at the listening side to properly integrate only the relevant information (so, attend over all received messages), but why should we expect the speaker to apriori know who this message should go to? Moreover, I don't really understand how targeted communication can even work (in the way the authors explain it) since the agents have partial information (e.g., in shapes they only see 5x5 around them), so they don't really know who is where --  but I could potentially see this working should the agents put information about their own identity and location.  So, given the positive results that the authors get, my understanding is that the signature doesn't have information about who should the recipient of the information be but more about what where the properties of the sender of this information.  So, based on my understanding, I don't feel that the flow of the story quite matches what is really happening and this might be very confusing for prospective readers. Can the authors elaborate on this, aim i getting things wrong?\n\nThere is literally no information about model size (or at least I wasn't able to find any). Is there any weight-sharing across agents? Do you obtain CommNets by using the implementations of the authors or by ablating the signature-part of your model? Moreover, why do agents have a limited view window on the SHAPES -- is (targeted) communication redundant when agents have full observability? The part about how multi-staged communication is implemented is quite cryptic at the moment -- is multi-staged the fact that the message is out-putted by processing with a recurrent unit? The messages is factorized into two parts k and u leading to a vector of size D -- what happens should we have one message of size D (rather than factorizing into 2), something like this would control for any improvements obtained from increases the parameters of the model.\n\nFinally,  if the premises of the paper is to define more effective communication protocols, evident in the use of continuous communication, (rather than studying what form can multi-agent communication etc etc), a necessary baseline  (especially in cases where agents share reward), is to communicate the full observation (rather than a function of it).  This baseline is not presented here and it's absolutely necessary.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1383/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "TarMAC: Targeted Multi-Agent Communication", "abstract": "We explore the collaborative multi-agent setting where a team of deep reinforcement learning agents attempt to solve a shared task in partially observable environments.
