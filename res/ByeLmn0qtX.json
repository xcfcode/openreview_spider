From the Method section, I am not sure whether this is a valid statement. In my understanding, equation (1) is the KL summation of all the domains. The following derivation assumes that the data of all the domains draw a distribution p(x) (which is the prior), and the data of each domain has a specific distribution p^(i)(x) (which is the posterior). Do you assume that all the domains from D_i to D_n are target domains? Then, what are the source domains?\n \nIn fact, the image set of the target domain p(x|D_i) was contained in the source domain p(x).\nSpecifically, p(x) is a whole face image set, and p(x|D_i) is a face image set that people (i) like.\nTo consider domain transfer when the image set of the source domain and the image set of the target domain are independent, we prepared two target domain sets p(x|D_1) and p(x|D_2).\nYou can see that p(x|D_1) should be a source domain set and p(x|D_2) a target domain set.\n\n> (3) From eq.(2) to eq.(3), why p(D_i) = \\lamda_i is assumed? Is p(D_i) related to the number of the instance in D_i?\n \nYes, \\lambda_i is the percentage of D_i.\n \n> (4) In the prior part of eq.(3), it should have a p(D_i|x) before log p_\\theta(x), right?\n \nYes. Thank you for the observation.\n \n> Where is f(\\hat_{D}|x), in the first line of page 4, used?\n \nWe did not use it.\n \n> What are the optimizers: g and g_e?\n \nThe optimizer g is for both the VAE encoder and decoder; g_e is the optimizer for the VAE encoder. Both the optimizers are Adam.\n \n> Regarding the experimental studies, what do you want to conclude from the visualization of the domain embeddings? It would be better to give more discussion, analyses or observation for the visualization.\n \nVisualizing the domain embeddings, we showed that the original image set p(x) can be transformed into the image set p(x|D_i) of multiple domains.\nHowever, we think that there were some unclear parts; therefore, we changed the image to a clearer image with a graph of quantitative comparison with other models. Please see the image on p. 8.\n \n>  For the comparison result with StarGAN, could you elaborate the experimental settings for each method? Could you give more explanation on why MD-VAE outperforms StarGAN.\n \nIn the comparison experiment with the existing method, the test images of the CelebA domain transferred by the methods were compared using DIS and changing the parameter five times.\nSince the CelebA dataset had 40 kinds of attributes, we changed the number of attributes, such as 5, 10, 20, 40, and performed domain transformation. Please see the results on p. 7.\n \n> Furthermore, are there any other state-of-the-art baselines that can be compared?\n \nWe added experiments of UFDN (NIPS, 2018) to the experimental results (p. 7) of the body.\nThe reason for choosing UFDN is that SOTA of the domain transfer is StarGAN in the method based on GAN, but it is UFDN in the method based on VAE."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1359/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1359/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1359/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variational Domain Adaptation", "abstract": "This paper proposes variational domain adaptation, a unified, scalable, simple framework for learning multiple distributions through variational inference.

It is a bit odd: actually they worked mostly on a special (relatively new) dataset named \"SCUT-FBP-5500,\" which seemed to contain the labeled samples (x,D1,...,Dn). Then, obviously we could access x|Di as well as Di|x. Of course, this type of fully labeled dataset is small in size.\n \nSince the samples from p(x|D_i) were not large to clearly generate images, we needed to obtain a sample from p(x) instead of p(x|D_i).\n \n> One issue lies in the latent prior learning (ie, optimization of (3)). Since they need to evaluate P(Di|x), x is limited to the labeled samples, namely those from the (small-sized) SCUT-FBP-5500 dataset only. So although they wrote expectation wrt p(x) in (3), the p(x) cannot be a large dataset like the CelebA dataset as they intended, but p(x) is limited to a small dataset like SCUT-FBP. The large samples from p(x) are only exploited in the VAE learning part.\n \nPlease explain this again because we are unable to understand the meaning of \u201cthe p(x) cannot be a large dataset like the CelebA dataset.\u201d\nWe used the CelebA dataset as a prior distribution of facial images because clear images could not be generated using only the SCUT dataset.\n\n> The experimental evaluation was weak; it was evaluated on only one dataset, as compared with the standard VAE and StarGAN, which were not aimed for the particular problem setup that the authors were considering.\n\nIn response to your suggestions, we performed the experiments again with two additional datasets:\n    1.

MNIST (10 domains)\nThe experiments showed good result and the details of the results have been added in the appendix.\n \nAs written in the revised paper, in the experiments using the SCUT-FBP-5500 dataset, we regarded the preference of one person as one domain.\nIn additional experiments using CelebA and MNIST, we performed domain transfer of facial image attributes and numeric labels, respectively.\nWe also conducted additional comparison experiments using CelebA with UFDN (NIPS, 2018), CVAE.\nUFDN was chosen because the SOTA of the domain transfer was StarGAN in the method based on GAN but it was UFDN in the method based on VAE.\nMoreover, since the proposed method is a model that extends CVAE, we also compared it with the original CVAE.\nPlease see the updated results on page 7.\n\n> At least, they may be able to compare it with a baseline approach, e.g., using the samples from p(x|D_i) available from the SCUT dataset (small though), one can learn encoder/decoder models for each D_i.\n\nYes, we experimentally confirmed that the DualVAE is more accurate than the single domain VAEs (SD-VAEs) learned independently in each domain by an experiment using SCUT-FBP-5500 (60 domains).\nThis is stated in the original paper in the SDVAE vs MDVAE paragraph (p.7).\n\n> There appears to be identity changes in many of the face image preference examples. This is unexpected. I would be more inclined to believe that personal preferences are about appearance (style) features rather than identify; yet, most examples in Fig. 6 indicate the opposite.\n\nSince the image in Fig. 6 was not explained, the explanation was added in section E (p.14).\nThis figure shows that by averaging the embedding of domains, DualVAE generates images that are preferred for multiple people.\nHowever, the more preferred the image, the more the identity will change as you have pointed out.\nTherefore, it is important to continuously adjust the parameters to the extent that the identity does not change."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1359/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1359/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1359/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variational Domain Adaptation", "abstract": "This paper proposes variational domain adaptation, a unified, scalable, simple framework for learning multiple distributions through variational inference.

The domains, D1,...,Dn, may refer to person-specific preferred images, for instance, and they focus on how to build generative models P(x|Di), which represents a set of images preferred by subject i.\n\nThey assumed a specific setup where one can access domain classifiers P(Di|x), but not the samples from P(x|Di). It is a bit odd: actually they worked mostly on a special (relatively new) dataset named \"SCUT-FBP-5500\", which seems to contain labeled samples, (x,D1,...,Dn) -- then, obviously we can access x|Di as well as Di|x. Of course, this type of fully labeled dataset is small-sized.\n\nTheir approach is basically to partition the latent space by the domains D1,...,Dn. They utilize the standard VAE model which is shared across the domains, and introduce domain-specific latent priors P(z|D_i) which are Gaussians. The learning is essentially a combination of the VAE learning and the latent prior learning, where the latter is done by enforcing the generated samples x from each Di to be consistent with the domain classifier P(Di|x). This strategy sounds reasonable enough.\n\nOne issue lies in the latent prior learning (ie, optimization of (3)). Since they need to evaluate P(Di|x), x is limited to the labeled samples, namely those from the (small-sized) SCUT-FBP-5500 dataset only. So although they wrote expectation wrt p(x) in (3), the p(x) cannot be a large dataset like the CelebA dataset as they intended, but p(x) is limited to a small dataset like SCUT-FBP. The large samples from p(x) are only exploited in the VAE learning part.\n\nThe experimental evaluation is weak: evaluated on only one dataset, compared with just standard VAE and StarGAN which are not aimed for the particular problem setup the authors are considering.\n\nAt least, they may be able to compare it with a baseline approach, e.g., using the samples from p(x|D_i) available from the SCUT dataset (small though), one can learn encoder/decoder models for each D_i.\n\n2) Strengths:\n\nRelatively unique problem (but unusual and unintuitive setup) and a reasonable approach.\n\n3) Weak points:\n\n-The writing is sloppy. It doesn't read very well, and difficult to follow. Contains many typos.\n\n-Weak in experimental evaluation and comparison with other (baseline) approaches.\n\n-There appears to exist identity change in many of face image preference examples.  This is unexpected.  I would be more inclined to believe that personal preferences are about appearance (style) features rather than identify.  Yet most examples in Fig.6 indicate the opposite.\n\n- Writing would benefit from laying out intuition beyond both the model and the experimental results.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1359/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variational Domain Adaptation", "abstract": "This paper proposes variational domain adaptation, a unified, scalable, simple framework for learning multiple distributions through variational inference.

The proposed framework assumes a prior, and models each domain as a posterior. A multi-domain variational auto-encoder is then proposed to implement the concept of multi-domain semi-supervision. Experimental studies are done to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.\n\nThis paper does not deal with the conventional domain adaptation problem as many existing domain adaptation works do. It focuses on the adaptation task of data generation. Here are some comments:\n(1)\tIt would be better to clarify the adaptation task by giving a concrete real-word example in the introduction. Specifically, you may want to specify what the source and target tasks are, and what the assumption you have made on the source and target tasks is.\n(2)\tIn the abstract and introduction, you state that a source domain is regarded as a prior, and target domain is regarded as posterior. From the Method section, I am not sure whether this is a valid statement. In my understanding, equation (1) is the KL summation of all the domains. The following derivation assumes that the data of all the domains draw a distribution p(x) (which is the prior), and the data of each domain has a specific distribution p^(i)(x) (which is the posterior).  Do you assume that all the domains from D_i to D_n are target domains? Then, what are the source domains?\n(3)\tFrom eq.(2) to eq.(3), why p(D_i) = \\lamda_i is assumed? Is p(D_i) related to the number of the instance in D_i?\n(4)\tIn the prior part of eq.(3), it should have a p(D_i|x) before log p_\\theta(x), right? Where is f(\\hat_{D}|x), in the first line of page 4, used? What are the optimizers: g and g_e?\n(5)\tRegarding the experimental studies, what do you want to conclude from the visualization of the domain embeddings? It would be better to give more discussion, analyses or observation for the visualization. For the comparison result with StarGAN, could you elaborate the experimental settings for each method? Could you give more explanation on why MD-VAE outperforms StarGAN. Furthermore, are there any other state-of-the-art baselines that can be compared?  \n\nOverall, I think this is an interesting paper. However, there are some unclear parts need to be further clarified. The experimental studies are a litter weak in the sense that (1) it needs more discussion and analyses on the results; and (2) more baselines need to be compared. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1359/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variational Domain Adaptation", "abstract": "This paper proposes variational domain adaptation, a unified, scalable, simple framework for learning multiple distributions through variational inference.

Firstly, the  samples from the target are not required. Instead, the framework requires one known source as a prior $p(x)$ and binary discriminators, $p(\\mathcal{D}_i|x)$, discriminating the target domain $\\mathcal{D}_i$ from others. Consequently, the framework regards a target as a posterior that can be explicitly formulated through the Bayesian inference, $p(x|\\mathcal{D}_i) \\propto p(\\mathcal{D}_i|x)p(x)$, as exhibited by a further proposed model of dual variational autoencoder (DualVAE). Secondly, the framework is scablable to large-scale domains. As well as VAE encodes a sample $x$ as a mode on a latent space: $\\mu(x) \\in \\mathcal{Z}$, DualVAE encodes a domain $\\mathcal{D}_i$ as a mode on the dual latent space $\\mu^*(\\mathcal{D}_i) \\in \\mathcal{Z}^*$, named domain embedding. It reformulates the posterior with a natural paring $\\langle, \\rangle: \\mathcal{Z} \\times \\mathcal{Z}^* \\rightarrow \\Real$, which can be expanded to uncountable infinite domains such as continuous domains as well as interpolation. Thirdly, DualVAE fastly converges without sophisticated automatic/manual hyperparameter search in comparison to GANs as it requires only one additional parameter to VAE. Through the numerical experiment, we demonstrate the three benefits with multi-domain image generation task on CelebA with up to 60 domains, and exhibits that DualVAE records the state-of-the-art performance outperforming StarGAN and UFDN.", "keywords": ["domain adaptation", "variational inference", "multi-domain"], "authorids": ["ohsawa@weblab.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp"], "authors": ["Hirono Okamoto", "Shohei Ohsawa", "Itto Higuchi", "Haruka Murakami", "Mizuki Sango", "Zhenghang Cui", "Masahiro Suzuki", "Hiroshi Kajino", "Yutaka Matsuo"], "TL;DR": "This paper proposes variational domain adaptation, a uni\ufb01ed, scalable, simple framework for learning multiple distributions through variational inference", "pdf": "/pdf/b8204ea500d2f2991add09e3cf3e002f2f43bb9d.pdf", "paperhash": "okamoto|variational_domain_adaptation", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nokamoto2019variational,\ntitle={Variational Domain Adaptation},\nauthor={Hirono Okamoto and Shohei Ohsawa and Itto Higuchi and Haruka Murakami and Mizuki Sango and Zhenghang Cui and Masahiro Suzuki and Hiroshi Kajino and Yutaka Matsuo},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByeLmn0qtX},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1359/Public_Comment", "rdate": null, "ddate": null, "expdate": null, "duedate": null, "tmdate": 1542311616305, "tddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "reply": {"signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*|\\(anonymous\\)", "description": "How your identity will be displayed."}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "forum": "ByeLmn0qtX", "readers": {"description": "Select all user groups that should be able to read this comment.", "value-dropdown-hierarchy": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1359/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1359/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1359/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "replyto": null, "content": {"comment": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}", "required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters)."}, "title": {"value-regex": ".{1,500}", "required": true, "order": 0, "description": "Brief summary of your comment."}}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values-copied": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference", "{signatures}"]}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "invitees": ["~"], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1359/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1359/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1359/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "multiReply": true, "taskCompletionCount": null, "transform": null, "cdate": 1542311616305}}}], "count": 12}
