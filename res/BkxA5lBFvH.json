They build on a framework for model-based RL called PETS. \n\nThe approach goes as follows: \n\n2-step process\n * train probabilistic model-based RL agents in a \u201cpopulation of source domains\u201d\n * dropped into new environment use \u201cpessimistic exploration policy\u201d\n\nThen at test time, in order to compute estimates for the rewards for each action the authors use a \u201cparticle propagation\u201d technique for unrolling through their dynamics model .\n\nThe action is chosen by looking at the sum of the 0 through kth percentile rewards. \nThis is a weird choice. Why are they looking at a sum over quantiles vs a quantile itself?\n\nThe claim is that the models from the first stage capture the epistemic uncertainty due to not knowing z.\nHowever, the authors give a too scant a treatment of what these uncertainty estimates really mean.\nFor example, they appear to only be valid with respect to an assumed distribution over z.\nThe paper\u2019s experiments however focus in large part on what happens when the model is evaluated \non values of z that were outside the support of the distribution over training domains. \nIn this case, any benefit appears to be ill explained by the underlying motivation.\n\n\nThe next step here is to finetune the model as data is collected on the new domain.\n\nAuthors propose heuristics for this finetuning that include\n1. Drawing experiences from the past experiences (under different domains) and \n2. \u201ckeeping the model close to the original model\u201d, via some sort of regularization presumably.\n\n>>> \twhy isn\u2019t the exact nature of how they \u201ckeep the model near the original model explained in the text?\n\tperhaps the authors mean that 1. and 2. are one and the same (1 as  means to achieve 2)\n\tif this is the case, then the exposition should be improved to make this more clear.\n\n\nSome important details appear to be missing. For example, how many distinct source domains are seen during pretraining? Do they set z different z for every single episode of pretraining? Some language here is unclear, for example what precisely does an \u201citeration\u201d mean in the context of the experiments? \n\nThe choice to report \u201caverage maximum reward\u201d seems strange if what the authors care about is avoiding risk. Can they explain/justify this choice or if not, present a much more comprehensive set of experimental results?\n\nThe figures tracking catastrophic failures vs performance resembles those in \n\u201cCombating Reinforcement Learning's Sisyphean Curse with Intrinsic Fear\u201d  https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01211\nThis raises some question about why they don\u2019t if concerned with \u201ccatastrophic events\u201d model them more explicitly. \nElse, if the return accurately captures all desiderata, why to we need to count the failures?\n\nIn short this is a simpzle empirical paper that makes use of heuristic uncertainty estimates, \nincluding in settings when the estimates have no validity. The writing is reasonably clear\nand the ideas are straightforward (which is perfectly fine!). A few of the decisions are unnatural,\na few are ad hoc, and a few details are missing. Overall my sense is that this paper \nhas some good qualitities, including the clarity of much of the exposition, \nbut it\u2019s still below the mark to be an impactful ICLR paper. \n\n==========UPDATE=================\nI read the rebuttal and am glad that the authors took time to read my review and engage with the criticism as well as try to make some small improvements to the paper, especially exploring the impact on the number of training environments on the results (in the original paper the number of environments available at train time was unlimited). The answers to some of the other questions were less convincing. E.g. the seemingly incoherent objective of summing over the quantiles falls flat. Why should we care more about being a \"strict generalization\" of some previous algorithm built upon than of having a coherent objective?

We have now included a new baseline: Pinto et al, Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning, 2017 (\u201cRARL\u201d), per your suggestion. Specifically, we train RARL with an adversarial agent that can perturb the motor torques. We pretrain RARL for about 30x as many episodes as RADA (necessary for the model-free approach RARL employs), and evaluate adaptation to new environments similar to our approach. The results are now included in Fig 2, 3, and 4 in the paper. They show that RARL does indeed induce robustness during policy transfer. However, in our experiments, RARL adapts more slowly, yields worse rewards, and leads to more collisions than RADA. Please see Sec 5 and Figs 2, 3, and 4 for more details.\n\n=== \u201cWhy meta-learning baselines do not work?\u201d === \nWe have tried RL^2, MOLe, and GrBAL (a model-based variant of MAML). Unfortunately, none of these methods work well in our setting. In particular, training these methods has proven extremely unstable in our environment. Following the reviewer's suggestions, we have run experiments to analyze why metalearning fails --- our hypothesis was that it failed due to the large range of training environments. In our new expeirments, we decreased the range of pretraining car widths (from 0.05-0.099 in the paper to 0.05-0.06) in an attempt to stabilize metalearning. We tried training RL^2 and GrBAL once more with reasonable hyperparameter search around the authors\u2019 code defaults. Despite this, neither metalearning approach was able to successfully train. We have added a note on this in the paper.\n\n=== \u201cThe paper claims fast and safe adaptation, but isn\u2019t fast and safe impossible?\u201d === \nThere is indeed a tradeoff between how safe an agent is, and how fast it can hope to adapt. However, while standard RL and meta-RL approaches do not consider safety at all and therefore provide no ability to trade off safety for speed and vice versa, RADA provides an intuitive way to do this by setting a caution parameter (gamma in Eq 2). It then aims to provide pareto-efficient solutions that pay attention to both safety and adaptation speed, with gamma controlling where on the pareto-frontier the solution is.\n\n===\u201cI am confused about the sentence \u2018Since dynamics models do not need any manually specified reward function during training, the ensemble model can continue to be trained in the same ways as during the pretraining phase.\u2019 Without reward, what\u2019s the purpose of RL?\u201d === \nWe employ a model-based planning approach to RL, involving two steps: (i) a dynamics model is trained that predicts future states given current states and actions, and (ii) then, an action is selected not through a learned policy, but instead by optimizing for actions that produce the most desirable states as predicted by the learned dynamics model. So, the dynamics model is the only component that is learned, and it is task-agnostic and requires no rewards. This is convenient in our setting, since the dynamics models can be trained even in the unseen test environment, where no rewards are provided. RADA exploits this.\n\n=== \u201cWhat is the relationship between the generalized action score and the risk of catastrophic failure?\u201d === \nEq 2 defines the generalized action score. This score includes a caution parameter which controls the degree of pessimism with which an action sequence is evaluated during planning with the learned model. For instance, when caution gamma is 50, the generalized action score of an action sequence is the average score of the bottom half of the particles propagated through the model. This would capture any catastrophic failures resulting from those actions, at the cost of ignoring the most successful trajectories that yielded highest reward. As gamma increases, the failures are weighted more relative to the successes. This means that during planning, actions that have even a minor risk of failure are assigned a low generalized action score, and therefore avoided. The generalized action score thus allows control over the degree to which catastrophic failure is avoided.\n\n\u201csum_N\u201d -> \u201csum_i\u201d Thank you, we have fixed this and other minor typos now. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2491/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2491/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["jessezhang@berkeley.edu", "bcheung@berkeley.edu", "cbfinn@cs.stanford.edu", "dineshjayaraman@berkeley.edu", "svlevine@eecs.berkeley.edu"], "title": "Hope For The Best But Prepare For The Worst: Cautious Adaptation In RL Agents", "authors": ["Jesse Zhang", "Brian Cheung", "Chelsea Finn", "Dinesh Jayaraman", "Sergey Levine"], "pdf": "/pdf/8e9d18159b301518f6a24ed018e6392e3a2b3d66.pdf", "TL;DR": "Adaptation of an RL agent in a target environment with unknown dynamics is fast and safe when we transfer prior experience in a variety of environments and then select risk-averse actions during adaptation.", "abstract": "We study the problem of safe adaptation: given a model trained on a variety of past experiences for some task, can this model learn to perform that task in a new situation while avoiding catastrophic failure?

Do they really capture epistemic uncertainty due to not knowing z?\u201d === \nThank you. We have now added visualizations in Sec 5 (particularly Fig 5)  that show the predicted trajectories from our model for a fixed action sequence, and show how it captures the various possible behaviors among car widths encountered in the training data. This provides an empirical validation that the model is indeed able to capture the uncertainty due to unknown car width z. We also include an Appendix B (Fig 7) showing how the model predictions improve during pretraining time until it converges to approximately correctly model the epistemic uncertainty.\n\n=== \u201cz different for each episode at training?\u201d ===\nYes, for the results reported in the paper, we did sample z uniformly at random over the training distribution at the beginning of each episode. We have now added additional results in an appendix showing how RADA performance evolves as a function of the number of available pretraining environments. In particular, we sample a fixed number (2/5/10) of car widths before pretraining and sample uniformly from those during pretraining. Our results indicate that there are significant gains in performance (both reward as well as collision safety) from 2 to 5 to 10. At 10 fixed car widths, results are similar to those originally reported in the paper. \n\n=== The review points out that while we propose RADA for safe adaptation to new domains, it still builds on probabilistic models that were learned on training domains, which might perform poorly in unseen domains. === \nRADA incorporates an inductive bias for \u201ccaution\u201d: when dropped into a new environment, a RADA agent starts acting as though the environment is at least as difficult as the most difficult environments it has been trained on. Specifically, it makes the reasonable assumption that actions that rarely caused bad outcomes in training environments are also unlikely to cause bad outcomes in the unseen environments, and selects them. The intuition is that while the new environments are indeed outside the support of what our models could have learned from training environments, they are still within the support of this cautious inductive bias which is built into RADA. Our empirical results establish that RADA does generalize safely to held-out environments. \n\nThis built-in bias does not come for free: in environments that are easier than a RADA agent\u2019s training environments (such as smaller car widths in our setting), it would be overly cautious during adaptation to a new environment and thus take longer to reach an optimal policy. \n\n===\u201cWhy sum of 0th through kth quantile, rather than just the k^th quantile\u201d? === \nGood question, we made this choice so that the RADA would be a strict generalization of the PETS objective: at gamma=0, the RADA objective in Eq 2 exactly matches the PETS objective of Eq 1.\n\n=== \u201cWhy average maximum reward? If the return accurately captures all desiderata, why do we count the number of collisions (failures)?\u201d === \nWe care about two things: (i) quickly reaching good performance in the target environment, and (ii) safety during the adaptation process. To capture these two desiderata, we report both the average max reward (consistent with Chua et al 2018, which we build on), and the cumulative number of collisions during adaptation. In our experimental setting, collisions correspond to catastrophic states that we can't recover from, and which we aim for RADA to learn to avoid. While return and collisions are closely related in our environment, they do not capture exactly the same thing. In particular, collisions lead to low reward, but low reward does not always mean that a collision occurred. Instead, it might also be due to the agent steering left rather than right, or going about in circles, for example. So it is worthwhile to measure collisions separately to evaluate how safe adaptation is.\n\n=== \u201cKeep the model close to the original model. How?\u201d === \nYes, we meant that RADA does this by using past experience in training environments during the finetuning stage in the target environment. We have improved the exposition now to clarify this.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2491/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2491/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["jessezhang@berkeley.edu", "bcheung@berkeley.edu", "cbfinn@cs.stanford.edu", "dineshjayaraman@berkeley.edu", "svlevine@eecs.berkeley.edu"], "title": "Hope For The Best But Prepare For The Worst: Cautious Adaptation In RL Agents", "authors": ["Jesse Zhang", "Brian Cheung", "Chelsea Finn", "Dinesh Jayaraman", "Sergey Levine"], "pdf": "/pdf/8e9d18159b301518f6a24ed018e6392e3a2b3d66.pdf", "TL;DR": "Adaptation of an RL agent in a target environment with unknown dynamics is fast and safe when we transfer prior experience in a variety of environments and then select risk-averse actions during adaptation.", "abstract": "We study the problem of safe adaptation: given a model trained on a variety of past experiences for some task, can this model learn to perform that task in a new situation while avoiding catastrophic failure?

As stated in the introduction, \u201cenables fast yet safe adaptation within only a handful of episodes.\u201d Intuitively, we can not expect to be safe and fast at the same time.

RADA works in two steps: it first trains probabilistic model-based RL agents in a population of source domains to gain experience and capture epistemic uncertainty about the environment dynamics. Then, when dropped into a new environment, it employs a pessimistic exploration policy, selecting actions that have the best worst-case performance as forecasted by the probabilistic model. We show that this simple maximin policy accelerates domain adaptation in a safety-critical driving environment with varying vehicle sizes. We compare our approach against other approaches for adapting to new environments, including meta-reinforcement learning.", "keywords": ["safety", "risk", "uncertainty", "adaptation"], "paperhash": "zhang|hope_for_the_best_but_prepare_for_the_worst_cautious_adaptation_in_rl_agents", "original_pdf": "/attachment/bc328d3d1fbc9e69884cc4517b1a5d6d0f1d7d11.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nzhang2020hope,\ntitle={Hope For The Best But Prepare For The Worst: Cautious Adaptation In {\\{}RL{\\}} Agents},\nauthor={Jesse Zhang and Brian Cheung and Chelsea Finn and Dinesh Jayaraman and Sergey Levine},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkxA5lBFvH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
