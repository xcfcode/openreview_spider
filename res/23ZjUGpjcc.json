However, it is positioned uniquely and cleverly in that the approach is developed with scalability in mind. Within this setting, the paper is convincing. Although the approach does not come with strong backing theory, it is intuitive and seems to work well. During the discussions phase, the authors have clarified some questions that made the paper convincing, even if it is a relatively heuristic approach. The results are strong if one is concerned with both quantitative performance and efficiency, a combination of objectives very often encountered in practice. Overall, it is expected that this idea can stimulate further research along those lines, especially since this paper is very nice and easy to read."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Scalable Transfer Learning with Expert Models", "authorids": ["~Joan_Puigcerver1", "~Carlos_Riquelme_Ruiz1", "basilm@google.com", "~Cedric_Renggli1", "~Andr\u00e9_Susano_Pinto1", "~Sylvain_Gelly1", "~Daniel_Keysers2", "~Neil_Houlsby1"], "authors": ["Joan Puigcerver", "Carlos Riquelme Ruiz", "Basil Mustafa", "Cedric Renggli", "Andr\u00e9 Susano Pinto", "Sylvain Gelly", "Daniel Keysers", "Neil Houlsby"], "keywords": ["Transfer Learning", "Expert Models", "Few Shot"], "abstract": "Transfer of pre-trained representations can improve sample efficiency and reduce computational requirements for new tasks.

Empirical results show that their method outperform the baseline.\n\nStrength:\n1. The paper is clearly written and easy to understand.\n2. Exploiting the label hierarchy to train multiple experts and select the best one makes sense.\n\nWeakness:\n1. Maybe I am missing something, but I don't see much new insights from the paper. When doing multi-source transfer, selecting the best performing expert for the target task seems like a straightforward baseline.\n2. The method does show empirical improvements, but perhaps not strong enough. From IN21k to VTAB-1k, the full model achieves 71.4 while the baseline achieves 69.8 (2.29% relative improvement). From JFT to VTAB-1k, the full model achieves 70.2 while the baseline achieves 69.8 (0.57% relative improvement). \n\nOther questions:\n1. I didn't quite understand what do you mean by \"combining all experts\" in section 6.5. Is that the same as doing ensemble? If so I think the comparison between \"All Experts\" and \"Baseline\" is not very fair.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2224/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2224/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Scalable Transfer Learning with Expert Models", "authorids": ["~Joan_Puigcerver1", "~Carlos_Riquelme_Ruiz1", "basilm@google.com", "~Cedric_Renggli1", "~Andr\u00e9_Susano_Pinto1", "~Sylvain_Gelly1", "~Daniel_Keysers2", "~Neil_Houlsby1"], "authors": ["Joan Puigcerver", "Carlos Riquelme Ruiz", "Basil Mustafa", "Cedric Renggli", "Andr\u00e9 Susano Pinto", "Sylvain Gelly", "Daniel Keysers", "Neil Houlsby"], "keywords": ["Transfer Learning", "Expert Models", "Few Shot"], "abstract": "Transfer of pre-trained representations can improve sample efficiency and reduce computational requirements for new tasks.

But that is not the case, as shown by the fact that the average performance of this approach (the Baseline) is lower than that of any type of expert model. However, while in a couple of datasets the full model without any specialization may be the best one --when the downstream data resembles well the whole upstream data, for example--, using experts is quite helpful overall, and kNN is able to select the baseline model in such cases (see Table 4 in the appendix). \n\n\u201c*Full*\u201d and \u201c*Adapters*\u201d refer to the *parameters* of this model that are specialized *to a subset of JFT/ImageNet before any downstream fine-tuning*. These are essentially two alternative architectures for the expert models, both of which originate from the Baseline model. In both cases, we fine-tune (i.e. transfer) the entire expert model selected by kNN on the downstream task.\n\nGiven that after the rebuttal we have an upper limit of 9 pages, we will clarify this in Section 4 and the tables. To doubly clarify the terminology here:\n\n1. __Baseline (B):__ This is just transferring the ResNet-50 that was pre-trained on JFT or ImageNet21k. This is the standard practice in transfer learning.\n2. __Full:__ \n    * The baseline B hat has been *specialized* by further pre-training all parameters of the ResNet50 on a *subset* of upstream data, e.g. pre-training on data about \u2018cars\u2019 in ImageNet21k. We have a pool of such expert models, as we generate a separate \u2018expert\u2019 by pre-training on different subsets of the upstream data.\n    * We compare different methods to select which ResNet-50 expert to use, and show there is a significant improvement when we select such a specialised model for a new downstream task.\n        * We note that the baseline model B is part of that pool - if it is beneficial to select it (according to kNN accuracy), our method will choose it.\n3. __Adapters:__\n    * The adapters are an architectural adjustment to ResNets that we propose (Diagram in Figure 3, described in Section 4.1). It is a very small component, with approximately 6% of the parameters of the full ResNet-50. Only these extra parameters are specialized to a subset of the pre-training data, the rest are kept as in the Baseline model.\n    * Similar to above, we show significant improvements from transferring a single generalist model (baseline). The adapters however allow for particularly efficient training and reduced storage costs.\n        * Like with full models, the baseline model B (with no adapters) is part of that pool. Once again, our method can (and does) select it according to its kNN accuracy in some cases.\n4. __All Experts:__ \n    * We simply include in the pool the two types of expert architectures: \u201cFull\u201d and \u201cAdapters\u201d. \n    * This yields the best results, since some architectures are better suited for a particular downstream dataset than others, and kNN does a good job selecting the right one.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2224/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2224/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Scalable Transfer Learning with Expert Models", "authorids": ["~Joan_Puigcerver1", "~Carlos_Riquelme_Ruiz1", "basilm@google.com", "~Cedric_Renggli1", "~Andr\u00e9_Susano_Pinto1", "~Sylvain_Gelly1", "~Daniel_Keysers2", "~Neil_Houlsby1"], "authors": ["Joan Puigcerver", "Carlos Riquelme Ruiz", "Basil Mustafa", "Cedric Renggli", "Andr\u00e9 Susano Pinto", "Sylvain Gelly", "Daniel Keysers", "Neil Houlsby"], "keywords": ["Transfer Learning", "Expert Models", "Few Shot"], "abstract": "Transfer of pre-trained representations can improve sample efficiency and reduce computational requirements for new tasks.

We agree that the goal is (of course) to select \"the best performing expert\". However, the paper argues that the best way to do this *efficiently* is not obvious. With enough resources/time we may be able to transfer every model to the target task through fine-tuning and then select the best. Unfortunately, this is too expensive in practice in the presence of many upstream models. The key innovation in this paper is to propose a simple yet inexpensive proxy that is able to find the right model (or adapter) from a large pool *without* fully fine-tuning all the models. We compare a number of options, and also to methods such as DAT that use more expensive techniques to build task-dependent experts. We show that the proposed kNN approach performs well across several tasks.\n\n2. With JFT the best experts model attains +2% absolute, and with ImageNet-21k +1.6% absolute. These are quite large improvements for no (or very little) increase in final model size, since the benchmark is an average across 19 diverse datasets. For context, the authors of the original paper introducing the benchmark [arXiv:1910.04867](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.04867.pdf) report only a 2% absolute gain when increasing the network size from ResNet50x1 to ResNet152x2 (10 times more parameters) on Imagenet.\n\nRe: \u201cOther questions 1\u201d: \u201cAll experts\u201d means selecting from both the adapter and full network experts simultaneously. We create a single pool with all the models, and use the kNN method to pick the right model. It is *not* an ensemble, and the final network has a computation cost equal (or very similar to) the baseline. This experiment shows that the kNN can successfully select from experts with very different architectures and get the \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d. It also shows that kNN is robust to increasing the size of the pool of expert models to a very large number (the largest pool has almost 600 experts).

The improvement of the adapter experts over the baseline provides some evidence that these models are able to specialize. However, as a more direct measure we can also add a plot where for each slice we show the performance on that slice of its expert model based on adapters and the baseline model. We have done this in the past for full models (not in the paper though), and the difference is quite large. As one would expect, due to the fine-tuning in the slice, the expert models\u2019 performance in their own data slice is much higher.\n\n2. We will add the non-expert baseline to Table 1.\n\n3. \u201cAll experts\u201d means selecting from both the adapter and full network experts: we consider a pool that it\u2019s the union of both expert pools. It is not an ensemble, and the final network has a computation cost equal (or very similar to) the baseline. This experiment shows that the kNN can successfully select from experts with very different architectures and get the \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d. Thanks for pointing out the ambiguity!

We will clarify the kNN performance proxy in the main text.\n\nFirst, as we argue during the paper, the cost of pre-training the pool of experts is amortized over time, since they can be reused when new downstream tasks are learned. Likewise, in Domain Adaptive Transfer (DAT) the cost of pre-training the generalist model on JFT is also amortized. The costs that cannot be amortized are those corresponding to the \u201cexpert preparation\u201d step and the downstream fine-tuning. The asymptotic costs of all steps are depicted in Table 8 (Appendix F.3).\n\nRegarding the \u201cexpert preparation\u201d step, which is the part that differs between the two methods when learning a new task, it requires less than 2 hours to select an expert model among a pool of 240 experts, based on 1000 images from the downstream task, using a single NVIDIA V100 GPU (see Appendix C.1). This is the real duration of the expert preparation step, following our method. Using the same hardware and image pre-processing, fine-tuning a R50 on JFT for 4 epochs requires ~1800 hours. This is the corresponding cost following the Domain Adaptive Transfer approach.\n\nSince fine-tuning on the downstream dataset takes only a few minutes (see Appendix E.2), it\u2019s impact is negligible (compared to the previous step), and thus our transfer approach learns a new task approximately 900x faster than that of Domain Adaptive Transfer, when pre-training is amortized and same hardware and model specifications are considered. Depending on different optimizations and system bottlenecks, we expect our approach to be 500 - 1000x faster.\n\nIndeed, pre-training the experts is computationally expensive. In particular, training the Baseline (one model on all the data) is most expensive, but also required by any large-scale transfer algorithm, whereas training each individual expert only requires finetuning it on its data slice for a couple of epochs.. In addition, the idea behind this work is that the experts need only be trained *once* (consuming those computational resources), and as we argued before this cost is amortized over time. After this, the user of the experts needs relatively few resources to run the proposed method, pick the best expert, and fine-tune it on their downstream task.\n\nNote: we have open-sourced 48 expert-models trained on ImageNet-21k slices.

Specifically, instead of using a generic representation for various down-stream tasks, this paper proposed to create a family of expert models in pre-training, and selectively choose one expert to generate representation depending on the target transfer learning task. A simple yet effective k-nearest neighbor strategy is used for picking the best-fitting expert. This paper has extensive experiments including pre-training models on two large-scale image datasets, and evaluated on two transfer learning benchmarks (VTAB and datasets from DAT).\n\n\n**Reasons for score:**\n\nThe general idea of this paper (i.e. replacing generic representation with one from target-dependent expert model) is very intuitive, and the experimental validations are very solid. However, the novelty and technical contribution of this paper is only moderate. Overall, I think it's a good paper and may inspire future work on more efficient and effective transfer learning.\n\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. The proposed idea is intuitive, and empirically very effective. Different from focusing on architectures for transfer learning, this paper focused on using different representations to improve transfer learning quality. This is complementary with many existing techniques on transfer learning.\n2. The experimental validations are extensive and solid, e.g. all reported accuracies have confidence interval so the comparison is more informative.\n3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.\n \n**Cons:**\n\n1. In Section 4.1 two variations of \"MoE family\" are proposed, i.e. Full ResNet Modules and Adapter Modules. For Adapter Modules, it seems all experts share blocks and only differ in adapter module (Fig.3 b). However, the effectiveness of constructing \"expert\" model in this way lacks supporting evidence, i.e. how well each \"expert\" performs on the corresponding/non-corresponding domains?\n2. I am wondering if Table 1 should add performance comparison with the baseline model B, so it would be more straightforward whether the expert branch selected by the proposed strategy is more effective on the target datasets.\n3. For \"All Experts\" in Table 2, I find it unclear as in Section 6.5 \"Combining All Experts\" it doesn't explain how this model works. Does it mean all experts are simultaneously selected, i.e. $x_i := F_i(x_{i-1} + \\sum_e a_e^{(i)}(x_{i-1}))$? In that case, if each adapter module introduced 6% parameters (Section 4.1) the extra parameters will be non-negligible.\n4. Please clarify: as shown in Figure 3 (a) ResNet-50 has four blocks and adapter module is added before each block; does the proposed system support choosing different adapter module at different block? E.g. for the first two blocks of a specific dataset $a^{(1)}_i$ and $a^{(2)}_j$, is it possible that $i != j$? In other words, the \"performance proxy\" strategy is applied to each block, or at the end of the entire network?\n5. Section 6.1 mentioned that ImageNet21k use 50 experts and JFT use 240 experts, but in supplementary JFT seems to have 244 experts. Also from Table 4 in supplementary C. 6, some dataset choose \"baseline\" as the selected expert. Does the \"baseline\" serve as a standalone expert, or a base of all experts (e.g. in adapter modules setting do the adapter serve as residual to the baseline)? There seems to be some inconsistencies here.\n\n\n**Questions during rebuttal period:**\n\nPlease address my questions in the cons section.\n  \n\n**Some typos and minor issues:**\n\n--  Supplementary D.1, \"Unconditional pre-training\" the last sentence is incomplete.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2224/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2224/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Scalable Transfer Learning with Expert Models", "authorids": ["~Joan_Puigcerver1", "~Carlos_Riquelme_Ruiz1", "basilm@google.com", "~Cedric_Renggli1", "~Andr\u00e9_Susano_Pinto1", "~Sylvain_Gelly1", "~Daniel_Keysers2", "~Neil_Houlsby1"], "authors": ["Joan Puigcerver", "Carlos Riquelme Ruiz", "Basil Mustafa", "Cedric Renggli", "Andr\u00e9 Susano Pinto", "Sylvain Gelly", "Daniel Keysers", "Neil Houlsby"], "keywords": ["Transfer Learning", "Expert Models", "Few Shot"], "abstract": "Transfer of pre-trained representations can improve sample efficiency and reduce computational requirements for new tasks.

The authors perform plenty of experiments to show the influence of different design and how the method compares with other methods. Overall, the paper is sound.\n\nClarity: The paper is well written and easy to follow. I have two questions:\n1. Does the number $n$ of adapters equals the number of experts? Or (because there are four blocks) does the number of experts equal the combination of adapters, $n^4$?\n2. I have one important question in experiments: Did you compare your method with direct transferring B (the initialization model)? This is the actual baseline to justify the effect of experts and your selection scheme. I think because of residual connection in adapters, B is included in the experts. But still, B could be the best choice but not selected due to the imperfection of selection scheme. I would like to see the results, I may change my score based on that.\n \nOriginality: The paper is a novel method for transfer learning, though using multi-expert system/adapters in network are not new.\n\nSignificance: This paper could be an inspiring work for transfer learning community.
