Here are our responses to your concerns.\n\n\u201cBoth competitive systems (He et al., 2018) and (Lei et al., 2018) are not exactly the same as proposed in these two works.\u201d\n    * For Lei et al., 2018, we re-used Lei et al.\u2019s implementation with minimum modifications; the original code is not applicable to our task. They use belief span to track entities mentioned so far, while we are tracking dialog acts and negotiation strategies. Therefore, the only modification we performed was to replace the entities in their belief span with our dialog acts and negotiation strategies.\n    * For He et al., 2018, the RNN structure used to model dialog acts is the exact model used by He et al. We implemented two RNNs to model dialog acts and negotiation strategies, because we hypothesize that tracking both dialog acts and negotiation strategies together will lead to better dialog performance. \n\n\u201cThe evaluation measurements used in the human evaluation is not directly comparable to prior work.\u201d\n    * Our human evaluation covers more aspects than He et al., 2018\u2019s human evaluation. He et al., 2018 only measures human likeness (corresponding to naturalness in our paper), while we measure in total three aspects: naturalness, coherence and persuasiveness. \n\n\"Probability density function\" should be \"probability distribution\"\n    * Yes, you are right. It should be \u201cprobability mass function\u201d (as Reviewer #1 pointed out) or \u201cprobability distribution\u201d. Thank you for pointing this out, we will fix this.\n\n\u201cIn the joint loss function (the equation before section 3), why use an indicator function instead of the cross-entropy loss for the last term?\u201d\n    * Following the Reviewer's suggestion, we reran the experiment with the cross-entropy loss for our best model (FeHED+CE). The table below shows the result. We observe an improvement of generation quality (Bi.acc, Uni.acc, BLEU), but a worse performance for strategy prediction (S.acc, S.F1). It is likely because cross entropy loss puts a constraint on generation quality, which could sacrifice the performance of strategy prediction. Overall, the new model still beats all the other baseline models (except for BLEU score). \n\n                                                Negotiation\nModels               Uni.acc   Bi.acc     S.acc    S.F1     BLEU\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFeHED+CE               50.3      59.6       60.4    21.5      20.7\nFeHED                      49.6      59.3       61.9    22.8      20.6  \n\n                                                Persuasion\nModels               Uni.acc   Bi.acc     S.acc    S.F1     BLEU\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFeHED+CE               0.18      0.78       0.79    18.2      13.7\nFeHED                      0.18      0.77       0.80    18.2      13.5 \n\n\n\u201cIn experimental setup, my understanding is that the model was jointly trained with all components. Why there are two separate learning rates?\u201d\n    * Sorry for the confusion. The learning rates should be 1.0 for both terms.\n\n\u201cIn evaluation, what are the exact definitions of Uni.acc and Bi.acc? I read this paragraph multiple times, and I am still not sure whether I understand it correctly.\u201d\n    * What is Uni.acc and why do we need it? Previous work evaluates the generation quality only using BLEU. BLEU evaluates how close is the generated utterance to the ground truth. However, BLEU is unable to tell us whether the generated utterance uses the correct negotiation strategies, which is very important for non-collaborative dialog. Both BLEU and Uni.acc are used to evaluate the generation quality. However, instead of focusing on the surface form as BLEU does, Uni.acc quantifies the percentage of generated utterances that contain the correct negotiation strategies. \n    * What is Bi.acc and why do we need it? It is not enough to compare with the ground truth utterance in dialog generation. Because in dialogs, multiple responses can be correct given the context. So the ground truth utterance is only one of the many valid responses. To evaluate our model more accurately, we not only calculate a single Uni.acc using the ground truth, but also consider other possible correct strategies given the conversation context using Bi.acc.\n    * Also we want to emphasize all the automatic evaluation metrics are insufficient to evaluate dialog qualities. They only capture partial information of dialog quality. We thus conduct human evaluation and recommend referring to human evaluation as the most comprehensive evaluation.\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1206/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1206/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Augmenting Non-Collaborative Dialog Systems with Explicit Semantic and Strategic Dialog History", "authors": ["Yiheng Zhou", "Yulia Tsvetkov", "Alan W Black", "Zhou Yu"], "authorids": ["yihengz1@cs.cmu.edu", "ytsvetko@cs.cmu.edu", "awb@cs.cmu.edu", "joyu@ucdavis.edu"], "keywords": ["dialog systems", "history tracking"], "abstract": "We study non-collaborative dialogs, where two agents have a conflict of interest but must strategically communicate to reach an agreement (e.g., negotiation).

Here are our responses to your questions\n\n\u201cWhy not a direct comparison with the models proposed by Wang et al., 2019, He et al., 2019?\u201d\n     * Wang et al. 2019 only proposed a persuasion dataset and did a classification task to classify persuasion strategies. They did not build a dialog system that we can compare against.\n     *Our HED+RNN in Table 1 and Table 2 is exactly He et al., 2019 \u2019s method, except that we use two RNNs to model both dialog acts and negotiation strategies, while He et al., 2019 only uses one RNN to modal dialog acts. Moreover, we use the same set of dialog acts as He et al., 2019. Sorry we did not make it clear in the paper. We will update that in the final draft.\n\n\u201cWhy is human evaluation performed only w.r.t. HED and its variant but not Sequicity?\u201d\n    * For the automatic metric, Sequicity performs much worse than other baseline models. So we did not have it in human evaluation. We only chose the baselines that has overall best automatic evaluation results to compare against in human evaluation.\n\n\u201cHow do you come up with number 37.6 in negotiation dialogue?\u201d\n    * For the negotiation task, a buyer/seller can propose a number with different precision as price, such as 3.444. In text generation, as we need a fixed-size vocabulary, such variance in number is hard to deal with. So, we normalized the price with respect to its original sale price to deal with it.

To track the history better, the authors propose to apply two pre-trained finite state transducers (FSTs) to take the sequence of dialog acts or strategies as inputs and output sequences of state embeddings for the hierarchical encoder-decoder (HED) part as inputs. The authors test their model on two tasks, a bargain task and a persuasion task.\n\nThe model that the authors prepose makes sense to me. It seems that the FSTs can successfully help the model to track the history better and propose useful state embeddings for the rest part of the model, on both dialog acts and strategies. Also, the authors have done a comprehensive empirical study to show the gain of the proposed techniques over the pure HED model and some baseline method. So I think this is a good work. But potentially it would be better if the authors can show more insights and details for the FSTs. \n\nSome detailed comments:\n\n1. The example dialogs in Table 3 show us that the FSTs can output dialog act distributions that can help the agent behave better compared to the case with an RNN for tracking the history, and the case without FST/RNN. This shows the success of the FST framework.\n\n2. The authors have done a comprehensive comparison for the cases with / without the two FSTs, as well as the case without the strategy predictor. Also, the authors compared with another existing method (Sequicity). The proposed method performs well compared to the baseline methods, on both general performances and the two types of human-evaluations. This shows the good empirical performance of the proposed method.\n\n3. This paper can be better if the authors can provide more insights and details for the FSTs. For example, why FST is better than RNN? The authors mentioned something about that, but it is not clear enough and it will be great if the authors can provide more discussions on this. In addition, the output alphabets and the sets of states are not clear for the FSTs, it will be better if the authors show the full details for the FSTs, as in my opinion this is the major contribution of this work.\n\n4. A minor comment: There are some inaccurate expressions in this paper. For example, the authors mentioned that the FSTs about put probabilistic density functions. However, to my understanding, the set of dialog acts is finite, hence FSTs output probabilistic mass functions, not probabilistic density functions. Please proofread about that.\n\nQuestion:\n\n1. Can you explain more about the choice for the parameters? For example, why the possible strategy output is a 15-dimensional binary-value vector?\n\n2. For the loss L_{joint}, shouldn't it be (st_{t+1,j}\\not\\in u_{t+1}) in the indicator function?\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1206/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1206/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Augmenting Non-Collaborative Dialog Systems with Explicit Semantic and Strategic Dialog History", "authors": ["Yiheng Zhou", "Yulia Tsvetkov", "Alan W Black", "Zhou Yu"], "authorids": ["yihengz1@cs.cmu.edu", "ytsvetko@cs.cmu.edu", "awb@cs.cmu.edu", "joyu@ucdavis.edu"], "keywords": ["dialog systems", "history tracking"], "abstract": "We study non-collaborative dialogs, where two agents have a conflict of interest but must strategically communicate to reach an agreement (e.g., negotiation).

Particularly, section 2.3 is too brief to provide enough technical details so readers can understand how exactly the two FST models work and why they are effective in encoding semantic and strategic information. With the important details being left out, it is difficult to evaluate the novelty of this work. \n\nIn addition, although the evaluation in section 3 shows the proposed model outperforms some existing competitive systems. The experiment setup is questionable:\n\n- Both competitive systems (He et al., 2018) and (Lei et al., 2018) are not exactly the same as proposed in these two works. To make a fair comparison, I strongly suggest running the systems released from their works\n- The evaluation measurements used in the human evaluation is not directly comparable to prior work, which makes it further unclear about the performance of the proposed model. \n\n\nSome additional comments on details\n\n- In the paragraph before section 2.4, I think \"probability density function\" should be \"probability distribution\", since the random variables are discrete.\n- In the joint loss function (the equation before section 3), why use an indicator function instead of the cross-entropy loss for the last term? \n- In experimental setup, my understanding is that the model was jointly trained with all components. Why there are two separate learning rates?\n- In evaluation, what are the exact definitions of Uni.acc and Bi.acc? I read this paragraph multiple times, and I am still not sure whether I understand it correctly.
