The authors perform an analysis of the performance of ResNets and DenseNets under data scarcity constraints and noisy training samples. They also run some experiments assessing the importance of the number of skip connections in such networks.\n\nThe presentation of the paper could be significantly improved. The motivation is difficult to grasp and the contributions do not seem compelling.\n\nMy main concern is about the contribution of the paper. The hypothesis that skip connections ease the training and improve the generalization has already been highlighted in the ResNet and DenseNet paper, see e.g. [a].\n\n[a] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.05027.pdf\n\nMoreover, the literature review is very limited. Although there is a vast existing literature on ResNets, DenseNets and, more generally, skip connections, the paper only references 4 papers. Many relevant papers could be referenced in the introduction as examples of successes in computer vision tasks,  identity mapping initialization, recent interpretations of ResNets/DensetNets, etc.\n\nThe title suggests that the analysis is performed on DenseNet architectures, but experiments focus on comparing both ResNets and DenseNets to sequential convolutional networks and assessing the importance of skip connections.\n\nIn section 3.1. (1st paragraph) proposes adding noise to groundtruth labels; however, in section 3.1.2,. it would seem that noise is added by changing the input images (by setting some pixel channels to 0). Could the authors clarify that? Wouldn\u2019t the noise added to the groundtruth act as a regularizer?\n\nIn section 4, the paper claims to investigate the role of skip connections in vision tasks. However, experiments are performed on MNIST, CIFAR100, a curve fitting problem and a presumably synthetic 2D classification problem. Performing the analysis on computer vision datasets such as ImageNet would be more compelling to back the statement in section 4.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On the Generalization Effects of DenseNet Model Structures ", "abstract": "Modern neural network architectures take advantage of increasingly deeper layers, and various advances in their structure to achieve better performance.
