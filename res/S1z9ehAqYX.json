Followings are the detail responses to the questions.\n\n*--Is 450k steps enough for Mujoco Tasks\nWe only evaluate the Reacher with 450k steps since the environment is very simple and 450k steps are sufficient to learn a good policy.  We use  4500k or more samples for all the other tasks according to their difficulty. \nWe find the current steps is enough to demonstrate the advantages of our method, but will further add steps to further confirm the results. \n\n*--Performance for PPO-MBS\nIn Figure 1, we demonstrated that our proposed method learns faster and can reduce variance during the training process. It is natural that the variance gap between our proposed method and baseline becomes smaller during the training since $\\alpha$ increases on walker2d and the combined gradient estimator is more similar to the unbiased gradient.  As for PPO-MBS vs constant $\\alpha$, the adaptive $\\alpha$ is close to $\\alpha=0.5$ during the training process. This also shows that we can adaptively get better performance than fixed coefficient without hyper-tuning. \n\n\n*--Why does $\\alpha$ increase on Walker2d and Hopper, but decrease on  Swimmer and Reacher? \n\nThis might be because that the trajectory lengths of Walker2d and Hopper increase during the training process, which increases the sample complexity gradually; this makes it difficult for the dynamic model to learn the real transition process and hence yields an increasing $\\alpha$.  This may also indicate that our adaptive strategy can check the performance of the learned dynamic model automatically. \n\n*--Comparing and Combining PPO-MBS and PPO-STS\nWe will add results on comparing and combining  PPO-MBS and PPO-STS in the revised version. The combination of these two approaches can be done straightforwardly with multiple shrinkage methods, which we will also investigate. \n\nAt last we would like to thank the reviewer for pointing our potential issues and we will improve them in our next version.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1102/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1102/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1102/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Shrinkage-based Bias-Variance Trade-off for Deep Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable successes in solving various challenging artificial intelligence tasks.

As for theoretical gurantees,  JS estimator was originally motivated for normal distributions for which nice inequalities can be established to guarantee the decrease of MSE.  However, it is easily applicable to more general cases and provides a simple yet powerful strategy for addressing the {very challenge of bias-variance trade-off} that is crucial in many components of RL. The goal of this work is to fill this gap between RL and JS literature. Note that the decrease of MSE in our experiments is already a direct evidence of the effectiveness of JS in RL.  In the future we will try to use recent extended efficient shrinkage estimators in parametric models (hansen, 2016), which relaxes the normal distribution to general asymptotic distributions.\n\nHansen, Bruce E.

Authors claim that by using the statistical shrinkage estimators combining different gradients that have different bias-variance trade-off would provide better mean-square error than each of those individual gradient estimators. The key observations made by the authors are that gradients computed by on-policy methods would provide nearly unbiased estimators with very high variance while the gradients obtained by the off-policy methods in particular model based approaches would provide highly biased estimators with low variance. Proposed statistical tool to combine gradients is James-Steim shrinkage estimator.

The first algorithm, PPO-MBS, combines low bias of on-policy methods with low variance of model-based RL algorithms. The second, PPO-STS, uses JS to create a statistical momentum and reduce variance of the PPO algorithm. Both algorithms are evaluated on Mujoco environments aiming to show improvements in average cumulative reward, reduced bias and variance.\n\nThe paper\u2019s topic is highly relevant, as the authors point out, the current state of the art in RL is largely divided between model-based and model-free methods. This paper aims at bridging the gap, and taking advantage of both sides. The writing is clear and concise, with all the math properly introduced. The proposed methods are interesting and novel. As far as I am aware, this is solid and unexplored approach with potentially significant impact.\n\nThere are two concerns with this paper. First, the evaluation results are promising, yet not fully convincing. It appears that 5 million steps is not sufficient for the policy convergence for any of the tasks (average reward keeps increasing). At the same time the variance gap (Figure 1) is reducing. \n- As the training continues, does the variance for PPO-MBS become larger?\n- Similar question for the average reward - the advantage of the PPO-MBS vs. comparison methods seems to be reducing. What happens with the additional training?\n- How do the trajectories and behavior of the Walker2D (and other) look with PPO-MBS vs. others - is the higher average reward indicative of the qualitatively better behavior?\n- Why do Walker2D and Hopper increase \\alpha over time, while Swimmer and Reacher lean more towards mode model based policy over time?\n- Is there something significant about the structure of the problems?\n- Similar questions arise from the evaluation of the PPO-STS - it appears that the training is even less complete in this case, rendering the conclusions about the quality of the learned policy at convergence invalid.\n- Why are Humanoid and Ant not evaluated on PPO-MBS? The authors should extend the training to convergence on all problems, and present the results including movies of example trajectories of all environments for both algorithms in the supplementary material.\n\nSecond, the paper introduces two competing methods.  While, the authors compare them directly,  they do not discuss how the two methods relate to each other. In the Reacher and Hopper task seems like all three methods perform about the same, and in the Hopper PPO-STS even performs worse than the baseline. This makes it difficult to assess the significance of the exposition. When should one be used, and when the other one is better?\n\nThe authors should consider either a) splitting the paper into two focusing each paper on a single algorithm with more in-depth evaluations and discussions, or b) combining the two algorithms into ones. In any case, further analysis that illuminates when the methods should be used, and how they improve the training are needed.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1102/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Shrinkage-based Bias-Variance Trade-off for Deep Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable successes in solving various challenging artificial intelligence tasks.
