However, the paper still suffers from poor presentation and poorly-motivated or justified modelling choices. The current version of the paper has not been updated, and all below issues thus stand. The paper overall presents a good idea, but I believe the authors made poor modelling choices, which led the kludgy math. \n\n----\n\nThe paper proposes to combine deep kernel learning (DKL) with PDE/ODE prior knowledge for learning spatiotemporal systems. The idea is sound and sensible, although it represents an incremental combination of two existing techniques. The differential assumption clearly improves in spatiotemporal experiments, which also motivates the idea. \n\nThe paper has unfortunately three major mathematical errors. \n\nFirst, the very first equation of the method (eq 4) is already incorrect: g(x) is not a function of input \u201cx\u201d but instead it\u2019s a function of solution \u201cf\u201d. The paper itself acknowledges this by giving series of examples which all are functions of \u201cf\u201d. The following GP prior for g(x) is then placed on incorrect inputs and seems misguided or at least insufficient to model the differential. Intuitively this is also easy to see: the differential of the solution is obviously not just a function of space and time (but of solution as well). \n\nSecond, the eq 6 states that a non-linear differential of a GP is some other Gaussian process. This is incorrect: non-linear transforms of a Gaussian process does not retain Gaussianity. Since this is a central definition of the paper, the whole method is likely incorrect.\n\nThird, the paper introduces a bizarre concept of constant zero vectors as random variables, ie. p(0|g). This is clearly wrong, and the probabilistic model is then wrong as well. While this could be easily fixed, the model is an example of GP-matching (which has known pathologies), and this has been extensively studied by many authors (eg. Wenk\u201919, Wenk\u201918, Gorbach\u201917, MacDonalds\u201915).\n\nGiven these obvious errors, the paper needs a major revision.\n\n\nTechnical comments:\no Eq 4 should be g(f,x), since later the \\varphi is a function of f and its x-derivatives. Currently none of the examples (eg. burger) follow eq 4. Also eq6 is also wrong with same argument\no Please define (mathematically) the tackled problem and the problem domain. The paper starts by discussing classification, but at sec 3 the context suddenly changes into PDEs without the reader being informed about this.\no The paragraph \u201cto incorporate..\u201d is difficult to follow since its technical but does not open up the math yet. It would help to write this in more conceptual way\no It would greatly help the reader understand the method to include the sup-fig1 in the main paper\no It seems that both f and g are assumed to be separate GPs. This is unclear from text, please clarify\no eq7 is strange, since it defines a dirac between a random variable g and a sample of h. This is nonsensical.\no The 0-sampling is obviously wrong and unnecessary. Double priors are perfectly fine in Bayesian modelling, and eq9 could be defined without the 0-stuff. The double priors are called product of expert priors, see eg. MacDonalds'15 or Wenk\u201919. They do have their own pathologies, but these papers discuss them extensively.  \n ", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper946/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper946/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Physics Informed Deep Kernel Learning", "authorids": ["~Zheng_Wang2", "wxing@sci.utah.edu", "~Robert_Kirby1", "~Shandian_Zhe1"], "authors": ["Zheng Wang", "Wei Xing", "Robert Kirby", "Shandian Zhe"], "keywords": ["Deep Kernel", "Bayesian Learning"], "abstract": "Deep kernel learning is a promising combination of deep neural networks and nonparametric function estimation.

Part of the reason is that there have been many excellent works proposed to exploit complete equations (i.e., g is known), including not only the great references [1-4], but also the ones cited in our paper (see Sec. 5 Related Work) as well as the recent physics informed deep neural networks (PINN), which directly motivates our work (see Sec. 1 Introduction 3rd paragraph). Actually, our setting is the same as the latent force models (LFM) by Alvarez09, except that LFM further restricts \\psi to be linear (while we do not). That\u2019s why in our experimental design, we evaluate the incomplete equation case (i.e., g is unknown) to match the goal of our work.\n\nSecond, we do agree that in Section 6.1 and 6.2, if we disclose the form of g to the competing methods, we can apply [2] for learning as well, although this will be UNFAIR to LFM and our method. We will conduct such evaluations and see the results. \n\nFinally, thanks for suggesting the deep Bayesian architectures, which is very promising. We will definitely consider extending our model along this direction."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper946/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper946/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Physics Informed Deep Kernel Learning", "authorids": ["~Zheng_Wang2", "wxing@sci.utah.edu", "~Robert_Kirby1", "~Shandian_Zhe1"], "authors": ["Zheng Wang", "Wei Xing", "Robert Kirby", "Shandian Zhe"], "keywords": ["Deep Kernel", "Bayesian Learning"], "abstract": "Deep kernel learning is a promising combination of deep neural networks and nonparametric function estimation.

We will add grey colors in our graphical representation. \n\nC2: use 0|g must give a different implementation because but the g|0 case would need an extra normalizing constant due to having a product prior (the product is not guaranteed to integrate to 1).\n\nR2: Yes, we totally agree. In R3 of the last response, we thought you were asking if simply multiplying Eq. 7 with Eq. 5 (i.e., N(g|0)) will lead to a difference in computation. In that case, the computation will be the same as in Eq.9. However, if we want to convert the product of the two priors into a new, valid prior, so that it can be present in a correct joint probability distribution (like Eq. 9), we do need an extra normalizer. This normalizer is only constant to g and will vary with the kernel parameters in Eq. 5 and equation parameters in Eq. 4 (if there are). Therefore, the computation will be very different.\n\nC3: what\u2019s actually happening in eqs 6-7 is that g is a change-of-variables transform of the GP-f by the \\phi. This properly defines g as a function of another RV, and also properly defines its distribution (via jacobian). If \\phi is linear, then g is a GP. \n\nR3: We agree. We also discussed how to obtain the marginal distribution of g via Jacobian (see the text right under Eq. 7 in our main paper and Sec. 2 of the supplementary material). While in theory feasible, the computation is tricky in practice. So, we use the full joint distribution in Eq. 9. \n\nC4: Using sampling to define a distribution is awkward. Using sampling instead to approximate a distribution is ok.\n\nR4: We use a sampling procedure that describes how each random variable is in turn sampled or generated (until the observations/data are generate), to define our probabilistic model. Then we proceed to the joint distribution of the model. We believe this is pretty natural and intuitive. Actually, many classical papers, like Latent Dirichlet Allocations [1] and its extension, e.g., [2] (see Sec. 3 in both [1] and [2]), use the same way to introduce their models. Note that the sampling procedure to describe our model is DIFFERENT from the Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo sampling algorithm used to approximate the posterior.\n\n[1] Blei, David M., Andrew Y. Ng, and Michael I. Jordan. \"Latent dirichlet allocation.\" JMLR, 2003: 993-1022.\n\n[2] Griffiths, Thomas L., et al. \"Hierarchical topic models and the nested Chinese restaurant process.\" Advances in neural information processing systems, 2004.\n\nC5: Having a prior for g feels unnecessary. If f is smooth and \\phi is smooth, then g=phi[f] will also be smooth ...\n\nR5: Our goal is to use Eq. 4, i.e., \\psi[ f ] = g, to guide or facilitate the learning of f. We neither know the form of f nor the form of g.  All we know is their relationship \\psi[]. Therefore, we put a f-prior and g-prior (or 0|g), and then connect them via \\psi (our whole model is talking about how to build this connection in a valid probabilistic framework). In this way, we can use the g-prior (or 0|g) to regularize the learning of f. While g-prior might not be that informative, the regularization itself has encoded the valuable physics knowledge exhibited in \\psi (see the paragraph right above Sec. 4.2) and will benefit f\u2019s learning, as demonstrated in our experimental results. \n\nOur strategy is in high level consistent with the latent force model by Alvarez09. They also assume Eq. 4 and unknown f and g. The difference is that they further restrict that \\psi is linear and has an analytical Green\u2019s function. They put a prior over g, and then derive the prior for f via kernel convolution. This is essentially another way to build up the connection of the two priors (but only feasible for linear operators). Note that while g-prior is not that informative, the physics knowledge has been encoded in the connection to f (i.e., the convolved kernel) and then facilitates the training.

We will definitely cite and discuss them. However, all these methods CANNOT apply to our problem --- incomplete differential equations (with a latent source function) and scarce data --- and work as proper baselines.\n\n[1] inherits the product-of-expert (PoE) heuristic of the AGM model (see Calderhead09 and Macdonale15 cited in Sec. 5 Related Work of our paper) and marginalizes out the derivates of the target function in ODEs. As a consequence, [1] and AGM only apply to ODEs with explicit forms. You cannot introduce an unknown source function in the ODE (like the one in Sec. 6.1 of our paper) --- otherwise, the marginalization is NOT doable (see Eq.9 in [1]). Furthermore, [1] further restricts the ODE response to be a summation of the product of states (i.e., mass-action kinetics, see eq. 10 in [1]) to ensure a closed-form update in their mean-field variational inference. Therefore, the method [1] CANNOT deal with incomplete, general differential equation in Eq.4 of our paper (even \\psi corresponds to an ODE). \n\n[3] discusses the issue of the PoE heuristics in AGM and [1]: the correct normalization will disconnect the observed data and ODE parameters. [3] provides another graphical model that can justify the previous approaches that uses an improper normalization to retain the connection. [3] also proposes a hybrid of point estimation (for GP hyperparameters) and MCMC (for hidden states and ODE parameters) for inference. However, all these discussions and extensions are based on the SAME setting as in AGM. That means, [3] is strictly grounded on ODEs with explicit forms, and cannot introduce latent source functions. \n\n\nWhile [2] can incorporate general equality or inequality constraints (based on ODEs/PDEs), it strictly requires every function in the constraint has an explicit form (e.g., H_{hi} listed in Sec 3.1 of [2]); otherwise, the constraint likelihood (e.g., Eq. 4&5 in [2]) CANNOT be constructed. The reason is that they need to evaluate both the LHS and RHS of the equality/inequality (on a set of inputs) to obtain the constraint likelihood in inference.  Therefore, their method does NOT support unknown source functions (i.e., g() in Eq 4 of our paper) as well, and hence is NOT applicable to our problem. \n\nWhile very interesting, [4] is the most IRRELEVANT to our work, in both the setting and the goal. First, [4] only focuses on (nonlinear) dynamical systems (i.e., ODEs) (our work is for general differential equation). Second, [4] assumes either the ODE is completely known (i.e., differential form in Sec. 2.2 in [4]) or ODE is completely unknown but there are enough, discrete trajectory data (i.e., recurrent form). By contrast, our model assumes the DE is partially known, i.e., with explicit \\psi but an unknown source function g() (see Eq. 4) and the data is scarce. Therefore, even only considering ODEs, our setting does not apply to [4], and either is infeasible to the method in [4] (differential form) or leads to very bad results due to insufficient data (recurrent form). Third, [4] aims to learn a set of bases functions (with neural networks) that span the Koopman invariant space. These bases functions decompose the solution function to facilitate the analysis of the nonlinear dynamic system. This is far different from our goal that uses incomplete differential equation to enhance the learning of the target function (esp. for extrapolation) from scarce data. We do NOT see any common metric that we can use to compare the two works.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper946/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper946/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Physics Informed Deep Kernel Learning", "authorids": ["~Zheng_Wang2", "wxing@sci.utah.edu", "~Robert_Kirby1", "~Shandian_Zhe1"], "authors": ["Zheng Wang", "Wei Xing", "Robert Kirby", "Shandian Zhe"], "keywords": ["Deep Kernel", "Bayesian Learning"], "abstract": "Deep kernel learning is a promising combination of deep neural networks and nonparametric function estimation.

Clarifying this in the paper would be good (eg. use gray nodes for data variables in plate diagram).\n\nThere\u2019s some confusion on nomenclature here. In Bayesian modelling we have a joint distribution over data variables, model parameters and hyperparameters; for which a factorisation is chosen with the chain rule (-> DAG). The posterior is model parameters conditioned on rest, and (Bayesian) _inference_ is the approximation of the parameter posterior (eg. MCMC, MF-VI or MAP). _Model selection_ is the procedure to select hyperparameters (eg. MLL optim or CV). \n\nI would argue that the g|0 or 0|g choice _must_ give a different implementation, otherwise the double prior problem has no practical relevance at all. I believe the 0|g case is roughly correct, but the g|0 case would need an extra normalizing constant due to having a product prior (the product is not guaranteed to integrate to 1). The 0|g model on the other hand seems more or less ok.\n\nI believe what\u2019s actually happening in eqs 6-7 is that g is a change-of-variables transform of the GP-f by the \\phi.

To present a reasonable logic flow, we need to first specify Eq. 5, and then explain why we cannot incorporate it outright to our probabilistic model, and why we should propose a generative component accordingly (see the following paragraph under Eq. 7).\n\n\nC2: The \u201c0\u201d is a random variable, which is sampled from a Dirac but evaluated with Gaussian density\u2026 not convinced the last equality of eq 8 is correct, not sure what kind of RV the 0 is\u2026. in this case the \u201cs\u201d would again collapse to the constant zero \u2026\n\nR2: The \u201c0\u201d here is NOT a random variable. It is the OBSERVATION of the virtual random variable (RV) \u201cs\u201d (see R4 in our previous response) and so it is data. The \u201c0\u201d is similar to the training inputs and outputs (X, y) (see Eq. 1& 9), which are observations of the input and output RVs, e.g., X = [0.3;0.4], y = [-1.3; 1.2]. These observations are fixed and used for training. In our work, we have an augmented dataset {(X, y), 0} to infer model parameters (similarly, all the prior Bayesian hybrid models [1-3] introduce augmented data).\n\nSecond, the \u201c0\u201d is NOT sampled from Dirac. Given g, we have the conditional distribution of the virtual RV \u201cs\u201d as p(s|g, Z) = N(s|g, Z) (see Eq. 8 and R4 in our last response). Therefore, \u201c0\u201d --- as the observation (or value) of s --- is sampled from the Gaussian (only g is sampled from Dirac, see Eq. 7). N(0|g,z) --- RHS of Eq. 8 --- is the likelihood of this observation (more specifically, the likelihood of RV \u201cs\u201d taking \u201c0\u201d). If still uncomfortable, look at p(y|X) in Eq. 1, which is also a likelihood --- the likelihood of the output taking y give the input taking X. \n\nThird, \u201cs\u201d does NOT collapse to constant 0\u201d. \u201cs\u201d is a continuous RV. Its range is R^M, NOT a singleton {0}. The \u201c0\u201d is the data (or observation or instance) for \u201cs\u201d. We combine the original data (X,y) and the virtual data \u201c0\u201d for model estimation. We can also construct nonzero virtual data/observations for \u201cs\u201d. See the discussion in our paper (5th line under Eq. 8). \n\nC3: Can you clarify whether the N(g|0)/N(0|g) choice changes something in practise or in computation\n\nR3: There is no change in computation. The change is the model definition.  N(g|0) defines another prior over g (in addition to Eq.7) and will cause a double prior problem, while N(0|g) defines a generative component that can be integrated into the original GP in a valid and principled way --- this is our modeling goal.\n\nC4: If the computing does not change at all, then surely there are also no modelling/theoretic changes either \u2026 \n\nR4: If this is true, there is NO meaning to propose the Bayesian hybrid framework by Lasserre06 and also the prior works [1,2]. Modeling and computation are obviously different things; you CANNOT use one thing to justify the other. Modeling specifies how you formulate the problem and defines the relationship of the variables. In Bayesian framework, modeling is defined by a sampling procedure and a joint probability distribution. Computation is the procedure to estimate/calculate the parameters and often involves optimization. They are verified in different ways. For example, in Bayesian modeling, we should ensure the sampling procedure is valid (DAG structure); in computing, we should look at if the (local) optimum is arrived or the Markov chain is mixed. One procedure cannot be used to verify the other. For example, two models have the same parameter estimations cannot prove that the two models have the same meaning. \n\nC5: I\u2019m having difficulty following eqs 6-7 or confirming that they are correct \u2026 Can you re-describe what eqs 6-7 mean?\n\nR5: Eq. 6 describes how to draw a sample of g() (in the function space) conditioned on X and y in our model. First, according to the GP predictive distribution, we draw a sample of f given {X,y}: f() = \\mu() + \\epsilon\\sqrt{v()} (see eq. 2 and paragraph containing Eq.6). Then according to the differential equation (4), we apply \\psi[] to obtain the sample of g(), as given in Eq. 6. Note that function sample of g includes \\epsilon.\n\nEq. 7 (the Delta prior) actually evaluates the sampled g() (in Eq.6) at Z, to obtain the samples of [g(z_1), \u2026, g(Z_M)], i.e., the finite projection of the function sample.\n\nThe whole sampling procedure is as follows. Given X, we sample y (standard GP). Given X and y, we sample (epsilon and then) the values of g() at Z (eq. 7), i.e., \\textbf{g}. Then given \\textbf{g}, we sample the virtual observations \u201c0\u201d (eq. 8). This exhibits a DAE structure and leads a valid joint probability Eq. 9.\n\nC6: Can you explain why we need the sampling to be included in eq. 9?\n\nR6: The sampling procedure defines our model and results in the joint probability in Eq. 9. They have no conflicts. They are equivalent.

My current take is:\n\n* eq 5 does not hold, but the text should be clearer that this equation is not meant to hold. It\u2019s quite unusual to give precise definitions of hypothetical terms.\n* I see the motivation of the 0/g \u201ctrick\u201d, since one wants to have an acyclic joint distribution. However, I still have concerns on the treatment of \u201c0\u201d being statistically correct. A new \u201cvirtual\u201d random variable can certainly be introduced, but it has to be properly defined. My concerns:\n    * The \u201c0\u201d is a random variable, which is sampled from a Dirac but evaluated with Gaussian density. I don\u2019t follow what this means statistically, or whether the RV is Dirac or Gaussian. If one has a coin, but always gets \u201cheads\u201d, then the coin either (i) is not two-sided at all, or (ii) its density of {heads,tails} is {1,0}.\n    * I not convinced the last equality of eq 8 is correct. A density \u201cp\u201d is always over some random variable, but I\u2019m not sure what kind of RV the 0 is. The Gaussian density _function_ certainly is symmetric, but the Gaussian _density_ should not be (since the mean is not even a variable!). The \u201cs\u201d notation and intuition is very clear, thanks for the explanation. However in this case the \u201cs\u201d would again collapse to the constant zero, and hence not really work with the Gaussian of eq 8. It seems that in eq 8 the LHS 0 and RHS 0 are different zeros. In left its a constant, in right its a random variable. Overloading symbols should be avoided.\n    * Finally, i\u2019m unsure if the \u201ctrick\u201d does anything. Eq 9 RHS is invariant to whether we have N(g|0) or N(0|g) density _function_, but it should not be invariant to whether we have p(g|0) or p(0|g) _density_. If the computing does not change at all, then surely there are also no modelling/theoretic changes either. I feel the authors are trying to apply an algebraic shortcut to acyclify their model without actually changing their underlying model, or fully accounting the effects of declaring the \u201c0\u201d as a _new_ random variable. To me the eq 9 RHS is still equivalent to the \"double prior\u201d case with p(g|0,S), but the necessary normalization constant of product priors p1*p2/Z is missing. On the other hand, the eq 9 LHS should not result in a Gaussian, but Dirac density for \u201c0\u201d. \n        * Can you clarify whether the N(g|0)/N(0|g) choice changes something in practise or in computation?\n* I\u2019m having difficulty following eqs 6-7 or confirming that they are correct. Eg. in eq 6 we define g(.) to be a function of \\eps, while g(.) does not contain \\eps. I believe eq 6 tries to define a sample from p(g), but the notation is misleading in that case (the equality symbol should not be used for sampling, instead use \\sim and eg. g^{j}). More generally, eqs 6-7 mix operations beteen RVs and samples (non-RV). Can you re-describe what eqs 6-7 mean? (see earlier comments as well)\n* The joint probability eq 9 looks like a conventional hierarchical model. Can you explain why we need the sampling to be included here?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper946/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper946/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Physics Informed Deep Kernel Learning", "authorids": ["~Zheng_Wang2", "wxing@sci.utah.edu", "~Robert_Kirby1", "~Shandian_Zhe1"], "authors": ["Zheng Wang", "Wei Xing", "Robert Kirby", "Shandian Zhe"], "keywords": ["Deep Kernel", "Bayesian Learning"], "abstract": "Deep kernel learning is a promising combination of deep neural networks and nonparametric function estimation.

However, it should be revised to clarify that its not a function definition, but instead a \\phi-g=0 equality.\n\nR1: We can certainty use \\psi[f]-g = 0. However, it is pretty common/standard to use \\phi[f] = g in the literature, not only in computational physics (see Raissi17), but also in prior GP works, see Graepel03 and LFM in Alvarez09 (all cited in Sec. 5 Related Work).  \n\nC2: what is g(x) in the burger example.\n\nR2: In our application, Burger\u2019s equation is used to describe the traffic flow in a highway; g(x) represents the external influences on the flow, e.g., new vehicles joining in or old vehicles leaving through the ramp. We will emphasize this point in the experiment.\n\nC3: However, \u201cg\u201d is not a GP, but it\u2019s still a Gaussian. I\u2019m confused. What is g? What does \u201cprior only in computation, not modelling\u201d mean?\n\nR3: \u201cg\u201d is a NOT Gaussian. The Gaussian is p(0|g, Z) in Eq. 8, which is used to sample virtual observations 0 given g (NOT to sample g itself). Note the joint probability (9) only includes p(0|g,Z) rather than p(g|Z) (in Eq.5).  \n\nIn Eq. (5) and the surrounding paragraph, we discussed IF we consider a GP prior for g, how this prior should be constructed. This is to motivate the generative component proposed later. In the following paragraph under Eq.7, we consider tying (5)&(7); however, \u201cdirectly multiplying (5) and (7) is problematic\u201d due to the double prior problem --- g has already been sampled according to f (see eq. 6&7), so we cannot assign a second prior over g (i.e., Eq. 5). To obtain a valid probabilistic model, we only use the first prior (i.e., Eq. 7) to sample g; then given g, we sample the virtual observations 0, i.e., p(0|g, Z). In our final joint probability in Eq. 9, there are NO terms that reflect g is a Gaussian.\n\nWhen we calculate the log probability for training, the log of p(0|g, Z) (generative component), i.e., logN(0|g, Sigma), is equal to computing the log of a GP prior over g with zero mean function, i.e., logN(g|0, Sigma) in Eq5. This is obvious, because Gaussian has the symmetric property --- switching the variable and mean does NOT change the density (see Eq. 8). Therefore, although in the modeling, we did not place a GP prior over g, in the computation (i.e., training), we equivalently calculate a GP prior of g.  \n\nC4: What does \u201csample set of virtual 0\u2019s\u201d mean? \u2026\u201cVirtual observations and virtual zeros are different things.\u201d\u2026 \u201cSampling means that we draw values wrt their density. If we always sample a \u201c0\u201d, then we ignore densities.\u201d\n\nR4: First, we NEVER claim ``\"virtual zeros\u201d in our paper. What we claimed is \u201cvirtual observations 0\u201d, see 1st line under Eq 8. In our experimental setting, we also mentioned the choice of the number of \u201cvirtual observations\u201d (see Sec. 6.1 Competing Methods, and 6.2 Motion capture). We believe these clearly mean that we introduced a set of virtual observations, whose values are chosen to be zero. Note we have also discussed how to choose nonzero values (see 5th line  under Eq.8).\n\nSecond, you might mix up random variables (RV) and their observations (instances). In essence, both our and the prior works [1-3], introduce a set of virtual, observable RVs. Let us denote them by s.  In our model, the conditional density is p(s|g, Z) = N(s|g, Z) (see Eq. 8). Note s are in continuous domain R^M.  In [3], the conditional density is a Probit likelihood given the latent GP derivatives. In our model, we assume the observed values of s are 0 while in [3] +1 or -1, in [1] the eigen-vectors of data covariance matrix, and in [2] also 0.\n\nThird, from the modeling structure, there are NO essential differences from choosing different values of the virtual observations. Such choices are totally determined by the problem/application. The key is that, using the hybrid framework, the model can avoid the double prior problem, and turn a second prior of the interested RV into a generative component to sample those virtual observations (conditioned on the RV). In this way, we can integrate an extra prior constraint/regularization in the training while the model is still in a principled Bayesian framework. That\u2019s the motivation of the prior hybrid Bayesian models [1-3].\n\nC5: \u201cwhat is the \"double prior\u201d problem here? To me it looks like one would get a product/decomposed prior (eg. p(g) = p_1(g) * p_2(g)), which is fine in probabilistic modelling\u201d\n\nR5: Yes, you can alternatively claim to construct a new prior p(g) = p_1(g)*p_2(g). However, you must prove this is a valid prior distribution, i.e., \\int p(g) = 1, p(g)>=0, etc. Simply multiplying Eq. 5&7 (Delta prior) will NOT give such a justification. We choose to turn p_2(g) into a generative component in the Bayesian hybrid framework.\n\nC6: The author\u2019s should also present the plate diagram for additional clarity. \n\nR6: We DID provide a graphical model representation in Fig. 1 of the supplementary material.

The eq 4 now makes sense. However, it should be revised to clarify that its not a function definition, but instead a \\phi-g=0 equality. Also perhaps also explain what is g(x) in the burger example.\n\nI am still very confused on the probabilistic model. \n\no So \u201cf\" is a GP, its differential is \u201ch\u201d, and it is equal to \u201cg\u201d. Then \u201cg\u201d is a function of a GP (linear or nonlinear). \n\nHowever, \u201cg\u201d is also not a GP (as stated above), but its still a Gaussian. I\u2019m confused. What is g?\n\no What does \u201cprior only in computation, not modelling\u201d mean? \n\no What does \u201csample set of virtual 0\u2019s\u201d mean? Are you really repeatedly sampling vector of zeros? Sampling means that we draw values wrt their density. If we always sample a \u201c0\u201d, then we ignore densities. \n\nIn [3] they use virtual observations, which are obviously ok. In [2] they use virtual zeros, and I am equally baffled what does it mean for them. [1] and Lasserre06 both try to combine generative and discriminative modelling, and both arrive at rather conventional hierarchical probabilistic models with no virtual zeros. I fail to see how any of these references justify or explain the use of zeros here. Virtual observations and virtual zeros are different things.\n\nThe eq 8 has p(0|g,Z). This implies that \u201c0\u201d is a random variable with a point domain \u201c0 \\in {0}\u201d. It also has a Gaussian prior, whose support is infinite. This is wrong. Can you clarify what the \u201c0\u201d-sampling, or what is p(0|..) or what is the \u201c0\u201d here?\n\nEven if the 0-sampling somehow would be theoretically ok (this would need solid justifications), I still find this to be a strange way of introducing non-standard notation and unnecessary complexity. If the model doesn\u2019t work without these kind of hacks, something is wrong. No other paper in this domain have needed the 0-sampling, why its necessary here?\n\no eqs 6 and 7 both relate the \u201cg\" (a random variable) to h(.,eps) (a non-random variable). What is the meaning of this?\n\no what is the \"double prior\u201d problem here? To me it looks like one would get a product/decomposed prior (eg. p(g) = p_1(g) * p_2(g)), which is fine in probabilistic modelling.\n\nI would recommend the authors to revise the sec 3 completely, and make it clear and rigorous what is the model first (ie. what is g, what is h, what is f), and afterwards define how to sample from it. Mixing sampling and model definition is confusing. If these are mixed, it needs clearer justification. \n\nThe author\u2019s should also present the plate diagram for additional clarity.  \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper946/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper946/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Physics Informed Deep Kernel Learning", "authorids": ["~Zheng_Wang2", "wxing@sci.utah.edu", "~Robert_Kirby1", "~Shandian_Zhe1"], "authors": ["Zheng Wang", "Wei Xing", "Robert Kirby", "Shandian Zhe"], "keywords": ["Deep Kernel", "Bayesian Learning"], "abstract": "Deep kernel learning is a promising combination of deep neural networks and nonparametric function estimation.

C: comments; R: response.\n\nC1: the very first equation of the method (eq 4) is already incorrect: g(x) is not a function of input \u201cx\u201d but instead it\u2019s a function of solution \"f\"; \n\nR1: First, g(x) is a source term (see the 2nd line under eq 4). In the literature of differential equations, the source term usually represents external influence on the physical system (described by \\psi[f]). Therefore, in general, g should be considered as a function of x, rather than assume a nested structure including f. Note that this is NOT a definition of ODE. Our work is NOT restricted to ODE either. \n\nSecond, even we put an extra assumption that g is also a function of f, i.e., g(f, x),  because f is a function of x, g is in essence still a function of x. There is NOT any conceptual and mathematical error. \n\nThird, the prior works, including Graepel03, Raissi17, and latent force models by Lawrence07 (see Sec. 5 related work), all assume the same general form as in (4). The only difference is that they further assume \\psi is linear, while ours do not have such restrictions. Do you imply all these pioneer works are wrong?  \n\nC2: The paper itself acknowledges this by giving series of examples which all are functions of \u201cf\u201d\n\nR2: This is a misunderstanding. The definition of \\psi only gives how we model the physical system. It has nothing to do with the definition of the extra source term. In general, all the equations, should have the from \\psi[f]-g = 0. We just move g to the right.  In the ideal case, g can be constant 0 --- this is how most textbooks introduce various equations. But in practice, this is rarely true, because no system is completely closed. \n\nC3: the eq 6 states that a non-linear differential of a GP is some other Gaussian process. This is incorrect: non-linear transforms of a Gaussian process does not retain Gaussianity. Since this is a central definition of the paper, the whole method is likely incorrect.\n\nR3: First, we NEVER claim  a non-linear differential of a GP is some other GP\u2019\u2019, neither does Eq6 reflect it.  Eq6 only states given the posterior form of f, how we obtain g --- based on which we construct the conditional prior of \\textbf{g} in Eq7, which obviously is NOT a GP. Second, in our modeling, we NEVER place a GP prior over g --- that will cause the double prior problem, and result in an INVALID probabilistic model. We use the symmetric property of Gaussian, to instead sample a set of virtual observations 0 given \\textbf{g}, see Eq8 and the surrounding text. This is equivalent to a GP prior only in COMPUTATION, rather than from modeling! This is also our contribution --- we want to regularize the learning of g (and then f) with a simpler prior, i.e., GP, but still obey the Bayes\u2019 rule to ensure proper, well-calibrated uncertainty quantification. Our model fulfills this effect in computation but in a correct probabilistic framework. \n\nC4: the paper introduces a bizarre concept of constant zero vectors as random variables, ie. p(0|g). This is clearly wrong, and the probabilistic model is then wrong as well\u201d \u201cDouble priors are perfectly fine in Bayesian modelling, and eq9 could be defined without the 0-stuff\n\nR4: First, double priors will lead to an improper Bayesian model with an incorrect joint probability distribution. It might be fine if we just want point estimations and predictions. However, we aim to also improve uncertainty quantification in the posteriors. If the joint distribution is conceptually incorrect, how to justify the posterior computed based on the joint distribution? \n\nSecond, we have clearly mentioned that we introduce a set of virtual observation to build a valid probabilistic model (see Sec1 &Sec3.1). This strategy is originally introduced in the Bayesian hybrid framework to principally combine a conditional and generative model (see Lasserre06 cited in our paper). The idea of virtual observations has also been used in Bayesian joint individual and group variable selection [1,2] and learning monotonic functions with GPs [3]. We do NOT see anything that is ``\"Bizarre and clearly wrong\". \n\nThird, regarding the product of experts (PoE), please see MacDonald\u2019s15 at Sec3 end (cited in Sec5 of our paper), they make a clear comment about the advantage of an alternative model GPODE over the PoE based model AGM: ``Conceptually, the GPODE is a proper probabilistic generative model, which can be consistently represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG)\u201d.  This is consistent with the advantage claimed in our paper. \n\n[1] Feng, Y, and Qi, Y. \"EigenNet: A Bayesian hybrid of generative and conditional models for sparse learning.\" NIPS, 2011.\n\n[2] Zhe, S, and et. al.

We did not stack many GPs in several layers. We only have one GP, but the kernel is constructed from a (deep) neural network. We aim to use physics to regularize the estimation of the deep kernels so as to enhance the GP learning. That\u2019s why in the experiments, we only compare with state-of-the-art single GP approaches. Incorporating physics into deep GPs is definitely promising and we will consider it as our future research plan. \n\nSecond, while our evaluation includes ODEs, our model is not restricted by being informed by dynamic systems. Eq. (4) is general and NOT necessarily an ODE; it can be any PDE with or without time variables.  See Sec. 6.2 metal pollution prediction where we actually did not use any time information. \n\nThird, from the review, we cannot find the references numbered as [1,2,3, 4]. We will appreciate if the reviewer could list the corresponding papers. We will definitely double check. \n\n\nC2: \u201cIt is not clear whether the parameters of the dynamical systems in the term h(Z,\\epsilon) of (12) are inferred. If this is the case, the ability of the framework in estimating the systems\u2019 should be assessed and compared to other moment matching approaches\u201d\n\nR2: Great question. First, as mentioned in Sec. 3.1, the 3rd line under Eq. (4), we allow \\psi[] to include unknown parameters. Therefore, h couples the deep kernels, the differential operators, and unknown parameters in the differential equation. The parameters will be jointly estimated in the training. We will emphasize this point in our paper. \n\nSecond, it is a great idea to assess these learned parameters. We will supplement the assessment. However, the goal of our paper is NOT system identification (via GPs). Rather, we aim to use incomplete differential equations to improve deep-kernel GP when learning with scarce data, in both prediction accuracy (esp. extrapolation) and uncertainty quantification. On two synthetic datasets and four real-world applications, our method has clearly shown improvement in both aspects. Therefore, we believe the advantage of our method has been well demonstrated. While many excellent works (e.g., gradient matching, see the references in Sec. 5) were proposed to (accurately) recover the equation parameters, they demand we have sufficient samples in the domain and restrict to special type of equations (typically ODEs). Most of them also require the equation form is completely specified. The problem setting is hence very different from ours, where the data is scarce, the equation is arbitrary, and include unknown source terms (functions).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper946/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper946/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Physics Informed Deep Kernel Learning", "authorids": ["~Zheng_Wang2", "wxing@sci.utah.edu", "~Robert_Kirby1", "~Shandian_Zhe1"], "authors": ["Zheng Wang", "Wei Xing", "Robert Kirby", "Shandian Zhe"], "keywords": ["Deep Kernel", "Bayesian Learning"], "abstract": "Deep kernel learning is a promising combination of deep neural networks and nonparametric function estimation.

The estimation is done in a non-parametric manner as posterior inference of Gaussian processes. The authors' proposal is to incorporate physics knowledge into this process. The knowledge here refers to a differential equation on the function to be estimated ($f$), and it may include unknown parameters and an unknown external force term $g$. They derive a joint distribution of 1) observation of $f$, i.e., $y$, 2) \"virtual\" observations $0$ of $g$, 3) latent variable $Z$ for latent force $g$, 4) randomness between $f$ and $g$, and 5) values of $g$. Afterward, they propose to perform a collapsed inference based on a lower bound of the log marginal likelihood (of observations $y$ and virtual observations $0$).\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe problem setting is clear. The proposed method is technically sound, and the experiments are enough convincing to show its superiority to baselines. Regardless of the common points with the latent force models [Alvarez+ 09] in terms of the problem setting, this paper proposes a somewhat new technique to perform inference under the presence of differential equation-based constraints on a target function. I think this paper is a sound work.\n\n### Note\n\nI think a concern lies in the paper's clear violation of the formatting instruction of ICLR 2021. Especially, the too narrow margins before and after headings seem to compress the main text, which might seem quite unfair. I delegate judgment on this regard to the chairs and for now, I decided the rating ignoring this matter.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper946/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper946/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Physics Informed Deep Kernel Learning", "authorids": ["~Zheng_Wang2", "wxing@sci.utah.edu", "~Robert_Kirby1", "~Shandian_Zhe1"], "authors": ["Zheng Wang", "Wei Xing", "Robert Kirby", "Shandian Zhe"], "keywords": ["Deep Kernel", "Bayesian Learning"], "abstract": "Deep kernel learning is a promising combination of deep neural networks and nonparametric function estimation.

It proposes an interesting and technically sounds (and not obvious) way to combine multiple successful components of recent literature in the field.\n\n### Clarity and technical soundness:\nThe paper is clear, technically sound and manipulates tools in an advanced way.\nIt would be useful to provide more intuition and high-level interpretation on the most technical aspects of Deep Kernel inference and on the usage of ELBO methods. That would go at the benefit of understanding for the non-specialists of Kernel-based learning who are interested in Physics Informed ML.\n\n### Results:\nThe results are extensive, are exploiting both simulation-type data and real-world data.\nThe benchmark used for comparison are relevant.\n\n### Applicability:\nIt would be interesting to have a more high-level interpretation and analysis of the applicability of the method to 3D simulation data. \nIn 4.2, it was not clear to me what N and M stand for.

However, as a data-driven approach, the performance of deep kernel learning can still be restricted by scarce or insufficient data, especially in extrapolation tasks.  To address these limitations, we propose Physics Informed Deep Kernel Learning (PI-DKL) that exploits physics  knowledge represented by differential equations with latent sources. Specifically, we use the posterior function sample of the  Gaussian process as the surrogate for the solution of the differential equation, and construct  a generative component to integrate the equation in a principled Bayesian hybrid framework. For efficient and effective inference, we marginalize out the latent variables in the joint probability and derive a simple model evidence lower bound (ELBO), based on which we develop a stochastic collapsed inference algorithm. Our ELBO can be viewed as a nice, interpretable posterior regularization objective. On synthetic datasets and real-world applications, we show the advantage of our approach in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.
