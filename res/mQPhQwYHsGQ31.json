Another contributing factor could involve the design of the boundary detection and superpixel generation procedure that favors over- vs under-segmentation. The high-performance of the boundary prediction methods results in negative and positive examples being mostly distinguishable from the boundary-prediction alone.\r\n\r\nWe hypothesize that many of the object/image features would perform relatively poorly in the absence of the boundary map features. In practice, other work in this area (Andres et al. and Nunez-Iglesias et al., for example) used boundary map-like features. These two factors led us to explore performance gains that could be achieved with additional features, rather than performance using those features in isolation.\r\n\r\nWhile your concerns regarding the domain specific nature of this work are well taken, we note that 3d shape analysis in general is a broad and varied field including tasks such as mesh segmentation, shape retrieval, etc. As a result, we expect that the methods could impact these applications as well, though verification will be needed of course.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the difficulties in understanding the nature of the task. We considered including summaries of the results of similar work on 3d agglomeration, but fear that these could result in confusion, as other methods differ in their heuristics, model design, and optimization methods.

Do they perform only in combination or do they also have a base performance of 90% by themselves?\r\n\r\nThe paper shows very clear benefits of using features from unsupervised learning techniques.
