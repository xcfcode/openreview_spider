The choice of the architecture is motivated by the links between PNNs and ODEs that describe the evolution of dynamical systems. \n\nQuality, clarity, originality and significance:\nPro: The paper is well written and approaches an important inverse problem, how to find anomalies in a dynamical system from some measured time series. The problem of anomaly detection is clearly significant, and the paper could benefit even more from a more extensive experimental setting on real world data. Cons: While the paper is mostly well argumented, I find that it leaves relevant information out that hinder its clarity as detailed below. \n\nThe main motivation of the paper is exemplified in Fig. 1 which shows that abnormal parameters of a dynamical system from the tail of the distribution might lead to normal trajectories, therefore misleading the anomaly detection. While this example is explaining already well the problem, I have a few questions. What are the ODEs generating this data, is this an example of the Van der Pol oscillator? If yes, it would be good to mention that. If it is a different system, is this system one-dimensional (x) or higher-dimensional? When PNN will be applied to this data, will it be applied on the fully observed system (let\u2019s imagine two-dimensional with variables x and y) or will it be applied on the partially observed system (here x)? If the input to PNN will be only x then I believe the Figure is ok, because we try to find anomalies only from x and the plot on the right shows that normal trajectories still correspond to abnormal parameters. However, if the PNN will be applied on other variables in addition to x (let\u2019s say x and y), then we would need to see the trajectories in this two-dimensional (or 3D if adding time) space. Because a trajectory can seem normal in one direction (here x) but appear as abnormal if we plot it in a different space. I believe the trajectories should be shown in the space of the data that will be used as input to PNN. In Sect. 2, is the full data (x and y) given to PNN always (this seems to be the case from eq 3 and Fig. 2)? \n\nI believe the abstract would benefit from a sentence about the results.\n\nEq (1): Why only two parameters a1 and a2? If this hints to the Van der Pol oscillator, then X should be two-dimensional not higher-dimensional. Otherwise, if it is a general dynamical system, $\\theta$ could be used for parameters. And then for illustration purposes as in Fig. 1 assume $\\theta$/$a$ is two-dimensional.\n\nWhat happens if the PNN architecture chosen in eq (3) changes? Are the results robust to the order of the polynomials?\n\nCould the authors provide a reference for Isolation Forest and describe it a little bit and justify its choice?\n\nSect. 2.1: Do we need the same number of layers as the number of stamps? If yes, how to address scalability to real world applications?\n\nSect. 2.2: \u201ccalculate a comprehensive number of features\u201d \u2013 how many features were computed and could the authors give some examples? Why is PCA needed on these features, and what is the impact of the number of PCs on the final results?\n\nWould it be possible to combine the different tables of results into one table for an easier comparison? I am very much surprised by the difference in performance between the LSTM in Table 2 and PNN in Table 3. If LSTMs behave so poorly, are there other methods closer to PNN in performance?\n\nSect.2.4: Some aspects, eg eq (8) could be added to the appendix. Not sure I fully understand how the TM-PNN is constructed by \u201csequential concatenation\u201d. Could the authors detail on this? What are the running times for ODE and PNN is Table 4?\n\nSect. 3: Would it be possible to have more details on the data? Some details are mentioned in the last paragraph from Conclusions, but could be moved here. What does this data represent, unless there are confidential issues? Eq (3) is a third order, not second order \u2013 which one is used here? Fig. 3, similar to Fig.1, should show the trajectories in the same space as the input to RNN, which might be more than one dimension (here x). \n\nFig. 4: I might be missing smth, but not sure I understand what are the parallel coordinates?\n\nRelated literature: there is a strong trend in ML in using Neural ODEs for modeling dynamical systems.

It shows the proposed polynomial neural network-based approach, which uses the fitted weights as extracted features, outperforms both classical statistical features and an LSTM autoencoder-based neural network.\n\nIt is indeed interesting and of practical value to distinguish any anomaly condition resulting from an abnormal configuration of the dynamical system, especially when it is difficult to accomplish using classical methods. \n\nHowever, there are some places where this paper needs to further clarify:\n- It is mentioned the proposed method will \u201ctrain a separate PNN for each trajectory and consider fitted weights as features for further anomaly scoring\u201d. If this is the case, I don\u2019t see how two similar trajectories ($X,t$), with one deemed anomalous, would result in significantly different PNN weights based on equations (2), (3), and (9).\n- The anomaly score needs to be clearly defined. From Figure 3, it seems a lower anomaly score indicates a higher chance of a trajectory being abnormal. However, I was thinking of the exact opposite while reading through the text.\n- It should be further clarified that the color code on the left subplot of Figure 1 should be the probability of getting a specific ($a_1, a_2$) pair, rather than the anomaly score on the right subplot.\n- Is it possible to use standard ODE-based fitting without any prior knowledge of the dynamic system (the $a_1=a_2=0$ assumption in Section 2.4)?
