The experiments are extremely limited, on a toy task. No other baseline than (Mueller and Thyagarajan, 2016) is considered. The related work section lacks important references. It is hard to find positive points that would advocate for a presentation at ICLR.\n\n* DETAILED REVIEW *\n\nOn related work, the authors need to consider related work on cross lingual retrieval, multilingual document representation:\n\nBai, Bing, et al. \"Learning to rank with (a lot of) word features.\" Information retrieval 13.3 (2010): 291-314.

Cross-lingual sentiment classification with bilingual document representation learning. In ACL 2016\n\n...\n\nOn evaluation, the authors need to learn about standard retrieval evaluation metrics such as precision at top 10, etc and use them. For instance, this book will be a good read.\n\nBaeza-Yates, Ricardo, and Berthier Ribeiro-Neto. Modern information retrieval. Vol. 463. New York: ACM press, 1999.\n\nOn learning objective, the authors might want to read about learn-to-rank objectives for information retrieval, for instance, \n\nLiu, Tie-Yan. \"Learning to rank for information retrieval.\" Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval 3.3 (2009): 225-331.\n\nBurges, Christopher JC. \"From ranknet to lambdarank to lambdamart: An overview.\" Learning 11, no. 23-581 (2010): 81.\n\nChapelle, Olivier, and Yi Chang. \"Yahoo! learning to rank challenge overview.\" Proceedings of the Learning to Rank Challenge. 2011.\n\nHerbrich, Ralf, Thore Graepel, and Klaus Obermayer. \"Large margin rank boundaries for ordinal regression.\" (2000).\n\nOn experimental setup, the authors want to consider a setup with more than 8k training documents. More importantly, ranking a document set of 1k documents is extremely small, toyish. For instance, (Schwenk et al 2017) search through 1.5 million sentences. (Bai, Bing, et al 2009) search through 140k documents. Since you mainly introduces 2 modifications with respect to (Mueller and Thyagarajan, 2016), i.e  (i) not sharing the parameters on both branch of the siamese and (ii) the fully connected net on top, I would suggest to measure the effect of each of them both on multilingual data and on the SICK dataset used in (Mueller and Thyagarajan, 2016).", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Estimation of cross-lingual news similarities using text-mining methods", "abstract": "Every second, innumerable text data, including all kinds news, reports, messages, reviews, comments, and twits have been generated on the Internet,  which is written not only in English but also in other languages such as Chinese, Japanese, French and so on.

Not only SNS sites but also worldwide news agency such as Thomson Reuters News provide news reported in more than 20 languages, reflecting the significance of the multilingual information.\nIn this research, by taking advantage of multi-lingual text resources provided by the Thomson Reuters News, we developed a bidirectional LSTM based method to calculate cross-lingual semantic text similarity for long text and short text respectively. Thus, users could understand the situation comprehensively, by investigating similar and related cross-lingual articles, when there an important news comes in.", "pdf": "/pdf/264283bc493fe735c93cd671a0ae68a6b4ccbec9.pdf", "paperhash": "wang|estimation_of_crosslingual_news_similarities_using_textmining_methods", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nwang2018estimation,\ntitle={Estimation of cross-lingual news similarities using text-mining methods},\nauthor={Zhouhao Wang and Enda Liu and Hiroki Sakaji and Tomoki Ito and Kiyoshi Izumi and Kota Tsubouchi and Tatsuo Yamashita},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1HNP0eCW},\n}", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zhouhao Wang", "Enda Liu", "Hiroki Sakaji", "Tomoki Ito", "Kiyoshi Izumi", "Kota Tsubouchi", "Tatsuo Yamashita"], "authorids": ["wangzhouhao94@gmail.com", "m2015eliu@socsim.org", "sakaji@sys.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp", "m2015titoh@socsim.org", "izumi@sys.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp", "ktsubouc@yahoo-corp.jp", "tayamash@yahoo-corp.jp"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "duedate": 1511845199000, "tmdate": 1515642450666, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper451/Official_Review", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper451/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper451/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper451/AnonReviewer2", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper451/AnonReviewer3"], "reply": {"forum": "r1HNP0eCW", "replyto": "r1HNP0eCW", "writers": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper451/AnonReviewer[0-9]+", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "review": {"required": true, "order": 2, "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}"}, "rating": {"required": true, "order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"]}, "confidence": {"required": true, "order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"]}}}, "nonreaders": [], "expdate": 1519621199000, "cdate": 1515642450666}}}], "count": 5}
