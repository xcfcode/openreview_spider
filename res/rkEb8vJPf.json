The application is certainly consequential and the quality of the writing is generally good.  However, there isn't much evidence that neural networks are a great choice for this application.  There is an impression of the motivation simply being that neural networks have had good performance on a number of various tasks, so it's worth trying them for this task as well, which seems a bit too arbitrary for presentation.  For example, is a MLP really needed to learn something as simple as the blue curve in Figure 1?  Such structure can be easily learned with very standard interpretable models.  I would be concerned in this case that MLPs could overfit, and also you would lack a natural framework for making uncertainty estimates, which seem critically important in this setting.  If there had been more empirical evidence relative to good models, or careful motivation about why specifically neural networks are a good choice, I may have been swayed.

To address this, they propose and then fit a few different neural-network based function approximators to  certain parts of a standard Hawkes process based rate estimator for spatio-temporal earth quake event data.\n\nThe premise of the paper may well be true (that popular geological 'laws' are much coarser approximations than we could have given modern estimation techniques), however I am not convinced by the analysis.  I am confused by the leap to neural-network approximators in the first place; skipping altogether a simpler set of model comparisons that could be made: e.g. the swap of an exponential law for the plausible (and often more natural) mixture of power laws (i.e. g(m_e) \\propto \\sum_i w_i m_e^i), or indeed Gaussian process based function approximators (which are as I understand it popular in the geostatistics community and straightforwardly support output uncertainty estimation, a convolutional interpretation, and the ability to control the function space considered viable).\n\nI am a bit confused by the set of 'generic' convolutions proposed in section 6 and 'DCNN' too: are these still causal in time, i.e. are we smoothing or filtering through time?\n\nSome more nit-picky comments:\n* In section 3, I find the use of M and m to be confusing.  I'm not sure whether this notation was deliberate or a typo.\n* In figure 1 it would be great to see some uncertainty estimates on this MLP estimator function estimator, even via simple dropout or similar.  It would also be nice to have some commentary on the non smoothness and apparent 0 tangent of g(m) for m=2?\n* I am not convinced by likelihood gain on validation data I am afraid, particularly for a discretised point process; depending on how the data is distributed these things can be notoriously sensitive to bin size and position, and I don't see much discussion of this in the paper.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Representation Learning for Seismic Hawkes Processes", "abstract": "Today, more than half a billion people live under the threat of devastating earthquakes.

We replace small components of a popular Hawkes process model for earthquake forecasting with black-box neural networks, with the goal of maintaining a similar level of interpretability as the original model. Using experiments on about three decades of earthquake hypocenter and magnitude estimates, we visualize our learned representations for earthquake events and discuss interpretability-accuracy tradeoffs. Our visualization may be useful to provide refinements to the Utsu/Ohmori law for the time-decay of aftershock productivity (Utsu, 1971).", "paperhash": "belanger|representation_learning_for_seismic_hawkes_processes", "keywords": ["hawkes process", "deep learning", "earthquakes"], "_bibtex": "@misc{\n  belanger2018representation,\n  title={Representation Learning for Seismic Hawkes Processes},\n  author={David Belanger and Yaniv Ovadia and Maxwell Bileschi and Brendan Meade},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkEb8vJPf}\n}", "authorids": ["dbelanger@google.com", "yovadia@google.com", "mlbileschi@google.com", "meade@fas.harvard.edu"], "authors": ["David Belanger", "Yaniv Ovadia", "Maxwell Bileschi", "Brendan Meade"], "TL;DR": "earthquake prediction", "pdf": "/pdf/dd9561d328ff052c9b11c75d1046a1a5f53097a4.pdf"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "duedate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "tmdate": 1518629844880, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/-/Acceptance_Decision", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs"], "reply": {"forum": null, "replyto": null, "invitation": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/-/Submission", "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs"]}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs"]}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "value-dropdown": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs", "everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 1, "value": "ICLR 2018 Workshop Acceptance Decision"}, "comment": {"required": false, "order": 3, "description": "(optional) Comment on this decision.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{0,5000}"}, "decision": {"required": true, "order": 2, "value-dropdown": ["Accept", "Reject"]}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "cdate": 1518629844880}}}], "count": 5}
