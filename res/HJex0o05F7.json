However, some major issues with the paper remain:\n\n1. Simply plugging deep-learning with active learning (for anomaly detection) is not a significant contribution.\n\n2. The theory in the paper is completely redundant and its implications are already well-known and well-appreciated. There is no need to introduce a superficial 'no free anomaly' theorem. It is independent of the algorithm and hence seems quite out-of-place.\n\n3. It is correct that the paper lacks space for some critical aspects. However, this is a problem arising out of the paper's organization. For instance, the theory and the results on the synthetic data such as Figure 3 are not relevant and uninteresting. You could remove all these and try addressing the more important concerns which are of significance to anomaly detection and which possibly extend active learning with deep learning into new territory. The current approach is merely plugging in one black box over other older ones."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper864/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper864/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper864/AnonReviewer3", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "UaiNets: From Unsupervised to Active Deep Anomaly Detection", "abstract": "This work presents a method for active anomaly detection which can be built upon existing deep learning solutions for unsupervised anomaly detection.

And further clarifications.", "comment": "We would like to again thank you for your very thorough and detailed review.\nWe tried to incorporate all the feedback into the manuscript, starting by changing its title to 'UaiNets: From Unsupervised to Active Deep Anomaly Detection'.\nWe believe this title better represents the main point of this work: translating unsupervised deep anomaly detection models to active ones.\nWe also tried to change the verbiage in the paper to make this clearer.\n\nWe have already addressed most of the points raised in the commentary bellow (before rebuttal period), but now that we incorporated it into the manuscript would like to readdress a few.\n\n1. Related Works: \"...active anomaly detection remains an under-explored approach to this problem...\"\n-> We still believe it is under explored, although we made it clear that there are some very interesting prior work on this.\n\n4. The paper mentions that s(x) might not be differentiable. However, the sigmoid form of s(x) is differentiable.\n-> We ran it allowing gradients through s(x) and the network improves on most datasets.\n-- But, since the underlying models might have non differentiable s(x), we kept the old results in the paper. We believe they are more representative.\n\n5. Does not acknowledge the well-known result that mixture models are unidentifiable. The math in the paper is mostly redundant. Some references:\n-> We added a short acknowledgement in Section 2.1.\n\n6. Does not acknowledge existing work that adds classifier over unsupervised detectors (such as AI2). This is very common.\n-> We read AI2 carefully and, if we understood correctly, it does not add a classifier over unsupervised detectors.\n-- It uses both a supervised classifier (random forest) and an unsupervised ensemble in a parallel manner to find anomalies.\n-- It trains both the unsupervised and supervised using the same set of features M, although the supervised model is only trained on the already labeled instances.\n-- So the only other work that adds classifier over unsupervised detectors would be LODA-AAD and Tree-AAD, which we address as really important prior work.\n-- We do it differently than they do though.\n\n-- To the best of our knowledge ours is the first work which applies deep learning to active anomaly detection.\n-- We believe this is also the first work to approach active anomaly detection in an end-to-end manner.\n---   Other work, such as LODA-AAD and Tree-AAD have a phase where they train their underline algorithms, and another which uses labeled instances to learns weights to change these underlying results.\n---   At the same time, AI^2 learns two separate models, an unsupervised and a supervised one, each with its advantages.\n---   Ours uses a composite loss function composed of the underlying model's loss added to the UAI layer one (binary cross entropy only applied to labeled instances).\n---   We tried to make this clearer in the text.\n-- Figures 9 and 10 in Appendix C.1 show why learning representations end-to-end is important.\n\n8. Does not compare against current state-of-the-art Tree-based AAD\n-> Added comparison\n\n9. The 'Generalized' in the title is incorrect and misleading. This is specific to deep-networks. Stacking supervised classifiers on unsupervised detectors is very common. See comments on related works.\n-> We changed the title.\n\n10. Does not propose any other query strategies than greedily selecting top.\n-> We believe this would be a very interesting research topic, one we want to study, but it deserves a paper on its own.\n-- It would be too dense a topic to cram it in here, so we followed the same strategy as prior work when doing this.\n-- This paper already had 25 pages and we could not address this issue here."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper864/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper864/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper864/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "UaiNets: From Unsupervised to Active Deep Anomaly Detection", "abstract": "This work presents a method for active anomaly detection which can be built upon existing deep learning solutions for unsupervised anomaly detection.

We do not think the novelty is marginal.\n   Deep Learning architectures excel exactly as feature extractors, being great for learning representations.\n   Besides, we show through the experiments in Appendix C.1 that end to end learning helps the base architecture learn better feature representations for anomaly detection.\n\n7. We do not argue that a prior needs to be assumed for all cases (although the no free lunch theorem does). We only argue that unsupervised anomaly detection needs one.\n   Supervised algorithms have, in general, presented good priors for most supervised learning problems, and the UAI layer learns in a supervised (active) way.\n   We also show in Section 4.1 that although unsupervised active learning have to trade off accuracy in a setting for another, active algorithms are robust to their choice and can give good results in all analyzed settings.\n\n8. We should have compared to them. Here are the results:\nTree-AAD      0.89* 0.29 0.86 0.50 0.32 0.53 0.69 0.76 0.94 0.59 0.92\nDAE_uai        0.94   0.47 0.57 0.91 0.33 0.55 0.66 0.64 0.86 0.60 0.93\nIn order: KDDCUP, Arrhythmia, Thyroid, KDDCUP-Rev, Yeast, Abalone, CTG, Credit Card, Covtype, MMG, Shuttle\n* to to run Tree-AAD on KDDCUP we needed to limit its memory about the anomalies it had already learned, forgetting the oldest ones. This reduced its runtime complexity from O(b^2) to O(b) in our tests, where b is the budget limit for the anomaly detection task.\n\n9. We can see how it might be misleading and will consider changing the title.\n\n10. Greedily selecting top is a good strategy in practical settings and (Das et al. 2016) and (Das et al. 2017) also use it.\n    In practical scenarios we want to have the most anomalies for a given budget, so selecting the most anomalous instance at a time is a useful strategy.\n    Also, if we select a non anomalous instance, we will use it to correct our probability distribution, improving our results in the next iteration.\n    Finally, since anomaly detection is already a highly imbalanced setting, we might not get anomalous instances even when picking top anomalous results, so actively searching them might be a good choice.\n\n11. What do you mean by streaming?\n    Section 4.3 shows a setting when we have new anomalous instances arriving and we want to detect anomalies in it.\n    If you wanted to run it on streaming data you would need to revisit the previously labeled instances every one in a while to keep training on them, while continuing training the base model on the streamed data."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper864/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper864/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper864/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "UaiNets: From Unsupervised to Active Deep Anomaly Detection", "abstract": "This work presents a method for active anomaly detection which can be built upon existing deep learning solutions for unsupervised anomaly detection.

In the well known (Chandola et al. 2009) survey, they don't mention active learning at all. Only citing (Abe et al. 2006) as supervised anomaly detection. (Das et al. 2016) only has 12 citations and (Das et al. 2017) has only one self-citation. These are some really interesting works in this area, but we believe if this was a well-researched topic they would have more recognition (assuming citations can be used as a measure for recognition).\n   Nonetheless, we should indeed have cited (Veeramachaneni et al. 2016) and (Das et al. 2017).

Our architecture can be built on top of state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection models, so using them during our models cold start is a good option. it gives state of the art anomaly detection in these first steps.\n   We state in the paper though that an interesting future work would be \"using the UAI layers confidence in its output to dynamically choose between either directly using its scores, or using the underlying unsupervised model\u2019s anomaly score to choose which instances to audit next\".\n   This is not straight forward though, since confidence scores from deep learning architectures are usually unregulated.\n\n3. Our model has several hyper parameters, but we show through our experiments that the network can produce good results to all analyzed datasets with the same choice of hyper parameters.\n   We only change k when dealing with datasets with few anomalies to give the model the chance to further interact with labels.\n   Our algorithm is robust to k. For k \u2208 {5; 10; 20; 30; 40; 50; 100}, using KDDCUP-rev, we get F1 scores of {0.90; 0.91; 0.90; 0.90; 0.91; 0.91; 0.91}, respectively, with no statistical difference between them (p < 0.1).\n   The choice of k is left to the user, since it might depend on their business model.\n   A large company with several experts might want to parallelize the models feedback and get more instances per iteration with the model.\n\n4. Both base models used have differentiable s(x) (squared error in DAE and sigmoid in classifier), but we wanted to build an architecture which could (potentially) be applied to different deep learning models in the future. Since this models might have non differentiable s(x) we didn't allow gradients to flow through it in our experiments.\n   we didn't test this, but we believe we might actually see better results if we allowed gradients through s(x).\n\n5. We believe our results expand on the unidentifiability of mixture models, showing that in this case *all* possible options are equally unidentifiable.\n   Nonetheless we should have cited these results and will mention and compare to them during rebuttal phase."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper864/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper864/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper864/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "UaiNets: From Unsupervised to Active Deep Anomaly Detection", "abstract": "This work presents a method for active anomaly detection which can be built upon existing deep learning solutions for unsupervised anomaly detection.

Does not acknowledge existing work that adds classifier over unsupervised detectors (such as AI2). This is very common.\n  - This is another linear model (logistic) on top of transformed features.

While the paper argues that a prior needs to be assumed, it does not use any in the algorithm. There seems to be a disconnect. It also does not acknowledge that AAD (LODA/Tree) does use a prior. Priors for anomaly proportions in unsupervised algorithms are well-known (most AD algos support that such as OC-SVM, Isolation Forest, LOF, etc.).\n  \n8.
