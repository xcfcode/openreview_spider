The authors motivate this idea in two ways: (1) autoregressive models that are bidirectional, and (2) non-autoregressive likelihood-based models of discrete data. They show that flows on discrete data do not need an expensive log-det-Jacobian step. However, they require a function mapping from discrete variables to discrete variables. As such a function is not directly differentiable, this paper uses a straight-through gradient estimator.\n\nThis is an interesting idea but is not that well fleshed out. A more thorough discussion of calculating gradients through the discrete outputs of their neural networks seems in order. Additionally, the experiments shown are on very small toy data.\n\nPros:\n- Interesting idea\n- Clear, no-nonsense writing\n\nCons:\n- No experiments on real data \n- Straight-through estimator seems limiting (e.g. not sure how it applies to non-ordinal data)\n", "rating": "3: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/DeepGenStruct/Paper32/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/DeepGenStruct/Paper32/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Discrete Flows: Invertible Generative Models of Discrete Data", "authors": ["Dustin Tran", "Keyon Vafa", "Kumar Agrawal", "Laurent Dinh", "Ben Poole"], "authorids": ["pooleb@google.com", "trandustin@google.com", "keyon.vafa@columbia.edu", "agrawalk@google.com", "laurentdinh@google.com"], "keywords": ["discrete data", "normalizing flows", "autoregressive", "realnvp"], "TL;DR": "We extend autoregressive flows and RealNVP to discrete data.", "abstract": "While normalizing flows have led to significant advances in modeling high-dimensional continuous distributions, their applicability to discrete distributions remains unknown.
