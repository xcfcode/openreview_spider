The main point of the paper is to compare the approach of using face detection and directly classifying the front seat image. They improve accuracy from 92% to 96% with full image classification. It also compares different aggregation methods on top of hand-designed features like SIFT: bag of words, fisher vector or VLAD, and shows better results using Fisher vectors. Other work has also been using more than just face detection but not the entire window itself. The novelty of this work is very limited and is mostly in the trivial idea of using the entire passenger image for classification.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- improving accuracy to 96% over face approach (92%).\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- no novelty.\r\n- no representation learning."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Occupancy Detection in Vehicles Using Fisher Vector Image Representation", "decision": "submitted, no decision", "abstract": "Due to the high volume of traffic on modern roadways, transportation agencies have proposed High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes and High Occupancy Tolling (HOT) lanes to promote car pooling.

The paper presents experiments comparing different approaches. In particular the paper explores solving the problem through using: a) Zhu and Ramanan's deformable part model for face detection, and using the detections for the final result, b) the use of Fisher Vectors in the sense of Jaakkola and Haussler, (1998), c) a variant of the widely used bag of visual words (BoW) representation, and d) a technique referred to as Vectors of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD). Techniques b), c) and d) use a traditional SVM approach for the final classification. The Fisher vector technique appears to have better performance compared to the other methods explored in this paper.\r\n\r\nThe paper looks at a concrete practical application and explores ways for solving the problem that are fairly in line with current practices in computer vision. The face detection based comparison is certainly important and interesting. However, it is not clear from the current manuscript exactly how the model of Zhu and Ramanan was trained for the experiments here. Was the face detector trained on the training set defined here? Or, was the face detector used with the pre-learned parameters as distributed on their website? The performance could be dramatically different depending on how the method was trained. The size of the test train splits for the other experiments are also not given and the issue of SVM hyper-parameter tuning is not discussed.\r\n\r\nThe Fisher feature vector technique presented here could be viewed as a form of representation learning, but this is really more of a vision application and method comparison paper as opposed to a paper deeply exploring aspects of representation learning. The paper also has some language problems."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Occupancy Detection in Vehicles Using Fisher Vector Image Representation", "decision": "submitted, no decision", "abstract": "Due to the high volume of traffic on modern roadways, transportation agencies have proposed High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes and High Occupancy Tolling (HOT) lanes to promote car pooling.
