The angle bias is non-zero as long as the random vector is non-zero in expectation and the given vector is non-zero.  This suggests that the some of the units in a deep neural network have large values (either positive or negative) regardless of the input, which in turn suggests vanishing gradient.  The proposed solution to angle bias is to place a linear constraint such that the sum of the weight becomes zero.  Although this does not rule out angle bias in general, it does so for the very special case where the expected value of the random vector is a vector consisting of a common value.  Nevertheless, numerical experiments suggest that the proposed approach can effectively reduce angle bias and improves the accuracy for training data in the CIFAR-10 task.  Test accuracy is not improved, however.\n\nOverall, this paper introduces an interesting phenomenon that is worth studying to gain insights into how to train deep neural networks, but the results are rather preliminary both on theory and experiments.\n\nOn the theoretical side, the linearly constrained weights are only shown to work for a very special case.  There can be many other approaches to mitigate the impact of angle bias.  For example, how about scaling each variable in a way that the mean becomes zero, instead of scaling it into [-1,+1] as is done in the experiments?  When the mean of input is zero, there is no angle bias in the first layer.  Also, what about if we include the bias term so that b + w a is the preactivation value?\n\nOn the experimental side, it has been shown that linearly constrained weights can mitigate the impact of angle bias on vanishing gradient and can reduce the training error, but the test error is unfortunately increased for the particular task with the particular dataset in the experiments.  It would be desirable to identify specific tasks and datasets for which the proposed approach outperforms baselines.  It is intuitively expected that the proposed approach has some merit in some domains, but it is unclear exactly when and where it is.\n\nMinor comments:\n\nIn Section 2.2, is Layer 1 the input layer or the next?", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Linearly Constrained Weights: Resolving the Vanishing Gradient Problem by Reducing Angle Bias", "abstract": "In this paper, we first identify \\textit{angle bias}, a simple but remarkable phenomenon that causes the vanishing gradient problem in a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with sigmoid activation functions.

", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "review": "Pros:\nThe paper is easy to read. Logic flows naturally within the paper.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Experimental results are neither enough nor convincing. \n\nOnly one set of data is used throughout the paper: the Cifar10 dataset, and the architecture used is only a 100 layered MLP. Even though LCW performs better than others in this circumstance, it does not prove its effectiveness in general or its elimination of the gradient vanishing problem. For the 100 layer MLP, it's very hard to train a simple MLP and the training/testing accuracy is very low for all the methods. More experiments with different number of layers and different architecture like ResNet should be tried to show better results. \n\nIn Figure (7), LCW seems to avoid gradient vanishing but introduces gradient exploding problem.\n\nThe proposed concept is only analyzed in MLP with Sigmoid activation function. In the experimental parts, the authors claim they use both ReLU and Sigmoid function, but no comparisons are reflected in the figures. \n\n2. The whole standpoint of the paper is quite vague and not very convincing.\nIn section 2, the authors introduce angle bias and suggest its effect in MLPs that with random weights, showing that different samples may result in similar output in the second and deeper layers. However, the connection between angle bias and the issue of gradient vanishing lacks a clear analytical connection. The whole analysis of the connection is built solely on this one sentence \"At the same time, the output does not change if we adjust the weight vectors in Layer 1\", which is nowhere verified. \n\nFurther, the phenomenon is only tested on random initialization. When the network is trained for several iterations and becomes more settled, it is not clear how \"angle affect\" affects gradient vanishing problem.\n\n\nMinors:\n1.

The angle bias results in almost constant\nactivation independent of input sample resulting in no weight updates for error reduction.\nAuthors chose to add an additional optimization constraint LCW (|w|=0) to achieve zero-mean\npre-activation while, as mentioned in the article.\n\nResponse 1: We did not intend to indicate that the proposed method (LCW) adds additional\nconstraint ||w||=0 on weight vectors, and we have added an explanation to clearly state that\nit is assumed that ||w|| > 0 in our paper to the first paragraph of Section 2.1 in the\nrevised manuscript.\nThe proposed method adds constraints 'w_1 + .. + w_m = 0' on weight vectors w, where\nw = (w_1, ..., w_m)^\\top in R^m, to force w perpendicular to 1_m = (1, ..., 1) in R^m,\nwhich is assumed to be the mean vector of the activation vector in the previous layer.\n\n--\n\nComment 2: Clearly, because of lack of scaling factor in case of LCW, like that in BN,\nit does not perform well when used with ReLU. When using with sigmoid the activation being\nbounded (0,1) seems to compensate for the lack of scaling in input.\n\nResponse 2: As the reviewer pointed out, the lack of scaling factor in LCW is a cause\nfor not performing well with ReLU. We tried ReLU6 (= min(max(x, 0), 6)) instead\nof ReLU with LCW, but it was still hard to train a deep MLP, in which the exploding gradient\nstill occurred. We are now developing methods to make LCW applicable to ReLU nets.\n\n--\n\nComment 3: While BN explicitly makes the activation zero-mean LCW seems to achieve it through\nconstraint on the weight features. Though it is shown to be computationally less expensive\nLCW seems to work in only specific cases unlike BN.\n\nResponse 3: We agree that LCW has limitation compared to BN as of now. However, it is also\nvery important to understand why batch normalization works so well in many situations.\nWe believe that reducing angle bias is a crucial role of batch normalization, and such\ninterpretation helps us to determine in which part of the network we should apply methods\nlike batch normalization."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Linearly Constrained Weights: Resolving the Vanishing Gradient Problem by Reducing Angle Bias", "abstract": "In this paper, we first identify \\textit{angle bias}, a simple but remarkable phenomenon that causes the vanishing gradient problem in a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with sigmoid activation functions.

When the mean of input is zero,\nthere is no angle bias in the first layer.\n\nResponse 1: We did experiments with CIFAR-10, in which each variable was scaled to have\nzero mean. As the reviewer pointed out, we have no angle bias in the first layer (the layer\nafter the input layer) in this case.\nHowever, the training of MLPs then got harder and the test accuracy was very row, even if\nwe applied either LCW or batch-normalization. We think this is because normalizing each pixel\nof images in CIFAR-10 ruined the relationship between pixels.\n\n--\n\nComment 2: What about if we include the bias term so that b + w a is the preactivation value?\n\nResponse 2: We have already included the bias term in our original experiment, although\nit was omitted in Equation 2 for simplicity. We have modified Equation 2 to include\nthe bias term for clarity in the revised manuscript.\n\n--\n\nComment 3: It would be desirable to identify specific tasks and datasets for which\nthe proposed approach outperforms baselines. It is intuitively expected that the proposed\napproach has some merit in some domains, but it is unclear exactly when and where it is.\n\nResponse 3: We did additional experiments with the SVHN dataset and the CIFAR-100 dataset,\nwhich are reported in the appendix B of the revised manuscript. The peak value of the test\naccuracy of the proposed method was comparable to that of batch-normalization when the MLP\nhas 5 layers or 50 layers, as shown in Figure 12 (f) and (i), Figure 14 (f) and (i), and\nFigure 15 (f) and (i).\nAn interesting point is that the peak of the test accuracy is around 20 epochs in the\nproposed method. However, we have no clear explanation for this finding. We have added\na description on this point in the third paragraph of Section 5.1 in the revised manuscript.\n\n--\n\nComment 4: In Section 2.2, is Layer 1 the input layer or the next?\n\nResponse 4: Layer 1 is the layer next to the input layer. We have added an explanation of\nthese points to the first paragraph of Section 2.2.1 in the revised version.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Linearly Constrained Weights: Resolving the Vanishing Gradient Problem by Reducing Angle Bias", "abstract": "In this paper, we first identify \\textit{angle bias}, a simple but remarkable phenomenon that causes the vanishing gradient problem in a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with sigmoid activation functions.
