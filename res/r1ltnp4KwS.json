The motivation for this is to improve upon the interpretability of the CNN, which is empirically shown by comparing the class activation maps (CAMs) of regular CNN and the proposed LSG-CNN. While the idea is interesting, one of the concerns from reviewers is about limited applicability of the method, at least the way it is shown in experiments -- a concern that I tend to agree with. As primary goal of the work is improving interpretability of CNNs, authors should test LSG-CNN with some more recent methods for producing the saliency maps other than CAM to convincingly establish the value of the method. Authors also mention lack of hyperparameter tuning and the use of SGD with limited training epochs as a reason for the drop in accuracy. It will be worth spending some effort so the accuracy matches the standard benchmarks -- this will help in arguing more convincingly about practical benefit of the method.

The novelty of the paper is to introduce the Label-Sensitive Gate path during the training, on top of the standard training path. This encourages the filters to extract class-sensitive features. \n\nThe highlight of the experimental results is that by incorporating the LSG structure, the author is able to achieve better localization with CAM because the filters are trained to extract more relevant features. Additionally, filters from different classes are kind of \"orthogonal\" to each other.\n\nHowever, I have a few questions for the author:\n\na) In Figure 5, the author mentions \"TP/FN\" samples in the caption. However, for the plot at the right, it is titled with \"False Positive\". Is this a typo or do you talk about something else? \n\nb) In Figure 7, the author shows the correlation matrix of filters. Since the filters belonging to one class are highly correlated (block matrices in plot d), why do not train even less filters for each class? If we train less filters for each class, will that hurt the performance? It might be a good direction on how to interpret filters from one class and how to make intra-class filters more interpretable.\n\nOverall, the novelty of the paper is limited by the scope of the experimental results. Why would people care about interpretability of CNN filters is not explained clearly. The paper shows interpretable filters could help with localization. However, this is the only example in the paper I find useful. It would be better if the author could show any other applications. Moreover, I wish the author could spend more paragraph discussing why filters belonging to different classes tend to be orthogonal to each other. This is not clearly written (Eq(3)?). A more theoretical/intuitive explanation would also make the paper stronger as well.\n\nIf the paper could omtroduce more real applications of the proposed LSG model and give more theoretical/intuitive explanations of why the inter-class filters are orthogonal, I would be willing to raise up my scores.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper788/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper788/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["lianghy18@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn", "oyzh18@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn", "suhangss@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn", "zengyy19@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn", "zihaoh@usc.edu", "xiast@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn", "dcszj@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn", "dcszb@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn"], "title": "Training Interpretable Convolutional Neural Networks towards Class-specific Filters", "authors": ["Haoyu Liang", "Zhihao Ouyang", "Hang Su", "Yuyuan Zeng", "Zihao He", "Shu-tao Xia", "Jun Zhu", "Bo Zhang"], "pdf": "/pdf/46b842f63e08d5aa5a51deb150f9313d3611ac60.pdf", "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have often been treated as \u201cblack-box\u201d and successfully used in a range of tasks.

(2) It would be better if the author could show any other applications. \n\nA: Interpretability of deep neural networks (DNNs) is essential for practical applications since it enables users to understand the overall strengths and weaknesses of the models, conveys an understanding of how the models will behave in the future, and how to diagnose and correct potential problems. Please also refer to R1 for review #1 for clear motivation of improving interpretability of CNN filters. \n\nAnd we have conducted more **quantitative analysis towards localization**, and experiments for **adversarial samples detection** as another application. Please refer to Section 4.4 and 4.5 in our revised version. The advantages of the improved interpretability of our LSG CNNs can be summarized as follows.\n\n1. LSG training leads to class-specific representation which helps us analyze the inner logic of CNNs and makes it easier to extract class-specific features by checking the learned gate matrix.\n\n2. As shown in Sec 4.4, the localization performances are consistently boosted in most experiments. LSG training encourages top convolutional each filter to focus on fewer classes, which obviously implies feature map can localize a class better.\n\n3. For the experiments of adversarial samples detection, we can achieve higher AUC scores with LSG CNN features comparing with STD CNN features. The insight behind is that the activation pattern of adversarial and normal samples is gradually different from lower layer to high layers. Thus the class-specific high-level features make it easier to detect the abnormal behaviour of adversarial samples.\n\nWe believe that the better class-specific representation indicates more potential value in many tasks associated with the working mechanism of filters.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper788/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper788/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["lianghy18@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn", "oyzh18@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn", "suhangss@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn", "zengyy19@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn", "zihaoh@usc.edu", "xiast@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn", "dcszj@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn", "dcszb@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn"], "title": "Training Interpretable Convolutional Neural Networks towards Class-specific Filters", "authors": ["Haoyu Liang", "Zhihao Ouyang", "Hang Su", "Yuyuan Zeng", "Zihao He", "Shu-tao Xia", "Jun Zhu", "Bo Zhang"], "pdf": "/pdf/46b842f63e08d5aa5a51deb150f9313d3611ac60.pdf", "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have often been treated as \u201cblack-box\u201d and successfully used in a range of tasks.

To reduce redundant filters during training, LSG is constrained with a sparsity regularization.

Will this hurt the performance?\n\nA: It is reasonable that the highly correlated intra-class filters in Fig 7 indicates that we can train fewer filters for each class. However, the motivation of our paper is to improve the interpretability of CNNs by handling the many-to-many mapping of filters and features as shown in Figure 1. Instead of concerning with the intra-class filters, disentangling the inter-class filters plays an important role in improving such interpretability. Thus, in our paper, we mainly focus on disentangling the filters between classes and did not try to redesign the model architectures. \n\nQ: It might be a good direction on how to interpret filters from one class and how to make the intra-class filters more interpretable.\n\nA: We agree with your opinion that it is a potential direction to reduce the correlation of intra-class filters. On the one hand, it could reduce the redundant filters to get a light-weight network structures like model pruning indicated in the related work. On the other hand,  it could help to train a more efficient model with better generalization as in (Prakash, Aaditya, et al.  2019). Besides, we believe with reduce intra-class filter correlation will bring better interpretability. Based on the current work, we will consider to further interpret intra-class filters by adding explicit regularization or filters pruning.  \n\nBy the way, thanks for your careful review and discover the typo in Figure 5.

Then we use an LSG training algorithm (Algorithm 1) to search for $G$.

We have given an intuitive explanation for the orthogonality in the revised version. Then in further analysis we observed in Figure 7 (e) that LSG significantly reduces the redundant weak correlation between most filter pairs, which are mostly for different classes.\n\nIt is a natural opinion that the reduction of filter redundancy is brought by the orthogonality of inter-class filters. Because for a set of filter groups orthogonal to each other, a filter in any group can not be a linear representation with the filters from other groups. This directly avoids redundant filter across groups. Besides, (Prakash, Aaditya, et al. 2019) conducted experiments to reduce filter redundancy by enforcing  filter orthogonality, which also verifies the opinion above.\n\nQ\uff1aInstead of evaluating the activation of the classification layer, it is possible to check the activation of the filters of the last convolutional layers.\n\nA: In our paper the focus is always on the top convolutional layer rather than the classification layer. We have made the concentration on the top convolutional layer more obvious in our new introduction. Besides, all the experiments have always been revolving around the top convolutional layer.\n\nQ: Another way to enforce a similar pattern on the gating function would be by maximizing the mutual information between selected filters and classes.\n\nA: Thanks for your advice.

Therefore, we were not dedicated significantly to improving the classification accuracy of our model on CIFAR-10 using all kinds of optimization tricks, such as the fine-tuning of optimizer hyper-parameters, the initial learning rate, or the learning rate schedule.

It has now been articulated, as shown in Figure 1. We can summarize our motivation as reducing many-to-many correspondence between top convolutional filters and classes, so as to obtain class-related representation that facilitates human\u2019s understanding and applications.\n\nIn a vanilla CNN, each filter in the top convolutional layer corresponds to multiple classes, since it extracts a mixture of features from different classes, which is a symptom of filter ambiguity. Such an intricate many-to-many correspondence between filters and classes makes it hard for people to understand the intrinsic logic and further diagnose the networks. To reduce the filter ambiguity and force such a correspondence to be many-to-one, we propose LSG to regularize the training of CNNs which disentangles the filters and leads to class-specific representation. Our class-related representation is straightforward for human's understanding and we prove the superiority of this representation with exhaustive experiments on different application tasks including localization and adversarial samples detection, as in Section 4.4 and 4.5. of the revised version.\n\nQ: The proposed motivations partially misleading. \n\nA: As in the caption of Figure 1, our goal is to disentangle the filters in the last convolutional layer rather than all convolutional layers in general, because the last convolutional layer captures the most semantic and high-level information and deserves disentangling. We have revised the introduction to emphasize the top convolutional layer.\n\nQ: The advantage of enforcing the last layer filters to be class-specific is not clear. \n\nA: The advantage of class-specific filters in top convolutional layer is in two aspects. On the one hand, for CNN\u2019s interpretability, a top convolutional filter focusing on one (or few) classes can extract more class-specific features or semantics. This facilitates understanding the inner logic of CNNs and diagnosing CNNs. On the other hand, for applications, class-specific filters  yield a better class-related feature representation. In a class-related feature representation, it\u2019s easier to tell which class the image belongs to based on the channels with dominant activations.

The main idea is to force the CNN filters to be class specific, i.e. to be associated to a specific class. This is accomplished by a gating function that enforces filters to be sparsely activated.  This would make the model more interpretable by allowing to check which filters/classes have been activated. Results are evaluated in terms of performance, sparsity of the filters and localization accuracy on CIFAR10.\n\nI lean to reject this paper because I consider the proposed motivations not clear and partially misleading. In the introduction it seems that the idea of enforcing class-specific filters makes sense in general because it avoids filters ambiguity and it reduces redundancy (not clear how). Instead, in the actual implementation, this idea is applied only at the last layer of a CNN. This makes sense, because in a CNN filters need to be shared among classes. It\u2019s an important form of regularization, especially when the amount of training data is reduced. \nAdditionally, the advantage of enforcing the last layer filters to be class-specific is not clear. To me, instead of evaluating the activation of the classification layer, it is possible to check the activation of the filters of the last convolutional layers. However not much more interpretability is added. Furthermore, the improvement on localization as shown in Fig. 6 is only qualitative as the images could have been cherry-picked and there is no real localization measure.\n\nAdditional comments:\nIn table 1, performance of the proposed training is comparable to a standard training on CIFAR10. However, evaluating the proposed approach on a single dataset and only one network is not enough for a clear evidence. Additionally, the obtained performance is below the standard performance of ResNet on CIFAR10 without a clear reason.\nAnother way to enforce a similar pattern on the gating function would be by maximizing the mutual information between selected filters and classes.  \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper788/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper788/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["lianghy18@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn", "oyzh18@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn", "suhangss@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn", "zengyy19@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn", "zihaoh@usc.edu", "xiast@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn", "dcszj@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn", "dcszb@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn"], "title": "Training Interpretable Convolutional Neural Networks towards Class-specific Filters", "authors": ["Haoyu Liang", "Zhihao Ouyang", "Hang Su", "Yuyuan Zeng", "Zihao He", "Shu-tao Xia", "Jun Zhu", "Bo Zhang"], "pdf": "/pdf/46b842f63e08d5aa5a51deb150f9313d3611ac60.pdf", "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have often been treated as \u201cblack-box\u201d and successfully used in a range of tasks. However, CNNs still suffer from the problem of filter ambiguity \u2013 an intricate many-to-many mapping relationship between filters and features, which undermines the models\u2019 interpretability. To interpret CNNs, most existing works attempt to interpret a pre-trained model, while neglecting to reduce the filter ambiguity hidden behind. To this end, we propose a simple but effective strategy for training interpretable CNNs. Specifically, we propose a novel Label Sensitive Gate (LSG) structure to enable the model to learn disentangled filters in a supervised manner, in which redundant channels experience a periodical shutdown as flowing through a learnable gate varying with input labels. To reduce redundant filters during training, LSG is constrained with a sparsity regularization. In this way, such training strategy imposes each filter\u2019s attention to just one or few classes, namely class-specific. Extensive experiments demonstrate the fabulous performance of our method in generating sparse and highly label- related representation of the input. Moreover, comparing to the standard training strategy, our model displays less redundancy and stronger interpretability.\n", "keywords": ["class-specific filters", "interpretability", "disentangled representation", "filter ambiguity", "gate"], "paperhash": "liang|training_interpretable_convolutional_neural_networks_towards_classspecific_filters", "original_pdf": "/attachment/46fa6e0d3ae221da70a379426ef29409b1635161.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nliang2020training,\ntitle={Training Interpretable Convolutional Neural Networks towards Class-specific Filters},\nauthor={Haoyu Liang and Zhihao Ouyang and Hang Su and Yuyuan Zeng and Zihao He and Shu-tao Xia and Jun Zhu and Bo Zhang},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1ltnp4KwS}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
