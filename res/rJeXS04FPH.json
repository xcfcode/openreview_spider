Table 1b:\n=============================================================\nResponse: This table compares DeFINE with state-of-the-art models which use significantly more computational resources. We highlight that our model\u2019s modest performance decrease is accompanied by a drastic reduction in parameters. \n\nMost of the RNN-based sequence models in Table 1b reported on WT-103 are not publicly available. Given the sensitivity of sequence models to hyper-parameters (Melis et al., 2018) and inspired by the success of AWD-LSTM sequence model, we designed a LSTM-based sequence model and study its performance on WikiText-103 in Table 1a. We observe that DeFINE is efficient and accurate in comparison to standard and adaptive embeddings.\n\n=============================================================\nReg. Table 2: \n=============================================================\nResponse: Table 2 shows two important things:\nDeFINE improves Transformer XL perplexity by adding only a small number of additional training parameters \nTo attain a similar performance, Transformer XL with DeFINE requires fewer parameters \nWe have reorganized the results and added Table 2b in the paper to better highlight these points. \n\n=============================================================\nReg. Table 3\n=============================================================\nResponse: The first three rows in Table 3 uses model ensembling while the BLEU score reported in last two rows is for a single model (without ensemble).

The basic building block of many deep sequence models, including BERT, ELMo, and embedding layers, is a linear layer. Given the fully-connected nature of this layer, it learns many parameters. When the vocabulary size grows, the amount of computational resources required by the embedding layer increases. As Reviewer 4 noted, learning embeddings efficiently is an important problem and several factorization methods have been proposed in literature to tackle the computational bottleneck in the embedding layers. These methods are effective in reducing the number of parameters, but unable to maintain the performance. For example, when we learn embeddings with projective embedding method in low-dimensional space (384-d vs. 128-d) in Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019), the number of parameters reduce significantly (140M vs. 71M), but at the cost of performance (27.06 vs. 29.16). \n\nMotivated by the success of factorization methods in improving the efficient and deep representation learning in improving the performance, this paper introduces a deep factorization method that allows to  learn deep representations efficiently and effectively (as noted by Reviewer 4 and Reviewer 1). The hierarchical structure, along with novel skip connections, of DeFINE allows to learn representations that are as powerful as standard embeddings, but with as few parameters as projective embeddings. We show that DeFINE improves the efficiency of existing sequence models without sacrificing performance. The results shown in Table 4 demonstrate the effectiveness of DeFINE over existing factorization methods. Moreover, the ablations in Section 4.4 supports our design decisions."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1105/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1105/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DeFINE: Deep Factorized Input Token Embeddings for Neural Sequence Modeling", "authors": ["Sachin Mehta", "Rik Koncel-Kedziorski", "Mohammad Rastegari", "Hannaneh Hajishirzi"], "authorids": ["sacmehta@uw.edu", "kedzior@uw.edu", "mohammadr@allenai.org", "hannaneh@washington.edu"], "keywords": ["sequence modeling", "input representations", "language modeling", "word embedding"], "TL;DR": "DeFINE uses a deep, hierarchical, sparse network with new skip connections to learn better word embeddings efficiently.

This is done by replacing the embedding lookup function which is typical in NLP tasks such as language modeling and machine translation with a hierarchical embedding model. This allows for a low dimensional embedding layer, reducing total parameters and training time. A novel skip-connections architecture is introduced as a part of the \"embedding generation model\". Experiments are conducted for language modeling and machine translation tasks and performance improvements are observed with a reduction in parameters and lesser training time.\n\nThe direction of this work is nice, the problem that is being tackled is indeed important.\nThe obtained results are nice (though this can be improved) and there is indeed some potential value in this work.\nHowever, I have the following concern. The paper completely ignores a lot of previous and concurrent work in reducing the size of the embedding layer. These works are in most cases not even cited and no empirical comparisons are provided. For example, please see below works in matrix factorization approaches, sparse word representation learning, codebook learning and other quantization approaches for compressing word embeddings:\n\nhttps://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1022/\nhttps://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/download/4578/4456\nhttp://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/papers/Mulcode_Compressor.pdf\nhttps://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/viewFile/17042/16071\nhttps://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/f158f7c81ed8e985fd51a20d193103ce427cad51.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.01068.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00149\n\nI would appreciate if comparisons with some of these approaches is provided in the next iteration of this work.\n\nOther suggestions:\n\n1. I think the paper would benefit from some analysis of the differences in the word embeddings learnt by a general lookup table learning model in comparison with the word embeddings learnt by this model. How are the embeddings compressed? How do the decompressed embeddings compare to the embeddings learnt by the lookup approach? More insights in the machinery via some visualizations would help.\n\n2. How do the gains of this method change as more or less training data is provided. For example, are the gains lesser on Gigaword? This would be interesting to know.\n\n3. GLT is mentioned twice in this paper.

We also appreciate the additional references [R1, R2] and comparisons that were suggested. Based on your suggestion, we compare different factorization methods with and without the compression method of [R1] in the table below. Both compression methods [R1] and [R2] are orthogonal to our factorization approach, and we show in the table that these methods can be used to further improve the efficiency of sequence models with and without DeFINE.  The results show that DeFINE embeddings can be compressed similarly to standard embeddings without loss of performance. Additionally, DeFINE achieves better inference speed compared to compressed standard embeddings.\n\nThe suggested compression methods allow for efficiently discretizing the continuous 32-bit full-precision embedding vectors, thus reducing the memory footprint of the input layer. With DeFINE, we also learn a continuous full precision 32-bit floating-point embedding vector (similar to Baevski & Auli, 2019 and Dai et al., 2019). Therefore, we can apply compression methods such as [R1] and [R2] to sequence models with DeFINE and other factorization methods. \n\nIt is important to note that by reducing parameters in the input and output layers DeFINE reduces the total number of operations in a sequence model while maintaining performance. This results in significantly lower inference time and requires less resources during training compared to compression methods without DeFINE. This is because DeFINE allows sequence models to learn output representations in low-dimensional space. For example, the classification layer in a standard Transformer-XL language model multiplies a context vector by a 384xV matrix, where V is the vocabulary size (for the Wikitext-103 dataset, V = 267,735). This is a computationally expensive operation. With DeFINE, we reduce the size of this matrix to 128xV while maintaining comparable performance (Table 2a in the paper). The result is a significant reduction in inference time and resources required during training, as reported in the table below. Inference time reported here is for sequence length of 100, batch size of 64, and is averaged across 100 runs. In these experiments, we use the open-source codebase of [R3] to compress to the 32 x 16 coding described in [R1].\n\nIn the table below we compare the performance of Transformer-XL with different factorization methods, with and without [R1] compression. We note that [R2] is a concurrent submission to ICLR 2020. Since compression-based methods and our factorization methods are orthogonal, we believe that the efficiency of sequence models with DeFINE can be further improved with compression- and quantization-based methods. \n\nWe are currently updating our manuscript to incorporate your suggested comparisons and will update the draft. \n\n[R1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.01068.pdf\n[R2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09756 (https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxbOlSKPr)\n[R3] https://github.com/zomux/neuralcompressor \n\n\n=====================================================================================================================\nMapping dimension || Factorization || Full 32-bit || Compression || Look-up Table || Perplexity || Inference Time\n(Table 2a)        ||               || Precision   || Compression || Size(in MB)   ||            || (in ms/batch)\n==================================================================================================================\n   384            ||  Standard     ||      Yes    ||   None      ||    411        ||   27.06    ||   202\n   384            || Standard      ||      No     ||    Yes      ||    21         ||   27.36    ||   201\n==================================================================================================================\n   128            || Projective    ||      Yes    ||    None     ||    127        ||   29.16    ||   129\n   128            || Projective    ||      No     ||    Yes      ||    21         ||   29.82    ||   129\n==================================================================================================================\n   128            ||     DeFINE    ||      Yes    ||    None     ||    127        ||   26.33    ||   131 \n   128            ||     DeFINE    ||      No     ||    Yes      ||    21         ||   26.03    ||   130\n=================================================================================================================="}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1105/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1105/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DeFINE: Deep Factorized Input Token Embeddings for Neural Sequence Modeling", "authors": ["Sachin Mehta", "Rik Koncel-Kedziorski", "Mohammad Rastegari", "Hannaneh Hajishirzi"], "authorids": ["sacmehta@uw.edu", "kedzior@uw.edu", "mohammadr@allenai.org", "hannaneh@washington.edu"], "keywords": ["sequence modeling", "input representations", "language modeling", "word embedding"], "TL;DR": "DeFINE uses a deep, hierarchical, sparse network with new skip connections to learn better word embeddings efficiently.

We now include a discussion of these methods in Section 2. In our work, we compare extensively against the adaptive method of Baevski & Auli, 2019, whose work improves over previous factorization techniques. We show that DeFINE can further improve these results (Table 4, added in the paper). \n\nWe agree that several factorization methods have been proposed in literature to tackle the computational bottleneck in the embedding and classification layers. These methods can be broadly categorized into two types: \n\n1) Projective Embeddings (as used in [r1], [r2], [r5], and Dai et al.,2019) which approximate a large embedding matrix with two smaller matrices\n2) Grouped Embeddings (as used in [r3], [r4], [r6], and Baevski & Auli, 2019) which cluster input tokens by frequency and assign different capacities to different clusters using projective embedding methods. \n\nWe would like to highlight that the adaptive method of Baevski & Auli, 2019 which we compare against extensively is a general method for efficient approximation of embedding matrix, since projective embeddings is a special case of grouped embeddings when the number of clusters is 1. Additionally, Baevski & Auli, 2019 allows for faster, memory-efficient end-to-end training while providing similar or better benefits compared to existing post-training methods [r2, r3, r4, r6] which requires a pretrained embedding matrix. We highlight that these post-training factorization as well as the compression methods in [r7] are complementary and could be used to further improve the efficiency of sequence models with DeFINE. \n\nThe experimental results reported in Baevski & Auli, 2019 as well as Grave et al., 2017a provide evidence for the superior performance of adaptive methods over earlier projective factorization techniques. Given their results, we focused on incorporating DeFINE in sequence models with adaptive embeddings, but also show that our technique improves on the projective factorization used in Dai et al., 2019 as well as standard embedding layers used in Merity et al., 2018 and Vaswani et al., 2017. We summarize these observations in the table below to highlight the importance of DeFINE against other embedding methods. \n\n\n=====================================================================\nSequence Model           || Factorization Operation || Perplexity (Parameters) \n=====================================================================\nLSTM (Table 1a)          ||        Standard         || 44.12 (92 M) \nLSTM (Table 1a)          ||        Adaptive         || 44.87 (33 M) \nLSTM (Table 1a)          ||        DeFINE           || 41.17(33 M)\n=====================================================================\nAWD-LSTM (Table 1c)      ||          Standard       || 58.8 (24 M) \nAWD-LSTM (Table 1c)      ||         DeFINE          || 54.2(20 M) \n=====================================================================\nTransformer-XL (Table 2) ||        Projective       || 27.06 (139 M) \nTransformer-XL (Table 2) ||          DeFINE         || 26.33(72.9 M) \n=====================================================================\n\nAdditionally, we have added a column in Table 2 to clarify what factorization technique is used with each setting, and include a new Table 4 which highlights the performance improvements of DeFINE against different factorization methods across tasks. Note that all results discussed here were already reported in the paper. No new experimental results have been added, we have only reorganized for clarity. \n\n[r1] Acharya, Anish, et al. \"Online embedding compression for text classification using low rank matrix factorization.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

I also do not understand the purpose of doing aggressive embedding expansion before another contraction. Why would this allows to learn a more efficient low dimensional embedding than the original one? This may happen to be the case, but why?\n\nOverall, the results seem to be a bit inconclusive.\nTable 1: b) DeFINE uses less parameters but also gives worse results. This does not allow me to conclude anything.\nTable 1: c) DeFINE seems to give better perplexity results, while using less parameters. This is good.\nTable 2: DeFINE uses more parameters and gives better perplexity results. I do not know what to conclude, as ideally I would like to see how would DeFINE do with the same number of parameters.\nTable 3: \"our implementation\" seems to provide much lower scores than the ones found in the literature and thus can not be used as an fair baseline. Once this baseline is discarded, DeFINE seems to be producing worse results while using less parameters. Is this good? I do no know. But certainly this is inconclusive.
