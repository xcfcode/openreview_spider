And (2) are adversarial examples generated by different methods distinguishable from each other? They find positive answers to both questions according to their experiments, and propose a method for detecting adversarial examples.\n\nThe authors take the viewpoint of varying how much the defender knows about its attackers. How they define whether a defender \u201cknows\u201d an attackers\u2019 model, source examples, or adversarial generation parameters, is through keeping characteristics of various test sets the same with the training set. For example, to test the effectiveness of when the defender \u201cknows\u201d the adversarial generation parameters, they will have a test set where the adversarial generation parameters are the same with the training set, but will possibly vary other characteristics. They do all their experiments on MNIST.\n\nIn the first experiment (Section 4.2), the authors find that a deep neural network binary classifier for detecting adversarially-tainted images does well when the adversarial generation parameters are known, and not as well when unknown. Thus, the author\u2019s conclude \u201cit is always beneficial for defenders to train a DDP-Model by using adversarial examples generated based on a variety of parameters. Meanwhile, the exact model architecture, and the exact natural examples used by attackers are not influential in the accuracy of the defenders\u2019 models.\u201d\n\nIn the second experiment (Section 4.3), the authors test whether a neural network is able to classify an image as adversarial if images from a particular adversarial generation method is left-out of the training samples, but all others are included. They conclude that the network has the hardest time when samples from L-BFGS and JSMA are left-out of the training sample.\n\nIn the last experiment (Section 4.4), the authors test whether a deep neural network can classify adversarially-generated images according the the generation method. The answer is affirmative, and they conclude, \u201cSimilar to what is observed for a DDP-Model in Section 4.2 and 4.3, it is also beneficial for defenders to train a DDS-Model by using adversarial examples generated based on a variety of parameters; meanwhile, the exact model architecture and the exact natural examples used by attackers are not influential in the accuracy of the defender\u2019s models.\u201d\n\n\nStengths: The authors\u2019 research questions are interesting and worthy of more investigation, namely whether we can detect adversarial examples. They also have nice experiments and make nice heuristic conclusions.\n\n\nWeaknesses: The main complaint I have is that the authors only use the MNIST dataset. And we know that the MNIST dataset is special, so I would have liked to see the same tests on different datasets, and possibly different model architectures. I think this will be a much better contribution to the field with these additions.\n\n\nOther comments:\nThe paper is clearly written and their experimental methodology seems original, and examining whether adversarial examples can be distinguished from untainted examples is important. But only using MNIST currently severely lowers the significance of this work. I think with more datasets and perhaps different model architectures, this can become a nice contribution to the field.\n\nPerhaps a minor point, but their terminology of \u201cnatural\u201d might not be the best, as MNIST is not usually considered as a \u201cnatural image,\u201d although I am aware that what the author say is \u201cnatural\u201d means \u201coriginal,\u201d or \u201cuntainted\u201d. I would maybe suggest the authors change this terminology.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1041/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Distinguishability of Adversarial Examples", "abstract": "Machine learning models including traditional models and neural networks can be easily fooled by adversarial examples which are generated from the natural examples with small perturbations.

However, it leaves some key aspects of defense and distinction out. Firstly, one can argue that if you know the adversaries of your model you can simply regularize the model for them. Even if regularization doesn't work fully, the DD model still suffers since it can have its own adversarial examples. From distinction perspective, it would be hard to believe that every single adversarial example will be detected, at least not without some solid theoretical background. It seems that  and natural examples are being thrown at the DD model without an elegant approach. \n\nI have the following concerns about the visualization and understanding of what DD does, which I believe should have been the focus of this paper. It was not immediately clear, what the message of the paper is or the claimed message was too weak: detecting adversarial examples using a classifier. It was not immediately clear why this is a good idea (since an adversarial example can be an adversary of both original network and DD) or what the DD learns.\n\nFurthermore, from experimental perspective, it is not sufficient to just perform experiments on one dataset, specially if the claim is big. You should consider running your model on multiple datasets and reporting what each DD learned. Furthermore, you should establish better comparison and back your claims with proper references. Some claims were too strong to believe without reference. \n\nI do look forward to seeing more about the visualization and intriguing properties which may arise from continuation of your studies.

Our original focus was intensively on the comparison of different attack methods.  We switched our focus to the defense side and completed this work without being aware of these related papers (very sorry about this).  We will cite them and compare them with ours in the revision.\n\nIn short, our approach is under the formulation of multi-label classification, which is different from those in the related work.  We discussed the important advantages of this approach such as exploring the intrinsic correlations between multiple labels in Section 3.1.  In addition, we explored a DDS-Model for distinguishing known adversarial examples as generated by different specific methods.\n\nWe just read the C&W paper \u201cAdversarial Examples Are Not Easily Detected \u2026\u201d, and find it very interesting and helpful.  We completely agree that adversarial examples are not easily detected.  Coincidentally and related to our original focus on attack comparison, we defined eight representative scenario-case combinations in Table 1 of our paper and constructed five datasets (Table 2) to extensively identify the situations in which adversarial examples are (vs. are not) easily detected. Our approach is more intensively tested (with both weak and strong attack methods) than some of the approaches evaluated by Carlini & Wagner. At the end of each experiment section (4.2, 4.3, 4.4), we highlighted the following key observations that are helpful to the defenders:\n\n(1) \u201cOverall, the results in Figures 1a and 1b are highly informative in practice for defenders. Most importantly, it is always beneficial for defenders to train a DDP-Model by using adversarial examples generated based on a variety of parameters. Meanwhile, the exact model architecture and the exact natural examples used by attackers are not influential in the accuracy of the defenders\u2019 models.\u201d\n\n(2) \u201cOverall, Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that a DDP-Model trained on adversarial examples generated by multiple methods can be highly effective. While it is always beneficial for defenders to train a DDP-Model using adversarial examples generated by as many as possible methods, our models do have the strong capability to correctly classify the adversarial examples of an unknown method whose siblings are known as shown in the results for the four methods FGSM, BIM, MIM, and PGD that belong to the same family. In addition, similar to what we have observed in Section 4.2, knowing the parameters of some adversarial example generation methods is still important to defenders.\u201d\n\n(3) \u201cOverall, these results demonstrate the strong distinguishability of competing adversarial example generation methods. Similar to what is observed for a DDP-Model in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, it is also beneficial for defenders to train a DDS-Model by using adversarial examples generated based on a variety of parameters; meanwhile, the exact model architecture and the exact natural examples used by attackers are not influential in the accuracy of the defenders\u2019 models.\u201d\n\nBack to your specific question \u201cdo you attempt to actively evade your detection scheme?\u201d.  Indeed, it is considered in our attack model and experiments as you might already perceive based on the observations we listed above.  We defined the threat model from the perspective of a defender as mentioned in Section 3.3.  Whether a defender knows the network model, parameters, source examples, and attack methods (i.e., the \u201cleft-out\u201d experiments in Section 4.3) used by attackers is equivalent to a large extent to how an attacker may evade the detection.  The observations listed above are also important suggestions for defenders to mitigate the evasions.  In other words, based on our preliminary analysis, our eight scenario-case combinations in Table 1 and the \u201cleft-out\u201d experiments in Section 4.3 include and indeed further extend the three types of attacks (\u201cZero-Knowledge\u201d, \u201cPerfect-Knowledge\u201d, and \u201cLimited-Knowledge\u201d) considered in the C&W paper.\n\nIt is always an arms race between attackers and defenders, no matter a defense solution takes the adversarial training approach or the adversarial example detection approach.  Even considering the attacks in the C&W paper, it is reasonable to assume that defenders may know the details of the attacks and will further improve the detection accuracy.  On the other hand, attackers can always leverage their knowledge of defense solutions to generate new adversarial examples to fool the systems.
