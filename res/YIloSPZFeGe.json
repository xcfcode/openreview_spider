For each, we pick a popular model that we:\n(i) *linearize* and (ii) and switch its training objective to *Frobenius norm error minimization*. These simplifications can cast the training into finding the optimal parameters in closed-form. We program in TensorFlow a functional form of Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), such that, we could decompose a dense matrix $\\mathbf{M}$, without explicitly computing $\\mathbf{M}$.\nWe achieve competitive performance on popular GRL tasks while providing orders of magnitude speedup.
