We have added more discussions in our revision to explain why we choose certain components to construct the proposed VHEGAN.\n\nAs also noted in your reviews, VHEGAN is not limited to the ZSL application. We choose to focus on ZSL mainly because 1) it is the original motivation for us to develop VHEGAN, 2) it allows us to provide not only interpretable visualization on the inferred latent space, but also objective quantitative comparison to verify its effectiveness in a concrete setting. Having excellent performance in the challenging text based ZSL tasks, we believe VHEGAN can also be generated to many other different machine learning tasks, and we are working on these extensions. \n\nWhile there are several concerns/suggestions on the choices of the modeling components of VHEGAN, we'd like to emphasize that the VHEGAN framework and the idea of randomizing the noise of the GAN generator with another deep generative model are our key contributions. \n\nThe VHEGAN framework is very flexible. As also noted in your reviews, one may easily substitute its current VHE decoder (Poisson GBN), VHE encoder (Weibull upward-downward variational autoencoder), DCGAN discriminator, and DCGAN generator with different modules, either for improved ZSL or image/text generation performance, or for other applications different from the ZSL task focused in this paper. We are incorporating your suggestions to run more experiments (e.g., replacing DCGAN with StachGAN/AttGAN), and will report updated experimental results in our next revision if the paper gets accepted.  \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1154/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1154/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1154/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "VHEGAN: Variational Hetero-Encoder Randomized GAN for Zero-Shot Learning", "abstract": "To extract and relate visual and linguistic concepts from images and textual descriptions for text-based zero-shot learning (ZSL), we develop variational hetero-encoder (VHE) that decodes text via a deep probabilisitic topic model, the variational posterior of whose local latent variables is encoded from an image via a Weibull distribution based inference network.

For this purpose, a Variational Hetero-Encoder is proposed for this task, exhibiting good performance with a shared latent space extracted from these two modes. Though PGBN and GAN have been used to represent text and image, respectively, they have not been successfully combined to find the relationship between these two modes and the ZSL task. Compared with PGBN, an encoder network is used perform end-to-end inference, serving as the source distribution for GAN, which further reinforce the effect of text on image generation.\n\nUsing PGBN instead of recurrent VAE and using GAN instead of VAE are due to the following reasons: \n\nFirst, it has been observed that the fully-connected VAE is not expressive enough for 64*64 RGB images and the deconvolutional VAE is hard to converge, which can be solved by GAN. \n\nSecond, our task focuses on ZSL classification. Although a sequential description could be excellent at defining a specific individual image, the key words are more effective to define a class of images (not a specific image). In addition, recurrent VAE often fails for long sequential texts, e.g., the description of an image class in encyclopedia often consists of thousands of words. Therefore, we extract bag-of-words features and use PGBN for textual generation, which is more suitable for the ZSL task. Indeed, we have clearly identified semantic connections between the images and some key words in the class-specific textual descriptions, which have been effectively captured by our model, as illustrated in Figs. 2-6 in the revised manuscript. Following your suggestion, we have added more discussions and illustrations (highlighted with italic text style).\n\nThank you for your suggestion that we can position this work as a text/image embedding/generation work, and then use ZSL as one of the applications. One reason we are focusing on ZSL in this paper is because ZSL is an application that we can provide rigorous quantitative comparison with previous work on this task. We are extending the proposed work to more applications and will report our findings in our future work. \n\nAs for the writing, in particular the first paragraph, we will make careful changes if the paper gets accepted.

In a broader context, image captioning using generative model seems quite relevant.\n\nA1: Image captioning often aims at generating a sequential text describing a certain image, which, however, might not be suitable for the ZSL classification task. First, a text representation is used to define a class of images (not just a single image). In such circumstance, compared with the sequential information, the key words are more general and effective to define a certain image class. Besides, the text representation for a class of images varies from a few words (e.g., a sentence or several tags) to hundreds of sentences (e.g., in encyclopedia), whose key words can be captured more robustly by PGBN than sequential models. The experimental results also illustrate that VHEGAN is able to capture semantically important words from both a long document and a short sentence, as illustrated in Figs. 2-6 in the revised manuscript.\n\nQ2: In Table 1, is it possible to report the top-5 accuracy on CUB-easy and top-1 accuracy on Oxford-Flower dataset? Otherwise, it is not very convincing that proposed approach is better than the state-of-the-art approach GAZSL. Reviewer feels that the zero-shot classification result is weak. In Table 1 and Table 2, it seems that GAZSL (Zhu et al. 2018) outperforms the proposed approach.\n\nA2: We only report top-1 accuracy on CUB-easy for GAZSL in Table 1 since the authors in Zhu et al. (2018) only list top-1 accuracy. With the code provided for Zhu et. (2018), we run it by ourselves and achieve 65.24% accuracy, a little lower than VHEGAN-layer3, as shown in the revised manuscript.\n\nFrom Table 1, we can see that GAZSL performs better only on CUB-easy and worse on both CUB-hard and Flower than VHEGAN does. Besides, as discussed in the manuscript, CUB-hard and Flower are more challenging datasets, which illustrates the generalization of VHEGAN. What\u2019s more, lower error bars are achieved by our proposed models, demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed posterior representation at multiple stochastic layers.  \n\nIn addition, although GAZSL exhibits higher accuracy on some metrics, it relies on an extra visual part detection that needs additional resources and elaborate tuning for different classes. As a result, as the original GAZSL only designs part detector for Birds, it is not suitable to perform ZSL on Flower. This problem may limit GAZSL in practical applications which contain many different types of objects.\n\nQ3: the text-to-image generation results look reasonably good. But the resolution and quality of generated images are far from state-of-the-art. One suggestion is to train the VHE model with an improved image generator.\n\nA3: Thank you for your suggestion. The resolution and quality of the generated images are affected by the type of GAN used in VHEGAN. Compared with generating high-quality images, for the ZSL task the paper is focused on, extracting image features to help the PGBN to learn a better latent space for the classification task is more important. Thus, we propose a framework to combine VAE-like model with GAN through a shared latent space, in which many types of GAN can be selected. According to the experiments, using DCGAN as image generator can realize a satisfactory classification results, which validates the effectiveness of our combination of PGBN and GAN for ZSL task. We leave the use of more sophisticated GAN in VHEGAN for future research. \n\nQ4: One suggestion is to train the VHE model with an improved image generator.\nStackGAN: Text to Photo-realistic Image Synthesis with Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks, Zhang et al. In CVPR 2017.\nAttnGAN: Fine-Grained Text to Image Generation with Attentional Generative Adversarial Networks, Xu et al. In CVPR 2018.\nAlso, reviewer would expect to see an improved image generator can lead to a better ZSL performance.\n\nA4: Thank you for suggesting these two relevant papers. Due to the time constraint, we were not able to update our experimental results by replacing DCGAN with more sophisticated GANs. If the paper gets accepted, we will cite these two papers and try to use StackGAN and AttnGAN to replace DCGAN and see whether we can get improved results.

In other words, they are dealing ZSL as the case that the seen and unseen classes are related in some feature space to some extent, though they have not specified the meaning of the shared features explicitly. In our work, we give the ZSL task an interpretable shared latent space, connecting the relationships between the images structures and the key words, whose effectiveness is validated on benchmark datasets following the widely used experimental protocols for text-based ZSL. Just as you mentioned, the less the relationship between the seen and unseen classes, the more challenging the task is. Compared with CUB2011-easy dataset, the Cub2011-hard and Flower datasets are more challenging, where the proposed VHEGAN remains the best.\n\nQ2: The problem is only valid when the unseen class distribution is very similar to the given classes. For example, the text description of unseen classes should be well represented to the topics from seen classes.\n\nA2: Although the seen and unseen classes are related in some feature space, which is hard to be defined, as we mentioned in A1, the entire class distributions are not \u2018very\u2019 similar, since they are different classes after all. Certainly, as discussed before, this type of similar image-text relationships is a basic assumption in ZSL and we follow the widely used experimental protocols. What\u2019s more, besides representing every specific text description of each class, the more important effect of explicitly learned topics is to well express the shared information between the seen and unseen classes, making the knowledge efficiently transfer from the seen to unseen classes.\n\nQ3: Similarly, GAN learns images from the seen classes, and by nature, GAN would not generate the proper images of the unseen class if the image distribution of the unseen class is different to the already seen class. In the paper, the classes are very similar to each other (birds, flowers) and that would be the reason GAN worked in this model.\n\nA3: According to the available ZSL protocols, the seen and unseen classes are related more or less. Besides, compared with the original GAN with an uninformative noise as the source distribution, in our model, the source distribution is related to the image distribution in semantic, which makes it possible to generate different images distributions from that of the seen classes.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1154/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1154/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1154/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "VHEGAN: Variational Hetero-Encoder Randomized GAN for Zero-Shot Learning", "abstract": "To extract and relate visual and linguistic concepts from images and textual descriptions for text-based zero-shot learning (ZSL), we develop variational hetero-encoder (VHE) that decodes text via a deep probabilisitic topic model, the variational posterior of whose local latent variables is encoded from an image via a Weibull distribution based inference network.

More specifically, it proposed a hybrid framework that combines VAEs (more precisely, the variational hetero-encoder or VHE) and GANs all together. The entire model is composed of an image encoder (Weibull upward-downward variational encoder), a text decoder (Poisson Gamma belief network), and an image generator (generative adversarial network). Once learned, the generative models can be directly used for zero-shot classification and various image generation applications. In the experiments, two benchmark datasets CUB and Oxford-Flowers are used.\n\n==\nNovelty/Significance:\nZero-shot learning is a challenging task and he main motivation of the paper (using generative model) is interesting. The text representation in the paper is simply bag-of-words which limits the application to some extent. In a broader context, image captioning using generative model seems quite relevant.\n\nDiverse and Accurate Image Description Using a Variational Auto-Encoder with an Additive Gaussian Encoding Space, Wang et al. In NIPS 2017.\n\n==\nQuality:\nOverall, reviewer feels this is a very interesting work. However, the results from the paper is quite mixed. It is not yet convincing whether the proposed approach is the state-of-the-art in zero-shot learning or text-to-image generation. \n\nFirst, this paper demonstrates the power of generative models in text-to-image generation and other applications. However, reviewer feels that the zero-shot classification result is weak. In Table 1 and Table 2, it seems that GAZSL (Zhu et al. 2018) outperforms the proposed approach. \n\nQ1: In Table 2, is it possible to report the top-5 accuracy on CUB-easy and top-1 accuracy on Oxford-Flower dataset? Otherwise, it is not very convincing that proposed approach is better than the state-of-the-art approach GAZSL.\n\nSecond, the text-to-image generation results look reasonably good. But the resolution and quality of generated images are far from state-of-the-art.
