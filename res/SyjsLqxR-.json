Experiments use a (previously published) iterative fast-gradient-sign-method and use a Resnet on CIFAR.\n\nThe authors conclude that in this experimental setting:\n- AT seems to defend models against shared dx's.\n- This is visible on universal perturbations, which become less effective as more AT is applied.\n- AT decreases the effectiveness of adversarial perturbations, e.g. AT decreases the number of adversarial perturbations that fool both an input x and x with e.g. a contrast change.\n- Singular perturbations are easily detected by a detector model, as such perturbations don't change much when applying AT.\n\nPro:\n- Paper addresses an important problem: qualitative / quantitative understanding of the behavior of adversarial perturbations is still lacking.\n- The visualizations of universal perturbations as they change during AT are nice.\n- The basic observation wrt the behavior of AT is clearly communicated.\n\nCon:\n- The experiments performed are interesting directions, although unfocused and rather limited in scope. For instance, does the same phenomenon happen for different datasets? Different models?\n- What happens when we use adversarial attacks different from FGSM? Do we get similar results?\n- The papers lacks a more in-depth theoretical analysis. Is there a principled reason AT+FGSM defends against universal perturbations?\n\nOverall:\n- As is, it seems to me the paper lacks a significant central message (due to limited and unfocused experiments) or significant new theoretical insight into the effect of AT. A number of questions addressed are interesting starting points towards a deeper understanding of *how* the observations can be explained and more rigorous empirical investigations.\n\nDetailed:\n-\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Universality, Robustness, and Detectability of Adversarial Perturbations under Adversarial Training", "abstract": "Classifiers such as deep neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable against adversarial perturbations on problems with high-dimensional input space.

The paper shows that adversarial training increases the destruction rate of adversarial examples so that it still has some value though it would be good to see if other adversarial resistance techniques show the same effect. It's also unclear from which epoch the adversarial examples were generated from in figure 5. Further the transformations in figure 5 are limited to artificially controlled situations, it would be much more interesting to see how the destruction rate changes under real-world test scenarios.\n\nThe results on the detector are not that surprising since previous work has shown that detectors can learn to classify adversarial examples and the additional finding that they can detect adversarial examples for an adversarially trained model doesn't seem surprising. There is also no analysis of what happens for adversarial examples for the detector.\n\nAlso, it's not clear from section 3.1 what inputs are used to generate the adversarial examples.

We tried to connect the different experiments with a common thread. \n* \"Does the same phenomenon happen for different datasets? Different models?\"\nWe have added experimental results on the German Traffic Sign recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) to the revised version of  paper. We have also evaluated a different model (a non-residual, convolutional network) on GTSRB. The main findings remain the same: adversarial training makes classifiers considerably more robust against universal perturbations, increases the destruction rate of perturbations considerably under most image transformations, and leaves perturbations well detectable. \n* \"What happens when we use adversarial attacks different from FGSM? Do we get similar results?\" Results reported in the paper were for the Basic Iterative (BI) adversary. We have added results for FGSM and DeepFool to the appendix of the revised version of the paper (both regarding destruction rate and detectability). The main findings remain the same for these adversaries.\n* \"The papers lacks a more in-depth theoretical analysis. Is there a principled reason AT+FGSM defends against universal perturbations?\" Our main results are empirical; however, we think that they provide potential direction for future theoretical analysis and are useful for this reason. It would be, for instance, interesting to connect our empirical findings on universal perturbations to the theoretical insights from the paper \"Analysis of universal adversarial perturbations\" (https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/228329/files/universal_perturbations_theory.pdf). In this paper, the authors  show that (assuming a locally curved decision boundary model) the existence of shared directions along which the decision boundary is positively curved implies the existence of small universal perturbations. The existence of such shared directions is closely related to our notion of sharedness of perturbations: our notion of sharedness corresponds to common directions (perturbations) which increase classification cost for many inputs while their concept is based on shared positive curvature of the decision boundary in a direction. As discussed in \"Analysis of universal adversarial perturbations\", when the decision boundary is positively curved in a direction, it will lie closer to the datapoint in this direction and thus moving in this direction will increase classification cost considerably. As we have empirically shown, adversarial training is effective in reducing the sharedness of perturbations, and thus potentially also in removing shared directions in which the decision boundary is positively curved (which would be the basis for the existence of universal perturbations). While this argument is informal, we hope that the observation reported in our paper can motivate future research into a better theoretical understanding on methods for preventing universal perturbations."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Universality, Robustness, and Detectability of Adversarial Perturbations under Adversarial Training", "abstract": "Classifiers such as deep neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable against adversarial perturbations on problems with high-dimensional input space.

Regarding the reviewer's questions:\n * Figure 5: the adversarial examples were generated from the epochs shown in the legend as \"model epochs\" (0, 1, 5, 51, 251). Please note that epoch 0 corresponds to a model pretrained with standard training (without adversarial training). Epoch 1 denotes the model after one additional epoch of adversarial training.\n * Reporting how the destruction rate changes under real-world transformations would make it difficult to attribute changes in destruction rates to individual changes (since typically changes of brightness, contrast, noise would occur at the same time). Moreover, artificially controlled situations have the advantage that the amount of brightness change, blurring etc. can be systematically varied. They thus allow to systematically study in which aspects adversarial training makes a model more robust. Because of this, we focused the experiments on snythetic transformations. We would also like to note that our point in the paper is not that adversarial training makes physical world attacks impossible but rather that physical-world attacks should be tested against models hardened with, e.g., adversarial training. For instance, our results on GTSRB (see revised PDF) show that adversarial training greatly increases robustness on this dataset and also increases destruction rate of the remaining perturbations under image transformations. In the lights of these results, it would be interesting to see if the results presented in works like https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08945v4 would carry over to a classifier hardened with adversarial training.  However, replicating this attack is beyond the scope of this paper but an important direction for future work (for which this work forms the basis).\n* In contrast to the reviewer's opinion, it was surprising for us that a detector was able to detect adversarial examples of an adversarially trained model. It was a likely assumption that detectability of perturbations were closely related to their sharedness and the existence of universal perturbations (since sharedness/universality is related to different perturbations being more \"similar\" and similarity in turn would make detectability easier). However, as the paper shows, adversarial training greatly reduces shared/universal perturbations but leaves detectability unchanged. Thus, these two properties seem to be unrelated which was surprising and insightful for us.\n* We do not claim that the detector could not be fooled. Our main point is not that the combination of adversarial training and detection is a robust defence but rather that adversarial training fails to become robust against certain shared patterns in adversarial perturbations that are picked up by a detector. Thus, combining adversarial training with a detection loss appears to be a promising direction for future work.\n* \"Also, it's not clear from section 3.1 what inputs are used to generate the adversarial examples. Are they a random sample across the whole dataset?\" If not stated otherwise, the adversarial examples were generated for the entire CIFAR10 test set. Otherwise, they are a randomly sampled subset of the test set."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Universality, Robustness, and Detectability of Adversarial Perturbations under Adversarial Training", "abstract": "Classifiers such as deep neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable against adversarial perturbations on problems with high-dimensional input space.
