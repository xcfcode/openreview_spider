Along with the to-be-released dataset, the authors also provide some unsupervised analysis and visualization of the dataset. \n\nThe data is collected using the author\u2019s company\u2019s single lead ECG devices. The dataset is collected from 11,000 patients and contains over 2.7 billion peaks. According to the cited works in section 2, the scale of this proposed dataset is unprecedented and will be beneficial to the ECG community.\n\nI think this is an interesting dataset for the ECG machine learning community. Some recent advances in this field are based on non-public dataset. However, this dataset seems to require additional curation before it is ready.\n\n\n\nQuestions. \nIn section 3, the authors discuss the potential concerns regarding privacy, what are the measures taken by the authors when collecting & distributing this dataset? I didn\u2019t find this question addressed in section 3.\n\nLike the authors stated in 2nd paragraph under section 4, this dataset is biased in the sense that it is collected from patients. The subjects are in the age group of 62.2 +/- 17.4. Do the authors recognized various chronicle conditions that often appear in that age group? Is that information part of the to-be-released dataset?\n\nSince this work focuses on releasing  a dataset, I find the current experiment section unnecessary & somewhat unrelated. What would be interesting to see is whether the authors use ML techniques to facilitate the curation of the dataset. For example, in paragraph 3 under section 4, it says each segment data is labeled by 3 technologists. How many technologist are involved in total? and what measure are taken to address the variances among different technologists?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1148/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1148/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["shawn@wtf.sg", "guillaume.androz@icentia.com", "doctor.ahmad89@gmail.com", "pierre.fecteau@icentia.com", "aaron.courville@gmail.com", "yoshua.bengio@mila.quebec", "joseph@josephpcohen.com"], "title": "{COMPANYNAME}11K: An Unsupervised Representation Learning Dataset for Arrhythmia Subtype Discovery", "authors": ["Shawn Tan", "Guillaume Androz", "Ahmad Chamseddine", "Pierre Fecteau", "Aaron Courville", "Yoshua Bengio", "Joseph Paul Cohen"], "pdf": "/pdf/fd13274db8244868c0db85bb2b6235baa5050444.pdf", "TL;DR": "We release a dataset constructed from single-lead ECG data from 11,000 patients who were prescribed to use the {DEVICENAME}(TM) device.", "abstract": "We release the largest public ECG dataset of continuous raw signals for representation learning containing over 11k patients and 2 billion labelled beats.

To this end, we propose an unsupervised representation learning task, evaluated in a semi-supervised fashion.  We provide a set of baselines for different feature extractors that can be built upon.  Additionally, we perform qualitative evaluations on results from PCA embeddings, where we identify some clustering of known subtypes indicating the potential for representation learning in arrhythmia sub-type discovery.", "code": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nwF-yGrDUIiBa15fcaPOXxuasn_6B50M/view", "keywords": ["representation learning", "healthcare", "medical", "clinical", "dataset", "ecg", "cardiology", "heart", "discovery", "anomaly detection", "out of distribution"], "paperhash": "tan|companyname11k_an_unsupervised_representation_learning_dataset_for_arrhythmia_subtype_discovery", "original_pdf": "/attachment/47adc66edfe2afb378d85aecf8f0de3f66228b6d.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\ntan2020companynamek,\ntitle={{\\{}{\\{}COMPANYNAME{\\}}{\\}}11K: An Unsupervised Representation Learning Dataset for Arrhythmia Subtype Discovery},\nauthor={Shawn Tan and Guillaume Androz and Ahmad Chamseddine and Pierre Fecteau and Aaron Courville and Yoshua Bengio and Joseph Paul Cohen},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkgqL0EtPH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
