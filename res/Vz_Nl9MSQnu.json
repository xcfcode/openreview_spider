We design two synthetic tasks, focusing purely on topological problems -- triangle detection and clique distance -- on which graph neural networks perform surprisingly badly, failing to detect those \"bermuda\" triangles. We plan to make the datasets and their generation scripts publicly available.", "pdf": "/pdf/ea04e414f4377204f1ea6bb605cb7dac920435a9.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|bermuda_triangles_gnns_fail_to_detect_simple_topological_structures", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021bermuda,\ntitle={Bermuda Triangles: {\\{}GNN{\\}}s Fail to Detect Simple Topological Structures},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to ICLR 2021 Workshop on Geometrical and Topological Representation Learning},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Vz_Nl9MSQnu},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615225929161, "tmdate": 1615967298665, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
