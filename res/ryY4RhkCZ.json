One depend only on the number of observations of the given context and the average reward in this situation and the second term begin the noise. This is equivalent to separate a local estimation error from the noise. \n\nThe idea is interesting but maybe not pushed far enough in the paper:\n*At fixed context x, assuming that the error is a function of the average reward u and of the number of displays r of the context could be a constant could be a little bit more supported (this is a variance explanation that could be tested statistically, or the shape of this 2D function f(u,r) could be plot to exhibit its regularity). \n* None of the experiments is done on public data which lead to an impossible to reproduce paper\n* The proposed baselines are not really the state of the art (Factorization Machines, GBDT features,...) and the used loss is MSE which is strange in the context of CTR prediction (logistic loss would be a more natural choice)\n* I'm not confident with the proposed surrogate metrics. In the paper, the work of Lihong Li &al on offline evaluation on contextual bandits is mentioned and considered as infeasible here because of the renewal of the set of recommendation. Actually this work can be adapted to handle theses situations (possibly requiring to bootstrap if the set is actually regenerating too fast). Also note that Yahoo Research R6a - R6b  datasets where used in ICML'12 Exploration and Exploitation 3 challenge where about pushing some news in a given context and could be reused to support the proposed approach. An other option would be to use some counterfactual estimates (See Leon Bottou &all and Thorsten Joachims &all)\n* If the claim is about a better exploration,  I'd like to have an idea of the influence of the tuning parameters and possibly a discussion/comparison over alternatives strategies (including an epsilon-n greedy algorithm)\n\nBesides theses core concerns, the papers suffers of some imprecisions on the notations which should be clarified. \n* As an example using O(1000) and O(1M) in the figure one. Everyone understands what is meant but O notation are made to eliminate constant terms and O(1) = O(1000).\n* For eqn (1) it would be better to refer to and \"optimistic strategy\" rather to UCB because the name is already taken by an algorithm which is not this one. Moreover the given strategy would achieve a linear regret if used as described in the paper which is not desirable for bandits algorithms (smallest counter example with two arms following a Bernouilli with different parameters if the best arms generates two zero in a row at the beginning, it is now stuck with a zero mean and zero variance estimate). This is why bandits bounds include a term which increase with the total number of plays. I agree that in practice this effect can be mitigated at that the strategy can be correct in the contextual case (but then I'd like to the dependancies on x to be clear) \n* The papers never mentions whats is a scalar, a vector or a matrix. This creates confusion: as an example eqn (3) can have several different meaning depending if the values are scalars, scalars depending on x or having a diagonal \\sigma matrix\n* In the paragraph above (2) I unsure of what is a \"binomial noise error distribution\" for epsilon, but a few lines later epsilon becomes a gaussian why not just mention that you assume the presence of a gaussian noise on the parameters of a Bernouilli distribution ? \n\n ", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DEEP DENSITY NETWORKS AND UNCERTAINTY IN RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS", "abstract": "Building robust online content recommendation systems requires learning com- plex interactions between user preferences and content features.

The proposed model deals with data and measurement uncertaintes to define exploitation/exploration startegies. \n\nMy main concern with the paper is that the contribution is unclear, as the authors failed from my point of view in establishing the novely w.r.t. the state of the art regarding uncertainty in neural networks. The state of the art section is very confusing, with works given in a random order, without any clear explanation about the limits of the existing works in the context of the task addressed in the paper. The only positioning argument that is given in that section is the final sentence \"In this paper we model measurement noise using a Gaussian model and combine it with a MDN\". It is clearly not sufficient to me, as it does not gives insights about why such proposal is done. \n\nIn the same spirit, I cannot understand why not any classical bandit baseline is given in the experiments. The experiments only concern two slightly different versions of the proposed algorithm in order to show the importance of the deconvolution of both considered noises, but nothing indicates that the model performs fairly well compared to existing approaches. Also, it would have been useful to compare ot to other neural models dealing with uncertainty (some of them having been applied to bandit problems- e.g., Blundell et al. (2015)).\n\nAt last, for me the uncertainty considered in the proposal is not sufficient to claim that the approach is an UCB-like one. The confidence bound considered should include the uncertainty on the parameters in the predictive posterior reward distribution (as done for instance in Blundell et al. (2015) in the context of neural networks), not only the distribution of the observed data with regards to the considered probabilistic families. Not enough discussion is given wrt the assumptions made by the model anyway. The section 4 is also particularly hard to follow.\n\nOther remarks:\n    - Equation (1) does not fit with mixtures considered in 4.2.1. So what is the selection score that is used\n    - \"Due to the fact that data noise is small given x\" => what does it mean since x is a couple ? Also I cannot understand the causal relation with the following of the sentence\n    - Figure 4 (and the associated paragraph) is very difficult to understand (I couldn't extract any information from this)\n    - Too many abreviations that complicate the reading\n    - The throughput measure is not clear\n    - Not enough justification about the architecture. For instance, nothing is said about the title subnet represented in the figure 3.\n    - What is the \"recommendation age\" ?\n    - \"We can rewrite eq. 2 using eq. 3 and 6\" => \"and 4\".\n\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DEEP DENSITY NETWORKS AND UNCERTAINTY IN RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS", "abstract": "Building robust online content recommendation systems requires learning com- plex interactions between user preferences and content features.

The method presented in this paper seems to be novel but lacks clarity unfortunately. My main doubt comes from Section 4.2.1, as I am not sure how exactly the two subnets fed into MDN to produce both mean and variance, through another gaussian mixture model. More specifically, I am not able to see how the output of the two subnets get used in the Gaussian mixture model, and also how the variance of the prediction is determined here. Some rewriting is needed there to make this paper better understandable in my opinion. \n\nMy other concerns of this paper include:\n1. It looks like the training data uses empirical CTR of (t,c) as ground truth. This doesn't look realistic at all, as most of the time (t,c) pair either has no data or very little data in the real world. Otherwise it is a very simple problem to solve, as you can just simply assume it's a independent binomial model for each (t,c).\n2. In Section 4.2.1, CTR is modeled as a Gaussian mixture, which doesn't look quite right, as CTR is between (0,1).\n3. A detailed explanation of the difference between MDN and DDN is needed.\n4.

We show the usefulness of using DDN online in a real world content recommendation system that serves billions of recommendations per day, and present online and offline results to eval- uate the benefit of using DDN.", "pdf": "/pdf/1e9b725db47e3c9f229dc1a840ad17bd37de1491.pdf", "TL;DR": "We have introduced Deep Density Network, a unified DNN model to estimate uncertainty for exploration/exploitation in recommendation systems.", "paperhash": "zeldes|deep_density_networks_and_uncertainty_in_recommender_systems", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nzeldes2018deep,\ntitle={{DEEP} {DENSITY} {NETWORKS} {AND} {UNCERTAINTY} {IN} {RECOMMENDER} {SYSTEMS}},\nauthor={Yoel Zeldes and Stavros Theodorakis and Efrat Solodnik and Aviv Rotman and Gil Chamiel and Dan Friedman},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryY4RhkCZ},\n}", "keywords": ["deep learning", "recommendation system", "uncertainty", "context-based and collaborative filtering"], "authors": ["Yoel Zeldes", "Stavros Theodorakis", "Efrat Solodnik", "Aviv Rotman", "Gil Chamiel", "Dan Friedman"], "authorids": ["yoel.z@taboola.com", "sth@deeplab.ai", "efrat.s@taboola.com", "aviv.r@taboola.com", "gil.c@taboola.com", "dan.f@taboola.com"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "duedate": 1511845199000, "tmdate": 1515642404235, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper176/Official_Review", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper176/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper176/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper176/AnonReviewer3", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper176/AnonReviewer2"], "reply": {"forum": "ryY4RhkCZ", "replyto": "ryY4RhkCZ", "writers": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper176/AnonReviewer[0-9]+", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "review": {"required": true, "order": 2, "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}"}, "rating": {"required": true, "order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"]}, "confidence": {"required": true, "order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"]}}}, "nonreaders": [], "expdate": 1519621199000, "cdate": 1515642404235}}}], "count": 5}
