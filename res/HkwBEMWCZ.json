The discussion is largely based on a sequence of experiments, some of which are interesting and insightful. The discussion here can be useful for other researchers. \n\nMy main concern is that the result here is purely empirical, with no concrete theoretical justification. What the experiments reveal is an empirical correlation between the Eigval index and training accuracy, which can be caused by lots of reasons (and cofounders), and does not necessarily establish a causal relation. Therefore, i found many of the discussion to be questionable. I would love to see more solid theoretical discussion to justify the hypothesis proposed in this paper.\n \nDo you have a sense how accurate is the estimation of the tail probabilities of the eigenvalues? Because the whole paper is based on the approximation of the eigval indexes, it is critical to exam the estimation is accurate enough to draw the conclusions in the paper. \n\nAll the conclusions are based on one or two datasets.

However, both because the paper is already quite long and because the analysis requested by the reviewer is not straightforward even in simplified models, we would like to leave this for future work. We would also like to point out that the idea that degeneracies cause training difficulties in neural networks is not wholly without theoretical precedent. Although the models they deal with are highly simplified models, prior work by Amari and colleagues, which we discuss in our paper, already established this connection. Similarly, as also discussed in our paper, Saxe et al. (2013) showed that randomly initialized linear networks become increasingly degenerate with depth and they identified this as the source of the training difficulties in such deep networks.\n\nSupplementary Note 4 validates our methods for quantifying degeneracies in smaller, numerically tractable networks. The results from these smaller networks agree with the results from the larger networks presented in the main text. For these smaller networks, the mixture model slightly underestimated the fraction of degenerate eigenvalues and overestimated the fraction of degenerate eigenvalues. However, in both cases, there was a highly significant linear relationship between the estimated and actual fractions. This suggests that inferences drawn from the mixture model about the relative degeneracy of models should be reliable, while inferences about the exact values of the eigenvalue degeneracy or negativity of the models should be made more cautiously.\n\nAs requested, we tested the results shown in Figure 4 in two more image recognition datasets (SVHN and STL-10).

The difficulty of training deep networks is partly due to the singularities caused by the non-identifiability of the model. Several such singularities have been identified in previous works: (i) overlap singularities caused by the permutation symmetry of nodes in a given layer, (ii) elimination singularities corresponding to the elimination, i.e. consistent deactivation, of nodes, (iii) singularities generated by the linear dependence of the nodes. These singularities cause degenerate manifolds in the loss landscape that slow down learning. We argue that skip connections eliminate these singularities by breaking the permutation symmetry of nodes, by reducing the possibility of node elimination and by making the nodes less linearly dependent. Moreover, for typical initializations, skip connections move the network away from the \"ghosts\" of these singularities and sculpt the landscape around them to alleviate the learning slow-down.
