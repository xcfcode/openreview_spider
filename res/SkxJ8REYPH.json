The scheme proposes to do a sequence inner/local steps of any optimizer without any momentum, but then only apply momentum on the outer level, after each global synchronization round.\n\nThe paper is clearly written and experiments are well set up.\n\nIn a more general view, I'd encourage the authors to discuss in the paper that momentum can be applied both in the inner and the outer loop. For example both [K19] and [Assran et al. (2019)] have already applied momentum in a similar setting but focusing on the inner level (which would be harder to analyze in theory, but might be a good method in practice).\n\nThe provided theoretical convergence result is valuable as a contribution, even if it does not show benefits of momentum over SGD, but at least it shows a slowdown which is bounded, as in single-machine SGD. The authors have done non-trivial work to extend it to the case of communication and local updates, but I didn't have time to check the entire long proof in the appendix.\n\nThe experimental results are convincing in comparison to the baselines without momentum.\nI would have hoped the authors also add a more clear picture of how the proposed 'outer' momentum would compare to practical 'inner' momentum schemes such as used by [Assran et al. (2019)] and [K19].\n\nThe main question for me is on the significance of the contribution. The benefits of momentum are well known in practice in the single-machine case, and theoretically not well understood. The paper here translates this type of results also to the decentralized case. As momentum is common it is not very surprising that it is also beneficial here. The paper could be strengthened by adding comparisons of different inner/outer momentum variants which are unique to the distributed setting. \n\nMinor comments:\n- At the end of Section 3, it is said that \"Local SGD, ... perform averaging on the model parameters rather than on gradients.\".\nWhile not totally wrong, I think one should say that local SGD can easily do averaging of the model changes/deltas, instead of the models themselves.\n\n- Start of Page 3 and of Section 5: potentially clarify notion of 'descent direction', as with SGD those are not technically descent on the original (local or global) objective, but only on the currently sampled stochastic f_i .\n\nUPDATE AFTER REBUTTAL\nThe discussion and other reviews were helpful, for instance that the paper should still clarify better the fact that the proposed method is just a very minor generalization of BMUF, to some more SGD variants (including decentralized). Nevertheless, reviewers seem to agree that the paper is well-presented in giving a more clear review of such methods, and valuable in improving the theoretical understanding of such distributed momentum methods. I keep the current score.\n\nReferences:\n[K19] Koloskova, Anastasia, et al. \"Decentralized Deep Learning with Arbitrary Communication Compression.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.09356 (2019).", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1123/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1123/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["jianyuw1@andrew.cmu.edu", "tantia@fb.com", "ballasn@fb.com", "mikerabbat@fb.com"], "title": "SlowMo: Improving Communication-Efficient Distributed SGD with Slow Momentum", "authors": ["Jianyu Wang", "Vinayak Tantia", "Nicolas Ballas", "Michael Rabbat"], "pdf": "/pdf/e8558035e2690cc168ce3d147df58cab1cb0d93e.pdf", "TL;DR": "SlowMo improves the optimization and generalization performance of communication-efficient decentralized algorithms without sacrificing speed.", "abstract": "Distributed optimization is essential for training large models on large datasets.

Thanks for pointing out our mischaracterization of BMUF. After re-reading the paper we agree that it mentions other methods than SGD could be used as the local optimizer. In our view, the main way in which SlowMo generalizes BMUF is by allowing workers to communicate during steps of the inner loop; when we use SlowMo with (O)SGP, workers gossip for $\\tau$ local iterations and then perform an AllReduce to exactly synchronize before doing the block/slow momentum step. In our experiments on both image classification and machine translations tasks we found that using (O)SGP in the inner loop provided improvements over having workers perform local/independent updates. This also why we chose to refer to the inner loop steps as coming from a \u201cbase\u201d optimizer instead of a \u201clocal\u201d one.

We agree that it would be desirable to provide theoretical results justifying why SlowMo leads to accelerated convergence rates, compared to other decentralized methods. To the best of our knowledge, there are still relatively few theoretical results for stochastic momentum methods illustrating when they achieve accelerated rates, even in the centralized/serial setting.\n\nIn the initial submission, to stay within the recommended page length, we focused our discussion in Sections 1 and 3 on prior work studying stochastic decentralized/communication-efficient optimization methods for non-convex problems (especially aimed at training deep neural networks), and especially those incorporating some form of momentum. We appreciate that there is a vast literature studying decentralized methods, especially for convex objectives, and there are also exciting recent advances in the theoretical understanding of (centralized) stochastic momentum methods.

In fact, in all of our experiments the local updates (with or without SlowMo) are all either based on SGD with momentum (on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet) or Adam (on WMT\u201916 En-De). So when using SlowMo there may actually be two forms of momentum being used. We did run experiments on CIFAR-10 where the local update rule (base optimizer) was plain SGD without momentum. When the local updates do not use momentum, we also observed that introducing SlowMo led to improvements in optimization and generalization. However, using local momentum is better than not using local momentum, and using SlowMo on top of local momentum provides further improvements (as illustrated by the results included in the paper). We realize that we may not have been clear on this point before, and we will update our submission to emphasize that $d^{(i)}_{t,k}$ in line 4 of Alg 1 could be a stochastic gradient $\\nabla F_i(x^{(i)}_{t,k}, \\xi^{(i)}_{t,k})$, or it could indeed correspond to a local momentum step, e.g., $d^{(i)}_{t,k} = \\beta^{(i)}_{\\text{local}} d^{(i)}_{t,k-1} + \\nabla F_i(x^{(i)}_{t,k}, \\xi^{(i)}_{t,k})$. Note that whether or not the local/base optimizer uses momentum is orthogonal to whether one has the workers communicate during the inner loop (e.g., using SGP/OSGP) or not (LocalSGD and LocalAdam).

However, they should modify their claim that \"BMUF is a special case of SlowMomentum\".\nIn classical block momentum version of BMUF, the  update formula is:\nu_{t+1} = \\beta u_{t} + \\alpha (x_{t,0}-x_{t,\\tau})\nx_{t+1,0} = x_{t,0} - u_{t+1}\n\\beta is called block momentum and \\alpha is block learning rate\n\nin this paper, the update formula becomes:\nu_{t+1} = \\beta u_{t} +  (x_{t,0}-x_{t,\\tau})/\\gamma_{t}\nx_{t+1,0} = x_{t,0} - \\alpha\\gamma_{t}u_{t+1}\n\nObviously this two formula are equivalent. BMUF is a general framework, which can work with different kinds of local optimizer. The author should not narrow down the definition of BMUF as BMUF with SGD as local optimizer and \\alpha=1. Actually, \\alpha=1 is used in all experiments of this paper.\n\nIn conclusion, the organization and writing of this paper is satisfactory, the experiments and theoretical proof is valuable for respective researchers.

The analysis is quite standard and the convergence rate with extra effect (increasing the upper bound) in Eq.5 cannot explain why it convergences faster and generalizes better (e.g. in Figure 2) than AR-SGD. \n* As one main contribution of this paper is in terms of the theoretical convergence guarantees, the related work should precisely mention the recent progress in this area and (maybe) point out the difference compared to the prior work. \n\nMinor comments: \n1.

Multiple approaches have been proposed to reduce the communication overhead in distributed training, such as synchronizing only after performing multiple local SGD steps, and decentralized methods (e.g., using gossip algorithms) to decouple communications among workers. Although these methods run faster than AllReduce-based methods, which use blocking communication before every update, the resulting models may be less accurate after the same number of updates. Inspired by the BMUF method of Chen & Huo (2016), we propose a slow momentum (SlowMo) framework, where workers periodically synchronize and perform a momentum update, after multiple iterations of a base optimization algorithm. Experiments on image classification and machine translation tasks demonstrate that SlowMo consistently yields improvements in optimization and generalization performance relative to the base optimizer, even when the additional overhead is amortized over many updates so that the SlowMo runtime is on par with that of the base optimizer. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees showing that SlowMo converges to a stationary point of smooth non-convex losses. Since BMUF can be expressed through the SlowMo framework, our results also correspond to the first theoretical convergence guarantees for BMUF.", "keywords": ["distributed optimization", "decentralized training methods", "communication-efficient distributed training with momentum", "large-scale parallel SGD"], "paperhash": "wang|slowmo_improving_communicationefficient_distributed_sgd_with_slow_momentum", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nWang2020SlowMo:,\ntitle={SlowMo: Improving Communication-Efficient Distributed SGD with Slow Momentum},\nauthor={Jianyu Wang and Vinayak Tantia and Nicolas Ballas and Michael Rabbat},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkxJ8REYPH}\n}", "full_presentation_video": "", "original_pdf": "/attachment/5d0d0fb3364cb6e46d0e07221220adede3442eb0.pdf", "appendix": "", "poster": "", "spotlight_video": "", "slides": ""}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
