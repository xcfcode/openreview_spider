This corresponds to one versus all learning of the first label where the labels of other classes are all chosen equal to \u201cnot-the-first-class\u201d. Then we move on to the next label and train the network to discriminate between first and second classes versus the rest of the labels. In that manner, the labels are learned incrementally until all labels are learned. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnswer to \u201cA lot of algorithms fall into your theory\u201d and \u201ci would assume all reasonable algorithms to perform that way. i.e. all algorithms that follow a version of the (natural) gradient. In normal gradient descent, we also see that the first thing we get right are the biases on the outputs, therefore i would claim this is a property of the learning-problem, not the algorithm. So far the article did not provide any evidence towards the contrary. \u201c\n\nWe agree with your comment. Indeed, we tried to emphasize the very same issue in our general comment as the strength of our framework.  Certain features of the trajectory, such as increasing tendency of H(\\hat Y), is indeed expected to hold generally for many \u201creasonable\u201d learning algorithms and therefore we suggested that this trajectory can be used to observe whether a learning algorithm is acting \u201creasonably\u201d or not. This claim is explored with new experimental results where we tried to show that this trajectory is different for underfitting, overfitting, and for example in learning one label at a time. Hence, the information plane might be used alternatively to monitor the learning process with potentially more enlightening information about the learning.\n\nThere is one caveat here. The SMLC was mainly adopted to explain the behavior of SGD in ANNs for perfect learning. This is definitely not expected to hold in general. However, we found it important to mention the similarity between the perfect SGD trajectory and the shortest path between probability measures, which can motivate cost functions promoting the shortest path directly if this path is optimal from learning perspective.

Here we address some concerns about the paper that are common among the reviews:\n\n1. (Generality) How General is this trajectory?\n\nAn important motivation of this work is to explore the generality of the observed trajectories and its interpretation. \n\nWe have tried to show that as far as some assumptions are in place, some features of the trajectory are to be expected in general:\n\nA1) The labels Y are uniformly distributed.\nA2) The parameter updates during learning are done using a function of the previous parameters and an independent random variable representing the training batch, i.e.,   $\\theta_{n+1} = f(\\theta_{n}, U)$. This assumption holds for SGD training of ANNs.\nA3) We assume perfect learning, that is $g(\\theta_n, .)$ converges to $c(.)$.\n\nWith these assumptions, the trajectory of learning in the information plane is independent from the architecture of the classifier (which may not even be an ANN). \n\nFirst, since the output labels are uniformly distributed, the entropy $H(\\hat y)$ tends to increase to its maximum during successful training which is motivated by Proposition 3. \n\nUnderstanding learning as maximization of mutual information, the shape of $H(\\hat y | y)$ is also expected to consist of one or more bumps with local maxima in the middle. The number of bumps depends on the trajectory and can be different if the learning strategy is different. For instance, if the learning algorithm is devised to learn one label at a time, the trajectory is quite different as it is shown in the Figure (here: https://ibb.co/f9H4TzP ) for 3 and 10 classes.\n\nThe parabola shape of the conditional entropy, however, is conjectured to be due to SGD changing the probability of labels to the ground truth labels by moving on the shortest path on the space of joint probability measures. This claim requires more theoretical and experimental investigation and it is relegated to future works.\n\n2. (Meaning) What is the meaning of these trajectories?\n\nWe propose that this trajectory in the information plane carries many useful information about the training process and can be used effectively to observe the state of training beyond mere measurement of training/test error. To back up this claim we included a new experiment in the paper in which we use the trajectories to spot underfitting and overfitting. \n\nA common practical issue in training learning algorithms is to find roots of the low accuracy and see if the obtained accuracy is the best we can do. This can be done in a straightforward way using the information plane. \n\nWe show that, regardless of the error, an underfitted classifier lies far from Fano\u2019s bound which implies that the accuracy can be still improved. On the other hand, an overfitted classifier lies very close to the Fano bound and moves on this curve. From this experiment, we conclude that taking a look at the trajectory of these quantities in other scenarios (e.g. adversarial training) may reveal characteristic behaviors thus providing new insights.

Valid concerns about the paper have been pointed out, which we aim to clarify in the latest version of the paper and the following comments:\n\n    1. \u201cThis is known to happen, because almost all models include a bias on the output.\u201d\n\nRegarding the comment about the bias, first, it should be noted that learning the marginal first is not universal and depends on the learning strategy. For instance if only one class is learned at a time, then the marginal is learned along with the training. See the figures attached to the general comment above. Therefore the relation between bias and learning marginals is far from being trivial and heavily depends on the learning algorithm. This hints to our claim that understanding different learning trajectories in the information plane can be illuminating for analyzing the learning process.\n\n\n    2. \u201cwhile showing some parabola like shape, there are big differences in how the shapes are looking like\u201d\n\nNote that  $\\alpha$-SMLC is a model used to explore how SGD is acting on probabilities during learning. Admitting its imperfection, similarities besides the parabolic shapes are notable. For example, the $\\alpha$-SMLC predicts that the inflection point of  $H(\\hat y | y)$ gets closer to the bound as $p$ increases, which is also observed in the experiments. \n\nDespite this, we share the reviewer\u2019s concern and believe that elaborating sophisticated extensions of the $\\alpha$-SMLC, that more closely resemble SGD, may be a fruitful research direction.\n\n    3. \u201cThere is no actual connection to SGD left\u201d\n\nThe connection to SGD arises from the fact that it can be modeled as a HMP. As far as the learning process can be modeled as a HMP, we expect the analysis to hold as well. However, SGD learning in ANNs is interesting as it ends up close to Fano\u2019s curve (as predicted by the $\\alpha$-SMLC) and as it is indicated in Appendix, it manages to learn the true labels from the noisy ones. \n\n\n    4. \u201cone could think about a model which can not model a bias and the inputs are mean-free thus it is hard to learn the marginal distribution, which might change the trajectory\u201d\n\nWe are not sure what the reviewer means by this but we think this concern may be addressed in the first point (\u201cgenerality\u201d) of the general comment above. Note that a model that is not able to learn the marginal distribution violates assumption A3 from that comment."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1465/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1465/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1465/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On the Trajectory of Stochastic Gradient Descent in the Information Plane", "abstract": "Studying the evolution of information theoretic quantities during Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) learning of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has gained popularity in recent years. \nNevertheless, these type of experiments require estimating mutual information and entropy which becomes intractable for moderately large problems.

This paper was inspired by (Ziv and Tishby 17'), but instead of measuring the mutual information I(X;T) and I(Y:T), this paper proposed to measure H(\\hat{y}) and H(\\hat{y}|y), which are much easier to compute but carries similar meaning as I(Y;T) and I(X;T).\n\nThe interesting part of this paper appears in Section 4, where the author makes a connection between the SGD training process and \\alpha-SMLC(strong Markov learning chain). SMLC is just simply linear combination of the initial distribution and the final stable distribution of the labels. The authors show that the trajectory of the real experiment is similar to that of SMLC.\n\nGenerally I think the paper is well-written and clearly present the ideas. Here are some pros and cons.\n\nPros 1: The trajectory presented in this paper is much more reliable than that in (Ziv and Tishby 17'), since measuring the entropy and conditional entropy of discrete random variables are much easier. Also it is easy for people to believe that the trajectory holds for various neural network structure and various activation functions.\n\nPros 2: The connection to SMLC is interesting and it may contain lot of insights.\n\nCons 1: One of my major concern is --- if you look at the trajectory of the experiment v.s. SMLC (Figure 3), they look similar at first glance. But if you look at it carefully, you will notice that the color of them are different! For SGD, the trajectory goes to the turning point very soon (usually no more than 10% of the training steps), whereas SMLC goes to the turning point much slower. How do the authors think about this phenomenon and what does this mean?\n\nCons 2: This paper is going to be more meaningful if the author can provide some discussions, especially about (1) what does the shape trajectory mean (2) what do the connection between the trajectory and Markov chain means (3) how can these connections be potentially useful to improve training algorithm? I understand that these questions may not be clearly answerable, but the authors should make this paper more inspiring such that other researchers can think deeper after reading this paper.\n\nCons 3: I suggest the authors using SGD instead of GD throughout the paper. Usually GD means true gradient descent, but the paper is talking about batched stochastic gradient descent. GD does not have Markovity.\n\nGenerally, I think the paper is on the borderline.

Assuming TV metric of probabilities, a trajectory is defined which fits to general learning behaviour of distributions.\n\nThe issue is that the paper abstracts the actual algorithm, model and data away and the only thing that remains are marginal distributions p(y) and conditional p(y'|y). At this point one can already argue that the result is either not describing real behavior, or is trivial. The proposed trajectory starts with a model that only predicts one-class (low entropy H(y') and high conditional entropy) and ends with the optimal model. the trajectory is linear in distribution space, therefore one obtains initially a stage where H(y') and H(y'|y) increase a lot followed by a stage where H(y'|y) decrease.\n\nThis is known to happen, because almost all models include a bias on the output, thus the easiest way to initially decrease the error is to obtain the correct marginal distribution by tuning the bias. Learning the actual class-label, depending on the observed image is much harder and thus takes longer. Therefore no matter what algorithm is used, one would expect this kind of trajectory with a model that has a bias.\n\nIt also means that the interesting part of an analysis only begins after the marginal distribution is learned sufficiently well. and here the experimental results deviate a lot from the theoretical prediction. while showing some parabola like shape, there are big differences in how the shapes are looking like.\n\nI don't see how this paper is improving the state of the art, most of the theoretical contributions are well known or easy to derive. There is no actual connection to SGD left, therefore it is even hard to argue that the predicted shape will be observed, independent of dataset or model(one could think about a model which can not model a bias and the inputs are mean-free thus it is hard to learn the marginal distribution, which might change the trajectory)\n\n Therefore, I vote for a strong reject.", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1465/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On the Trajectory of Stochastic Gradient Descent in the Information Plane", "abstract": "Studying the evolution of information theoretic quantities during Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) learning of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has gained popularity in recent years. \nNevertheless, these type of experiments require estimating mutual information and entropy which becomes intractable for moderately large problems. In this work we propose a framework for understanding SGD learning in the information plane which consists of observing entropy and conditional entropy of the output labels of ANN. Through experimental results and theoretical justifications it is shown that, under some assumptions, the SGD learning trajectories appear to be similar for different ANN architectures. First, the SGD learning is modeled as a Hidden Markov Process (HMP) whose entropy tends to increase to the maximum. Then, it is shown that the SGD learning trajectory appears to move close to the shortest path between the initial and final joint distributions in the space of probability measures equipped with the total variation metric. Furthermore, it is shown that the trajectory of learning in the information plane can provide an alternative for observing the learning process, with potentially richer information about the learning than the trajectories in training and test error.
