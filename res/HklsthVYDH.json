The framework is flexible on how the attacker network can be trained, and advances over previous works where the attacker is a human-designed algorithm rather than a learning model. Experiment results show that the framework reaches superior defense performance. The authors also extend the framework to help imitation learning.\n\nOverall the paper is a pleasure to read. My questions/suggestions are\n\n(1) Given that the framework seems natural in design, a deeper contribution would be talking about how to successfully train the framework in practice. The authors talk about the connection of the framework to GAN, and the latter is not that easy to train. However, we see very little information on how to train the framework in the paper. Was it super easy to train the framework (why?), or did the author encounter any difficulties? Are there important heuristics that help train the framework successfully?\n\n(2) While the framework leads to a better defense mechanism (the authors' goal), one could wonder whether it leads to a better attacker as well. Instead of just checking the differences of the attacking examples generated, can we take the inner attacker and see if it is more effective in attacking than PGM and CW? How does the goodness of the attacker improve with time? Do different L2L variants generate attackers with different quality? Do the quality connect with the defense performance?\n\n(3) Section 4 looks distracting to me. It is good to know that the framework can be extended to imitation learning, but the section is best put at a longer version or another paper, rather than occupying a significant amount of space in the current paper.\n\nI have read the rebuttal and thank the authors for the response.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper90/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper90/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["zhchen@gatech.edu", "jianghm@gatech.edu", "yyshi@gatech.edu", "bodai@google.com", "tourzhao@gatech.edu"], "title": "Learning to Defense by Learning to Attack", "authors": ["Zhehui Chen", "Haoming Jiang", "Yuyang Shi", "Bo Dai", "Tuo Zhao"], "pdf": "/pdf/4638e0b618dd401d984af3d8345467fd1e4be65a.pdf", "abstract": "Adversarial training provides a principled approach for training robust neural networks.

Indeed, evaluating the robustness of the model needs careful experimental design. The evaluation is not designed to favor our framework, but to have a fair comparison with the results in [1]. We now make a clear statement and provide more evidence to support our conclusion, which has been added to Appendix E in the revised paper.\n\nBefore we make the detailed comments, we would like to make a particular response to \u201cIn other words, if the attacker knows the strategy used by the defender (such as the attacker network structure), it may be possible to break the model.\u201d Our work follows the most reliable and widely used robust model approach \u2014 adversarial training, which finds a set of parameters to make the model robust. We do not make any modifications to the final classifier model. Unlike previous works (e.g., Defense-GAN [2]), our model does not take the attacker as a part of the final model and does not use shattered/obfuscated/masked gradient as a defense mechanism. To see this, we check each item recommended in section 3.1 of [3]:\n-- One-step attacks perform better than iterative attacks:  Figure 4 shows that the PGM attack is stronger with larger number of iterations.\n-- Black-box attacks are better than white-box attacks: Appendix A shows that the black-box attack is much weaker than white white-box attacks.  We do not make any modifications to the final classifier model. There is no reason that the black-box attack can be stronger than the white-box attack.\n-- Unbounded attacks do not reach 100% success: Figure 9 in Appendix E shows that the PGM attack eventually reaches 100% success as the perturbation magnitude increases.\n-- Random sampling finds adversarial examples: In the table below, we show that random search is not better than gradient-based methods and is rather weak against our model. \n-- Increasing distortion bound does not increase success: Figure 4 shows that the PGM attack becomes stronger as the perturbation magnitude increases.\n\nEven the attacker network structure is known, it is not obvious how to design a more effective attack.  One naive way is directly using the trained attacker model to attack the final classification model, we show that the attack is just as good as PGM attack and we have added these results in Table 2 on Page 6 in revision.\n\nCIFAR10\n| Attack                 \t\t                    | Grad L2L    | 2-Step L2L |\n+--------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------+\n|CW                      \t\t                    | 53.5%         | 57.07%       |\n|PGM 20               \t\t                    | 51.17%       | 54.32%       |\n|PGM 100             \t\t                    | 47.72%       | 52.34%       |\n|Grad L2L Attacker    \t\t            | 49.68%       | --                 |\n|2-Step L2L Attacker\t\t            | --       \t   | 52.71%       |\n|Random (w/ $10^5$ Samples)          | 82.67%       | 83.10%       |\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper90/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper90/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["zhchen@gatech.edu", "jianghm@gatech.edu", "yyshi@gatech.edu", "bodai@google.com", "tourzhao@gatech.edu"], "title": "Learning to Defense by Learning to Attack", "authors": ["Zhehui Chen", "Haoming Jiang", "Yuyang Shi", "Bo Dai", "Tuo Zhao"], "pdf": "/pdf/4638e0b618dd401d984af3d8345467fd1e4be65a.pdf", "abstract": "Adversarial training provides a principled approach for training robust neural networks.

Figure 4 and Figure 9 in Appendix E evaluate the robustness under an unrestrictive attack, which is essentially the attack with unbounded perturbation magnitude $\\epsilon=\\infty$.\n\nIn this paper, we focus on $\\ell_\\infty$ attack because it is the most reasonable evaluation and has been shown to be much more powerful than the other threat models. For example, in [2] (Figure 4), they show that to successfully attack the model,  $\\ell_2$ attacks require an extremely large perturbation magnitude, which even makes the adversarial images visually **distinguishable** (The experiments only make sense when the adversarial images are visually **indistinguishable**). \n\nIn terms of training stability, our framework is easy to train, since we take clean images and the corresponding gradient as the input of the attacker, which has been highlighted in our paper as a Gradient Attacker Network on Page 4. Without such gradient information, we show that such an attacker severely suffers from training instability (see Naive-L2L). We add a discussion in Section 5 (Discussion) in the revised version. Footnote 2 and Appendix B also discuss how architecture affects training stability. \n\n(2) That\u2019s a very good suggestion. \nOur framework can be naturally extended to other types of adversarial training, including TRADES[3], VAT [4], Local Linearity Regularization [5]. We leave them for future investigation.\n\n(3) The limiting cycle is a long-lasting issue for minimax problems [6,7]. The reason behind the limiting cycle is that the update rule is quite different.\n\nTo see the difference between the minimization problem and minimax problem, we consider the objective function $f(x,y)$ involves two variables: $x$ and $y$.\n\n| Problem         | Objective                   | Update Direction        |\n+-------------------+----------------------------+--------------------------------+\n| Minimization | $\\min_{x,y} f(x,y)$         | $(-\\frac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial x},-\\frac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial y})$ |\n| Minimax        | $\\min_x \\max_y f(x,y)$ | $(-\\frac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial x},\\frac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial y})$     |\n\nFigure 1 is an illustrative example. We provide a concrete example in Appendix D in the revised version: we consider the following optimization problem: $\\min_x \\max_y xy$. Then at the $t$-th iteration, the update direction will be $(-y_t,x_t)$. If we start from $(1,0)$ with a small enough stepsize (e.g., $0.0001$), this update will result in a limiting circle: $x^2+y^2=1$ and never reach the stable equilibrium $(0,0)$. \n\nA general min-max optimization problem is more complicated and can be highly nonconvex-nonconcave. \n\nWe have also revised the corresponding contents in the Introduction to clarify our motivation. \n\n[1]Nagarajan, Vaishnavh, and J.

In adversarial training, however, we have the label supervisions. Moreover, the attacker is only for generating perturbation, whereas the generator in GANs is for generating whole images from random noise. In this sense, adversarial training is easier than GAN training. \n\n(1.b) (Grad-L2L vs. Naive-L2L) For improving the training stability, we take clean images and the corresponding *gradient* as the input of the attacker, which has been highlighted in our paper as a Gradient Attacker Network on Page 4. Without such gradient information, we show that such an attacker severely suffers from training instability (see the results of Naive-L2L). \n\n(1.c) Furthermore, we want to emphasize an important detail found in our experiments (footnote 2 on page 5 and Appendix B). The network used in our framework has no downsampling modules, i.e., the image resolution does not change throughout the network. We also tried another architecture with downsampling modules, which is called \u201cslim attacker\u201d. We observed that the slim attacker suffers from training instability. We suspect the reason behind this is that the downsampling causes the loss of information. Thus, we tried to enhance the slim attacker by skip layer connections, by which the robust performance is still worse than the proposed architecture on CIFAR10 as illustrated in the following table. \n\nWe have revised the footnote 2 and Appendix B to highlight these points, which will benefit the follow-up research. \n\nSee Table 8 (Appendix B on Page 13) for full experiment results.\n| Input                  | GradL2L w/ Slim Attacker | GradL2L (Original)         |\n+----------------------+------------------------------------+---------------------------------+\n| Clean                  |   85.31%                               |  85.84%                             |\n| PGM-20 attack  |   51.02%                               |  51.17%                             |\n| CW attack          |  42.72%                                | 53.50%                              |\n\n\nExcept for the aforementioned parts, we observe no other training instability issue with L2L. We have added the above discussion about the training stability to Section 5 (Discussion) on Page 8 in the revised paper.\n\n(2) As illustrated below, L2L attacker is stronger than PGM 20 and CW attacks, which explains why both Grad L2L and 2-Step L2L yield a more robust model than PGM Net. \n\nFurthermore, for Grad L2L, the perturbation generated by PGM 100 is significantly stronger than the one generated by the L2L attacker. While for 2-Step L2L, the strength of PGM 100 is similar to L2L attacker. This observation shows that 2-Step L2L attacker is stronger than Grad L2L attacker and thus yields a more robust model.\n\n| Attack                        | Grad L2L    | 2Step L2L |\n+----------------------------+----------------+--------------+\n|CW                               | 53.5%         | 57.07%     |\n|PGM 20                       | 51.17%       | 54.32%     |\n|PGM 100                     | 47.72%       | 52.34%     |\n|Grad L2L  Attacker    | 49.68%       | --               |\n|2Step L2L Attacker    | --                 | 52.71%     |\n\nThe corresponding discussion has been added to Section 3 (Experiments) in the revised paper.\n\n(3) Section 4 (Extension) shows the proposed L2L framework is very generic: it can be naturally used in solving more general min-max optimization problems, such as GAIL. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper90/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper90/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["zhchen@gatech.edu", "jianghm@gatech.edu", "yyshi@gatech.edu", "bodai@google.com", "tourzhao@gatech.edu"], "title": "Learning to Defense by Learning to Attack", "authors": ["Zhehui Chen", "Haoming Jiang", "Yuyang Shi", "Bo Dai", "Tuo Zhao"], "pdf": "/pdf/4638e0b618dd401d984af3d8345467fd1e4be65a.pdf", "abstract": "Adversarial training provides a principled approach for training robust neural networks.

Unfortunately, such a minimax problem is very difficult to solve due to the lack of convex-concave structure. This work proposes a new adversarial training method based on a generic learning-to-learn (L2L) framework. Specifically, instead of applying the existing hand-designed algorithms for the inner problem, we learn an optimizer, which is parametrized as a convolutional neural network. At the same time, a robust classifier is learned to defense the adversarial attack generated by the learned optimizer. Our experiments over CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that the L2L outperforms existing adversarial training methods in both classification accuracy and computational efficiency.

Instead of using a gradient-based attack to solve the inner maximization, the authors use a neural network to learn the attack results. From the experimental results, this method can effectively defend against CW and PGD on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. But the clean accuracy is lower than Madry et al. \n\nAlso, there are too many works on robustness defense that have been proven ineffective (consider the works by Carlini). Since this is a new way of robust training and there is no certified guarantee, I suggest the authors refer [1] to evaluate the effectiveness of the defense more thoroughly to convince the readers that it really works. Especially, a robustness evaluation under adaptive attacks is necessary. In other words, if the attacker knows the strategy used by the defender (such as the attacker network structure), it may be possible to break the model. \n\nI am not convinced by the limiting cycle claim in Figure 1. I do not think this scenario (gradient descent goes along a cycle) is possible. If we take the integral of the gradient along this cycle from x to itself, we will get 0=f(x)-f(x)=-\\int_{t on cycle}f'(t)dt<0, which means that the function is not continuous at x. I suggest the authors have a surface plot of the function if they think this is possible. \n\n[1] Carlini, Nicholas, et al. \"On evaluating adversarial robustness.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.06705 (2019)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper90/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper90/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["zhchen@gatech.edu", "jianghm@gatech.edu", "yyshi@gatech.edu", "bodai@google.com", "tourzhao@gatech.edu"], "title": "Learning to Defense by Learning to Attack", "authors": ["Zhehui Chen", "Haoming Jiang", "Yuyang Shi", "Bo Dai", "Tuo Zhao"], "pdf": "/pdf/4638e0b618dd401d984af3d8345467fd1e4be65a.pdf", "abstract": "Adversarial training provides a principled approach for training robust neural networks.

The experimental results are presented clearly, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in running time. Section 4 seems to support the main claim in a novel way as well.
