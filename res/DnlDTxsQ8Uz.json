Through various ablation experiments, we evaluate the impact of bandpass filtering on the numerical performances of a GCN: we empirically show that most of the necessary and used information for nodes classification is contained in the low-frequency domain, and thus contrary to images,  high-frequencies are less crucial to community detection. In particular, it is sometimes possible to obtain accuracies at a state-of-the-art level with simple classifiers that rely only on a few low frequencies.", "pdf": "/pdf/f5834261330cbc2569c8778b90c953ba27bc6c41.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|lowrank_projections_of_gcns_laplacian", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021lowrank,\ntitle={Low-rank projections of {\\{}GCN{\\}}s Laplacian},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to ICLR 2021 Workshop on Geometrical and Topological Representation Learning},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=DnlDTxsQ8Uz},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615225929161, "tmdate": 1615967298665, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
