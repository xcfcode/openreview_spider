Our approach works by training a neural network to mimic the fitness function of a design optimization task and then, using the differential nature of the neural network, perform gradient decent to maximize the fitness. We demonstrate this methods effectiveness by designing an optimized heat sink and both 2D and 3D airfoils that maximize the lift drag ratio under steady state flow conditions. We highlight that our method has two distinct benefits over other automated design approaches. First, evaluating the neural networks prediction of fitness can be orders of magnitude faster then simulating the system of interest. Second, using gradient decent allows the design space to be searched much more efficiently then other gradient free methods. These two strengths work together to overcome some of the current shortcomings of automated design.", "pdf": "/pdf/af6ab6541b45846a48f03645686a45cc6802cc7d.pdf", "TL;DR": "A method for performing automated design on real world objects such as heat sinks and wing airfoils that makes use of neural networks and gradient descent.", "paperhash": "hennigh|automated_design_using_neural_networks_and_gradient_descent", "authors": ["Oliver Hennigh"], "authorids": ["loliverhennigh101@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["Deep Learning", "Automated Design", "Gradient Descent"], "_bibtex": "@misc{\n  hennigh2018automated,\n  title={AUTOMATED DESIGN USING NEURAL NETWORKS AND GRADIENT DESCENT},\n  author={Oliver Hennigh},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByICvwkvM}\n}"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 1, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "duedate": 1518472800000, "tmdate": 1518474081690, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/-/Submission", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["~"], "reply": {"forum": null, "replyto": null, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop"]}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*|ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop", "description": "Your authorized identity to be associated with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"pdf": {"required": true, "order": 9, "value-regex": "upload", "description": "Upload a PDF file that ends with .pdf"}, "title": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Title of paper.", "value-regex": ".{1,250}"}, "abstract": {"required": true, "order": 8, "description": "Abstract of paper.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}, "authors": {"required": true, "order": 2, "values-regex": "[^;,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*", "description": "Comma separated list of author names.
