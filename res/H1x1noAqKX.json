We answer your questions as follows.\n\n> Unfortunately, I do not see any relevant technical novelty, and this is a major issue. \n\nIn our opinion, a simple solution to a difficult problem is preferred to a complex one.\n\n> Perhaps the only significant conclusion about this paper is that \n> before designing a new OOD detector, if representing \n> the set of \u201cunknown\u201d classes with ILVRC is reasonable, \n> then it makes sense to simply train a binary classifier and see how it works.\n\nOur experiments suggest that representing outliers with ILSVRC might be reasonable more often than not, since our method correctly classified negative WildDash images such as a white wall, two kinds of noise, anthill closeup, aquarium, etc.\n\nA concurrent submission to ICLR 2019 shows that representing outliers with ImageNet and 80 million images is a reasonable choice for a wide selection of datasets. We feel that our submission nicely complements their work by presenting a similar idea in the dense prediction context.\n\nhttps://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxCxhRcY7\n\nYes, our main conclusion is that ImageNet seems to be diverse enough to support discriminative OOD detection in diverse traffic images. The other important finding is that entropy-based OOD detection approaches (e.g. max-softmax) are not appropriate for dense prediction due to inherent aleatoric uncertainty involved.\n\nWe thank for the comment, we shall revise the conclusion accordingly.\n\n> Besides the novelty, I disagree with the way the paper has been positioned and motivated. \n> It brings into play epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty concepts to justify (the simplicity of) the approach, \n> and it overlooks a large body of machine learning (novelty detection, one-class classification, \u2026). \n> This is also a major issue.\n\nWe avoided several methods based on complex GAN designs due to large space and time complexities which would cause GPU memory exhaustion and long training times. One of our in-distribution datasets contains 18000 complex road driving images (Vistas, we reduce resolution to 512x1024 pixels). This means 150 times more pixels than in CIFAR and more than 50 times more pixels than in UCSD ped2, even if we neglect diversity of scenes (different continents, night, rain, snow, ...) and cameras. We do not say it is impossible to adapt some GAN approach to OOD detection on Vistas, however that is certainly not straightforward (as we try to describe below) and therefore out of our scope.\n\nThe diversity of our in-distribution dataset restricts our options since now, when we train only the discriminator, our training procedure takes an entire day. We reckon that training a GAN variant with suitable capacity would require much more time since the generator would initially produce useless counterexamples.\n\nOur memory requirements are even more restrictive since our ambition is to attach the discriminator as the second head to a regular semantic segmentation pipeline (we tried that already, it works).

We prefer to focus on baseline models at this stage in order to simplify conclusions as well as speed-up the training.\n\nSOTA on cityscapes achieve high benchmark results by recovering fine spatial detail lost due to downsampling. Our segmentation models are not as accurate on object borders or small objects like poles, but work reasonably well. When it comes to OOD detection, we are more interested in existence of OOD regions, rather than their exact outlines. Furthermore, as table 5 shows, cityscapes is in many ways a very specific dataset (single camera, nice weather conditions, German cities). Consequently, chasing SOTA on cityscapes is likely to poorly affect max-softmax OOD detection due to overfitting. Using simpler models is also a way of regularization.\n\nTable 3 in our original submission includes OOD-detection results obtained with the model which achieves 77.1 mIoU on Cityscapes. The table shows only results of OOD-detection by classification into foreign classes since this approach worked much better than max-softmax. In the revised paper we show the max-softmax results as well.\n\nWe agree that densely connected layers are a very good choice for semantic segmentation. However, tiramisu would not be a suitable choice for our experiments due to following reasons:\n\n    it has a thick up-sampling path which complicates training on large images due to large memory requirements\n    the Tiramisu paper proposes exotic downsampling paths for which there are no ImageNet-pretrained parameters available; consequently this would require training from scratch and lead to at least a 10-fold increase in training time and loss of accuracy due to overfitting.\n\n> Figure 1 is impossible to read as the captions are too small.\n\nWe shall improve the captions in the revised paper.\n\n> The representations of figures 2-5 are difficult to interpret.\n\nCould you please be more specific about what could be done to clarify these figures?\n\n> There is no comparison to SOTA\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is almost no previous work in OOD detection on pixel level. Previous work in OOD detection focuses on classification tasks on entire images. We adapt these approaches for dense OOD-detection and show that our approach performs better. Kendall and Gal (2017) model epistemic uncertainty on pixel level, although they do not use it for OOD detection. Our early experiments with this approach resulted in poor OOD detection performance. WildDash is the first semantic segmentation benchmark that introduces OOD images. Most of existing submissions on WildDash come without an accompanying paper, so it is not clear what, if anything, was used for OOD detection.

Therefore, the detection is performed on a pixel basis. The application of the approach is to datasets used for autonomous driving, where semantic segmentation of the view of the road is a typical application. Since in a road view there will be pixels that are projections of objects that are likely not in the set of classes known by the semantic segmentation algorithm, it makes sense to flag them as being out of distribution (OOD), or not known, or to assign to them a low confidence level. The proposed approach is trivial: train a binary classifier that distinguishes image patches from a known set of classes from image patches coming from an unknown (background class). The classifier output applied at every pixel will give the confidence value. While there are different dataset options to represent the known classes, the background class is represented by images from ILSVRC. The results show that for the segmentation application the approach works better than using an adaptation of more elaborate out-of-distribution methods.\n\nQuality and clarity:\nThe paper is well organized and is described very clearly and provides an ok set of results, despite the simplicity of the approach.\n\nOriginality and significance:\nUnfortunately, I do not see any relevant technical novelty, and this is a major issue. Perhaps the only significant conclusion about this paper is that before designing a new OOD detector, if representing the set of \u201cunknown\u201d classes with ILVRC is reasonable, then it makes sense to simply train a binary classifier and see how it works.\n\nBesides the novelty, I disagree with the way the paper has been positioned and motivated. It brings into play epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty concepts to justify (the simplicity of) the approach, and it overlooks a large body of machine learning (novelty detection, one-class classification, \u2026). This is also a major issue.\n\n\nAdditional comments:\n\nOne of the biggest motivations for this work is that other approaches do not distinguish between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty and this is why they do not work. This is regarded as a distinctive advantage of the proposed approach. It is claimed that the proposed formulation is insensitive to any aleatoric uncertainty. On the other hand, the paper is written in a way that ignores a large body of literature that goes under the name of \u201cnovelty detection\u201d, \u201canomaly detection\u201d, \u201cone-class classification\u201d, and related names. So, I am wondering how the approaches just mentioned compare with the proposed method, when epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty become part of the discussion. Isn\u2019t every novelty detector insensitive to aleatoric uncertainty as well? Could the Authors clarify what they claim with that statement, while considering a broader view? \n\nThe paper should relate to the literature mentioned above. In particular, I would point the Authors to a couple of recent works that seem to precisely contradict the premises of the proposed approach, which are given at the beginning of section 3:\n\n- Adversarially Learned One-Class Classifier for Novelty Detection, CVPR 2018\n- Generative Probabilistic Novelty Detection with Adversarial Autoencoders, arXiv, July 2018.\n\n\nAgain, related to novelty detection, it looks like the proposed approach still requires tuning one or more thresholds. Therefore, it would not be that different from tuning the threshold of a novelty detector, or a one-class classifier. It would have strengthened the paper if the approach was compared also to a novelty detector.\n\nIt is not clear if the fully convolutional OOD detector is working on a patch or on the entire image. If it is a patch, of what size?\n\nPage 4, define the \u201cID\u201d acronym. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper675/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Discriminative out-of-distribution detection for semantic segmentation", "abstract": "Most classification and segmentation datasets assume a closed-world scenario in which predictions are expressed as distribution over a predetermined set of visual classes.

Unfortunately, most existing semantic segmentation datasets assume closed-world evaluation which means that they require predictions over a predetermined set of visual classes. This work utilize data from other domain to detect undetermined classes, thus can model uncertainty better in an explicit way. I just have minor comments. \n\n1.

Those classes use to be the same ones for training and testing. However, what happen when during testing time images with classes unseen during training are shown to the model? This article focus in this problem which is not currently taking much attention by the mainstream research community and is of great importance for the real world applications.\n\nThis article tries to detect areas of the image where those out-of-distribution situations appear in semantic segmentation applications. The approach used is by training a classifier that detects which pixels are out of distribution. For training two datasets are used: the dataset of interest and another different one. The classifier learns to detect if a pixel is from the dataset of interest or from another distribution.\n\nThe main problem I found with this article is that I couldn't fully understand it. Maybe because the text needs a bit more of review and improvement or maybe because Im not very familiar with the topic. Moreover the article is 10 pages while it is encouraged to be 8. I find that the method of the paper is quite simple and can be explained more straight forward and in less pages. The related work section overlaps a lot with the intro, I suggest to combine both. First two paragraphs of the method seam that should be in the intro. Model details from the experiments I consider that should be explained in the method. I miss a figure explaining the architecture of the model. Why using the semantic segmentation model proposed and no something standard? For instance Tiramisu (That is also based on dense layers). Note that the method used for semantic segmentation is 10 points lower than the SOTA in Cityscapes. Figure 1 is impossible to read as the captions are too small. The representations of figures 2-5 are difficult to interpret. There is no comparison to SOTA\n\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper675/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Discriminative out-of-distribution detection for semantic segmentation", "abstract": "Most classification and segmentation datasets assume a closed-world scenario in which predictions are expressed as distribution over a predetermined set of visual classes.
