To distinguish stolen models from reference models, the proposed approach generated conferrable adversarial examples, which can only be transferred to the stolen models, but not to the reference models. \n\nPros:\n1. The idea of using adversarial examples to identify stolen models is interesting.\n2. The paper provides comprehensive experiments, including model extraction attacks, adaptive model extraction attacks, etc.  The results outperform popular adversarial attacks, FGM, PGD, and CW attacks. \n\nCons:\n1. The key concern about the paper is the unclear threat model. Why does the model stealing attacker have white-box access to the source model? In general, the white-box access means the attacker has all the information about the source model. The definition of \u201cstrong attacker\u201d is confusing: If the attacker requires access to domain data, then why the attacker is strong? Do attackers have access to the data? It seems the attackers have only the input data but partial label data, which is a strong assumption. Many recent works show that model stealing attacks can surrogate datasets to extract the victim models. Can these attacks be detected by the proposed approach?\n2. The paper is very hard to follow. Many definitions are missing in the paper. \n3. What is Transfer(S, x; t) in Eq (1)? What is Classify(S, x) in Eq (2) and (3)? What is H in Eq (5)?\n4.

A new method is proposed to generate conferrable adversarial examples. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The most impressive thing is the AUC of this method in verifying surrogates.\n\nComments:\n\nI'm not familiar enough with the field to judge the novelty and soundness of the proposed method. But I'm willing to roll with the main idea of the paper. Conferrability is the core contribution of the paper. The existence of the conferrable adversarial examples is shown empirically in the paper. Ensemble adversarial attack CEM is shown effective in the same time.\n\nStrengths:\n\n1.The research on this issue has extremely high application value and practical significance. The problem is very important for providers, especially when they want to protect their intellectual property. \n\n2.This paper is well motivated, and thus it is enjoyable to read.\n\n3.The idea of conferrability is very interesting. The existence of the conferrable adversarial examples is shown empirically to prove the value of this definition.\n\n4.Impressive empirical results. Fingerprint in this paper is the first method that reaches an AUC of 1.0 in verifying surrogates, which is impressive for me. Because I'm not familiar enough with the field, I'm not sure whether the method is SOTA in more benchmarks.\n\n5.Interesting figures make the paper easy to follow. I suggest the authors replace Figure 2(b) with a vetorgram to improve the quality.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1.There are 3 hyperparameters in equation 5, sensitivity analysis may be needed.\n\n2.Is decision threshold sensitive in different datasets? It may affect the practicality of the method.\n\n3.Clarity: What is the meaning of $\\sigma$ in equation (4)? Is it an activation function? More clarification may be needed to make the paper easier to read.\n\n4.What is the meaning of 'unremovable'? Is this a formal term in English (irremovable)?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1415/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1415/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Neural Network Fingerprinting by Conferrable Adversarial Examples", "authorids": ["~Nils_Lukas1", "~Yuxuan_Zhang1", "~Florian_Kerschbaum1"], "authors": ["Nils Lukas", "Yuxuan Zhang", "Florian Kerschbaum"], "keywords": ["Fingerprinting", "Adversarial Examples", "Transferability", "Conferrability"], "abstract": "In Machine Learning as a Service, a provider trains a deep neural network and gives many users access.

The idea itself is interesting enough, the this work presents a neat development toward solving this problem. An important issue with this problem is to distinguish a reference model from a stolen model. Thus a desire property of the fingerprint adversarial example is to mislead all surrogate models but non reference models. Since adversarial examples are typically transferable to reference models, thus it is important to distinguish a fingerprint from a transferable adversarial example. For a long time, researchers do not have an answer to whether this is possible, and this work provides an evidence that it may generate a conferrable but not transferable adversarial example to achieve the goal. \n\nThe idea is pretty simple: we construct a conferrable score function to induce all surrogate models to produce a target label; while all reference models to produce different labels. The experiments show that such an approach can indeed produce some fingerprint adversarial examples to distinguish between reference models and surrogate models to a certain degree. \n\nHaving said this, the results are not perfect. For example, Fig 3(b) shows that FGM and PGD have better detectability AUC when epsilon is larger. Although the results are not perfect, this shows promising initial results toward an interesting research domain.\n\nThe presentation has some issues that can be fixed by revision. The figures are generally too small to read. Authors can increase them by leveraging one more page. Also, it's necessary to include the definition of FTLL, FTAL, RTLL, RTAL in the main text. Again, one more page should be able to fix the issue.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1415/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1415/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Neural Network Fingerprinting by Conferrable Adversarial Examples", "authorids": ["~Nils_Lukas1", "~Yuxuan_Zhang1", "~Florian_Kerschbaum1"], "authors": ["Nils Lukas", "Yuxuan Zhang", "Florian Kerschbaum"], "keywords": ["Fingerprinting", "Adversarial Examples", "Transferability", "Conferrability"], "abstract": "In Machine Learning as a Service, a provider trains a deep neural network and gives many users access. The hosted (source) model is susceptible to model stealing attacks, where an adversary derives a surrogate model from API access to the source model. For post hoc detection of such attacks, the provider needs a robust method to determine whether a suspect model is a surrogate of their model. We propose a fingerprinting method for deep neural network classifiers that extracts a set of inputs from the source model so that only surrogates agree with the source model on the classification of such inputs. These inputs are a subclass of transferable adversarial examples which we call conferrable adversarial examples that exclusively transfer with a target label from a source model to its surrogates. We propose a new method to generate these conferrable adversarial examples. We present an extensive study on the irremovability of our fingerprint against fine-tuning, weight pruning, retraining, retraining with different architectures, three model extraction attacks from related work, transfer learning, adversarial training, and two new adaptive attacks. Our fingerprint is robust against distillation, related model extraction attacks, and even transfer learning when the attacker has no access to the model provider's dataset. Our fingerprint is the first method that reaches a ROC AUC of 1.0 in verifying surrogates, compared to a ROC AUC of 0.63 by previous fingerprints.
