They do pre-train their model (BROS) on a large dataset with 11M documents, and then used such models to perform downstream tasks in four smaller datasets. Their models achieve better quantitative results when compared to the provided baselines.\n\n### Positive aspects \n\n* Positional encoder based on sinusoidal function seems to be effective.\n* Authors perform experimentally sound experiments, following closely LayoutLM.\n* Pre-trained models could be useful.\n* Authors reproduced results from their strongest baseline.\n* Better results in all downstream tasks.\n\n### Cons and aspects to improve\n\nMy main concern is that the overall contribution is seems to be limited.In fact, the original paper of the Transformer approach, already proposed such kind of embedding. It is good to know that it works for 2D-coordinates for the task at hand, though it seems to be more a marginal improvement on existing work rather than a standalone contribution.\n\nIt is hard to tell what are the standalone contributions of the paper, and what is coming from other works.\n\nAuthors could have provided more in-depth details (visualizations, analysis, examples) to show main differences between the proposed approach and baselines (specially LayoutLM). Also they could visually demonstrate the advantages of their approach.\n\nAuthors could have plugged their embedding strategy in LayoutLM to understand the impact of that particular component.\n\nI would like to have seen qualitative examples of model predictions, and more examples from the dataset.\n\nA figure containing the whole process could be helpful to better understand the processing required to train / test such models. Figure from LayoutLM is a good example of that, it comprises the entire process and makes it easier to understand the whole architecture.\n\n* In the abstract, authors say \"BROS utilizes a powerful graph-based decoder that can capture the relation between text segment\"* Though in the text such a component (that is from other work) is only mentioned twice without further detail.\n\nIt is unclear to me:\n\n* How regions of interest are detected in this work? (I assumed authors used the same strategy as LayoutLM).\n* OCR seems to be an extra-step in the preprocessing stage. What to do if the user does not have the same OCR. What is the impact of a good OCR for training and testing (prediction of new, unseen documents)?\n* \"In-house OCR engine was applied\" can authors provide more details on that?\n\nThis line of work could be much stronger if the models comprised the whole process (detection, text extraction, recognition) in an end-to-end manner.\n\n### Notes on text and style\n\nThere are parts of the manuscript that felt somewhat informal and confusing to me. I will provide some details as follows.\n\n* Set a default format for numbers in tables. Table 1 has two distinct decimal number formats.\n* Personally, I think it is better to write $5 \\times 10^{-5}$ rather than 5e-5.\n* In the results section there is a typo: *\"performances with a large margins of 2.32pp in\"*. Also, text could be more formal. I would avoid using the use of the *pp* abbreviation.\n* \"By achieving the best, these results prove that BROS\" this sentence can be improved.\n* \"Moreover, it should be noted that BROS achieves higher f1 score than 79.27 of LayoutLM using visual features\". I think authors wanted to say that even though BROS does not rely on visual features, it does outperform LayoutLM which, in turn, uses visual features. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper607/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper607/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "BROS: A Pre-trained Language Model for Understanding Texts in Document", "authorids": ["~Teakgyu_Hong1", "~DongHyun_Kim3", "~Mingi_Ji1", "~Wonseok_Hwang1", "~Daehyun_Nam2", "~Sungrae_Park1"], "authors": ["Teakgyu Hong", "DongHyun Kim", "Mingi Ji", "Wonseok Hwang", "Daehyun Nam", "Sungrae Park"], "keywords": ["Pre-trained model", "language model", "Document understanding", "Document intelligence", "OCR"], "abstract": "Understanding document from their visual snapshots is an emerging and challenging problem that requires both advanced computer vision and NLP methods.

The followings are additional responses. \n\n> #### **F. Which component contributes the most to BROS\u2019 robustness against permuted order information**\n\nAs we mentioned above, BIO-tagging cannot address document KIE tasks when there is no order information of target key texts. For examples, if the order of the key texts is wrong, BIO formalization cannot find the correctly ordered texts. Here, we provide additional ablation study to describe how the positional embedding and encoding methods contribute to provide the robustness on FUNSD and p-FUNSD under the use of SPADE decoder.\n\n\\# | 2D embedding | 2D encoding  | decoder                | FUNSD | p-FUNSD\n--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nBROS | Sinusoid\\&linear | Untied | SPADE                  | 74.44 | 45.16\n | Look-up table (LayoutLM's) | Untied | SPADE            | 67.99 | 21.10\n | Sinusoid\\&linear | Tied (LayoutLM's) | SPADE           | 42.46 | 38.77\n | Look-up table (LayoutLM's) | Tied (LayoutLM's) | SPADE | 68.08 | 20.84\n\nThere were three interesting observations. First, the combination of Layout's components show the second best on FUNSD but the worst performance on p-FUNSD. It indicates that the combination of LayoutLM's embedding and encoding can be acceptable on KIE tasks with optimal order information but it has a limitation in a realistic scenario. Second, the encoding method is critical on FUNSD and the embedding method is effective on p-FUNSD. Finally, the combination of our embedding and encoding shows the best performance compared to the other combinations. \n\n> #### **G.2. SpanBERT experiments**\n\nAs you suggested, we fine-tuned SpanBERT for our document KIE tasks. Interestingly, SpanBERT shows better performance than BERT. We guess that SpanBERT learns long-term dependencies for text spans, so it extracts key texts and their relationship better. \n\nModel | FUNSD EE | FUNSD EL\n--- | --- | ---\nBERT | 60.26 | 0.98\nSpanBERT | 63.12 | 12.65\nBROS | 81.21 | 66.96"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper607/Authors"], "readers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper607/Authors", "everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper607/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "BROS: A Pre-trained Language Model for Understanding Texts in Document", "authorids": ["~Teakgyu_Hong1", "~DongHyun_Kim3", "~Mingi_Ji1", "~Wonseok_Hwang1", "~Daehyun_Nam2", "~Sungrae_Park1"], "authors": ["Teakgyu Hong", "DongHyun Kim", "Mingi Ji", "Wonseok Hwang", "Daehyun Nam", "Sungrae Park"], "keywords": ["Pre-trained model", "language model", "Document understanding", "Document intelligence", "OCR"], "abstract": "Understanding document from their visual snapshots is an emerging and challenging problem that requires both advanced computer vision and NLP methods.

Pre-training objective for area-masking LM**\n\nWe will add the pre-training objective with a mathematical formula in the paper. Thank you for the comment.\n\n> #### **B. Performance difference between Table 1 and Table 4**\n\nThe performances in Table 1 and Table 4 cannot be simply compared. First, in Table 4, we set the basic setting as BROS and change our proposed modules to the original modules (LayoutLMs') to prove that all components are important to improve performances. Second, in Table 4, the models are trained with a subset of the training dataset (512K documents) to conduct multiple experiments with limited resources. Since pre-training with a large-scale dataset takes time, their large-scale experiment cannot be provided in this discussion period. However, if you want, we are willing to provide the results at the camera-ready version.\n\n> #### **C. Ablation study: gradually adding each new component to the original LayoutLM**\n\nThank you for your constructive suggestion. The following table provides the performances when gradually adding each new component. As can be seen, the performance is also improved gradually. We will add this experiment to the paper.\n\nModel | FUNSD EE | SROIE EE | CORD EE\n--- | --- | --- | --- \nLayoutLM                | 64.54 | 93.47 | 92.81\n+area-masking          | 65.98 | 92.97 | 93.56\n+Untied with token emb | 66.78 | 93.70 | 93.46\n+sinusoid \\& linear    | 73.16 | 93.70 | 94.88\n+SPADE (BROS)          | 74.44 | 93.99 | 95.15\n\nModel (all SPADE) | FUNSD EL     | CORD EL      | SciTSR EL\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nLayoutLM                    | 27.06 | 87.71 | 98.35\n+area-masking              | 28.19 | 88.12 | 98.67\n+Untied with token emb     | 26.95 | 88.03 | 98.65\n+sinusoid \\& linear (BROS) | 40.04 | 91.00 | 99.17\n\n> #### **D. Symmetric design for calculating attention score**\n\nThe motivation of the second term in Eq.(2) is to enable the model to find the target position effectively when the query context and position are given. For example, in the case of Figure 2, the context and position (\"Date\") requests the position of (\"December 9, 1999\"). In our early experiment, the symmetric approach that you mentioned showed performance degradation. In addition, when utilizing SPADE, we observed that the degree of degradation increased. We think that the opposite direction of the conditional attention score might be harmful to identify spatial relationships between text blocks.\n\nModel              | Decoder | FUNSD EE | SROIE EE | CORD EE |\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nBROS (with eq.(2)) | BIO     | 73.16    | 93.70    | 94.88   |\nBROS (symmetric)   | BIO     | 71.58    | 93.78    | 94.01   |\nBROS (with eq.(2)) | SPADE   | 74.44    | 93.99    | 95.15   |\nBROS (symmetric)   | SPADE   | 62.70    | 82.20    | 90.02   |\n\n> #### **E. Design of $t^{\\text{ntc}}$ in Eq.(4)**\n\nThank you for pointing out the description about Eq.(4). As you mentioned, the output of $f_{\\text{ntc}}$ is a distribution over N+1. Here, +1 indicates that the token does not have a next token or the token is not related to any class (similar role with an end-of-sequence [EOS] in NLP). $t^{\\text{ntc}}$ is introduced to identify the un-connected tokens. We found that the description should be improved and we will provide a better description for Eq.(4).\n\n> #### **F. Which strategy contributes the most to BROS\u2019 robustness against permuted order information**\n\nSPADE decoder is the most important factor for permuted datasets because BIO encoding cannot group text blocks without their perfect order information (SPADE decoder is used in Table 2 and 3). To clarify the effectiveness of the proposed components on the permuted dataset, we are implementing additional ablation studies and we will share the results.\n\n> #### **G. Minor concerns**\n\nG1. \"Although SPADE is not the most important component of BROS, I believe including details of the grade-based decoder will help the readers to understand the model much better.\"\n\nThank you for your suggestion. We will provide more details about SPADE decoder. \n\nG2. \"I\u2019m curious about the performance of SpanBERT on the four datasets since the author said that area-masking of BROS is inspired by SpanBERT.\"\n\nThank you for the interesting question. We will conduct the downstream tasks with SpanBERT. \n\nG3. \"In Table 3, the value of LayoutLM - FUNSD should be 78.89 since all other p-FUNSD \\& FUNSD related values are consistent with Table 1 \\& 2.\"\n\nThe score in Table 1 and 3 cannot be related because SPADE decoder is utilized in all experiments in Section 5.3. In the reason, LayoutLM$^{\\dagger}$ shows the same score in Table 2 and 3 but it has different scores in Table 1 (BIO) and 3 (SPADE). We will clarify this difference in the paper."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper607/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper607/Authors"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper607/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "BROS: A Pre-trained Language Model for Understanding Texts in Document", "authorids": ["~Teakgyu_Hong1", "~DongHyun_Kim3", "~Mingi_Ji1", "~Wonseok_Hwang1", "~Daehyun_Nam2", "~Sungrae_Park1"], "authors": ["Teakgyu Hong", "DongHyun Kim", "Mingi Ji", "Wonseok Hwang", "Daehyun Nam", "Sungrae Park"], "keywords": ["Pre-trained model", "language model", "Document understanding", "Document intelligence", "OCR"], "abstract": "Understanding document from their visual snapshots is an emerging and challenging problem that requires both advanced computer vision and NLP methods.

We found that your concerns lied on the area-masking strategy and the graph decoder. However, we argue that our masking strategy is distinct from the previous approach as well as that the graph decoder is necessary for a real scenario. The followings provide detailed discussions about your concerns.\n\n> #### **A. More description about the area-masking strategies**\n\nTo make an area hide text span (n-gram) in 2D space, the area should be related to the text sizes and locations in a document. Our approach expands an area of a randomly selected text block with an exponential distribution. After an area is identified, all text blocks are evaluated whether their centers are allocated in the area or not, then all tokens in the allocated blocks are masked. Such masking process is repeatedly conducted until the number of masked tokens reaches to 15\\% of the total. As you mentioned, we found that the description of Figure 1 should be improved and we will add more descriptions in the paper.\n\n> #### **B. Marginal performance gain from the area-masking strategy**\n\nAs you mentioned, the improvement from the area masking might look marginal in the small FUNSD dataset. When we conducted the ablation study on other datasets, we observed consistent improvements over all EE downstream tasks. See the following table.\n\nMLM | FUNSD EE | SROIE EE | CORD EE |\n--- | --- | --- | --- |\nRandom tokens | 73.85 (0.40) | 93.07 (0.52) | 94.89 (0.24) |\nRandom areas   | 74.44 (0.36) | 93.99 (0.43) | 95.15 (0.22) |\n\n(Numbers: average and standard deviation of five F1 scores)\n\n> #### **C. Comparison between sinusoid \\& linear and learnable embeddings for representing 2D positions**\n\nEmbedding | FUNSD EE | \n--- | --- |\nLook-up table | 78.81 | \nSinusoid \\& linear | 79.63 |\n\nYour concern was that the comparison of the embedding methods was conducted with the models pre-trained only with 512K data. \nWe agreed with your concern, so we conducted a comparison on the cases with 11M data (11M, 1 epoch). \nThe results show that our embedding is efficient as well as effective when compared to LayoutLMs'. We will provide more comparisons on other downstream tasks.\n\n> #### **D. Difficulty on serializing OCR blocks**\n\nWe don't agree with your opinion: \"as most commercial OCR tools have already got very good reading order information, the benefit from the graph decoder might be marginal.\". First, serializing text blocks is emerging research problem (Li et al., 2020). Second, the most commercial OCR tools might look good but they fail to organize a layout document in a reading order (See Appendix B). Finally, EL tasks from FUNSD, CORD, and SciTSR require the graph decoder because BIO tagging approach cannot address the problem. It should be noted that the graph decoder is applied to all models including LayoutLM for EL tasks. \n\nIn addition, even though holding perfect serialization information, the graph decoder shows consistent improvement from the BIO tagger. See the following table.\n\nDecoder | FUNSD EE | SROIE EE | CORD EE | \n---| --- | --- | --- |\nBIO tagger | 73.16 | 93.70 | 94.88 | \nSPADE decoder| 74.44 | 93.99 | 95.15 | \n\nWe will add this table and analysis on the paper. It will be constructive to discuss this issue more if we misunderstood your opinion.\n\n*Li et al., An End-to-End OCR Text Re-organization Sequence Learning for Rich-text Detail Image Comprehension, ECCV-20.*\n\n> #### **E. Difference from SPADE**\n\nAs you mentioned, proposing SPADE decoder is not our contribution so we have not argued that in our paper. SPADE (Hwang et al., 2020) is a transformer-based model including a graph-based decoder. Although the graph-based formalism requires spatial relationships between text blocks, they suffered from learning them only with small datasets (downstream datasets in our paper). To compensate for the issue, BROS learns spatial encoding with large-scale data and fine-tunes that to support the SPADE decoder. Our paper proved that the SPADE decoder with BROS was suitable for document KIE tasks rather than argued that SPADE itself was our main contribution. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper607/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper607/Authors"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper607/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "BROS: A Pre-trained Language Model for Understanding Texts in Document", "authorids": ["~Teakgyu_Hong1", "~DongHyun_Kim3", "~Mingi_Ji1", "~Wonseok_Hwang1", "~Daehyun_Nam2", "~Sungrae_Park1"], "authors": ["Teakgyu Hong", "DongHyun Kim", "Mingi Ji", "Wonseok Hwang", "Daehyun Nam", "Sungrae Park"], "keywords": ["Pre-trained model", "language model", "Document understanding", "Document intelligence", "OCR"], "abstract": "Understanding document from their visual snapshots is an emerging and challenging problem that requires both advanced computer vision and NLP methods.

Followings are discussions about your major and minor concerns.\n\n > #### **A. Not a standalone contribution**\n\nBROS tackles document KIE tasks by addressing current limitations on multiple components. They are standalone contributions: (1) area-masking for learning text spans on 2D space, (2) positional embedding and encoding that have not been applied for 2D language models, (3) the combination between pre-trained model and SPADE decoder for document KIE tasks, and (4) evaluation on realistic scenarios without perfect serialization. Following the \"No Free Lunch Rule\", each function and metric might not be new but it should be introduced in this research area. In fact, several pre-trained language models such as BERT, RoBERTa, SpanBERT, StructBERT contribute to the NLP field by optimizing or improving the learning process without any architectural changes. As like them, this paper also contributes document intelligence by providing a pre-trained 2D language model improved from LayoutLM in multiple aspects.\n\n > #### **B. Ablation study based on LayoutLM**\n\nModel| FUNSD EE F1\n--- | --- \nLayoutLM | 64.54\n(with our learning strategy)| 65.98\n(with our position embedding)| 49.42\n(with our position encoding)  | 66.03\n(with our position embedding \\& encoding) | 72.48\n(with our decoder) | 65.91\n\nThank you for your constructive suggestion. As you requested, we provide experiment results by plugging the proposed modules into LayoutLM. When changing the original module to ours, the performances are solely increased except for the case of the positional embedding (sinusoid \\& linear). Interestingly, when combining our positional embedding and encoding (untied), the performance is dramatically increased. This result shows the benefits of using our proposed embedding and encoding methods together. We will add this ablation study in the paper.\n\n > #### **C. More examples from the dataset**\n\nWe will add more examples of the datasets and figures comparing the results of LayoutLM and BROS. \n\n > #### **D. Model overview figure**\n\nWe will add the overview figure of BROS for a better description.\n\n > #### **E. Questions**\n\nQ1) How regions of interest are detected in this work? (I assumed authors used the same strategy as LayoutLM).\n\nWe guess that the region of interest will be red boxes in Figure 1(b). Our approach randomly selects a text block and expands the text region with exponential distribution. The intuition behind this approach is that area covering text spans on 2D space should be related to the size and location of the texts. \n\nQ2) OCR seems to be an extra-step in the preprocessing stage. What to do if the user does not have the same OCR. What is the impact of a good OCR for training and testing (prediction of new, unseen documents)?\n\nWe provide two answers: for pre-training and downstream tasks. If we didn't figure out your question, please reply to discuss this correctly.\n\n* Pre-training) As you recognized, IIT-CDIP (11M) is pre-processed and we pre-trained LayoutLM$^{\\dagger}$ and BROS on the same dataset. Interestingly, LayoutLM$^{\\dagger}$ performs similarly with the original LayoutLM pre-trained on their OCR results in multiple settings (See Appendix A.1). In other words, two advanced OCR engines reach similar results when applied to the dataset for pre-training. It is over-burden to prove the effect of OCR engines, but the recent OCR engines will be promising for pre-training 2D language models. \n\n* Downstream) To train and evaluate downstream tasks with their ground truth annotation, we utilize the provided OCR results without applying other OCR engines. However, the labels of downstream tasks are tied with provided text blocks and the labels cannot be defined on the other OCR results. \n\nQ3) \"In-house OCR engine was applied\" can authors provide more details on that?\n\nThe OCR engine consists of a CRAFT detector (Baek et al., 2019) and an ASTER recognizer (Shi et al., 2018). To keep anonymity, it is hard to describe more details but we will provide the API information that we used after the discussion period ends. \n\n*Baek et al., Character Region Awareness for Text Detection, CVPR-19.*\n*Shi et al., ASTER: An Attentional Scene Text Recognizer with Flexible Rectification, TPAMI-18.*"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper607/Authors"], "readers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper607/Authors", "everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper607/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "BROS: A Pre-trained Language Model for Understanding Texts in Document", "authorids": ["~Teakgyu_Hong1", "~DongHyun_Kim3", "~Mingi_Ji1", "~Wonseok_Hwang1", "~Daehyun_Nam2", "~Sungrae_Park1"], "authors": ["Teakgyu Hong", "DongHyun Kim", "Mingi Ji", "Wonseok Hwang", "Daehyun Nam", "Sungrae Park"], "keywords": ["Pre-trained model", "language model", "Document understanding", "Document intelligence", "OCR"], "abstract": "Understanding document from their visual snapshots is an emerging and challenging problem that requires both advanced computer vision and NLP methods.

We will add this analysis in this discussion period.    \n\n> #### **B. More description about Figure 1(b)**\n\nWe found that the description of Figure 1 should be improved. In the figure, red boxes indicate random selections of text blocks/tokens and the black boxes represent the masked tokens. Although there can be multiple tokens in a single text block, the token masking (Figure 1.a) flats all tokens of a document, selects a token randomly (red), and masks it directly (black). In contrast, the area masking (Figure 1.b) selects a text block, identifies an area by expanding the block area with an exponential distribution (red), masks tokens in all text blocks of which center is aligned in the identified area (black). Thanks to this comment, we will improve the figure description.

It proposes a new pre-training strategy called BERT relying on Spatiality (BROS) with area-masking and utilizes a graph-based decoder to capture the semantic relation between text blocks to alleviate the serialization problem of LayoutLM. \n\nIt points out that LayoutLM fails to fully utilize spatial information of text blocks and will face difficulties when text blocks cannot be easily serialized.  \n\nThe three drawbacks of LayoutLM are listed:\n* X-axis and Y-axis are treated individually with point-specific embedding\n* Pre-training is identical to BERT so does not consider spatial relations between text blocks\n* Suffer from the serialization problem\n\nThe proposed three corresponding methods of BROS are:\n* Continuous 2D positional encoding \n* Area-masking pre-training on 2D language modeling\n* Graph-based decoder for solving EE & EL tasks\n\n> Strength:\n\n* The paper makes incremental advances over past work (LayoutLM) and the proposed BROS models achieves SOTA performance on four EE/EL datasets (i.e., FUNSD, SORIE*, CORD, and SciTSR)\n\n* The paper is generally easy to follow and could be better if provide more important details in Section 3.2 & 3.3\n\n* The experiment and discussion for Section 5.3 are quite convincing. BROS could achieve robust and consistent performances across all the four permuted version datasets, which demonstrates that BROS is adaptive to documents from the practical scenarios. \n\n> Major concerns:\n\n- For Section 3.2, the author didn\u2019t even provide the pre-training objective for the area-masked language model. I think the author should include the objective and define the exponential distribution explicitly.\n\n* I\u2019m confused about why the performance difference in Table 4 between original LayoutLM and BROS is larger than that in Table 1. In the original LayoutLM, the 2D position encoding method is tied with token embedding. This applies to both Table 1 and Table 4. However, in Table 4 the performance difference on FUNSD EE is 42.46 vs 74.44, while in Table 1 the performance comparison is 78.89 vs 81.21. Could the author give some explanations on this?\n\n- In Table 4, it is better for the author to clearly indicate each ablation\u2019s components. The author should also give the performance of the original LayoutLM and performances after gradually adding each new component to the original LayoutLM: such as original LayoutLM + Sinusoid & Linear, original LayoutLM + Sinusoid & Linear + untied with token embedding, etc.\n\n* For encoder design in Eq. (2), the second term is used to model the spatial dependency given the source semantic representation.  How about adding a symmetric term to model the semantic dependency given the source spatial representation. My question is simply that why not adopt a symmetric design for Eq. (2)?\n\n* Can the author give the reason behind the design of $\\mathbf{t}^{ntc}$ in Eq.(4)? I\u2019m not so clear about the function of $\\mathbf{t}^{ntc}$.  Does the $\\mathbf{f}_{ntc}$ output a distribution of the probability to be the next token over all N tokens? \n\n* Could the author give a detailed analysis on which strategy contributes the most to BROS\u2019 robustness against permuted order information? From the results of Table 4, it is not the SPADE decoder and the most important factor seems to be calculating semantic and position attentions separately, i.e., untied with token embedding and explicitly modeling semantic/position relations between text blocks. Do the authors agree with my conjecture?\n\n> Minor concerns:\n\n* Although SPADE is not the most important component of BROS, I believe including details of the grade-based decoder will help the readers to understand the model much better.\n\n* I\u2019m curious about the performance of SpanBERT on the four datasets since the author said that area-masking of BROS is inspired by SpanBERT.\n\n* In Table 3, the value of LayoutLM - FUNSD should be 78.89 since all other p-FUNSD & FUNSD related values are consistent with Table 1 & 2.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper607/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper607/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "BROS: A Pre-trained Language Model for Understanding Texts in Document", "authorids": ["~Teakgyu_Hong1", "~DongHyun_Kim3", "~Mingi_Ji1", "~Wonseok_Hwang1", "~Daehyun_Nam2", "~Sungrae_Park1"], "authors": ["Teakgyu Hong", "DongHyun Kim", "Mingi Ji", "Wonseok Hwang", "Daehyun Nam", "Sungrae Park"], "keywords": ["Pre-trained model", "language model", "Document understanding", "Document intelligence", "OCR"], "abstract": "Understanding document from their visual snapshots is an emerging and challenging problem that requires both advanced computer vision and NLP methods.
