The core contribution in this paper is the \u201cSTAM\u201d aggregation rule which is to set the combination coefficient to $1/\\sqrt{C}$ for a network with $C$ branches. This aggregation rule is justified by (1) theoretical analysis on the function values and gradient norms at initialization, and (2) experiments on residual networks and transformers showing that this rule performs better than the baseline rules (such as sum or average).\n\n[Pros]\n\n--- The problem this paper focuses on (multi-branch architectures) is important and I think worth more studies since they are used more widely these days. From a theoretical perspective, the number of branches seems like a similar thing as the width of a network, yet the understanding is not yet as comprehensive as our understanding on the width (for which we know things like what are their effects, how should we initialize a wide network, etc).\n\n--- The experimental results are interesting and could be a good reference point for designing these multi-branch architectures. Specifically, it is interesting to see it is better to explicitly do a fixed $1/\\sqrt{C}$ scaling, rather than making it trainable or embedding it into the individual linear layers in each block. \n\n--- The paper is generally clearly written and easy to follow. The notation between the theory and empirical parts matched quite well.\n\n[Cons]\n\n--- I feel like the core contribution of the $1/\\sqrt{C}$ scaling rule is rather straightforward and not necessarily justified as a new method or theory, especially with the analogy to width in mind: It is standard to initialize weight matrices to have scale $1/\\sqrt{d}$ where $d$ is the either the input or output dimension as this gives the right normalization. Even with the other \u201cbaselines\u201d (making the $1/\\sqrt{C}$ trainable or embedding it into the individual blocks) performing worse according to this paper, I still feel like a researcher or practitioner who encounters the issue of choosing the aggregation rule could still end up with the same solution proposed in this paper. \n\n--- The theoretical results also build on the exact same normalization idea ($1/\\sqrt{C}$ scaling gives the right normalization) as for width, and do not seem to provide us with much new theoretical understandings for what is unique about the multi-branch architecture. From my (maybe biased) perspective, I would have been more interested in some more in-depth understandings (either theoretical or empirical), such as what is the effect of adding more branches (and where does diminishing return kick in). Reading this paper leaves me more questions than answers about these multi-branch networks.\n\n------\nAfter rebuttal: Thank the authors for the response.

It analyzes the feedforward/backward dynamics of multi-branch networks, proposes an aggregation design named STAM, and shows the feedforward/backward dynamics of multi-head attention layers, and discusses some of its properties.\n\nHere are some issues that might need the authors\u2019 attention.\n\n1. In the introduction, the paper states that simply adding branches multiple times does not often work as expected. I am aware that there are experimental results in the later sections that support this argument. But putting it in the introduction without any concrete examples might be confusing.\n\n2. I think it would also be helpful if there are some brief descriptions of what the proposed STAM does and how it improves over other designs in the introduction.\n\n3. The paper seems to lack a strong main theme and all the contributions and results are loosely connected.\n\n4. The theoretical results are mostly based on the assumption that the weights are randomly initialized. However, the distributions and the properties of the weights might be different after the training begins. Does this imply that the significance of some of the results is limited?\n\n5. The stability analysis is mostly done on norm analysis. The proposed STAM is also inspired by the norm analysis where the goal is to keep the norm of activations and gradients within a reasonable range. However, it seems to me that the theoretical results are a little bit weak: it\u2019s not hard to imagine that the relationship between norms of activations/gradients and the norm of $\\alpha$ is somewhat linear, and sum/mean becomes improper when the number of branches grows.\n\n6. Missing words in paragraph 5 of section 3.2: \u2026 as the number of branches (see Section 5.2).\n\n7. The aggregation form that the paper has studied is the weighted sum of multiple branches. The paper claims that concatenation is equivalent to sum aggregation for ResNeXt. I\u2019m not fully convinced that this is true considering it\u2019s impractical for a sum aggregation to perform matrix multiplication, batch normalization, and optional ReLU. And I don\u2019t see an easy way to absorb the last 1x1 conv+bn into the branches while satisfying the assumptions of the theoretical results, plus bn will also cancel the effect of $\\alpha$ if my understanding is correct.\n\n8. ResNeXt uses the batch normalization layers, which automatically adjust $\\alpha$. How is this related to the proposed STAM? Do they serve similar purposes?\n\nSummary:\nThe paper presents some interesting findings. However, it seems lacking a strong main theme and the novelty/significance of the theoretical results is not strong, either. The proposed STAM only provides incremental design changes to the networks.\n\nUpdates:\nThanks for the authors' response and the revisions. However, the paper still lacks strong and significant results. Therefore, I keep my previous rating. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1724/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1724/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On the Stability of Multi-branch Network", "authorids": ["~Huishuai_Zhang3", "~Da_Yu1", "~Wei_Chen1", "~Tie-Yan_Liu1"], "authors": ["Huishuai Zhang", "Da Yu", "Wei Chen", "Tie-Yan Liu"], "keywords": ["stability", "multi-branch network", "backward propagation"], "abstract": "Multi-branch architectures are widely used  in state-of-the-art neural networks.

Here are 1-1 responses to the reviewer's questions.\n\n1. Lack of comparison with FixUp and Re-Zero.\n\n Re: Fixup and ReZero are for residual network with large depths, while we study the multi-branch structure. Although the scaling factor are at the same position if using residual structure, we are targeting different problems.  \n\n 1) Fixup scales down the initialization to train deep ResNet without BN. We have discussed the initialization approach for stabilizing multi-branch network in Section 3.2. We argued that scaling down initialization can have similar effect of stabilization as  STAM  theoretically and proposed a new initialization scaling factor based on backward stability. 2) ReZero introduces a learnable $\\alpha$ on the  output of residual block. The experiments in ReZero focus on the fast training but do demonstrate test/valid improvement over baselines.\n\n2. Report BLEU on baseline setting + STAM in Table 2&3. It gives me the impression that the authors try to hide the fact that the proposed method does not do well in this setting and they have to tune the model structure and training settings to find some cases that the proposed method works.\n\n Re: We are not hiding anything. For baseline settings, they are stable itself by initialization and the hyperparameter setting.  We do not use extra $\\alpha$, or equivalently $\\alpha=1$. \n\n In the experiments,  we use fixed $\\alpha$ and do not tune this value because we are not trying to find the best model structure and tune the hyperparameters. Instead, we want to show the effect of adding more branches and how the STAM aggregation can mitigate the issue of instability and fully train the network to its potential as the number of branches becomes large.\n\n3. In Table 3, the baseline (Ott et al., 2018) is trained for about 43 epochs. In my experience, it starts to overfit after that....\n\n Re: Thanks for the insightful comments. As using more branches, we indeed observed overfitting and introduced the head-level dropout to effectively reduce the validation loss. This is something trick to battle over the overfitting, and is not that relevant to our theme \"stability of multi-branch network\". We will make this clear in the revision.\n\n4. The author set $\\alpha$ for Transformers and  for ResNeXt and just provide some very hand waiving explanation, which gives an impression that the theory doesn't work and all we need is to tune a hyperparameter .\n\n Re: The theory is based on that each branch can stably forward/backward propagate itself. The experiment settings are consistent with the theory. For the ResNeXt, the  number of branches is the same as original ResNeXt. We use $\\alpha=1/\\sqrt{C}$ to aggregate in our ResNeXt. \n\n For Transformers, the original structure is stable because of initialization and the hyperparameter setting. We use a corresponding mini-version as one branch. We set the $\\alpha$ accordingly. In the original submission, we use $C$ to denote the number of heads, which arouses confusions. In the revision, we clarify this by using $h$ to denote heads and use $C$ to denote the effective number of branches. Moreover, in the experiments, we want to demonstrate that the scaling factor $\\alpha$ should  be inversely proportional with the root of the number of branches, which aligns with the theoretical claim, rather than some exact value $1/\\sqrt{C}$. We set $\\alpha=1/\\sqrt{C}$ for simplicity.\n\n5. On page 6, \"We give an upper bound on the forward process when the softmax behaves more like a \u201cmax\u201d operator, which is usually the case after initial training.\" This is a false claim.\n\n Re: Thank you for pointing out this. The statement is a relative description compared to the initialization. However, we agree with reviewer's concern and modify the draft.\n\n6. The claim in Appendix C.3 makes the authors' definition of  very arbitrary...\n\n Re: We thank the reviewer for pointing out this. We admit that the definition of branch need to be clarified. From the theory, a branch itself should be a stable forward/backward stability for a constant lr optimizer. For a 2 layer FFN with $d_{fc}=4d$ and a fixed $d$, we can view it as either one branch or four branches. The view needs to change when the intermediate dimension goes extremely wider, e.g. from 4 to 1000, 10000, 100000. The reviewer may not agree with this because such setting is not used in practice.

The authors provide some theoretical insights to back up the method. However, the experiments are not very convincing. I had a good impression of this paper when I read the method sections but until the experiment sections. There are many problems in the experimental setup that makes me hesitate to accept this paper. The authors have a very unclear definition of the number of branches which gives me the impression that the authors just introduce a hyperparameter $\\alpha = 1/\\sqrt{C}$ and they can pick whatever $\\alpha$ or $C$ they want in the experiments tailored for the story.\n\n##### Strength\n- The arguments and theory in sections 3 & 4 are sound and interesting.\n- The proposed method is quite simple.\n- The proposed method leads to improvements on CIFAR 10 & 100.\n- By tuning the model architecture with the proposed method, the authors also show improvements on IWSLT 14 & nestest2014.\n\n\n##### Weaknesses\n\n- This paper is lack of comparisons with a series of related works that sets the outputs of residual branches to zeros such as FixUp (Zhang et al., 2019) and Re-Zero (Bachlechner et al., 2020).\n- It is very suspicious that the authors do not report the BLEU (+STAM) of the first row in Tables 2 & 3. It gives me the impression that the authors try to hide the fact that the proposed method does not do well in this setting and they have to tune the model structure and training settings to find some cases that the proposed method works.\n- In Table 3, the baseline (Ott et al., 2018) is trained for about 43 epochs. In my experience, it starts to overfit after that. However, the authors train all their models for 150 epochs. Otherwise, it is possible that the Transformers without STAM BLEU converge faster and overfit at epoch 150, which makes them look worse than the ones with STAM. Based on Appendix D, the authors also use a new technique head-level dropout which was not used by Ott et al., 2018. I would like to see the authors use the same setting as the baseline or report curve of BLEU scores at different epochs to convince me that this is not the case.\n- The author set $\\alpha = 1/\\sqrt{C/8}$ for Transformers and $\\alpha = 1/\\sqrt{C/4}$ for ResNeXt and just provide some very hand waiving explanation, which gives an impression that the theory doesn't work and all we need is to tune a hyperparameter $\\alpha$.\n- On page 6, \"We give an upper bound on the forward process when the softmax behaves more like a \u201cmax\u201d operator, which is usually the case after initial training.\" This is a false claim. It is more often that the attentions assign large weights to multiple positions. Making the attention sparse usually restricts the models and leads to worse results.\n- The claim in Appendix C.3 makes the authors' definition of $C$ very arbitrary. The author claim that the 2-layer FFN with $d_{fc} = 4d$ in a Transformer-big has 4 branches. I don't see why there is a reason that this should view as having four branches. This should be considered as having only one branch only. Otherwise, since it has only 2 layers, we can view each hidden neuron in the middle layer as one branch. The authors just take their advantage to group ever $d$ neurons as one branch, but some other people can also group them in any other ways and say there are $C$ branches take doing them arbitrarily. For example, I can group ever 4 neurons as one branch and say this FFN has $d$ branches, or even group the first $2d$ dimensions as one branch and the rest of the neurons as $2d$ branches and say this FFN has $2d + 1$ branch. Overall, this makes me feel that the authors are playing a game of definitions and choosing whatever $C$ or $\\alpha$ as they want.\n\n\n##### Questions & Suggestions\n- How does STAM work when applied to depthwise separable convolution in MobileNets and EfficientNets which can be viewed as an extreme case of multi-branch convolution.\n- It would be more exciting to see if this method can be applied to the field of neural architecture search (NAS) where people explicitly train a gigantic multi-branch network and has problems with having some branches undertrained.\n\n##### References\n- Zhang, Hongyi, Yann N.
