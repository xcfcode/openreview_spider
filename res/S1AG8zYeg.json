(2015)\n\nWhile our work is built upon Vinyals et al. (2015), we would like to point out the following key differences in our model:\n \n- Their intention was to show that the input, output orderings can matter in set/sequence mapping tasks, which they demonstrate using small scale experiments. In contrast, we build on these ideas to address the challenging problem of modeling logical and hierarchical structure in text.\n\n- Different from the original method, the following two techniques proved to be beneficial in the sentence representation learning experiment, which yielded an improvement of 25% (Pearson score) in the semantic relatedness task. These ideas are also more generally applicable within the set to sequence framework beyond our task domain.\n\n1. In addition to the sentences in the current paragraph, we also added contrastive sentences (i.e., sentences from other paragraphs) to the memory in the decoder. This forces the model to not only identify the correct sentence from the current paragraph, but also to distinguish and ignore sentences that are irrelevant to the context. \n\n2. We observed that the bilinear scoring function (eqn 10) produces much better representations compared to the MLP scoring function (eqn 9) that was suggested in Vinyals et al. (2015). We hypothesize that this difference in performance is due to the generative vs discriminative approach in predicting the next sentence as we discuss in section 3.1.\n\nWe have revised the paper to include an ablative study of the contributions of the above techniques. Please see section C.3 of the supplementary material.\n\n\nR1: Significance of the sentence ordering problem\n\nWe emphasize the importance of the sentence ordering problem below.\n\n- A sentence ordering component is essential in tasks that involve presenting a coherent summary of facts. In applications such as extractive multi-document summarization and retrieval-based question answering, sentences are fetched from multiple sources and an ordering component becomes necessary to coherently organize these sentences [1,2]. Our proposed method can be used for such applications, which will be interesting future work.\n\n- Perhaps more importantly, by learning to perform sentence ordering we are able to model text coherence. Automatic methods for evaluating human/machine generated text have great importance. Concrete applications include Automated essay scoring [3] and Text generation [4,5]. Discourse structure and coherence quality are key dimensions along which essays are scored in the ETS TOEFL and GRE analytical writing tasks [6]. A text generation system has to pay attention to choices such as presentation order of facts, order of entities in a clause, number of possibilities for pronoun resolution, etc. that influence coherence [7]. A model of coherence aids the better design of these systems.\n\n- Context prediction approaches have shown to yield useful representations for words and sentences in prior work. In this context, we demonstrate that the objective of the ordering task also helps learn useful sentence representations with cheaper computational cost compared to recent methods. \n\n\nR2: Questions regarding technical details\n\nPlease find below the responses to your questions about the technical details.\n\n- c and h are the usual cell state and hidden state (also called cell output) of an LSTM cell. Please refer to part D of the supplementary material for the exact equations. Intuitively, the cell state captures history information and the cell output extracts information from the cell state that is useful for (predicting) the output for the current time step.\n\n- W is a matrix of weights. As we discuss in the paper the first scoring function is a single hidden layer feed-forward net that takes s, h as inputs. This has the parametric form (omitting bias terms): f(s,h) = W\u2019tanh(W [s; h])). Assuming the dimensionality of s, h to be D and hidden layer size to be H, the weight matrix W has size Hx2D and W\u2019 has size 1xH. In the bilinear scoring function W would be a DxD matrix.\nIf you could let us know what other notations you found confusing, we would be happy to clarify.\n\n- The hidden state of the decoder is initialized with the final hidden state of the encoder as we describe in page 5 (second line). This is similar to how sequence to sequence models operate.\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Christensen, J., Mausam, S. S., Soderland, S., & Etzioni, O. (2013). Towards Coherent Multi-Document Summarization.

This model is presented as an encoder-decoder, and uses recent development for neural network (pointer networks and order invariant RNNs).\n\nThe first processing step of the model is to encode each sentence using a word level LSTM recurrent network. An order invariant encoder (based on Vinyals et al. (2015)) is then used to obtain a representation of the set of sentences. The input at each time step of this encoder is a \"bag-of-sentences\", over which attention probabilities are computed. The last hidden representation of the encoder is then used to initialize the decoder. This decoder is a pointer network, and is used to predict the order of the input sentences.\n\nThe model introduced in this paper is then compared to standard method for sentence ordering, as well as a model with the decoder only. The encoder-decoder approach outperforms the other methods on the task of ordering a given set of sentences. The authors also show that the model learns relatively good sentence representations (e.g. compared to Skip-thought vectors).\n\nThis paper is relatively well written, and easy to follow. The model described in the paper does not really introduce anything new, but is a natural combination of existing techniques to solve the task of sentence ordering. In particular, it uses an order-invariant encoder to get a representation of the set of sentences, and a pointer network to predict the ordering. While I am not entirely convinced by the task of sentence ordering, this approach seems promising to learn sentence representations.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty solid and well executed paper.\n\npros:\n - sound model for sentence ordering\n - strong experimental results\ncons:\n - might be a bit incremental\n - usefulness of sentence ordering", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Sentence Ordering using Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "Modeling the structure of coherent texts is a task of great importance in NLP.

I don\u2019t see how we can merge the encoder and decoder in this manner. h_{t, dec} represents the state in the decoder where the previous (t-1) tokens have been received as input and the t th token is to be predicted. But in the encoder h_{t, enc} does not have such an interpretation. Furthermore, the number of read cycles in the encoder is a constant and does not depend on the document length. Perhaps I did not understand your suggestion. It would be helpful if you could elaborate a bit more. \n\nFor the order discrimination and sentence ordering experiments the single hidden layer feed-forward net was used. For the experiments in section 4.4 the bilinear function was used. The bilinear function produced much better semantic representations of sentences, as measured by the performance in the sentence similarity and paraphrase detection tasks. As we discuss in section 3.1, this difference arises from the discriminative and generative approaches in predicting the next sentence.\n\nNo, the RNN Decoder corresponds to the setting where the sentence encoder + decoder are trained from scratch. We apologize for the confusion. We identified a bug in the decoding procedure for the RNN Decoder and updated the performance numbers for this model. The new result invalidates our previous conclusion that the difference comes from better sentence representations as the model performance is much better now.
