We have just noticed that the reviewer's comment is slightly different now than what we received by email (we suspect there was an edit for which we did not get a notification from openreview). This concerns the sentence \"Should the data-generating distribution add an edge which is missing in  with probability $\\delta$ to $\\widehat{\\mathcal{G}}$?\" which we did not see originally in the email.\n\nThat would be a different setting in which one would also perform \"filtration\" of the knowledge graph rather than just \"completion\" (we were also hinting at this in the previous response but now we wanted to be more explicit seeing the sentence that we originally had not seen). One could modify our analysis to accomodate for such noise as well (we explain how below) but that would again be something slightly different than what is really measured when people evaluate KG embedding methods in the literature on the KG \"completion\" task (because there is usually no other way to evaluate which triples included in the training KG are wrong than by laborious human anotation). \n\nHowever, please notice that you could first have a ground-truth-0 graph $\\mathcal{G}_0$ then add the noise (triples that are not in the original $\\mathcal{G}_0$) and then call the new graph $\\mathcal{G}^*$ \"ground truth KG\". You can then still apply our analysis to the ground truth KG with triples missing completely at random and everything will work correctly as in our paper. We will just not be recovering $\\mathcal{G}_0$ but $\\mathcal{G}^*$ - after all KG completion is usually about adding triples.\n\nNow, how one could extend our results to KG-completion+filtration. Most of our analysis would carry on unchanged. One critical step is in the application of McDiarmid inequality. If we assumed that every triple can be added with some small probability, we would not be able to get the sparsity term in the resulting bounds for the expected number of errors. This problem can be solved by a simple modification of the noise model: sample M triples with replacement ($M \\approx \\delta' |\\mathcal{O}|^2 |\\mathcal{R}|$) from the complement of the knowledge graph and add them to $\\mathcal{G}$ (instead of adding each possible triple independently with probability $\\delta'$). For practical purposes these two settings are very similar, but this one is a bit easier to analyze. Another place where our analysis would need to be changed is the derivation of the bound depending on the KL-divergence. There we would have to replace at some places $P[B_i = 1] = 0$ by $P[B_i = 1] = \\delta'$, but the rest of the analysis should not change much.\n\nWe were trying to keep as close to the settings reported in the practical papers as possible which is why we did not consider KG \"filtration\"."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1335/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1335/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["kuzelo1@gmail.com", "yuyiwang920@gmail.com"], "title": "Knowledge Graph Embedding: A Probabilistic Perspective and Generalization Bounds", "authors": ["Ondrej Kuzelka", "Yuyi Wang"], "pdf": "/pdf/db7d5734c57a9740dc8c6e081af94c02f451d5c6.pdf", "TL;DR": "We prove bounds on expected error of knowledge graph embedding methods from certain class and under certain assumptions.", "abstract": "We study theoretical properties of embedding methods for knowledge graph completion under the missing completely at random assumption.

The footnote 2 in the original version of the paper referred to the more general case in which noisy triples could be added by the data-generating process as well and the task would be to still recover the original KG. It does not mean that we assume a perfect knowledge graph as input, only that we consider the task usually considered in the literature and that is knowledge graph \"completion\" (that is also what the evaluation protocols in the respective practical papers measure). It would certainly be interesting to consider the problem of knowledge graph \"filtration\" in which the task would be to also remove triples that do not belong to the knowledge graph, but that is something that would need some input from the practical/experimental side as well. \n\n\n> Minor comments\n\nWe will update these minor issues in the revision shortly before the deadline (in case there is more feedback we want to update the revision once).

Since these methods also maximize  log-likelihood which corresponds to minimizing the discrepancy (KL-divergence) of the data-generating and the modelled distribution, we need to bound the error in terms of these (else our analysis would not apply). Besides, it is normal in machine learning to use different losses than the 0-1 loss for computational complexity reasons.\n\n>\t- The small terms in the upper bound (i.e., first and second terms) depend on the \n> number of objects  and not on relations . Since the role of  and  is symmetric \n> mathematically (if I understand correctly), I feel it is weird that the additional terms do not \n> necessarily go to zero when . I particular, I expected that the additonal small terms \n> depend solely on .\n\nThis is an interesting observation. The answer is going to be yes and no. First, indeed we made a (small) mistake and forgot a $|R|$ term under the square root, so our bound was not as tight as possible. So in fact, the sparsity term in the bound should be $|\\mathcal{G}^*|/(|\\mathcal{O}|^2*|\\mathcal{R}|)$ (we apologize for this and fixed it in the paper). On the other hand, it is not true that $\\mathcal{R}$ and $\\mathcal{O}^2$ are mathematically symmetric. To describe both $R$ and $O^2$ one needs |\\mathcal{R}| vectors and $\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{O}^2|}$, i.e. $|\\mathcal{O}|$, vectors, respectively. So in this respect (counting the number of parameters), $\\mathcal{R}$ would behave more similarly to $\\mathcal{O}$ rather than $\\mathcal{O}^2$. On the other hand, $\\mathcal{R}$ and $\\mathcal{O}^2$ behave the same when it comes to the number of examples (positive + unlabeled), as this is indeed $|\\mathcal{R}|\\cdot |\\mathcal{O}|^2$.\n\nTo give an intuitive example. Consider two extreme cases $|\\mathcal{R}| = 1$ and $|\\mathcal{O}| \\rightarrow \\infty$ vs $|\\mathcal{R}| \\rightarrow \\infty$ and $|\\mathcal{O}| = 2$. In the first case, we can generalize which our bounds prove. However, in the second case we cannot really guarantee generalization (we have $2 |\\mathcal{R}|$ examples and $d \\cdot |\\mathcal{R}|$ parameters)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1335/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1335/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["kuzelo1@gmail.com", "yuyiwang920@gmail.com"], "title": "Knowledge Graph Embedding: A Probabilistic Perspective and Generalization Bounds", "authors": ["Ondrej Kuzelka", "Yuyi Wang"], "pdf": "/pdf/db7d5734c57a9740dc8c6e081af94c02f451d5c6.pdf", "TL;DR": "We prove bounds on expected error of knowledge graph embedding methods from certain class and under certain assumptions.", "abstract": "We study theoretical properties of embedding methods for knowledge graph completion under the missing completely at random assumption.

More specifically, it formalized a knowledge graph completion problem as an estimation of the optimal embedding by assuming the canonical distribution derived from the embedding and derived the upper bound of misclassification rate of entities under the missing-completely-at-random assumption.\n\n\nDecision\n\nAlthough the formalization of knowledge graph completion problems is novel (to the best of my knowledge), there is much room for improvement in the organization of the paper. Therefore, I would recommend to reject the paper this time and to ask authors to revise the paper so that the paper is more accessible to researchers and engineers.\nThere are numerous existing works about the knowledge graph embedding problem and the knowledge graph completion problem using embeddings. However, few works have been done to justify these methods theoretically. This paper attempted to answer this question via statistical learning theorem perspectives. The theorems gave sufficient conditions in terms of the size of a knowledge graph and properties of embedding functions under which the misclassification rate goes to $0$. In this aspect, this paper gave insights into how we can give justifications to existing embedding methods.\nHowever,  I think it is hard for those who are not familiar with this field to follow the logic of the paper, as I write in detail in the following sections. I understand some people argue that the paper organization is not essential for how a paper contributes to science and technology. However, the accessibility to the paper is vital to promote technical communications in different fields. Also, I believe it is beneficial for the paper to maximize its value. Thus, I would ask the authors to polish the paper.\n\n\nSuggestions\n\n- Introduction \n\t- Please explain what knowledge graphs are in the introduction before explaining how knowledge graphs represent knowledge, or what problems of practically available knowledge graphs have.\n\t- I think it is a bit too casual and conversational to use wordings like \"Please bare in mind\" in papers.\n\t- I think it is helpful if the authors add a summary of theorems and its implication in the introduction to grasp the theoretical contributions the paper has made.\n- Section 6, Theorem 1\n\t- Please describe what is the probability of $P$ and with respect to which probability distribution $\\mathbb{E}$ takes the expectation.\n- Section 7\n\t- The authors claim that Pinsker's inequality plays a central role in deriving the upper bound for the ratio of wrongly predicted triples. However, we cannot know how the authors used the inequality unless we see the proof of Theorem 3, which is available in the appendix.\n\t- In Theorem 3, the definition of \"wrongly predicted triple\" is missing. I only find a description related to it in the proof of Theorem 3 in the appendix. Could you add the definition in the main part?\n- Section 8, Theorem 4\n\t- The statement of Theorem 4 says that $\\mathbb{X}$ is a learned representation. But it is not available in the main article how we obtain it. We know that the authors used the maximum-likelihood estimator if we read the proof of the theorem. The author should clarify it in the statement of the theorem.\n- Section 10\n\t- What does \"this\" mean in the title of the section?\n\t- In the initial reading, I could not understand the main point the authors want to address in the paragraph starting with Loss. I think authors can clarify the point by restructuring the paragraph.\n\n\nMinor comments\n\n- Section 2 and Section 6\n\t- The authors treated $\\mathbb{X}$, which is the set of vector representations of objects and relations, as a lookup table in Section 2.2 and reinterpreted it as the subset of $\\mathcal{X}^{|\\mathcal{O}|+|\\mathcal{R}|}$ in Section 6. I think we can simplify the description if we treat $\\mathbb{X}$ as the subset of $\\mathcal{X}^{\\mathcal{O} \\sqcup \\mathcal{R}} := \\{f: \\mathcal{O} \\sqcup \\mathcal{R} \\to \\mathcal{X} \\}$ and denote $\\mathbb{X}(o)$ as $x_o$ in short hand for a representation $\\mathbb{X}$ and an object $o\\in \\mathcal{O}$ (and similarly for $x_r$).\n- Section 4\n\t- It would be helpful to make the correspondence explicit between each sentence and theorem later in the last paragraph. For example, \"We prove a generalization bound for log-likelihood from which a bound on Kullback-Leibler divergence follows (Theorem 3)\" or something like that.\u2028- Section 6, Theorem 1\n\t- The definitions of $\\mathbb{X}_o$ and $\\mathbb{X}_r$ are missing, if I do not miss something.\n\t- It is better to add the assumption that $\\sup_{h, r, t} |\\psi(x_h, x_r, x_t)|$ is finite.\n- Section 12\n\t- \"simplistic\" means too simple by itself. So, \"too simplistic\" should be \"too simple\" or \"simplistic\".\n\n\nQuestions\n\n- Section 4\n\t- I could not fully understand the intuition of the proof in the second paragraph. The authors think that the situation is desirable if multiple knowledge graphs are available. However, in the first approach, they concatenated the graphs into one (I interpreted the union of graphs as $\\widehat{\\mathcal{G}}_1 \\cup \\widehat{\\mathcal{G}}_2 \\cup \\cdots \\widehat{\\mathcal{G}}_n$. Correct me if I am wrong). Since this operation would reduce the situation to the single-graph case, we cannot take advantage of multiple graphs.\n- Section 7, Theorem 4\n\t- The upper bound is in terms of the estimator which maximizes the expected log-likelihood. I am wondering whether this estimator can achieve the best possible misclassification rate (i.e., $|\\mathcal{F}/|\\mathcal{O}^2|/|\\mathcal{R}||$). I understand that it minimizes the discrepancy between the inferred distribution and the data generating distribution. But I am not sure it implies the least misclassification rate.\n\t- The small terms in the upper bound (i.e., first and second terms) depend on the number of objects $|\\mathcal{O}|$ and not on relations $|\\mathcal{R}|$. Since the role of $\\mathcal{O}^2$ and $\\mathcal{R}$ is symmetric mathematically (if I understand correctly), I feel it is weird that the additional terms do not necessarily go to zero when $\\mathcal{R}\\to \\infty$. I particular, I expected that the additonal small terms depend solely on $|\\mathcal{G}|=|\\mathcal{O}|^2|\\mathcal{R}|$."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1335/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1335/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["kuzelo1@gmail.com", "yuyiwang920@gmail.com"], "title": "Knowledge Graph Embedding: A Probabilistic Perspective and Generalization Bounds", "authors": ["Ondrej Kuzelka", "Yuyi Wang"], "pdf": "/pdf/db7d5734c57a9740dc8c6e081af94c02f451d5c6.pdf", "TL;DR": "We prove bounds on expected error of knowledge graph embedding methods from certain class and under certain assumptions.", "abstract": "We study theoretical properties of embedding methods for knowledge graph completion under the missing completely at random assumption.

Under a \"``missing completely at random'' assumption, the authors model the distributions of sampled KG and ground-truth KG, and derivate the bounds as a function of the KL-divergence by leveraging Pinsker's inequality. Preliminary discussions on how existing KG embedding methods fit into this theoretical study have been conducted.\n\nPros:\n- This work raises a novel problem, i.e., analyzing the theoretical generalization ability of existing KG embedding methods. \n- The paper is well motivated with clear writing and technically sound with rigorous formula derivation.\n\nCons:\n1) For KG construction, people usually collect/mine in a batch/incremental fashion in which each batch focuses on certain aspects. For example, one can collect some bio facts about Persons from Wikipedia, then collect some entertainment related facts from news. So in practice, \"``missing completely at random\" assumption may not hold for KG.\n\n2) The derivation is suitable for a class of KG models that maximize log-likelihood losses, while many KG embedding methods use margin-based loss functions. Although the authors mentioned \"``log-loss can in principle be also used and it was observed by Trouillon & Nickel (2017) that the margin-based loss functions, used by many knowledge graph embedding methods, are more prone to overfitting compared to log-likelihood'', more rigorous theoretical analysis is suggested to verify (or refine) the applicability of the proposed analysis \n\n3) It would be better to see more examples that applying the proposed analysis to different KG embedding methods, corresponding comparisons help to get a deeper understanding for existing KG embedding methods, and may shed further light on how to design a KG embedding method that achieves a good enough generalization with fewer model parameters.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1335/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1335/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["kuzelo1@gmail.com", "yuyiwang920@gmail.com"], "title": "Knowledge Graph Embedding: A Probabilistic Perspective and Generalization Bounds", "authors": ["Ondrej Kuzelka", "Yuyi Wang"], "pdf": "/pdf/db7d5734c57a9740dc8c6e081af94c02f451d5c6.pdf", "TL;DR": "We prove bounds on expected error of knowledge graph embedding methods from certain class and under certain assumptions.", "abstract": "We study theoretical properties of embedding methods for knowledge graph completion under the missing completely at random assumption.
