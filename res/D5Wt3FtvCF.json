The idea in the paper is that a recommender system can utilize the uncertainty of its users in order to maximize the \"commercial benefit\" of the system.  \n\nFactors to consider include:\n\n1. ICLR's Ethical Principles on contributing to society and to human well-being (and in particular \u201cWhen the interests of multiple groups conflict, the needs of those less advantaged should be given increased attention and priority\u201d).\n\n2. ICLR's Ethical Principles on avoiding harm and taking action to avoid discrimination.\n\n3. Exploiting and manipulating individuals without their knowledge or consent, particularly in ways that they could foreseeably find problematic (e.g., if they knew the full space of options).\n---\n\nOptimizing for commercial benefit is not a priori ethically problematic, so the question is whether there are ethical concerns within the paper's focus. As-is, the paper does not put forward a proposal that detracts from human well-being or adds to discrimination. On the other hand, it does not address the potential for exploitation or other foreseeable harms and risks aligned with a commercial focus. Further experiments could be designed and included in the paper, so the interest of the users is also weighted, not just commercial benefits of the platform. The problem could be, for instance, framed both as a maximization of commercial interests and a metric around user interests. We understand however that such work could be outside the scope of this specific work.\n\nIn any case, authors would be well advised to note tradeoffs -- including the harms and risks to individuals -- when commercial goals are prioritized. This can include, e.g., loss of wealth, addiction, unequal access to opportunity, polarization. Such documentation would help ground this paper within the landscape of ethical considerations for recommender systems, contributing to the broader goal of understanding harms and risks of commerce-focused systems."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper386/Ethics_Committee"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper386/Ethics_Committee"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "PURE: An Uncertainty-aware Recommendation Framework for Maximizing Expected Posterior Utility of Platform", "authorids": ["~Haokun_Chen1", "jingmu.lzy@alibaba-inc.com", "~Chen_Xu2", "~Ziqian_Chen1", "jinyang.gjy@alibaba-inc.com", "~Bolin_Ding3"], "authors": ["Haokun Chen", "Zhaoyang Liu", "Chen Xu", "Ziqian Chen", "Jinyang Gao", "Bolin Ding"], "keywords": ["commercial recommendation", "maximizing platform benefits", "uncertainty-aware", "influence of display policy", "non-convex optimization"], "abstract": "Commercial recommendation can be regarded as an interactive process between the recommendation platform and its target users.

The basic idea is that when a user is uncertain about some properties of a particular item (e.g., quality of the item) or he/she might be more (or less) influenced by the system\u2019s past recommendations, the system would have room to recommend items that maximize system utility. The idea sounds interesting and feasible to me, but the presented technical solution is unfortunately opaque and hard to follow. I do have a few of questions regarding the two assumptions and main results in this work.\n\nFirst, what is the meaning of $p_{u,i}(x)$? Based on the description, it should be the representation of item $i$ from user $u$\u2019s perspective. However, the way to estimate the parameters of this distribution is based on the system learnt embeddings in user groups and item categories. Why would those learnt embeddings or such an estimation method correspond to a particular user\u2019s assessment on an item? For example, the user group is constructed by age and gender, does it mean all users with the same gender and age would have the same uncertainty on items, disregarding to their specific experiences of those items? I believe this item uncertainty could be better modeled with respect to individual user\u2019s interaction history with the item (e.g., non-durable consumer goods or service might be a better target for this study). \n\nThe second assumption is even harder to understand. Should this $p_{u,i}(display|x;\\pi)$ be understood as a user\u2019s belief of why item $x$ is recommended to him/her? But how would this estimate on the user side affect his/her behavior? The higher the probability, the more likely the user would click on the result? Based on Eq (5), it seems to be the case; but why would it be in practice? For example, when the user realizes the system is taking advantage of him/her for profit, would the user go against the recommendations? This actually leads to a bigger question regarding the problem setup in this paper: throughout the paper, the tone is the system takes advantage of users to maximize its \u201ccommercial benefits\u201d, which is very shortsighted. This is based on a static assumption about users\u2019 behaviors and their trust on the system, as required by Eq (5). However, once the user realizes the system\u2019s strategy and loses his/her trust on the system, the system will lose further opportunities for making recommendations (or gaining its utilities). \n\nThe reported experiment results are also not easy to follow. For example, Figure 1 and 2 showed the obtained utility from the learnt policy, which illustrate the learning is converging. But how good is the learnt policy? There should be some baselines for comparison purpose, e.g., at least against a random policy? Figure 3\u2019s result isn\u2019t a surprise: the utility function is a sigmoid function, which is a generalized linear function, over the item representation and user preference. As a result, how the learnt policy reacts to different user preference can be suggested by the linear case\u2019s analysis. Moreover, I do not quite follow the definition of $v_0$: \u201crecord the learned expected value (w.r.t. the learned policy) of the elements with dimension 0 of the mean vectors, which is denoted as $v_0$.\u201d   \n\nBy the way, I could not derive Eq (5) from Eq (4), and this is what I have: \n$$\np_{u,i}(x|display,\\pi)=\\frac{ p_{u,i}(x,display,\\pi)}{ p_{u,i}(display,\\pi)} =\\frac{ p_{u,i}(x) p_{u,i}(display,\\pi|x)}{ p_{u,i}(display,\\pi)}\n$$\n\n**Acknowledgement of author rebuttal** I appreciate the detailed discussions that the authors have provided. However, my concerns still remain, and I am not convinced to improve my overall evaluation.

We have noticed that there is a shared concern that the work may lack experiments for comparison. We would illustrate the reason for that and further present the efforts we have made to address this concern in the following.\n\nWe should first point out that our target is to propose a solid framework, which mainly consists of an objective function (i.e., expected posterior utility) and an optimization solution (i.e., the proposed ADMM-based method), to enhance existing recommendation solutions (via taking the user uncertainty over different item dimensions and the impact of display policy over user into consideration). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first complete framework to achieve this target and there is no suitable framework for conducting straightforward and informative comparison in term of expected posterior utility as Reviewer 4 mentioned in the comments. Thus, in the original paper, we focus on verifying the technical effectiveness of the framework in the experiment section.\n\nTo further address this concern, we sincerely accept your suggestion to conduct comparison between the learned policy and other heuristic policies such as random policy and prior-based policy. We have conducted supplementary experiments and provide the detailed results in the revised paper which demonstrates that the learned policy achieves great superior over competed policies. Please refer to Section 4.3 in the revised paper for more details.\n\nThanks again for your comments.

For instance, assume that there are two laptops which are similar but with different colors and the target user is uncertain about which color he would prefer. We further assume that the benefits that the platform can gain from recommending these two laptops are different. Then the platform may choose to recommend the laptop with higher benefit by utilizing the user uncertainty over the item color.\n\n\"Isn't the below...\", \"The following seems...\": You are absolutely correct that there exist works to explore the impact of recommendation systems. However, we should point out that it is still not well-studied how to explicitly exploit the influence of display policy when developing recommendation solution. One of the purposes of the proposed framework is to provide a novel way to achieve that. We have made this point clearer in the revised paper.\n\n\"In eq (1)..., How is the recommendation performed...\": Equation 1 describes how to derive the optimal recommendation policy $\\pi^u$ for user $u$. The policy $\\pi^u$ is a probability distribution over the candidate item set $\\mathbb{I}$ which indicates the recommendation probability  for each item. Thus, the platform can perform recommendation by conducting sampling w.r.t. $\\pi^u$.\n\n\"It is unclear what x represents...\": To model the user uncertainty over different item dimensions, we assume that the representation of item $i$ for user $u$ is  sampled from a multivariate Gaussian distribution $p_{u,i}$. Thus, as you said, $x$ can be regarded as a realization of item high-order features from the user's perspective.\n\n\"The normality assumptions in eq (2) and (3): what is the price of reality deviation from these?\": The proposed framework based on two reasonable assumptions. The first assumption adopts Gaussian distribution to capture the user uncertainty. Such Gaussian-based assumption is widely accepted in the research area. Besides, the second assumption only assumes that higher similarity between item $i'$ and the displayed items would make the user consider that item $i'$ is with higher probability to be displayed, which is also reasonable in real-world scenarios.\n\n\"It says v_u..., how this can be computed...\": As shown in the paper, $v_u=\\sum_{i\\in\\mathbb{I}}\\pi_i\\mu_{u,i}$. Please refer to the content below the Equation 3.\n\n\"In eq (3), what is the random variable 'display' indicating...\": Thanks for the comment. \"display\" indicates the event of displaying the corresponding item to the target user. We have made that clearer in the revised paper.\n\n\"Lemma 1, Corollary 1 and 2 seem to follow in a straightforward manner..., a nonlinear f which is still unclear...\": To ease the presentation, we only present the main conclusions in methodology section and place the detailed proofs of Lemma 1, Corollary 1 and 2 in Appendix. We sincerely welcome the readers to read the detailed proofs and provide your suggestions. Besides, as illustrated in the paper, $f$ is the utility function of the platform which can be flexibly defined to fit different requirements of different scenarios. For instance, if we regard the click through rate (CTR) as the platform's utility, $f$ can be an MLP trained to conduct CTR prediction.\n\nWe are grateful for your review and have tried our best to address your concerns. It is our duty to make the work clear for the readers and we also hope that the work can be judged with careful consideration. We sincerely look forward to your further comments."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper386/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper386/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "PURE: An Uncertainty-aware Recommendation Framework for Maximizing Expected Posterior Utility of Platform", "authorids": ["~Haokun_Chen1", "jingmu.lzy@alibaba-inc.com", "~Chen_Xu2", "~Ziqian_Chen1", "jinyang.gjy@alibaba-inc.com", "~Bolin_Ding3"], "authors": ["Haokun Chen", "Zhaoyang Liu", "Chen Xu", "Ziqian Chen", "Jinyang Gao", "Bolin Ding"], "keywords": ["commercial recommendation", "maximizing platform benefits", "uncertainty-aware", "influence of display policy", "non-convex optimization"], "abstract": "Commercial recommendation can be regarded as an interactive process between the recommendation platform and its target users.

However, we should point out that to construct such distribution is not the goal of this paper. We regard $p_{u,i}$ as the input of our framework and provide one practical way to construct it. Any reasonable method to construct $p_{u,i}$ can be adopted within our framework. Besides, we do have considered to construct $p_{u,i}$ by only utilizing  the interaction history of individual user $u$. However, such method faces the challenge of data sparsity as we have to estimate distributions for all items while the interacted items of one user are always limited. That is the reason why we believe that estimating the parameters of the distribution via group-based method is a practical way.\n\n\"The second assumption is even harder to understand..., which is very shortsighted...\": As presented in Assumption 2, $p_{u,i}(display|x;\\pi)$ denotes the display probability of item $i$ from the perspective of user $u$ when the item representation is $x$, taking the impact of display policy $\\pi$ over user $u$ into account. Assumption 2 only assumes that higher similarity between the current item representation $x$ and the expected representation of displayed items would lead to higher display likelihood from the perspective of the user. There is no assumption about \"users' behaviors and their trust on the system\" as you claim. Besides, we might disagree with your opinion that the proposed framework is \"shortsighted\". Actually, the proposed framework can avoid the shortsighted actions via considering the impact of display policy over user. According to Equation 1, we try to derive a policy to maximize the expected posterior utility while the posterior utility $U_u(i|display;\\pi)$ is parameterized by policy $\\pi$. In other words, the long-term impact of policy $\\pi$ is taken into consideration when we derive the optimal policy, which indeed contributes to avoid shortsighted policy. By the way, such solution is a little bit similar to the reinforcement learning method as both of them consider the future influence when deriving the policy. That is the reason we link our work with reinforcement learning in the related work section.\n\n\"Figure 1 and 2..., There should be some baselines...\": Thanks for the suggestion. We have addressed this concern according to your suggestion. Please refer to the common response and the Section 4.3 in the revised paper for more details.\n\n\"Figure 3's result isn't a surprise..., do not quite follow the definition of $v_0$...\": To make it clearer for you, we provide detailed explanation in the following. Assume that the mean representation of items are $\\mu_1, \\mu_2,...,\\mu_m$, then $v_0=\\sum_{j=1}^m\\pi[j]\\mu_j[0]=\\mathbb{E}_{j\\sim\\pi}\\mu_j[0]$ where $a[i]$ denote the $i$-th element of vector $a$. Thus, $v_0$ denotes the expected value of item dimension 0 w.r.t. the learned policy and can reflect to what extent the policy has adjusted to make use of item dimension 0. Besides, we should point out that Figure 3 not only present the result of policy adjustment w.r.t the user preference, but also present the result w.r.t. the item variance of the user which is more important as it reveals the influence of user uncertainty.\n\n\"I could not derive Eq (5) from Eq (4)...\": Note that we take the influence of display policy into account and the event of displaying item $i$ is parameterized by $\\pi$. Thus, by adopting Bayes' theorem, we have: $$p_{u,i}(x|display;\\pi)=p_{u,i}(x)\\frac{p_{u,i}(display|x;\\pi)}{p_{u,i}(display;\\pi)}$$\n\nThank you again for your efforts.

We address your concerns in detail as follows.\n\n\"I was unable to find..., lacking experiments...\": In the paper, we propose a novel objective function, i.e., the expected posterior utility, to take the influence of display policy over user into account. In our experiments, the expected posterior utility is thus adopted as the metric for conducting evaluation. For the concern of lacking experiments for comparison, we have addressed that in the common response. The supplementary experiments in Section 4.3 demonstrates the superior of the proposed framework. Please refer to the common response and the revised paper for more details.\n\n\"How efficient is the proposed method on large item set...\": In the worst case, the time complexity of solving Equation 21 and 22 is $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ where $N$ denotes the number of items. However, note that large-scale recommendation systems in real-world applications such as Taobao always consist of the recall phase and the phase of final ranking. The first phase recalls a small amount of items from millions of items by utilizing efficient approaches.  The second phase always adopts complex but effective methods to conduct final ranking over the filtered items. Thus, the proposed framework can be applied in the second phase and enhances the recommendation system by taking into consideration the user uncertainty over item dimensions and the influence of display policy over user.\n\n\"What is the 'display' random variable?\": Thanks for your comment. \"display\" indicates the event of displaying the corresponding item to the target user. We have made that clearer in the revised paper.\n\nResponse to other minor comments: We believe all other comments are also addressed in the revised paper. Please refer to the revised paper and let us know if you have any further comments.\n\nThanks again for your efforts to make this work better.

To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first work that proposes to maximize the expected posterior utility taking the user uncertainty and the influence of display policy into consideration. As a result, there is no suitable framework for conducting straightforward and informative comparison in term of expected posterior utility, as you mentioned in the comments.

As typical solutions for recommendation systems always encode each item as an embedding, the item dimensions refer to different dimensions of the item embedding, which can be explained as different high-order features.

It is motivated by the fact that most recommender systems don't take into account that user may be highly uncertain about value/utility in certain dimensions (e.g., color of a product) while more certain about others. The platform can use this information explicitly while optimizing for what to show.\n\nA question that needs empirical evidence is whether uncertainty in certain dimensions have affect on recommendation outcomes. A priori it seems unclear which type of an effect this has.

To achieve the maximized expected posterior utility, it also provides a technically sound solution to derive the approximately optimal policy based on ADMM, and achieve provides insights for the commercial recommendation based on the experiments with real-world data.\n\nReasons for score: \nI like the idea of taking into consideration user uncertainty and display policy. My major concern is about experiments (see cons below). Hope the authors can address my concern in the rebuttal period.\n \nPros: \n1. The paper studies the most important problem for recommendation platforms: commercial benefits. The problem itself will have great impacts on real-world scenarios.\n2. The proposed recommendation framework is novel for taking into consideration user uncertainty and display policy for maximizing commercial benefits. Deriving the problem into maximizing the posterior utility, this paper also proposes the ADMM-based solution to derive the approximately optimal policy. \n3. Experiments on the real-world dataset provide some practical insights about how to achieve commercial benefits for the recommendation platform.\n \nCons: \n1. Although several insightful experiments are provided, I still have several suggestions on the experiments to enhance the quality of the paper: \n(1) Although the data is from a real-world scenario, there are only results on expected utility. It might be valuable to investigate the real-world beneficial increases (if it is sensitive for companies to share the exact value, maybe it can provide the value of the increasing percentage).\n(2) There is no baseline. It might because this paper utilizes expected posterior utility to evaluate the effectiveness,  this metric may not be suitable for other recommendation baselines. Thus, is it possible to select another metric as a supplement and have several comparison experiments?\n2. In the introduction, it would be better to provide more details about \u201citem dimensions\u201d and \u201cuser uncertainty\u201d, which seems not very clear to me. \n\nQuestions during the rebuttal period: \nPlease address and clarify the cons above ", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper386/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper386/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "PURE: An Uncertainty-aware Recommendation Framework for Maximizing Expected Posterior Utility of Platform", "authorids": ["~Haokun_Chen1", "jingmu.lzy@alibaba-inc.com", "~Chen_Xu2", "~Ziqian_Chen1", "jinyang.gjy@alibaba-inc.com", "~Bolin_Ding3"], "authors": ["Haokun Chen", "Zhaoyang Liu", "Chen Xu", "Ziqian Chen", "Jinyang Gao", "Bolin Ding"], "keywords": ["commercial recommendation", "maximizing platform benefits", "uncertainty-aware", "influence of display policy", "non-convex optimization"], "abstract": "Commercial recommendation can be regarded as an interactive process between the recommendation platform and its target users.

The results suggest that the platform should cater to the user's preference for item dimensions that the user prefers, while for item dimensions where the user is with high uncertainty, the platform can achieve more commercial benefits by recommending items with high utilities.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "chen|pure_an_uncertaintyaware_recommendation_framework_for_maximizing_expected_posterior_utility_of_platform", "one-sentence_summary": "In the paper, we propose a novel recommendation framework to maximize the platform's expected posterior utility, taking into consideration the user uncertainty over different item dimensions and the influence of display policy over user.", "pdf": "/pdf/770c3c14eb315661cf91be42146e47be5dde7602.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=xdNDGLMX6W", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nchen2021pure,\ntitle={{\\{}PURE{\\}}: An Uncertainty-aware Recommendation Framework for Maximizing Expected Posterior Utility of Platform},\nauthor={Haokun Chen and Zhaoyang Liu and Chen Xu and Ziqian Chen and Jinyang Gao and Bolin Ding},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=D5Wt3FtvCF}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
