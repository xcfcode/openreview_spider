We agree with the reviewer that finite sample bounds rather than asymptotic rates would be more desirable. However, the requirements on the smoothing rate which are a side product of Theorem 1 provide us with intuition on how to adjust the noise variance in response to the sample size and data dimensionality. Deriving finite sample bounds would require making limiting model assumptions which would be conflict with the model-agnostic feature and generality of this work.\n\nC: Intuition does arise from the derivation for the effect of noise on the objective which helps understand the nature of the noise, but one wonders if similar intuitions could be derived for other forms of regularization as well. \n\nR: The key property of noise regularization is its nonparametric nature which allows us to derive the regularization effect uniformly for all parametric CDE function classes.

In the following, we attempt to address the reviewer's concerns:\n\nC: Adding noise on x (e.g., [1]), y (e.g., [2]) is not new. Though it is claimed that this paper extends previous results on classification/regression to conditional density estimation which is a more general case. This claim is not well supported. Experiments are still evaluated in classification/regression tasks.\n\nR: As pointed out in the introduction, the paper addresses the regularization of conditional density estimation (CDE). As we acknowledge in the last paragraph of chapter 3, noise regularization is a well studied method in the context of regression and classification problems. The references mentioned by the reviewer fall into this body of literature. We thank the reviewer for pointing out additional papers we have missed and added them to our manuscript.\n\nThe reviewer correctly points out classification / regression are special cases of more general class of CDE. That is, the predictive distribution is typically a simple Gaussian / Softmax-Categorical distribution. The main difficulties arising from generalizing beyond these special cases are moving towards more complex, expressive density models (e.g. GMM or Normalizing Flow) that are conjoined with a neural network and dealing with the inherent unboundedness of the log probability in Theorem 1 & 2.\n\nThere exists a substantial body of empirical results for noise regularization in regression and classification tasks. In contrast, our paper focuses on CDE with expressive density models and datasets with a large amount of aleatoric uncertainty, evaluated with the negative log-likelihood, which is a standard metric for assessing the fit of a CDE. We would highly appreciate specific suggestions on how to improve the experiments and substantiate the claims.\n\nC: Theorem 1 & 2 in Sec 4.2 only show the asymptotic case, which are quite obvious and seems helpless in understanding the advantage of adding noise regularization in conditional density estimation.\n\nR: We agree with the reviewer that finite sample bounds rather than asymptotic consistency results would be more desirable. Obtaining finite sample bounds requires narrow assumptions on the density model and thus would reduce the generality / applicability of the results.  Moreover, the requirements on the smoothing rate which are a product of Theorem 1 provide us with intuition on how to adjust the noise variance in response to the sample size and the dimensionality of the data. \n\nC: Sec 4.1: \"The second term in (6) penalizes large negative second derivatives of the conditional log density estimate...\". It is hard for me to understand. Large positive second derivatives also lead to poor smoothness.\n\nR: The first term in (6), that is the negative log likelihood, pushes the density towards high probabilities in the data points y_i. Due to the limited probability mass, this leads to large negative second derivatives in the respective point. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 (left).  At the same time the second term in (6) penalizes large negative second derivatives in the locations y_i which counteracts the effect of the first term. Since both effects compensate each other, the regularization does not lead to large positive derivatives in the data locations. We will improve the clarity of our exposition in our revised paper."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper13/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper13/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authors": ["Jonas Rothfuss", "Fabio Ferreira", "Simon Boehm", "Simon Walther", "Maxim Ulrich", "Tamim Asfour", "Andreas Krause"], "title": "Noise Regularization for Conditional Density Estimation", "abstract": "Modelling statistical relationships beyond the conditional mean is crucial in many settings.

In the following, we attempt to address the reviewer's concerns:\n\nConcern: The experiments performed in the paper are all very small scaled.\n\nResponse: In the large scale setting, the superior performance of neural network estimators over non-parametric methods is widely acknowledged. In contrast, the focus of the paper are small scale settings where data is scarce and classical nonparametric methods are considered state-of-the-art [1, 2]. One of the core contributions of the paper is the empirical study in section 5.3 of the paper, which shows that neural network based CDE, when combined with noise regularization, consistently & significantly outperforms previous non/semi-parametric methods, even when only very little training data is available.\n\nC: The method itself is not novel. Adding noise to for regularization is a quite common technique used in many different applications. \n\nR: We agree with the reviewer: Noise regularization has widely been studied in the context of regression and classification. The paper attempts to close a gap in previous research by contributing a comprehensive study of noise regularization for conditional density estimation, on which we could not find any previous work. Existing work on noise regularization for regression / classification (e.g. [3, 4]) typically assumes a simple Gaussian / Softmax as predictive distribution, leading to simple interactions between NN outputs and the resulting distribution which can be exploited for technical analysis. In contrast, our analysis makes no such assumptions, thus requiring non-trivial technical arguments to deal with the inherent unboundedness the log-probability and integrability issues, making it much more general. We will try  to further clarify the contribution in the paper\u2019s introduction.\n\nC: [...] How does it compare to methods that enforce Lipschitz continuity? e.g., gradient penalty, or construct a lipschitz constrained network \n\nR: As is discussed in chapter 4 of the paper, the effect of regularization in the weight space of the neural network (NN) is only poorly understood in the context of CDE, since the NN only indirectly controls the prediction output through a complex density model. We have not considered further methods such as enforcing Lipschitz continuity as, in addition to restrictions to the NN weights and nonlinearities, this would also require imposing restrictions on the density model (e.g. Mixture Model  / Normalizing Flow). The non-parametric / model-agnostic nature of noise regularization circumvents such problems and makes it nearly universally applicable. \n\n[1] Masashi Sugiyama and Ichiro Takeuchi.

The paper considers parametric estimation where in given a parametrized family of distributions f_{theta} we wish to minimize the likelihood of seeing the given data over theta. The parametric family in a lot of applications consists of highly expressive families like neural networks, which leads to the issue of overfitting in small data regimes. This has been tackled via regularization over the parameter space which might be hard to interpret as the associated inductive bias is not well understood and depends on the parametric family under consideration. On the other hand the paper proposes to add explicit noise in the examples used during training, i.e. irrespective of the optimization procedure (which could be mini-bath sgd) the paper proposes to draw examples from the data set, explicitly add noise onto the examples and create a proxy objective over the augmented data set. \n\nThe paper establishes two theoretical results. First is a simple taylor approximation based analysis to highlight the effect of the variance of noise. The conclusion is that higher variance penalizes the high curvature areas of the resultant density and hence this kind of noise addition could be seen as making resulting density smoother. The second contribution is to show that this procedure is asymptotically consistent, i.e. as n goes to infinity and the number of augmented data points go to infinity, the resulting density converges to the target density. This of course requires the noise variance to follow a decreasing schedule to 0. \n\nThe main merit of the idea is in its agnostic nature, as it can be applied to any parametric family and the experiements show that it seems to uniform improvement across models,  The basic idea proposed by the error, has existed in the space of deep learning based methods forever. This is the same idea behind image augmentation which forms a crucial part of training supervised models in vision. The authors claim that this idea is novel in the space of parametric density estimation, however I do not know enough about the area to verify the claim. It would surprise that this very natural idea has not been tried before. \n\nI have gone through the theoretical derivations in the paper and they look sound to me. However the results are all asymptotic in nature without establishing explicit rates which is a little bit of disappointment. Since I am not completely familiar in nature, but I guess such asymptotic consistency might be achievable using other forms of regularization under suitable assumptions. In that light, the theoretical contributions while being sound did not lend much intuition about why such a method might outperform others. Intuition does arise from the derivation for the effect of noise on the objective which helps understand the nature of the noise, but one wonders if similar intuitions could be derived for other forms of regularization as well. It would be great to see this derivation being extended to some concrete scenarios under well understood parametric families and seeing the effect explicitly. \n\nRegarding the experiments - The experiments definitely look promising as the improvments seem uniformly good across the cases considered. I am not an expert however in this setting so it is hard for me to judge the quality and significance of the benchmarks. The experiment methodology nevertheless looks sound. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper13/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper13/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authors": ["Jonas Rothfuss", "Fabio Ferreira", "Simon Boehm", "Simon Walther", "Maxim Ulrich", "Tamim Asfour", "Andreas Krause"], "title": "Noise Regularization for Conditional Density Estimation", "abstract": "Modelling statistical relationships beyond the conditional mean is crucial in many settings.
