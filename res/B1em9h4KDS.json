It seems to work well in the limited evaluation and is at least claimed to be easier to use for practitioners. This paper could benefit tremendously from both better evaluation and discussion. The paper would be much clearer if GI contextualized itself relative to GAIN on the one hand (which is the most similar GAN method) and multiple imputation on the other hand (of which this is almost, but not quite, an instance of). \n\n\nSuggestions for improving the introduction & discussion: \n* The purpose of this paper is to model uncertainties about missing values \u2014 you really should say more about probabilistic methods than \"A few exceptions exist such as Bayesian models\u201d.  At least give some motivation for why certain imputations problems couldn\u2019t be feasibly solved by modeling the missing values in a probabilistic programming framework. \n* Other GAN methods for imputation (GAIN and MisGAN) are dismissed as \"often very complicated to be applied in practical setups by practitioners\u201d. Given that the described method resembles GAIN, is it really much simpler? If so, can you be more specific when characterizing related work?\n* \"This is different from approaches such as multiple imputation where several predictors are trained on different imputed versions of a dataset.\u201d \u2014 the main difference between this approach and MI is that you\u2019re interleaving imputation and training a downstream model. Emphasize this earlier on, since it will make the whole technique easier to understand.\n\nSuggestions for improving the evaluation:\n* You\u2019re imputing missing rectangles from an image dataset \u2014 please show us the resulting images. I would greatly prefer this to Section 4.5 \u2014 which is a very low sample size, low dimensionality example and it\u2019s really unclear how well it generalizes to real data. \n* \"We also considered using root means squared error (RMSE); however, we decided not to use this measure as we observed an inconsistent behavior using RMSE in our comparisons as RMSE favors methods that show less variance rather than realistic and sharp samples from the distribution.\u201d \u2014 I think this is a mistake, likely motivated by the proposed method doing worse under the RMSE metric. Show us several relevant metrics and then discuss their tradeoffs afterward. \n* \"We run each experiment multiple times (at least 4)\u201d \u2014 please report how often each experiment was run, even better if you standardize this number. \n* For Table 2, please provide accuracy without missing values as a baseline.\n* Add MICE or some other \u201cstandard\u201d imputation method as a baseline. \n\nSuggestions for improving readability: \n* Many sentences start with \u201cin this\u201d (e.g. \u201cin this case\u201d, \u201cin this setting\u201d, &c). Sometimes these sentences even co-occur within the same paragraph. Try to switch up the phrasing and move away from repetition. \n* Not a complete sentence: \"For instance, jointly training multiple generator/discriminator networks, tuning objective functions with multiple hyper-parameters, etc.\"\n\nUpdate: I think the latest draft of the paper is a big improvement, the inclusion of a \"classical\" baseline, improved language and additional appendices are all welcome. I'm leaving the rating as a \"weak accept\" since the paper still feels rough and could use additional editing/streamlining.

Results between the two mismatch.\u201d\n\nThank you for pointing out the inconsistency. Table 2 provides final classification accuracies for Landsat. To generate results related Figure 7, we used less number of training epochs and did not use the optimal hyper-parameter settings. To address this issue, we rerun the ablation experiments and updated Figure 7 in the revised version to use a similar setup as used for Table 2.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n* Comment: \u201cI think the statement in the first paragraph in Section 4.4 that \"MSE loss term would act as a denoising loss smoothing noisy missing pixels\" could be misleading. MSE is used with mask in GAIN, hence it only applies to the observed features during training. Its effect on smoothing noisy missing pixels is not clear.\u201d\n\nWe understand the reviewer\u2019s concern that the MSE loss is not exactly similar to what we have for denoising autoencoders. However, based on our experiments, its overall impact is very similar to autoencoders. Note that the generator network is partially receiving an autoencoder loss term which is well-known to cause over-smoothing.\nTo address the comment and prevent misleading our readers, we revised the sentence to be more scientifically accurate (first paragraph in Section 4.4):\n\u201cOne possible explanation for this behavior might be the fact that GAIN has an MSE loss term acting similar to an autoencoder loss smoothing noisy missing pixels.\u201d\n\n-------------------------------------------\n* Comment: \u201cI think the paper would benefit if the authors could explain/show:\n- Increasing the missing rate would also increase the possibility that the ground truth be a more multi-modal distribution. Especially in rectangular generation part where it can remove a complete object. Does stochastic averaging benefit more in this case?\u201d\n\nAs suggested by the reviewer, we conducted a new experiment to show the benefit of stochastic averaging over simple classification for rectangular missingness ranging from 20% to 90% (see Table 6 in Appendix D).\n\nLast paragraph of Appendix D:\n\u201cFrom Table 6, it can be inferred that as the rate of missingness increases, the benefits of the suggested predictor algorithm increase significantly. We hypothesize that at higher rates of missingness, the conditional distribution of missing features becomes multimodal. In such a scenario, the suggested method captures the uncertainties over the target distribution resulting in the predictor to make more reliable class assignments.\u201d"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper110/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper110/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authors": ["Mohammad Kachuee", "Kimmo K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen", "Orpaz Goldstein", "Sajad Darabi", "Majid Sarrafzadeh"], "title": "Generative Imputation and Stochastic Prediction", "abstract": "In many machine learning applications, we are faced with incomplete datasets.

Please find a point-to-point response to your comments in the following.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n*Comment: \u201c1- The predictor is trained on different version of imputed samples (imputed via the generator); this equates to making noisy version of the real samples, where noise is applied to the missing variables. A side effect of this is generalization of the predictor; thus, have you been careful that the improved accuracy is not due to generalization? In other words, if we imposed the generalization via adding gaussian noise to the imputed samples by GAIN for example, would we get improved accuracy too?\u201d\n\nThank you for raising this concern. Adding Gaussian noise often serves as a data augmentation and may result in improved generalization. \n\nIn order to address this concern, we conducted an experiment by adding different amounts of Gaussian noise during the training process for GAIN and GI. Then we compared how the accuracies change at different rates of training noise. As we thought it might also be interesting to our readers, we included this comparison in Appendix G of the paper.\n\nIn summary, adding small amounts of Gaussian noise (e.g., std=0.0125) improves the generalization under uniform missingness for both GI and GAIN. Even in this case, GI is still outperforming GAIN in terms of final classification performance. Therefore, the improved accuracy cannot be solely attributed to the noise generated during the stochastic process.\nIt is also interesting to point out that for the case of rectangular missingness, adding Gaussian noise results in a consistent reduction in the classification accuracy for both methods.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n*Comment: \u201c2- Your method known as GI is a modified version of GAIN. You could also use MisGAN, and I am wondering if the results would have been different if generator in MisGAN was used in GI in Figure 2 (b), as MisGAN works better than GAIN.\u201d\n\nWe conducted experiments using MisGAN as imputer block for GI under different degrees of rectangular missingness. Here is a comparison of GI, MisGAN, and GI(predictor)+MisGAN(imputer):\n\n\n                          |   MCAR Rect. Missing Rate\n                          |   20%   |   40%     |   60%   |\n -----------------------------------------------------------\nGI                      |  84.0%  |  76.9%  |   66.1% | \nMisGAN           |  82.9%  |  75.6%  |   65.0% |\nGI+MisGAN     |  83.5%  |  76.5%  |   65.3% |\n\n\nAs it can be seen from these results, using MisGAN(imputer)+GI(predictor) performs better than MisGAN, while it is still worse than using the suggested GI imputer and predictor combination.\nNote that from Fig.2(b), GI is the better imputer while MisGAN trails  below with a small margin. It is consistent with the results presented above as GI is still using a better imputer compared to MisGAN+GI.\nWe decided not to include this result in the paper at this point; though we would be happy to add this table if the reviewer thinks it would be helpful.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper110/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper110/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authors": ["Mohammad Kachuee", "Kimmo K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen", "Orpaz Goldstein", "Sajad Darabi", "Majid Sarrafzadeh"], "title": "Generative Imputation and Stochastic Prediction", "abstract": "In many machine learning applications, we are faced with incomplete datasets.

This is not accurate: in noisy label prediction, we have one (noisy) y corresponding to each x, in your case there are multiple ys for one sample.\u201d\n\nWe understand the reviewer\u2019s concern; the case of having noisy labels and having imputed samples with different real labels are not exactly equivalent in general. However, if we consider the equivalence in terms of gradient-based training; it can be a valid statement to say that these two cases are very similar.\n\nNote that, during the optimization, we are doing an update based on gradients of loss terms that come from different versions of an imputed sample in which a few cases have a different assigned label as the correct underlying label. Intuitively, we are using misleading gradient terms as it happens in gradient-based learning using noisy labels. If we consider the average impact on gradients for batches of samples rather than the individual cases, the overall impact on the training would be very similar.\n\nIn order to address the reviewer's concern, we revised the paper to be more precise about this and omitted the term \u201cequivalent\u201d (see the last paragraph of Claim 1 in Section 3.3).\n\n-------------------------------------------\n*Comment: \u201c5- In the implementation details, I cannot fully wrap my head around the part \u201cz vector of size 1/8\u201d; how did you choose this 1/8?\u201d\n\nWe use the z vector as the source of randomness for the generator network. A z vector of very small size would not be effective enough and may result in deterministic imputations given a set of observed features. On the other hand, a very large z vector would unnecessarily increase the size of the input layer for the generator network causing training issues in practice.\n\nRegarding the specific choice of 1/8, we conducted initial experiments using different sizes for the z vector. We found that the final performance is not too sensitive to the choice of z size (as long as it is not relatively small or large). In this paper, we suggest the 1/8 ratio as it is a reasonable choice that does not add a huge overhead and at the same time is strong enough to induce randomness to the generator. For instance, the original implementation of GAN on MNIST (Goodfellow et al. 2014) uses a z of size 100 for inputs of size 784, roughly the same ratio.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper110/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper110/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authors": ["Mohammad Kachuee", "Kimmo K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen", "Orpaz Goldstein", "Sajad Darabi", "Majid Sarrafzadeh"], "title": "Generative Imputation and Stochastic Prediction", "abstract": "In many machine learning applications, we are faced with incomplete datasets.

Please find a point-to-point response to your comments in the following.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n* Comment: \u201cThe purpose of this paper is to model uncertainties about missing values \u2014 you really should say more about probabilistic methods than \"A few exceptions exist such as Bayesian models\u201d.  At least give some motivation for why certain imputations problems couldn\u2019t be feasibly solved by modeling the missing values in a probabilistic programming framework.\u201c\n\nThank you for pointing this out, we agree with the reviewer that probabilistic and Baysian methods deserve a more precise discussion. We revised the paper to include a discussion on Baysian methods and added proper citations accordingly (see the last paragraph of Section 2):\n\n\u201cNote that while certain Bayesian methods such as probabilistic Bayesian networks allow handling of missing values as unobserved variables. However, given an incomplete training dataset and without any known causal structure as a priori, learning such models is a very challenging problem with the complexity of at least NP-complete to learn the network architecture in addition to an iterative EM optimization to learn model parameters (Darwiche, 2009; Neapolitan et al. 2004).\u201d\n\n-------------------------------------------\n* Comment: \u201cOther GAN methods for imputation (GAIN and MisGAN) are dismissed as \"often very complicated to be applied in practical setups by practitioners\u201d. Given that the described method resembles GAIN, is it really much simpler? If so, can you be more specific when characterizing related work?\u201d\n\nGAIN is using an additional MSE loss term as well as a hint vector, imposing a two additional hyperparameters that require tuning. \nIn the case of MisGAN it is exacerbated further as it has three generators and three discriminators for the final imputer architecture. In contrast, our method has a single generator and discriminator.\n\nTo address your comment and to clarify this for our readers, we added an explanation to the revised version (the fourth paragraph of Section 2):\n\n\u201cFor instance, Yoon et al. (2018) requires setting hyperparameters to adjust the influence of an MSE loss term as well as the rate of discriminator hint vectors. Also as another example, Li et al. (2019) is using three generators and three discriminators for the final imputer architecture.\u201d\n\n-------------------------------------------\n* Comment: \u201c\"This is different from approaches such as multiple imputation where several predictors are trained on different imputed versions of a dataset.\u201d \u2014 the main difference between this approach and MI is that you\u2019re interleaving imputation and training a downstream model. Emphasize this earlier on, since it will make the whole technique easier to understand.\u201d\n\nAs suggested, we added a discussion on the relationship of this work and MI earlier in the paper. We agree with you that it will help with motivation and understanding of our readers.\n\nThe last paragraph of the introduction:\n\u201cThis work suggests the idea of training a predictor on different imputed samples to capture the uncertainties over class assignments. Compared to MI, the suggested method interleaves imputation and training a downstream prediction model, enabling to estimate classification uncertainties for each instance.\u201d\n\n-------------------------------------------\n* Comment: \u201cYou\u2019re imputing missing rectangles from an image dataset \u2014 please show us the resulting images. I would greatly prefer this to Section 4.5 \u2014 which is a very low sample size, low dimensionality example and it\u2019s really unclear how well it generalizes to real data.\u201d\n \nSection 4.5 was designed to be a very simple distribution so that we can visually show the generated samples in a 2-D space. \nIn order to address your comment, we included a new appendix in the paper that is dedicated to the visual comparison of imputed samples for different missing structures and different imputers.

Please find a point-to-point response to your comments in the following.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n* Comment: \u201cIn GAIN, they use a hint vector as an input to the discriminator. They show that without the hint vector, there is no unique solution (this is shown without the MSE loss). The authors do not use this vector in their approach (as in Figure 1) and it is not clear to me if it causes any instabilities or if multiple experiments yield similar results or if the stochastic prediction benefits from this.\u201d\n\nTo answer your comment, we included a new appendix to the revised paper studying the impact of the discriminator hint vector (See Appendix I).\n\nIn summary:\n- For the uniform missing structure, using the hint mechanism does not result in any noticeable improvement in the final imputation quality.\n- For the rectangular missing structure, however, using the hint vector causes instabilities in the training process. One possible explanation is: providing even a small portion of the mask as a hint, due to the deterministic nature of the rectangular shape  it is equivalent to providing region boundaries to the discriminator making it obvious for the discriminator. In GAN training we generally want to have equal competition between the generator and discriminator.\n\nBased on these observations, we decided not to use hint vector in our final architectures.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n* Comment: \u201cOn what type of examples GI is more accurate than other models? Since stochastic prediction is the main difference from GAIN, is this related to the multi-modality of the noisy examples?\u201d\n\n\nWe believe that this work (GI) outperforms GAIN based on two factors:\n\nFirst, in contrast to GAIN, the GI imputer objective function does not have an MSE loss term. We hypothesize that using an MSE loss would lead to generated samples to be biased toward the mean of the underlying data generation distribution. To support this hypothesis, we included a new appendix to the revised version to show the impact of the additional loss term on the generated samples for a synthesized dataset (see Appendix H).\n\nSecond, given that GI is able to generate sharp samples from a multimodal distribution, the stochastic predictor would help model the distribution of target class assignments based on an ensemble of samples (128 in this paper) rather than an over-confident assignment using a single imputed sample. Section 4.5 of the paper uses a multi-modal synthesized dataset to show this visually.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper110/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper110/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authors": ["Mohammad Kachuee", "Kimmo K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen", "Orpaz Goldstein", "Sajad Darabi", "Majid Sarrafzadeh"], "title": "Generative Imputation and Stochastic Prediction", "abstract": "In many machine learning applications, we are faced with incomplete datasets.

Unlike old-fashion multiple imputation techniques, one predictor is trained on different samples and it induces the uncertainty. The experiments on number of datasets show the proposed predictor is capable of having a fairly better performance.\nOverall, this paper raises an interesting point about missing data imputation via generative models, and well-written; however, there are number of concerns:\n1-\tThe predictor is trained on different version of imputed samples (imputed via the generator); this equates to making noisy version of the real samples, where noise is applied to the missing variables. A side effect of this is generalization of the predictor; thus, have you been careful that the improved accuracy is not due to generalization? In other words, if we imposed the generalization via adding gaussian noise to the imputed samples by GAIN for example, would we get improved accuracy too?\n2-\tYour method known as GI is a modified version of GAIN. You could also use MisGAN, and I am wondering if the results would have been different if generator in MisGAN was used in GI in Figure 2 (b), as MisGAN works better than GAIN.\n3-\tI am also wondering how the GAIN imputation changes by removing the MSE term? GI discards the MSE term in GAIN, and it changes the distribution of the imputed variables by GAIN. Could you maybe fit a Normal distribution on a chosen imputed variable  (N=128) and visualize how different it is from the distribution of imputed variables with GAIN with MSE term. \n4-\tIn justification for claim 1, it is said \u201cThis is equivalent to training models using noisy labels\u201d. This is not accurate: in noisy label prediction, we have one (noisy) y corresponding to each x, in your case there are multiple ys for one sample.\n5-\tIn the implementation details, I cannot fully wrap my head around the part \u201cz vector of size 1/8\u201d; how did you choose this 1/8?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper110/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper110/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authors": ["Mohammad Kachuee", "Kimmo K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen", "Orpaz Goldstein", "Sajad Darabi", "Majid Sarrafzadeh"], "title": "Generative Imputation and Stochastic Prediction", "abstract": "In many machine learning applications, we are faced with incomplete datasets.

They first train a GAN model where the generator outputs an imputed representation of the input and discriminator is trained to predict if an individual features (such as a pixel) is imputed or not. Given the generator and incomplete sample, they train a predictor using the output of the generator, imputed sample, as input. Their main contribution is using a MC averaging to compute the prediction by repetitively sampling from the noise variable, z, and generating different imputations from generator. They show that the proposed model improves upon the previous SOTA on final classification performance.\n\nOverall the paper is clearly written. But I do feel it is a bit incremental over the GAIN approach. The overall GAN architecture is very similar to GAIN's and although stochastic prediction shows clear improvements it is a bit straightforward. However, I think the uncertainty of the imputations and its effect on the final prediction is interesting. I suggest the authors to extend this part with more detailed analysis.\n\nThere are several parts that are confusing/missing in the paper:\n\n- In GAIN, they use a hint vector as an input to the discriminator. They show that without the hint vector, there is no unique solution (this is shown without the MSE loss). The authors do not use this vector in their approach (as in Figure 1) and it is not clear to me if it causes any instabilities or if multiple experiments yield similar results or if the stochastic prediction benefits from this.\n- On what type of examples GI is more accurate than other models? Since stochastic prediction is the main difference from GAIN, is this related to the multi-modality of the noisy examples?\n- Can you explain the difference between the results in Figure-7 and Table-2? Results between the two mismatch.\n- I think the statement in the first paragraph in Section 4.4 that \"MSE loss term would act as a denoising loss smoothing noisy missing pixels\" could be misleading. MSE is used with mask in GAIN, hence it only applies to the observed features during training. Its effect on smoothing noisy missing pixels is not clear.\n\n\nI think the paper would benefit if the authors could explain/show:\n- Increasing the missing rate would also increase the possibility that the ground truth be a more multi-modal distribution. Especially in rectangular generation part where it can remove a complete object. Does stochastic averaging benefit more in this case?"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper110/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper110/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authors": ["Mohammad Kachuee", "Kimmo K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen", "Orpaz Goldstein", "Sajad Darabi", "Majid Sarrafzadeh"], "title": "Generative Imputation and Stochastic Prediction", "abstract": "In many machine learning applications, we are faced with incomplete datasets.
