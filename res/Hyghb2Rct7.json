The authors test it in the inverse reinforcement learning setting and the behavioral cloning setting on different control problems.\n\nI feel the basic idea is really straightforward. Although some promising results are obtained in the experimental setting, I believe the contribution may not be sufficient for a publication at ICLR. Moreover, there are some issues in the writing, e.g., \n\n- classically, as far as I know, RL is not considered to be a metaheuristic, although I understand that someone could make the case for it.\n\n- although there\u2019s not really a consensus on terminology, I think using imitation learning to define the whole class of problems encompassing IRL and behavioral cloning is not the best. Generally, imitation learning is equated to behavioral cloning. I think a better term for this general class is learning from demonstration. For instance, there are some IRL approaches that don\u2019t try to mimic a demonstrated policy, but aim at learning an even better policy.\n\n- the issue described in the paper about the missing sequential information is due to the fact the authors consider POMDPs and not MDPs. This should be made clearer.

(2016) is about go, not chess. Are TRPO or PPO really off-policy or asynchronous?\n\n- the last section of Sec.3.4 sounds strange. It\u2019s not MC that assumes that the impact of an action decays with time. The discount factor comes from the choice of the total discounted reward criterion.\n\nOther comments:\n\n- in abstract: BL -> BC\n- notations issues in (2-5)\n- l.6-7, Algo 1: t = T_m?\n- The text should be checked for typos.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1208/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SIMILE: Introducing Sequential Information towards More Effective Imitation Learning", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a metaheuristic aiming at teaching an agent to interact with an environment and maximizing the reward in a complex task.

The assumption is that mostly all the IL techniques are learning a policy which depends on state at time t, while the information contained in this state may be not sufficient to choose the right action (actually, this is the POMDP setting, the notion of POMDP not appearing in the paper....). The authors thus propose to use a recurrent neural network to encode the state by aggregating past information, instead of just using the features of the state at time t. They thus instantiate this idea on different methods and show that, on some problems, this approach can increase the quality of the final policy.\n\nActually, the contribution of the paper is a simple extension of existing methods: using a RNN instead of a simple NN in imitation learning models. First of all, when dealing with classical environments such as Atari, many papers propose to use the last N frames as a state encoding (instead of the last frame), following the same intuition. The studied setting thus corresponds to the PO-MDP case and using a RNN in POMDP is for example what is done in  [Merel etal. 2017]. Moreover, the problem of imitation learning (and particularly inverse RL) in POMDP has been of the interest of many papers like [Choi et al. 2008] for instance and many more, and it is unclear what is the positioning of this paper w.r.t existing works. Since the paper proposes just to encode history with a RNN, the proposed solution lacks of originality, and the contribution of the paper in term of model is quite low.  But the authors explain how this can be instantiated in three different settings (IRL, GAIL and BC) -- note that the section concerning the use of Adaboost is not clear and could be better described -- which can be of the interest of the community. \nConcerning the experiments, I don't understand what is the split between training and testing data. Is it pairs of state-action coming from the experts ? or trajectories ? Moreover, I don't understand why these environments correspond to POMDP cases and the authors have to give details on that. For instance, mountain-car is clearly not a POMDP problem in its classical shape, nor Acrobot. As if, it makes the experiments very difficult to reproduce. The interest of using the RNN to encode history does not seem clear for each of the cases since it often degrades the final performance, so I don't know exactly what insights I can extract from the paper.\n\nPro:\n* The approach is proposed for IRL, GAIL and BC\n\nCons:\n* Lack of positionning w.r.t POMDP litterature\n* Lack of details in the experiments, and lack of good experimental results\n* Low contribution in term of model\n\n\n[Merel et al. 2017]  Learning human behaviors from motion capture\nby adversarial imitation\n[Choi et al.] Inverse Reinforcement Learning in Partially Observable\nEnvironments", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1208/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SIMILE: Introducing Sequential Information towards More Effective Imitation Learning", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a metaheuristic aiming at teaching an agent to interact with an environment and maximizing the reward in a complex task.
