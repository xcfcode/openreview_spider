It builds and improves upon existing methods of zero-shot HPO where the high level idea is to use the outcomes of hyper-parameters on an offline collection of datasets in order to speed up HPO on a new dataset. On the plus side, the methods provided seem to be novel, and the results seem to be promising. The main issue is the writing and clarity of the paper, making it hard to be certain of the good qualities of the paper. Aggregating the reviews, the details are too spread out between the appendix and main body, the techniques require more motivation behind them, and important details of the experiment are somewhat vague. The authors provided a modified version which is definitely a step in the right direction, however, it does not seem to be enough. I think this is a solid paper based on a promising idea. However, given the almost unanimous agreement about that crucial gap in clarity even after the modified version was uploaded, I recommend rejecting the paper.

First, we updated all of our experiments based on the new unified architecture to improve the robustness of the model. Second, there was a bug in the GP training code which we resolved in this updated draft. For warm-starting probabilistic approaches such as GP, it is expected that all the models will converge after a number of trials, however we are interested in early gains that are provided by our proposed hyper-parameters compared to other warm-start techniques.\n\n**Comment**: As R#5 mentioned, I don't think we can say that the proposed method is robust unless considering the proper way to choose K. \n\n*Rebuttal*:  To address your concerns, we evaluated the performance of GROSI(+X) on 5 different k values on the held-out validation datasets, Appendix E.2, and updated Table 4 with GROSI(+10) since it had on average the best validation performance.  We would like to note that top-k was proposed as a way to introduce uncertainty to our model. Unlike probabilistic surrogates that leverage  uncertainty in the acquisition function, selecting the hyper-parameter from the top-k uniformly at random is a heuristic that guarantees exploration.\n\n**Comment**: In ablation study, the authors said that the model underfit when all loss is simultaneously used with respect to Optimization Md, is it possible to explain this reason? \n\n*Rebuttal*: The results have been updated in the ablation study for the pretrained meta-feature extractor due to incorrectly loading the weights. In the results of Table 5, the performance of the pretrained model is poor for 2 out of the 3 datasets. After investigating the training losses, we noticed that when optimizing a pretrained model, the loss converges quickly with approximately half the number of iterations compared to when learning from scratch. This indicates that the algorithm gets stuck at a local optima. For Regularization Md, the slight improvement is considered an artifact of the meta-dataset.\n\n**Comment**: In appendix D, the response model parameter of Algorithm 1 and the meta-feature parameter of Algorithm 5 use the same notation, \\beta. Are they controlled by the completely same parameters in this paper? In appendix B it says \"we incorporate the meta-feature extractor as part of the response model\", which confuses me, as if the parameters are not exactly the same.\n\n*Rebuttal*: The parameters defined in each algorithm are self-contained, i.e. \\beta reported in Algorithm 5 is different from \\beta in Equation 8 and Algorithm 4. Algorithm 5 is a stand-alone meta-feature learning algorithm that is implemented to provide learned meta-features for the zero-shot baseline, NN-D2V and the sequential baseline TST-D2V.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3283/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3283/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Zero-shot Transfer Learning for Gray-box Hyper-parameter Optimization", "authorids": ["~Hadi_Samer_Jomaa1", "~Lars_Schmidt-Thieme1", "~Josif_Grabocka1"], "authors": ["Hadi Samer Jomaa", "Lars Schmidt-Thieme", "Josif Grabocka"], "keywords": ["Hyper-parameter Optimization", "Transfer Learning", "Meta-learning"], "abstract": "Zero-shot hyper-parameter optimization refers to the process of selecting hyper- parameter configurations that are expected to perform well for a given dataset upfront, without access to any observations of the losses of the target response.

Why is this?\n\n- Although the authors claim to have achieved SOTA in Experiment Q3, the performances of the algorithm (Table 4) are dependent on the hyperparameter K, and failure of tuning can be expected to result in worse performance than the other methods. As R#5 mentioned, I don't think we can say that the proposed method is robust unless  considering the proper way to choose K.\n\n- In ablation study, the authors said that the model underfit when all loss is simultaneously used with respect to Optimization Md, is it possible to explain this reason?\n\n- In appendix D, the response model parameter of Algorithm 1 and the meta-feature parameter of Algorithm 5 use the same notation, \\beta. Are they controlled by the completely same parameters in this paper?

Based on your recommendation, we have added the results of this method to Table 4 in the updated draft.\n\n**Comment**: As for using a discrete search space, GP based bayesian optimization works best with continuous parameters, and most HPO algorithms have no issues working directly in a continuous space. One would think a very high definition discretization is always better, but actually as I described with a discretization that is very finely grained the algorithm would converge towards the top k selected candidates being always the same. \n\n*Rebuttal*: You are correct, because for most HPO algorithms, the surrogates are defined solely over the domain of hyper-parameter configurations. However, we extend the domain over the datasets themselves, a particular advantage for HPO.  \nDiscretization of continuous spaces has also been investigated in [2]. Unfortunately optimizing general black box functions is outside our problem definition, since finding suitable meta-features for black-box functions is not straightforward and constitutes an interesting line of research for future work.\n\n\nWe hope that these findings address your concerns, and we welcome any additional feedback. \n\n\n[1] Wistuba, Martin, Nicolas Schilling, and Lars Schmidt-Thieme. \"Sequential model-free hyperparameter tuning.\" 2015 IEEE international conference on data mining.

We have replaced the average best baselines with the average rank, selecting the hyper-parameters with the highest average ranking score across the meta-train datasets. We also added intermediary zero-shot results to Table 3. \n\nWe would like to kindly point out that one of the additional merits of our proposed algorithm that distinguishes it from the rest of the zero-shot baselines is that it provides a well-initialized surrogate that can adapt to any target dataset. \n\n**Comment**: This encourages a diverse set of configurations, as opposed to just picking the best average ones, which is likely to select very similar hyperparameters I would suggest using standard deviation (or standard error) instead of variance, as it has the same unit as the mean. In the graph approximate confidence intervals mean +- 1.96 * std dev / sqrt(N) can be used, if I understand your setup correctly in your setup you should have N = 24 \n\n*Rebuttal*: Thank you for pointing that out. You are correct, per split, we evaluate on 24 test datasets. The reported results represent the average across 5-splits (total 120 datasets) of the average of the 24 test datasets per split, and the 1x standard deviation of the average across 5 splits. We updated the draft and pointed that out.\n\n**Comment**: My concern with the heuristic (picking at random from the top k), is that the idea is not even so well defined. Given a continuous space all top k points would be one infinitesimal distance from each other. This means that it only makes sense (and provide something different from the best predicted configuration) if the space is discretized, but then the question is how does one discretize the space, and how does one chose k. And why would that work robustly? Now to be clear, bayesian methods have their own issues, and often it's better to have good empirical results than theoretical guarantees based on dubious assumptions, but ideally I would need more discussion and stronger results to be convinced that such a heuristic would work robustly.\n\n*Rebuttal*: We define our problem setting for discrete spaces in consistency with the literature. Zero-shot transfer learning solutions for HPO in continuous spaces is an interesting challenge for future work. We introduce top-k, a heuristic acquisition function, as a variant of our top-1 approach due to the lack of uncertainty of our proposed surrogate model. Similar approaches have been seen in Reinforcement Learning settings with \\epsilon-greedy policies that guarantee exploration.\n\n**Comment**: Lastly, I think the exposition is still a little chaotic, for an idea that is fairly simple, and some of the changes seem a little unpolished.\n\n*Rebuttal*: We thank you again for pointing out the typos. We hope that the current description of the approach is more self-contained and clear for the readers.\n\nWe would like to note out that even though the idea sounds simplistic, we are the first to propose an optimization approach for hyper-parameter optimization that extends the surrogate definition to the joint dataset/hyper-parameter domain, i.e. relies directly on the datasets, and the first to propose the novel regularization technique that proves its importance in the Ablation Study. \n\nWe welcome any further remarks!\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3283/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3283/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Zero-shot Transfer Learning for Gray-box Hyper-parameter Optimization", "authorids": ["~Hadi_Samer_Jomaa1", "~Lars_Schmidt-Thieme1", "~Josif_Grabocka1"], "authors": ["Hadi Samer Jomaa", "Lars Schmidt-Thieme", "Josif Grabocka"], "keywords": ["Hyper-parameter Optimization", "Transfer Learning", "Meta-learning"], "abstract": "Zero-shot hyper-parameter optimization refers to the process of selecting hyper- parameter configurations that are expected to perform well for a given dataset upfront, without access to any observations of the losses of the target response.

I think this should be given more attention ...\n\n*Rebuttal*: In our understanding the capacity and architecture of the surrogate models is dependent on the configuration space (hence, meta-dataset dependent), because the complexity of the interaction between the hyper-parameters of a ML method differs from the interaction of the hyper-parameters of other ML methods. In the submission version of the paper, we conducted a search for the best architecture for every meta-dataset based on the best validation score on the respective held-out validation meta-dataset. To be clear we divided each meta-dataset into training, validation and test splits of the meta-tasks and tuned the architecture of the surrogate on the validation split.\n\nHowever, we agree with your point that for generalizing the surrogate architecture to future meta-datasets it is beneficial for practitioners to have a fixed surrogate that is efficient on all meta-datasets. To show that a single unique surrogate architecture is efficient on all meta-datasets we conducted a new experiment by picking the best architecture based on the average validation meta-dataset score for all our meta-datasets. We uploaded a new version of the paper with the new results using a single fixed architecture for all meta-datasets.\t\t\n\nThe exact protocol of choosing the architecture is detailed in Section 4, page 5 of the new paper draft, as well as Appendix E.\n\n**Comment**: It is also not clear if the model can avoid getting stuck in local minima?\n\n*Rebuttal*: A probabilistic version of the proposed meta-learned surrogate would be really interesting for a future work. We need to research efficient ways of modeling uncertainty with our surrogate neural networks. At the moment, given the lack of a probabilistic neural network, our exploration is ensured by a heuristic acquisition, which does not select the best configuration, but instead a random one among the top-k best. \n\nTo show that our method does not get stuck in a local optima, we extend the HPO experiments for more trials (from previously 50 to 75), see Section 5.4, page 8, as well as Table 4. As you can see, not only does our method avoid getting stuck in local optima, but is also better than probabilistic meta-learned surrogates. \n\n**Comment**: Algorithm 3 in the appendix mentions the use of an acquisition function ... \n\n*Rebuttal*: We introduce Algorithm 4 to formally define GROSI(+X), the sequential optimization variant of our model. \n\n**Comment**: Normalized regret never defined.\n\n*Rebuttal*: The regret represents the distance between an observed response and the optimal response on a response surface. For hyper-parameter optimization, the meta-datasets are provided beforehand, consequently the optimal response is known. The normalized regret represents the regret when the response surface is normalized between (0,1). We provide a definition in the updated draft. The definition can be found in Section 5.1, page 5\n\n**Comment**: Simple idea, although not described so straighforwardly ...\n\t\n*Rebuttal*: Thanks for the suggestion, we use the extra page to to improve and elaborate the description of our proposed approach.\n\n**Comment**: The algorithm is not very principled from a probabilistic standpoint when used in setting Q3 ...\n\n*Rebuttal*: We added a new experiment with more trials to inspect whether our method plateaus eventually and we do not see the behavior you suggest (see Figure 2). Instead, we observe that our method converges faster to the best configuration than the baselines, which have a probabilistic Bayesian optimization strategy. \n\n**Comment**: The theory sections in the main text are fairly standard ...\n\n*Rebuttal*: You are right, we updated the text to improve readability.\n\n**Comment**: In general the paper is not really self contained, instead a lot of the important details are contained in the appendix. I would also suggest to be clearer about what the main contribution is.\n\n*Rebuttal*: We agree, based on your suggestions, we will use the extra page to make the paper more self-contained.\n\n**Comment**: Any uncertainty quantification (confidence intervals or error bars) in the results is missing ...\n\n*Rebuttal*: We added the uncertainty quantification to the new draft in all the Tables and Figures, as well as the Appendices.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3283/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3283/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Zero-shot Transfer Learning for Gray-box Hyper-parameter Optimization", "authorids": ["~Hadi_Samer_Jomaa1", "~Lars_Schmidt-Thieme1", "~Josif_Grabocka1"], "authors": ["Hadi Samer Jomaa", "Lars Schmidt-Thieme", "Josif Grabocka"], "keywords": ["Hyper-parameter Optimization", "Transfer Learning", "Meta-learning"], "abstract": "Zero-shot hyper-parameter optimization refers to the process of selecting hyper- parameter configurations that are expected to perform well for a given dataset upfront, without access to any observations of the losses of the target response.

That is, a model is introduced to learn how to learn a group of optimal parameters based on the given meta-features. The acquisition function, meta-features extraction, meta-learning optimization method, the dataset similarity loss, etc., are all borrowed from prior works.\n\n*Rebuttal*: Sure, as almost all papers we use a lot of existing methods. But our contribution is not just a new combination of pre-existing things, but we are the first to present a neural-network based surrogate function that regresses directly from the dataset to the response, without the use of pre-estimated (engineered or learnt) meta-features. We also design a novel similarity-driven regularization term, Equation 4. \n\n**Comment**: The meta-features of datasets are directly computed by Dataset2Vec [1]. This paper points out that prior methods rely on engineered meta-features, but actually [1] can be applied to improve them as well.

My concern is that the information may be considerably dropped than measuring similarity by inter-distributional distance.\n\n*Rebuttal*: To the best of our knowledge, in all the HPO literature there is no such inter-distributional distance being used. The problem here is especially, that the instances from different datasets will have different predictors, we are not sure that interdistributional distances can be easily applied to such a scenario.\n\n**Comment**: The algorithm in the appendix doesn't have a section on learning meta features, how (and when) are these updated in the algorithm?\n\n*Rebuttal*: We added Algorithm 5 to describe the process of learning meta-features, we also added a new experiment that uses D2V meta-features, a variant of the TST approach, which we call TST-R For our method, we learn the meta-features end-to-end by optimizing Equation 8, page 5.

In contrast to standard HPO approaches, where HPs are found for each task by random/grid search or Bayesian Global Optimisation or sequential model based optimisation, the proposed approach learns a response model defined over the combined domain of datasets and hyper-parameters such that for a new task, for which training data and labels and some ranges of HPs are given, HPO can be done by querying the response model without having to evaluate the black-box function of the validation loss as a standard HPO would do. \n\nI think the manuscript is very well written, the motivation is sound, the related work section includes many relevant and well summarized examples of similar approaches, the notation and the presentation of the proposed approach are intuitiv and concise. \n\nOne thing that could probably be improved a bit is the coherence of the text, I mean, I had to jump a lot between the Appendix and the paper to understand some necessary details. For instance the core of the approach in section 4, and eqs 3-5 are very difficult to understand without the information referenced in the last paragraph of that section. I wonder if it would be possible to mention some of the relevant information, e.g. how eq. 5 is optimized or how the dataset2vec features are learned, right in section 4. \n\nThe experimental evaluation appears solid and comprehensive. I like how the authors investigated their approach in three different settings. Compared with a large number of alternative approaches the proposed approach achieves improvements in all HPO settings, \u2018cold-start\u2019, \u2018warm-start\u2019 and continuous learning of the response model. One question I had when thinking about the experiments is that the proposed approach relies on a number of parameters to be chosen well, in particular the HPs that determine the computation of the meta features and the response model. It appears that the response model used some basic settings that were not optimised for the task, but I still wonder how sensitive the learning of the response model is to the choice of hyper parameters. That includes the 'generalisation performance' of the dataset2vec model and all other ingredients of the response model, apart from the validation loss of the black/grey-box ML model.\n\nWhen comparing the proposed approach with existing approaches, it seems that at least some of the aspects that make this work so well should also be captured in other approaches that use some dataset features in a transfer learning HPO setting. Some of them are mentioned in the related work section (Perrone et al, Volpp et al, Feurer et al, \u2026) but especially the experimental setting of SEQUENTIAL GRAY-BOX FUNCTION OPTIMIZATION looks very similar to reinforcement learning approaches to HPO which include dataset features in their policy (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11527). Given these similarities and the strong empirical results it would be great to get a better understanding of which elements that are different to existing work contribute most. The ablation study in Appendix F.2 is great, and could be discussed in the main text especially in relation to other work. \n\nTo summarise I think the experimental validation suggests that this approach has potential to improve the state of the art in HPO. Some relevant details of the method are not entirely clear, or at least could be better described in the main text. Also in the experimental evaluation it could made clearer that the results are not sensitive to the tuning of the, pretty complex, HPs of the response model itself.  \n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3283/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3283/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Zero-shot Transfer Learning for Gray-box Hyper-parameter Optimization", "authorids": ["~Hadi_Samer_Jomaa1", "~Lars_Schmidt-Thieme1", "~Josif_Grabocka1"], "authors": ["Hadi Samer Jomaa", "Lars Schmidt-Thieme", "Josif Grabocka"], "keywords": ["Hyper-parameter Optimization", "Transfer Learning", "Meta-learning"], "abstract": "Zero-shot hyper-parameter optimization refers to the process of selecting hyper- parameter configurations that are expected to perform well for a given dataset upfront, without access to any observations of the losses of the target response.

The proposed method incorporates two ideas from the meta-learning framework namely the task similarity based on the meta-features and the dataset identification. The former idea is used to achieve the requirement that responses to similar data sets should be similar.The latter idea has the role of preventing data of dissimilar tasks from being embedded in close proximity in the meta-feature space.\n\nIn this paper, the authors construct a new meta-dataset to evaluate the proposed method by compare it with various HPO methods (both zero-shot approach and sequential model based approach).\n\nWhile the performances of various HPO tasks certainly seems to have improved, there are some concerns.\n\n- How can you justify the proposed approach  which measures domain similarity in terms of distances between meta-features  (some kind of point estimation), rather than inter-distributional distances? My concern is that the information may be considerably dropped than measuring similarity by inter-distributional distance.\n\n- The algorithm in the appendix doesn't have a section on learning meta features, how (and when) are these updated in the algorithm?\n\n- Appendix B.1 defines a regularization term for dataset identification. \n\n  -- Although the range of \\hat{s} is defined as {0, 1}, in (8) \\hat{s} appears to be a continuous value. Are you using some kind of threshold to make it binary? \n\n  -- The authors argue that  \"Without loss of generality, we use the Euclidean distance to measure the similarity between the extracted meta features, ... and \\gamma = 1\".

In Appendix B.1, it mentioned that using the similarity regularization defined in Equation 4. alone is not sufficient to measure the dataset similarity, so an additional similarity metric Equation 9. is used. What is the impact of directly replacing the distance metric in Equation 4. with Equation 9?\n\n2. Since the similarity regularization is computed using K selected datasets, and \"for each meta-dataset the architecture of the models are selected based on their performance on their validation datasets\", how to ensure that the proposed universal model trained on these K datasets can be generalized to other datasets.\n\n3.

They use transfer learning from related tasks as well as learned meta-features for each task, and then simply pick the hyperparamater configuration predicted to perform best by this NN based model.\n\nThe authors provide results on 3 meta-datasets, each a slightly different hyperparamter optimization problem applied to the same 120 UCI datasets, thus providing relataed task for each of these three settings. The algorithm can be used in three modes Q1, as a zero-shot algorithm to immediately select the best performing hyperparameters Q2, as an initialization strategy used in the same way as Q1 but followed by a traditional sequential HPO algorithm, and Q3, as a standalone sequential tuning algorithm, by updating the model with any new evaluations, and then using it to suggest the configurations to evaluate next.\n\n\n#### Comments / Questions\nA crucial detail, that is only cursorly mentioned in the main test, is that the authors tune the architecture of their model to be adapted to the specific meta-dataset used (as described in table 5 in appendix D). I think this should be given more attention, having to tune the surrogate hyperparameters itself seems a fairly major limitation of the method and should be discussed. It is not clear exactly how many different architectures were tested, what the search space was, and how well any specific architecture would generalize to new meta-datasets, or even new datasets on the same meta-dataset.\n\nWithout more details on how the tuning of the surrogate architecture exactly happened, it does not seem possible to apply this method to other meta-datasets, making the paper incomplete a non-reproducable.\n\nIt is also not clear can the model can avoid getting stuck in local minima? I would be curious why this was not a problem with the Q3 experiments without the exploration usually given by a probabilistic model.\n\nAlgorithm 3 in the appendix mentions the use of an acquisition function, but the proposed model does not appear to be probabilistic, so it is not really clear what kind of acquisition function would be used here.\n\nNormalized regret used for all results is never defined.\n\n#### Pros\n* Important use case/setting (expeciall Q1 and Q2)\n* Simple idea, although not described so straighforwardly, I would avoid all the talk of a grey-box method and focus more on simplicity and the idea of providing a good and simple zero-shot NN model that is able to use meta-features in an effective way\n* Meta-datasets useful for research are being published with the paper (or at any rate promised to be published upon acceptance)\n* The experimental results look fairly competitive (although with some of the shortcomings and open questions I mention in this review)\n\n\n#### Cons\n* The authors tune their model architecture to be adapted to each specific meta-dataset, but this tuning process is not well described, making the method hard to reproduce.\n* The algorithm is not very principled from a probabilistic standpoint when used in setting Q3, the used exploitation and exploration trade off is just an heuristic, and not guaranteed to provide good exploration. I would expect it to plateau at a much worse value than bayesian optimization methods. Honestly I would think the paper would be stronger without this use case described, and more more focus given to the results and the zero-shot case.\n* The theory sections in the main text are fairly standard and could be shortened a lot, as well as not really needed to explain the method used, what is more relevant is the actual model used, in terms of architecture and tuning. In the current version the architecture is relegated to the appendix and the tuning absent.\n* In general the paper is not really self contained, instead a lot of the important details are contained in the appendix. I would also suggest to be clearer about what the main contribution is.\n* Any uncertainty quantification (confidence intervals or error bars) in the results is missing, thus it is difficult to assess how reliable the results are.\n\n\nI think in the current state the paper is not ready to be published. However the idea is simple and promising. I would suggest the authors improve the description of the experimental results, comparing against some more zero-shot baselines. Also either the tuning process of the model itself should be described in more detail in the main text, or not be required (in case a more general architecture can be provided).\n\n\n\n#### Typos/Other minor comments\nIt would be using always use the same term instead of simetimes probabilistic surrogate and other times response model.\n\nThe way l_hat and the selection of the surrogate is chosen by max likelihood is a bit convoluted, but as I said above, I don't think the theory sections in the main text add much insight into the method, just direcly describe the loss.\n\nSection 4:\ninputting -> taking as input\npage 14 first paragraph:\nto optimize outer loop -> to optimize *the* outer loop\nAppendix B1:  learningJomaa -> missing space\nAppendix Q1: typos in \"but the time training required time of underlying model.\"", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3283/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3283/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Zero-shot Transfer Learning for Gray-box Hyper-parameter Optimization", "authorids": ["~Hadi_Samer_Jomaa1", "~Lars_Schmidt-Thieme1", "~Josif_Grabocka1"], "authors": ["Hadi Samer Jomaa", "Lars Schmidt-Thieme", "Josif Grabocka"], "keywords": ["Hyper-parameter Optimization", "Transfer Learning", "Meta-learning"], "abstract": "Zero-shot hyper-parameter optimization refers to the process of selecting hyper- parameter configurations that are expected to perform well for a given dataset upfront, without access to any observations of the losses of the target response.
