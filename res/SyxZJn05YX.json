We really appreciate it and have uploaded a newer version of the manuscript (fonts marked as blue where there is a major change).\n\n>>> The method of obtaining the representative in buffer is not clearly presented; f_critic^j may be the j-th element of F_critic, please denote what f_critic^j stands for.\n\n[RESPONSE]: We have modified the manuscript in Sec. 3.2 to better explain how the representative (b_i) is obtained. It is the average feature representation of one class, taken samples (the critic output) from all the large objects as training evolves. Specifically, we add a new Eqn. (2) besides the original Eqn. (1) to mathematically explain how the representative (b_i) is computed.\n\nf_critic^j is indeed the j-th element (entry) of F_critic:\n\nF_critc = {f_critic^0, f_critic_^1, \u2026, f_critic^j, ...}          (no notation of \u201clarge/small\u201d and \u201cl\u201d for brevity here)\n\nPlease refer to the new Section 3.2.\n\n>>> Overall training and inference procedure are not clearly presented.\n\n[RESPONSE]: Sorry for leaving reviewer such an impression. We do have a \u201ctraining and test details\u201d section (Section 6.5) in the appendix. The room for the main paper might be tight so we put it apart from the main paper. We have added more details about the overall network structure in Sec 6.5. \n\n>>> What\u2019s the higher level feature map P_m? How did you choose the higher level feature map at the m-th level in option (b) and (c) in Section 3.3; what is the meaning of the \u201cpast\u201d features in Section 3.2?\n\n[RESPONSE]: The higher level feature maps P_m serve as the input source for the RoI layer in the large-object set. \u201cm (or l)\u201d denotes the feature map output in different ResNet stages (corresponding to different resolutions). In ResNet, there are five stages (l or m = 1, ...5); one stage might have a bunch of resnet blocks. The higher one stage is, the higher level semantics it stands for. We use last four levels/stages (P_2, \u2026, P_5) to construct P_m (or P_l). l is the current level and m is the level that is higher than l. For example, if l = 3, then m = 4 and 5.\n\nWe have modified Sec. 3.3 to add a footnote about the meaning of P_m and how we choose P_m accordingly in the \u201cOption (b) \u2026.\u201d paragraph (at the end of page 5). \n\n\u201cPast\u201d features in Section 3.2. It means we take the average of features in all large objects that the network has seen in the past mini-batch/iteration training. We revised the sentence a little bit to make it more clear (last few sentences in the paragraph below Enq. (2)).\n\n>>> Better to show the exact structure of the make-up module and critic module.\n\n[RESPONSE]: We have added a separate section (Section 6.6 Network structure in feature intertwiner) in the appendix as requested. And we add a sentence in the main paper (Sec 3.1) to let readers know about this. \n\n>>> The sentences at the bottom of p.4 starting with \"Note that only~\" looks ambiguous. \n\n[RESPONSE]: This sentence is for making sure the audience understands that the feature intertwiner is not applied during inference, since we don\u2019t know which objects are assigned as large objects for the current level. Thus there is no way to compute the buffer. Only the blue part (for the small object stream) in Figure 2 will be applied during inference. We have shortened the sentence to make it more clear. \n\n>>> Can this method apply to the other backbones such as VGG or ResNets without FPN? More than two datasets are necessary to show the effectiveness of the methods.\n\n[RESPONSE]: Yes, it can be applied to other backbones with FPN, since the assignment of large/small set is independent of the specific structure.\n\nAs reviewer requested, we have adopted two additional backbone structures (resnet without FPN and VGG-16) to verify the effectiveness of our feature intertwiner on PASCAL VOC 2007. The results are shown in Table 5 in the appendix. For ResNet-101, the division of the four levels are similar as ResNet-101-FPN on COCO; for VGG-16, we take the division similarly as stated in SSD.  Specifically, the output of layer \u2018conv7\u2019, \u2018conv8_2\u2019, \u2018conv9_2\u2019 and \u2018conv10_2\u2019 are used for P_2 to P_5, respectively. \n\nOur method performs favorably against others in both backbone structures on the PASCAL dataset. For example, using VGG-16, we achieve a mAP of 73.1%, compared with SSD 71.6%, Faster-RCNN 69.9% and Fast R-CNN 66.9%.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper961/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper961/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper961/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Feature Intertwiner for Object Detection", "abstract": "A well-trained model should classify objects with unanimous score for every category.

We really appreciate it and have uploaded a newer version of the manuscript (fonts marked as blue where there is a major change).\n\n>>> Class buffer seems very restricted in having a single element per category per scale to represent all features. A dictionary approach with multiple elements give more flexibility to the model and learn a richer representation at the cost of not-so-good clustering?\n\n[RESPONSE]: by saying \u201ca single element\u201d in the class buffer, the reviewer might refer to the output of the critic in Figure 2 (a 1024-dim feature vector for each category) as a single element, if we understand correctly.\n\nOne possible solution to implement the reviewer\u2019s suggestion would be, given the critic output - the feature representation for each category, we further feed it into a GMM (Gaussian Mixture Models) to generate different modes (\u201cdifferent elements\u201d in reviewer\u2019s language) for each category, in hope that the GMM outputs would enrich the representation and give more flexibility to the model. Well there are several concerns in this alternative for the buffer design. \n\n(1) First, the number of modes (number of mixtures) for each class is hard to define. For example, a \u201ckite\u201d might be easy to recognize as long as we have sort of \u201cappearance\u201d mode; a \u201ctrain\u201d category might need more modes than \u201cappearance\u201d since it can be visually very close to \u201cbus\u201d.\n\n(2) Let\u2019s say, the number of modes/elements is set to be the same across all categories, denoted as K. The output of GMM would be K vectors, each with D dimensions. We then compare the difference of distributions between the large and small set. We doubt it would work better since it complicates the case in feature space with K*D-dim features, compared to the current design of D-dim.\n\n>>> Why drop performance for couch? (and baseball bat + bedroll)\n\n[RESPONSE]: Aha, good catch! The \u201ccouch\u201d category extremely degrades the performance (~2.x% drop) while the drop for \u201cbaseball bat\u201d and \u201cbroccoli\u201d is minor. After browsing the images that contain \u201ccouch\u201d (http://cocodataset.org/#explore), we find that for a large couch in the image, usually there sit a bunch of people, stuff, pets. And yet the annotations in these cases would cover the whole scenario including these \u201cnoises\u201d, making the feature representation of the large couch, quite inaccurate. The less accurate features would guide the learning of their small counterparts, making AP of this class unreliable. \n\nFor some examples here:\nhttp://cocodataset.org/#explore?id=445620\nhttp://cocodataset.org/#explore?id=346272\nhttp://cocodataset.org/#explore?id=128113 \n\nWe have added the discussion above following the first paragraph in Sec. 4.2. \n  \n\n>>> Result of \u201cMask RCNN, updated result\u201d in Appendix, Table 4\n\n[RESPONSE]: It was mistakenly reported in the table. Our bad. The numbers shown in the appendix \u201c39.2 62.5 41.6 || 43.5 65.9 47.2\u201d is the result taken from the fifth row of Table 8 in the Mask-RCNN paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06870.pdf). The first three numbers are actually the *segmentation* mAP, which is irrelevant of our task while the last three numbers are the desired *bounding box* mAP. Hence the correct number should be:\n\nMask RCNN, updated result \t|  ResNetX-101-FPN   |   43.5    65.9   47.2   |  -         -          -\nInterNet (ours)\t\t\t        |  ResNet-101-FPN     |    42.5    65.1  49.4   | 25.4   46.6    54.3\nInterNet (multi-scale)                 |  ResNet-101-FPN     |    44.2    67.5   51.1  | 27.2   50.3    57.7\n\nSince we don\u2019t find the 43.5% model in the official model zoo (https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/blob/master/MODEL_ZOO.md), the evaluation of the small, medium and large object is thus missing. But based on the mAP of 43.5%, which is better than ours without multi-scale (42.5%), we guess it would be better in some metrics.\n\nThe updated Mask-RCNN result increases the original performance from 38.2% to 43.5% by switching the backbone structure to ResNetX, an updated baseline model, ImageNet-5k pre-training and train-time augmentation. It is better than ours and this is probably due to the change of network structure. Our multi-scale version (44.2%) is better than the updated Mask-RCNN result, however.\n\nWe have correctified Table 4 in the appendix and added the discussion above in the first paragraph of Sec. 6.4."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper961/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper961/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper961/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Feature Intertwiner for Object Detection", "abstract": "A well-trained model should classify objects with unanimous score for every category.

We really appreciate it and have uploaded a newer version of the manuscript (fonts marked as blue where there is a major change).\n\n>>> Authors should discuss the difference with self-paced learning.\n\n[RESPONSE]: With all due respect, we might doubt there is little resemblance of our method to the self-paced learning [kumar2010] except the fact that, both methods have two sets.\n\n[kumar2010] Kumar, M.; Packer, B.; and Koller, D. Self-paced learning for latent variable models. In NIPS 2010.\n\n(Since the reviewer doesn\u2019t give a specific reference to self-paced learning (SPL), we looked into the literature and found the reference above that might be the most relevant for consideration)\n\n(1) SPL uses one (easy one) of the two sets first and then involves the second (hard one) to optimize the objective function. The division of sets is based on the easiness of samples and can be deemed as a way of *separating samples*, in order to optimize hidden variables. There is no *interaction* between two sets in SPL.\n\n(2) The division of sets for our method is motivated by the fact that one set is reliable and the other is less reliable; they share similar feature distribution. Thus these two sets can mutually help each other towards a more compact cluster within one class (mainly the reliable one helped the less reliable one). It is deemed as a way of interacting two sets from the very start during the training process, in order to optimize the class centroid in feature space. Our method always *interact* with the two sets simultaneously by the inherent design in feature intertwiner.\n\n(3) Besides, the definition of sets in [kumar2010] is also different than ours. The easy examples (which they define as those that generate a smaller loss, and refers to the \u201creliable set\u201d in our case) could be a small object, corresponding to the less reliable set, which is contradictory in our setting by definition.\n\nTherefore, we deem these two works are parallel to each other. \n\nWe have added the comparison of our work with SPL at the end of the first paragraph in related work, Sec. 6.1 in the appendix.\n\n\n>>> The method is positioned as a general one for feature learning. Why only apply for object detection? It is expected to see whether it works for classification. More datasets are needed even only for object detection.\n\n[RESPONSE]: The idea of utilising one reliable set to help the feature learning of the less reliable set is very general for feature learning. For now, we apply to object detection only because it is naturally curated for generating these two sets: based on their size/resolution compared with RoI output\u2019s size.\n\nAs for classification, it\u2019s important to divide features from the input into one reliable set and the other less reliable one. It requires some discussions and studies, which is not our focus in this paper. Instead of investigating how to *generate* the two sets, we mainly discuss how to *use* information from the reliable set to guide the learning of the less reliable set.  We will leave the possible extension to image classification as future work.\n\nWe have added one more paragraph in the last conclusion section (Sec. 5) to address reviewer\u2019s concern on this.\n\nPlease note that the title of Section 3 is already shrunk to \u201cFeature Intertwiner for Object Detection\u201d in the first submission. The introduction describes the idea of feature intertwiner in general while the method and experiment sections narrow down the problem into the object detection. We can change the paper\u2019s title as \u201cFeature Intertwiner for Object Detection\u201d based on reviewer\u2019s suggestion.  \n\n[MORE DATASET FOR DETECTION]: We have conducted experiments on another standard object detection dataset to verify our idea. Please see Table 5 in the revised manuscript. On Pascal VOC 2007 dataset, we achieve a mAP of 73.1%, compared with SSD 71.6%, Faster-RCNN 69.9% and Fast R-CNN 66.9%.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper961/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper961/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper961/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Feature Intertwiner for Object Detection", "abstract": "A well-trained model should classify objects with unanimous score for every category.

Their key idea is that detecting bigger objects is an easier task and can be used to guide the detection of smaller objects. This is done using the \"Feature Intertwiner\"  which consists of two branches, one for the larger objects (more reliable set that is also easier to detect) and one for the smaller objects (less reliable set). The second branch contains a make-up layer learned during training (which acts as the guidance from the more reliable set) that helps compensate details needed for detection. The authors define a class buffer that contains representative elements of object features from the reliable set for every category & scale and an intertwiner loss that computes the L2 loss between the features from the less reliable set & the class buffer. They also use an Optimal Transport procedure with a Sinkhorn divergence loss between object features from both sets. The overall loss of the system is now a sum of the detection loss, the intertwiner loss and the optimal transport loss. They evaluate their model on the COCO Object detection challenge showing state-of-the-art performance. They also provide thorough ablation analysis of various design choices. The qualitative result in Fig.1 showing well clustered features for both high & low resolution objects via t-SNE is a nice touch.\n\nCOMMENTS:\nClarity - The paper is well written and easy to follow.\nOriginality & Significance - The paper tackles an important problem and provides a novel solution. \nQuality - The paper is complete in that it tackles an important problem, provides a novel solution and demonstrates via thorough experiments the improvement achieved using their approach. \n\nQUESTIONS:\n1. The Class Buffer seems very restricted in having a single element per object category per scale to represent all features. The advantage of forcing such a representation is tight clustering in the feature space. But, wouldn't a dictionary approach with multiple elements give more flexibility to the model and learn a richer feature representation at the cost of not-so-good clustering ?\n2. Any comment on why you drop performance for couch ? (and baseball bat + bedroll)\n3. In Table 4 of Appendix where you compare with more object detection results, I find it interesting that Mask RCNN, updated results has a might higher AP_S (43.5) compared to you (27.2) and everyone else. I was expecting you to be the best under that metric due to the explicit design for small objects. They (MaskRCNN, updated results) are also significantly better than the rest under AP_M but worse under AP_L. Can you explain this behavior ? Is the ResNeXt backbone that much better for small objects ?\n", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper961/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Feature Intertwiner for Object Detection", "abstract": "A well-trained model should classify objects with unanimous score for every category. This requires the high-level semantic features should be alike among samples, despite a wide span in resolution, texture, deformation, etc. Previous works focus on re-designing the loss function or proposing new regularization constraints on the loss. In this paper, we address this problem via a new perspective. For each category, it is assumed that there are two sets in the feature space: one with more reliable information and the other with less reliable source. We argue that the reliable set could guide the feature learning of the less reliable set during training - in spirit of student mimicking teacher\u2019s behavior and thus pushing towards a more compact class centroid in the high-dimensional space. Such a scheme also benefits the reliable set since samples become more closer within the same category - implying that it is easilier for the classifier to identify. We refer to this mutual learning process as feature intertwiner and embed the spirit into object detection. It is well-known that objects of low resolution are more difficult to detect due to the loss of detailed information during network forward pass. We thus regard objects of high resolution as the reliable set and objects of low resolution as the less reliable set. Specifically, an intertwiner is achieved by minimizing the distribution divergence between two sets. We design a historical buffer to represent all previous samples in the reliable set and utilize them to guide the feature learning of the less reliable set. The design of obtaining an effective feature representation for the reliable set is further investigated, where we introduce the optimal transport (OT) algorithm into the framework. Samples in the less reliable set are better aligned with the reliable set with aid of OT metric. Incorporated with such a plug-and-play intertwiner, we achieve an evident improvement over previous state-of-the-arts on the COCO object detection benchmark.", "keywords": ["feature learning", "computer vision", "deep learning"], "authorids": ["yangli@ee.cuhk.edu.hk", "db014@ie.cuhk.edu.hk", "shaoss@link.cuhk.edu.hk", "wanli.ouyang@gmail.com", "xgwang@ee.cuhk.edu.hk"], "authors": ["Hongyang Li", "Bo Dai", "Shaoshuai Shi", "Wanli Ouyang", "Xiaogang Wang"], "TL;DR": "(Camera-ready version) A feature intertwiner module to leverage features from one accurate set to help the learning of another less reliable set.", "pdf": "/pdf/84ec6cb778a53957314e00cf2d51733adcaff22d.pdf", "paperhash": "li|feature_intertwiner_for_object_detection", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nli2018feature,\ntitle={Feature Intertwiners},\nauthor={Hongyang Li and Bo Dai and Shaoshuai Shi and Wanli Ouyang and Xiaogang Wang},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxZJn05YX},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper961/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234337611, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "SyxZJn05YX", "replyto": "SyxZJn05YX", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper961/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335842143, "tmdate": 1552335842143, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper961/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 8}
