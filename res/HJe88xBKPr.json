This is an important issue to address\n\nYes, this can happen. It happens and more frequently with GNMT in the early epochs. This is the exact issue we are addressing with enhanced loss scaling.  \n\nWe see more frequent gradient overflows because of a few outliers in the distribution, while a significant chunk of the gradients experience underflow. \nThis happens more frequently with GNMT because it does not use any normalization layers which lead to more irregular data distributions. Also, RNNs tend to accumulate errors quickly compared to feed-forward networks, this is exacerbated by the additional noise induced by the low precision (FP8). \n\nThe existing loss scaling algorithms treat all overflows equally -- if they see an overflow, they drop the scaling factor. This leads to scaling factor dropping very quickly because of these spurious outliers.\nThe fix we proposed to our algorithm is to ignore a few spurious overflows which are likely a result of the outliers and continue to maintain a higher loss scale value. We accomplish this by setting a \u2018lower threshold\u2019 for the loss scale value to prevent it from going below a certain threshold value even when overflows occur \u2013 and this strategy worked as evidenced by the GNMT result.  \n\nNow, to automate this process, we will add a new variable \u2018consecutive_overflow_threshold\u2019, (=2 or 3 depending on the workload). This will enable the loss scaling algorithm to ignore overflows unless they occur in succession for \u2018consecutive_overflow_threshold\u2019 times, which is a more reliable indicator of a true shift in the gradient distribution, and not caused by spurious outliers. We will also reduce the interval between loss scale updates (from 2000 to 500), so there is a better chance to recover from any inadvertent drop in loss scale value.\n\n>> Moreover, GNMT is kind of old that I doubt the value of a method that only works for GNMT.\n\nGNMT is kind of old, but It is also more difficult to converge at low precision because of the reasons discussed above. This is not the case for feed forward networks that include layer normalization as evidenced by our Transformer result.  Based our observations, we believe automatic loss scaling will work for a large percentage of the feed-forward networks. \n\nWe have updated the paper with the pseudo code for enhanced loss scaling algorithm.\n\n>> it seems that Sec 3.1 is only for GNMT and Sec 3.2 is only for ResNet 50. The motivation now looks confusing. \nSection 3.1 is mostly addressing loss scaling issues of GNMT because other networks we converged did not have any issues with existing loss scaling method. We think GNMT represents kind of an extreme case for the following reasons: \n1.\tit is a recurrent network which tend accumulate gradient errors quickly, which is exacerbated by the noise induced by low-precision. \n2.\tIt does not use any kind of normalization layers, leading to more irregular data distributions, which are difficult handle for the standard loss scaling algorithms. \n\nThe observations from Section 3.2  are applicable across the workloads \u2013 we have chosen Resnet-50 as an example to clearly demonstrate the effects of noise on generalization and how that can be addressed with stochastic rounding.  We have observed similar behavior across all three workloads we have demonstrated \u2013 and they all use stochastic rounding for the gradients. We have not added additional plots for Transformer and GNMT in the interest of space. \n\n>> Please distinguish your stochastic rounding method with reference [1].\n\nStochastic rounding is not new, the difference is in how it was implemented.  Our implementation is more efficient for the following reasons: \n1.\tWe perform stochastic rounding only \u2018once\u2019 after the full MatMul operation is complete. Wang et.al perform stochastic rounding on the accumulator after every few (8 to 32) FMA instructions. This incurs a few orders of magnitude higher overhead compared to our implementation depending on the number of FMA instructions required by MatMul . They also need to replicate this capability inside each FMA unit which costs more power and silicon area. \n2.\t Our rounding method itself is more efficient because we use 8-bit PRNG (LFSR) for generating the random probability. We also reuse the random numbers quite extensively ( > 256 times). This reduces the cost of stochastic rounding hardware quite significantly.   \nWe contribute the following to the state-of-the art FP8 training. \n-\tWe show better coverage across multiple datasets & workloads. As a result, we uncovered issues like gradient noise and loss scaling and propose solutions to handle them. \n-\tWe proposed a better and more efficient approach to implementing  FP8 hardware compared to the one proposed by Wang et.al.  \n- Previous results from Wang et.al. only show results for Resnet 50.\nHence we believe there is significant novelty in the work we presented.

We will attempt to answer your questions below. \nQ1. \nOur intention was to show that both enhanced loss scaling and stochastic rounding are essential for achieving full accuracy with FP8 training.  \nFor example, in section 3.1, our experiments already use \u201cstochastic rounding\u201d on gradients (essential for convergence) to study the impact of loss scaling in isolation. \nSimilarly, in section 3.2 when studying the impact of stochastic rounding, we employed the \u2018best loss scaling strategy\u2019 derived from section 3.1. Perhaps this is not clearly described in the paper. We will edit the text for clarity and upload the new version of the paper.  In Figure 2a, we have compared multiple experimental results to demonstrated impact of using different loss scaling values on final accuracy of Resnet50. \n\nQ2. \nOn stochastic rounding : As we discussed in Section 3.2, rounding plays a significant role for FP8 because the rounding errors are quite large at this precision. It is known that standard rounding methods (up, down, towards zero, away from zero) have a positive or a negative bias to the final distribution. The most popular rounding method used by floating point today is round to nearest even (RNE) \u2013 although this method is free of positive or a negative bias -- it distorts the data distribution to have more even numbers than odd. (more info here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Floating-point_rounding). It is also known that rounding errors grow with longer accumulation chains (like in Convolution and MatMul). For RNE method, the rounding errors grow proportional to the square root of number of accumulations. This is quite significant at extreme low precisions (like FP8) where \u2018episilon\u2019 value is large. \n\nStochastic rounding is bias free because it uses random probability term for tie-breaking. It does not impact the overall data distribution of the tensor and the rounding errors are small and evenly distributed. This makes the accumulation of errors during long accumulation chains much less likely.  \n>> On why Resnet-50 demands a large scaling factor? : \nIn general working with FP8 would require larger scaling factor because FP8 has smaller dynamic range compared to FP16. The smallest number that can be represented by FP16 is 5.96e-8 whereas the smallest number that FP8 can represent is 1.52e-5. This means that a larger percentage of smaller gradients fall \u2018below\u2019 the FP8 range. Hence, we need to use a larger scaling factor to push them up into the FP8 range. \n\nQ3. \nWe would like to clarify that we do not use FP32 in any of our training results. For Resnet-50 , all convolution and batchnorm layers use FP8 -- except the first conv and last FC layers which use FP16; we also use FP16 master copy of weight. This configuration identical to what is used by Wang et.al.-- hence the comparison is fair. \nThe key difference between our implementations is that we use FP32 accumulator (in the ALU) while Wang et.al use a modified FP16 (1-6-9 format) \u2013 as a result, they need to implement additional hardware in the ALU path to perform stochastic rounding on the accumulator to preserve accuracy. Given the complexity of building stochastic rounding hardware, their implementation will be more expensive to build. We discussed these design trade-offs in Section 1.  \n\nQ4. \nWe employ the widely disseminated techniques that are used for FP16 mixed precision training, these are implemented in frameworks such as Tensorflow and PyTorch. Our loss scaling methods are modifications on top of these baseline methods.To answer your specific question : Scale (=2) and threshold (min=2, max=2^14) values are hard-coded in in the current implementation of loss scaling algorithm. The dynamic loss scaling algorithm increments the loss scale value by a factor of \u2018scale\u2019 every 2000 iteration intervals and reduced the loss scale by a factor \u2018scale\u2019 in the case of an occurrence of \u2018NaN\u2019 in the during gradient computation.  For GNMT training, the enhanced loss scaling method updates the \u2018min\u2019 threshold value according to the schedule shown in Figure 2b to prevent the loss scale becoming too small. We will add the description of the algorithm to the paper.   \n\nQ5. \nWe have described the loss scaling methods applied to each model in section 3.1 \nFor Resnet50, we use constant loss scaling of 10K, this is derived empirically through experimentation which are detailed in section 3.1. For GNMT and Transformer, we use dynamic loss scaling implemented by Tensorflow. \n\nQ6. \nFor now, the process of selecting which layers to run at FP8 requires human expertise and intervention. But we expect the future frameworks to automate this process of selecting multiple precision options to maximize performance. Recent work on use of AutoML [1] for mixed-precision quantization is also promising research direction.\n[1] HAQ: Hardware-Aware Automated Quantization with Mixed Precision, Kuan Wang et.al., CVPR 2019.

We believe this method can be automated for GNMT as well. We have observed that GNMT saw wider error gradient distributions which often consisted of outliers that are much larger than the mean. When these outliers are scaled with a large scaling factor, they overflow and cause a NaN when gradients for previous layer are computed. The current automatic loss scaling algorithm is ill-equipped to handle these transient NaNs, it over-corrects (reduces) the loss scale value every time it encounters an outlier, resulting in divergence. Our enhanced loss scaling strategy mitigates this by adding a lower threshold to prevent loss scale value from becoming too small. We believe adding a few additional conditions to loss scaling algorithm will handle this case automatically. \nThe current loss scaling algorithm works like this: \nInitial \u2018loss_scale\u2019 value is set to \u2018max_threshold\u2019.\nWhen a gradient computation results in a NaN, reduce the loss_scale by a factor of \u2018scale\u2019 (=2)\nIf there is another NaN within the \u2018interval\u2019, the loss scale is further reduced by a factor of 2. \nIf there is no NaN encountered for \u2018interval\u2019 (=2000) iterations, the \u2018loss_scale\u2019 value is increased by a factor of 2 \nWhen the gradients have lot of outliers, we would see more of these spurious NaNs and the \u2018loss_scale\u2019 value quickly drops. One or more of the following solutions can be applied to solve this. \n1.\tReduce \u2018interval\u2019 to a smaller iteration count (=200) so the \u2018loss_scale\u2019 value can recover to quickly from a previous drop. \n2.\tIgnore a few NaNs unless they appear in consecutive iterations. This will address the over-correction  (similar to setting a lower threshold) \n3.\tA more generic solution is to derive layer-wise scaling factor which is aware of the gradient distribution at each layer [1] \nAs per your feedback, we will update the paper with a description and/or a flow chart of this algorithm. \n\nQ2. On connection between the norm and rounding technique.\n\nAs we discussed in Section 3.2, rounding plays a significant role in FP8 training because rounding errors are quite large at this precision. It is known that round to nearest even (RNE) distorts the data distribution to have more even numbers than odd. As a result of this when using RNE, rounding errors grow at the rate proportional to square root of number of accumulations. (more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Floating-point_rounding) \nIn Figure 3c, we are showing the result of these accumulated errors on the weight distribution. The overall weight distribution is shifted towards larger numbers resulting in increasing \u201cL2_loss\u201d (=sum of squares of the weights). Since l2_loss is used as a \u2018regularization\u2019 term ( loss =cross_entropy+l2_loss), the loss increases as the rounding errors keep accumulating. This leads to loss of generalization, as shown in Figure 3a and 3b \u2013 the training loss keeps going down while validation loss is increasing.  \n\nTo avoid using l2_loss term, we tried using \u2018drop out\u2019 method and trained without any regularization. Though the validation error improved in both these cases, there was still a significant gap in final accuracy due to ineffectiveness of these regularization methods. \n\nThen then we went back to l2 regularization \u2013 this time addressing the rounding errors in the gradients using stochastic rounding. This helped keep the accumulation of errors in check and the we achieved SOTA accuracy. \n\nQ3. \nThe single hyper-parameter used for loss scaling indicates whether to use a \u2018static\u2019 or a \u2018dynamic\u2019 loss scaling method. We will add this detail to experiments section. \n\n Q3b. On the relevance of Banner et.al. [3] as an important baseline.\n\nIn our case the update is not full precision. We compute weight gradients at FP8 precision and we use FP8 weight gradients and FP16 master weights for the weight update operation. In Figure 1 we are showing FP32 because the internal accumulator in ALU unit is FP32, during weight update the weights are accumulated into FP32 accumulator and are converted to FP16 before they are written out to the master copy, we have described this in Section 3, para 3. \nIn contrast Banner et.al [3] use a technique called \u2018gradient bifurcation\u2019 where they only quantize one of the two convolutions in the backward pass. They maintain two copies of the error gradient one of which is at full precision. The full precision copy is used to compute the error gradients at FP32 precision and passed down to the previous layer.  \nHope that helps clarify your questions.  \n\n[1] Adaptive Loss Scaling for Mixed Precision Training, Ruizhe Zhao, Brian Vogel, Tanvir Ahmed \n[2] Wang N, Choi J, Brand D, et al.

Is there any automatical way or heuristic deciding way? \n\nWe believe this can be automated. We have observed that GNMT saw wider error gradient distributions which often consisted of outliers that are much larger than the mean. This is exacerbated by the additional noise induced as a result of using lower precision (FP8) for error gradients. When these outliers are scaled with a large scaling factor, they overflow and cause a NaN when gradients for previous layer are computed. The current automatic loss scaling algorithm is ill-equipped to handle these transient NaNs, it over-corrects (reduces) the loss scale value every time it encounters an outlier, resulting in divergence. Our enhanced loss scaling strategy mitigates this by adding a 'minimum threshold' to prevent loss scale value from becoming too small. We believe adding a few additional conditions to loss scaling algorithm will handle this case automatically. \n\nThe current loss scaling algorithm works like this: \nInitial \u2018loss_scale\u2019 value is set to \u2018max_threshold\u2019.\nWhen a gradient computation results in a NaN, reduce the loss_scale by a factor of \u2018scale\u2019 (=2)\nIf there is another NaN within the \u2018interval\u2019, the loss scale is further reduced by a factor of 2. \nIf there is no NaN encountered for \u2018interval\u2019 (=2000) iterations, the \u2018loss_scale\u2019 value is increased by a factor of 2 \n\nWhen the gradients have lot of outliers, we would see more of these spurious NaNs and the \u2018loss_scale\u2019 value quickly drops. One or more of the following enhancements can be applied to automatic loss scaling algorithm to address this:\n \n1.\tReduce \u2018interval\u2019 to a smaller iteration count (=200) so the \u2018loss_scale\u2019 value can recover to quickly from a previous drop. \n2.\tIgnore a few NaNs unless they appear in consecutive iterations. This will address the over-correction  (similar to setting a lower threshold) \n3.\tA more generic solution is to derive layer-wise scaling factor which is aware of the gradient distribution at each layer [1] \n\nQ2: The stochastic rounding method is very intuitive. How do you choose the value of \"r\" in the equation? Is it a sensitive hyper-parameter or not?\n\nWe appreciate the positive feedback. \nThe value of \u201cr\u201d is an 8-bit random number generated using LFSR random number generator. We also reuse these random numbers (for about 256 times) to save on the overheads to generate these numbers. \n\nWe will fix the typos and grammatical errors you pointed out and update the paper. \n\nHope this clarifies your questions. \n\n[1] Adaptive Loss Scaling for Mixed Precision Training, Ruizhe Zhao, Brian Vogel, Tanvir Ahmed (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.12385)"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2323/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2323/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["naveen.k.mellempudi@intel.com", "sudarshan.srinivasan@intel.com", "dipankar.das@intel.com", "bharat.kaul@intel.com"], "title": "Mixed Precision Training With 8-bit Floating Point", "authors": ["Naveen Mellempudi", "Sudarshan Srinivasan", "Dipankar Das", "Bharat Kaul"], "pdf": "/pdf/7521b8ec6f4a9e37eeb6be057dfe0021258c5ed6.pdf", "TL;DR": "We demonstrated state-of-the-art training results using 8-bit floating point representation, across Resnet, GNMT, Transformer.", "abstract": "Reduced precision computation is one of the key areas addressing the widening\u2019compute gap\u2019, driven by an exponential growth in deep learning applications.

Finally, they get a slightly better validation accuracy compared to full precision baseline. Overall, this paper focuses on engineering techniques about mixed precision training with 8-bit floating point, and state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple data sets shows the effectiveness of their work. \n\nHowever, there are some problems to be clarified.\n1. The authors apply several techniques to improve the precision for training with 8-bit floating point, but they do not show the gain for each individual. For example, how much improvement can this work achieve when just using enhanced loss scaling method or a stochastic rounding technique? This should be clearly presented and more experimental comparison is expected.\n\n2. The paper should present a bit more background knowledge and discussion on the adopted techniques. For instance, why the stochastic rounding method proposed in this article by adding a random value in probability can regulate quantization noise in the gradients? And why Resnet-50 demands a large scaling factor?\n\n3. On Table 3, in comparison with Wang et al. (2018), the authors use layers with FP32 (not FP16 in Wang). Thus, it is hard to say the improvement comes from the proposed 8-bit training. This should be clarified.\n\n4. How to set the hyper-parameters, such as scale, thresholds and so on, is not clear in the paper. There are no guidelines for readers to use these techniques.\n\n5. The authors did not give a clear description of the implement for the enhanced loss scaling. They apply different loss scaling methods for different networks. This should be explained in detail.\n\n6. In the experiment, for a single model, some layers are 8-bit, some layers are 32-bit and some layers are 16-bit.  Is the 8-bit training only applicable for a part of the model?  How do we know which layer is suitable for 8-bit training?

The authors use an enhanced loss scaling method and stochastic rounding method to stabilize training. They do experiments on image classification and NLP tasks.\n\nThe paper is clearly written. However, I don\u2019t think this paper passes the bar of ICLR. This paper lacks innovation and insightful analysis.\n\n1.Sec. 3.1 proposes enhanced loss scaling. Loss scaling is a heuristic to train low-precision neural networks. The authors train 8-bit GNMT with a changing scaling factor. However, this looks like some manually tuned result for GNMT only. I doubt if this generalizes to other models. Besides, there is no equation or algorithm flowchart to demonstrate their method. It\u2019s not very readable.\n\n2.The logic of Sec. 3.2 is quite confusing. The authors first empirically show that the performance of ResNet-50 significantly drops with 8-bit training. Then they show the sum of the square of the weights in ResNet-50 is high at the beginning. With this observation, they claim it demonstrates the drawback of \u2018rounding-to-nearest-even\u2019. I cannot see the connection between the norm of weights and the rounding technique. Moreover, the stochastic rounding has already been used in 8-bit training.[1]\n\n3.The setting in the experiment section is not stated clearly. For example, what\u2019s the hyper-parameter for loss scaling? Another question is the gradient. In Sec. 3, just above Fig. 1, the authors claim the weight update is performed in full-precision. In contrast, they claim the gradient is 8-bit in table 3. If the update is full-precision, [2] is an important baseline. \n\nSmall suggestions:\n1.For Fig. 6, I suggest the authors to smooth the loss curves to avoid overlap of two curves.   \n2.There are two \u2018with\u2019s in the last paragraph of page 7.\n\nReference:\n[1]Wang N, Choi J, Brand D, et al.

The experiments are very clear and easy to follow.\n\nClarity: The paper is clearly written with some visualizations for readers to understand the 8-bit training. \n\nSignificance:\n1. The enhanced loss scaling strategy is interesting but the method seems hand-tuning. Is there any automatical way or heuristic deciding way?\n2. The stochastic rounding method is very intuitive. How do you choose the value of \"r\" in the equation? Is it a sensitive hyper-parameter or not?\n\nTypos:\nPage 7: with with roughly 200M ->  with roughly 200M \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2323/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2323/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["naveen.k.mellempudi@intel.com", "sudarshan.srinivasan@intel.com", "dipankar.das@intel.com", "bharat.kaul@intel.com"], "title": "Mixed Precision Training With 8-bit Floating Point", "authors": ["Naveen Mellempudi", "Sudarshan Srinivasan", "Dipankar Das", "Bharat Kaul"], "pdf": "/pdf/7521b8ec6f4a9e37eeb6be057dfe0021258c5ed6.pdf", "TL;DR": "We demonstrated state-of-the-art training results using 8-bit floating point representation, across Resnet, GNMT, Transformer.", "abstract": "Reduced precision computation is one of the key areas addressing the widening\u2019compute gap\u2019, driven by an exponential growth in deep learning applications. In recent years, deep neural network training has largely migrated to 16-bit precision,with significant gains in performance and energy efficiency. However, attempts to train DNNs at 8-bit precision have met with significant challenges, because of the higher precision and dynamic range requirements of back-propagation.   In this paper,  we  propose  a  method  to  train  deep  neural  networks  using  8-bit  floating point representation for weights, activations, errors, and gradients.  We demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple data sets (imagenet-1K, WMT16)and a broader set of workloads (Resnet-18/34/50, GNMT, and Transformer) than previously reported.
