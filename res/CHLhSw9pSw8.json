We polished a few details and added another appendix that describes key aspects of the gradient calculation for training in more detail, as we realized that this information is useful when trying to independently reproduce our results without TensorFlow - where support for complex intermediate quantities may well be entirely absent. The changelog (now appendix B) shows these changes.\n\nWith respect to where the extra information is coming from, the example in Figure 1 tries to clarify this question. We agree that the underlying mechanism is rather non-obvious and takes a while to understand. (We did not find this example straightaway, either.) Overall, the \"quantum mechanical miracle\" that we exploit in our work nowadays also has remarkable applications such as neutrino detectors weighing only a few kilograms(!) rather than many tons - see e.g. https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/08/milk-jug-sized-detector-captures-neutrinos-whole-new-way\n\nDespite limited time remaining, we are now focusing on finding ways to clarify the mechanism even better.

(Though, I think the original goal of the paper is very worthy, and look forward to the final version of this work!)\n\nTo try to give constructive critique:\n\n- it took me a long time to understand the setup of the problem. An illustration of FashionMNIST or MNIST would help, with an incoming photon, an arrow through the cut-out of the image (clearly delineating that the image is binarized, and that white pixels are cut out, allowing the photon to pass through), and a detector (An LCD screen is described \u2014 is this the detector as well? Or does the photon bounce back and is then detected?). Such an illustration would go a long way for a machine learning practitioner unfamiliar with the double slit experiment and whatnot.\n\n- an algorithm box. A machine learning audience is used to thinking in terms of training data and algorithms. In this case, an algorithm box would help, specifically as it shows where the additional information is coming from. It seems like the 'training' is in optimizing the parameters of the unitary transform. Clearly delineating input, output, and optimization steps will help clarify the method. \n\n- an equation for computing the predictions of the trained model. Given a photon that passed through a mask, a clear formula for computing the class probability with the trained unitary operator parameters.\n\n- clearly describing the baseline. It was hard to find the details of the classical performance reported. 'maximal classical performance' is confusing wording, and implies that 'maximal' is proven theoretically. Is there a citation for this? I may have missed it. If it is not proven theoretically, then the wording should be changed, and a clear description of the architecture, training data, and training algorithm should be used, and code should be included in the supplement. This will help machine learning folks understand exactly what the comparison is against. From a machine learning standpoint, is the single pixel input to the model randomly sampled every time? \n\n- developing an additional baseline. Finding a unitary transform to find bases corresponding to style and class is unfair to the classical method, which does not have access to this information. Not having a baseline that uses this additional information will further confuse machine learning folks, as it seems obvious that a model that uses additional information will outperform a 'classical' model that does not use this information. For example, a tensor decomposition/SVD that uses information about style and class might be possible.\n\nHope this is helpful; I think with this additional work it could be quite a valuable contribution, as I think the ICLR community could be inspired to develop more methods that require complex-valued numbers such as this one.\n\nEdit:\n\n- the authors meaningfully addressed the above points.

Do they agree that the new appendices A.1 and A.2 appropriately address the need for more detailed explanations they flagged up?\n\n2. Do they agree that formula (8) describes the computational aspects sufficiently well to also answer the questions that an \"algorithm box\" on the inference process would answer? This is, after all, basically a linear model (since quantum mechanics is linear), with some minor subtleties due to occurrence of complex intermediate quantities and unusual parametrization.\n\n3. Do they agree with our proof of the accuracy threshold for the classical baseline? To re-state the claim: unless one uses quantum interference, maximal performance on the test set is obtained by taking the (x,y) pixel coordinates of the photon, looking up the corresponding entry in Figure 2, and predicting the class from that cell. No non-interference classifier will be able to achieve a higher accuracy on the test set than this procedure. (If they agree, this should remove the need for another classical baseline, which they asked for in the final two items of their initial response - we know the maximally attainable performance, \"even when cheating is permitted\".)\n\n4. (As per our last response): What is their guidance for whether an explanation of the training process should explicitly discuss the subtleties around backpropagating through complex intermediate quantities. Should this be discussed in terms of a language that expresses everything as real quantities, or would it be appropriate to discuss this in terms of holomorphic and antiholomorphic functions, i.e. Wirtinger calculus?\n\nIf we do not hear back before the end of the weekend, our plan is to assume that the answer to (1, 2) is that their concerns are appropriately addressed, that they (3) agree on our baseline accuracy threshold proof, and there is no need to explain this further, and we will address (4) by adding another appendix that explains complex-backpropagation in pedestrian terms by mapping it to real-backpropagation with twice-as-large matrices, which would work, but be somewhat less efficient than what TensorFlow actually does in such a situation.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2148/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2148/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Single-Photon Image Classification", "authorids": ["~Thomas_Fischbacher1", "~Luciano_Sbaiz1"], "authors": ["Thomas Fischbacher", "Luciano Sbaiz"], "keywords": ["quantum mechanics", "image classification", "quantum machine learning", "theoretical limits"], "abstract": "Quantum Computing based Machine Learning mainly focuses on quantum computing hardware that is experimentally challenging to realize due to requiring quantum gates that operate at very low temperature.

Given the optimality proof in appendix A.2, we know that we can not get above our classical accuracy threshold unless we break property P1 or P2. This means in particular that we disagree with the idea that \"it seems obvious that a model that uses additional [style and class] information will outperform a 'classical' model that does not use this information\": Our proof in particular also means that a classical model that was trained not only having access to the test set, but also access to any other statistics of any example dataset (irrespective of training or test), such as in particular the suggested tensor decomposition / SVD (i.e. PCA) can not beat this threshold.\n\nWe do agree that observing such a large large performance gap should generally be met with skepticism and seems to be asking for an explanation.\n\nOn the \"classical baseline\" side, a perhaps useful question to ask is: if all we see is a single pixel flashing up once, do we really believe we can predict the digit class it came from with an accuracy that is far better than random guessing? Even 25% accuracy should be regarded as high in that light. On the quantum side, we have a witness that shows that better-than-40% accuracy is attainable - so, what explains that gap? The sole explanation for this gap is the ability to exploit interference of the quantum state of a single photon with itself - precisely what Figure 1 and the accompanying text explain in a simplified setting. With \"Schrodinger's Cat\", it is questionable whether the gedankenexperiment actually tells us anything about quantum mechanics that would need a deep explanation. Here, however, there is a clear, large, quantitative performance gap between what we can at best hope to achieve classically and what has been demonstrated to be possible with quantum mechanics: Our paper makes the often discussed \"inherent spookiness\" of quantum mechanics visible in yet another way - here, in a ML setting via its implications for an image classification task.\n\nFinally, and related to the above point, considering item 2 on the reviewer's list, algorithm boxes, especially for training: We did not yet address this in our first revision, in the interest of iterating fast and getting as much of an improvement out of our the review process of this article as we can (with all the reviewers' help, for which we are very grateful here).\n\nThe supplementary material already contains a code implementation of the training procedure, which simply amounts to optimizing cross-entropy loss for predictions obtained with formula (8) via stochastic gradient descent on large batches of example images. (Large batches are useful here in order to amortize the cost of exponentiating a complex 790x790 matrix.) On the technical side, there is slightly more to this procedure than meets the eye, since we are actually relying on TensorFlow using a somewhat unconventional definition of a complex gradient, which happens to be not a proper complex derivative, but exactly the variant that one needs when backpropagating from a real amplitude-magnitude-square result through the contributing complex amplitudes, as in this example. One way to resolve this subtle technical detail would be to simply present the complex matrix calculation in the form of a real calculation with twice as large matrices and vectors, i.e. describe an implementation that would be half as efficient as the one actually provided by the supplementary material. The alternative would be to describe in detail TensorFlow's strategy for handling complex gradients, which unfortunately would however require introducing some complex calculus in addition to the already present need for proceeding in small steps when explaining quantum mechanics. We are happy to add another appendix that explains this using either option, but would ourselves generally lean towards avoiding any discussion of complex-valued backpropagation in this work. Feedback on what readers might likely find more accessible here would be highly appreciated.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2148/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2148/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Single-Photon Image Classification", "authorids": ["~Thomas_Fischbacher1", "~Luciano_Sbaiz1"], "authors": ["Thomas Fischbacher", "Luciano Sbaiz"], "keywords": ["quantum mechanics", "image classification", "quantum machine learning", "theoretical limits"], "abstract": "Quantum Computing based Machine Learning mainly focuses on quantum computing hardware that is experimentally challenging to realize due to requiring quantum gates that operate at very low temperature.

This is extremely valuable feedback to us. Given that we have to expect very uneven distribution of prior knowledge of this subject in the readership, it might make sense to provide additional explanations that go beyond the core content of the paper in appendices. The major changes we made to the first revision of our manuscript are:\n\n1. We slightly restructured the introduction and expanded the discussion how our work \n  is related to other recent research on optical ML.\n2. We added formula (8), alongside a detailed explanation.\n  This compact formula shows explicitly how the probability for each output class is computed\n  from the input image, given the (trained) model parameters.\n\nUnfortunately, with these two additions, we mostly reached the extended 9-page limit. So, for now, we moved the more detailed explanations into two appendices. We are looking forward to working with our reviewers in order to eliminate some redundancy from now having both a compact and a detailed explanation of some aspects, and ultimately perhaps folding some of the rather relevant additional material - such as the schematic diagram - back into the main text of our article. Concerning the new appendices:\n\n3. We are providing a schematic diagram in appendix A.1, alongside a very detailed explanation that specifically shows how the structure of the image gets encoded by the photon quantum state, clarifying in particular that there is no binarization.\n\n4. We also provide a detailed proof of optimality for the \"classical\" (i.e. no-self-interference) baseline in appendix A.2, both explaining the basic idea by means of a simplified example, and also showing all the mathematical steps that lead to the conclusion that no classifier that does not use interference can possibly have an accuracy higher than this threshold.\n\nChecking our original submission's baseline, we found and fixed two implicit assumptions that one could regard as questionable. For the resubmitted manuscript, our new claims are (a) that the - slightly higher - \"classical baseline\" performance now can not even be beaten by any classifier that has properties P1 and P2, even if this might have had access to the test set during training, and that (b) the reasoning given in section A.2 constitutes a stringent mathematical proof of this fact.\n\nThese changes directly address item 1 (diagram), 3 (complete formula with explanation), and 4 (precise description of the baseline) from the reviewer's list of improvement suggestions.\n\nConcerning the final point on the list of improvement suggestions, providing an additional baseline: We would like to address this in a separate comment.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2148/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2148/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Single-Photon Image Classification", "authorids": ["~Thomas_Fischbacher1", "~Luciano_Sbaiz1"], "authors": ["Thomas Fischbacher", "Luciano Sbaiz"], "keywords": ["quantum mechanics", "image classification", "quantum machine learning", "theoretical limits"], "abstract": "Quantum Computing based Machine Learning mainly focuses on quantum computing hardware that is experimentally challenging to realize due to requiring quantum gates that operate at very low temperature.

We updated the draft to include a more in-depth explanation in the main text. Extending this particular approach to colored images would in principle be feasible, but introduce complications on the experimental side without adding interesting new aspects to the mathematical analysis of this problem: One would have to use a coherent light source that can produce collimated photons not at one, but three different wavelengths (colors), then either spatially separate the color-components or optically couple such photons into and out of the device that performs shaped self-interference in a way that simultaneously minimizes losses for different wavelengths, optimize the linear optical device parameters to simultaneously transform quantum states in a useful way for different input photon wavelengths, and finally also discriminate photons at different wavelengths. Considering that even when generating a color image, the widely employed technical solutions all approximate color by splitting a pixel into spatially separated sub-pixels, the most viable experimental approach might be to spatially separate the quantum state space into a red/green/blue component as early as possible (perhaps using mirrors that are transparent at different wavelengths, or photonic crystals) and use three individually trained instances of a linear optical amplitude-reshuffling device plus detector array. Likewise, going to higher resolution / more complex scenes would mostly introduce complications on the side of an experimental realization.\n\nHaving said this, our general impression is that representing high level concepts that are relevant for other Machine Learning problems in terms of rather simple quantum states indeed might be promising to try.

On the question what the \"real motivation\" of this work is, one way to answer it is to see this article as a demonstration that high-level knowledge representation of concepts as abstract as \"image of a shoe\" can in principle be done remarkably well even using the most low-level concept that physics allows, namely the quantum state of a single photon. The significance of this is that there may be interesting \"analog quantum computer\" realizations of quantum ML that are not based on far-future \"digital error-correcting quantum computer\" architectures: We might not have to wait for a general-purpose many-qubits quantum computer for quantum ML to become practically relevant - very simple quantum systems can already encode high level features. On the physics side, multiphoton (not many-photon) quantum optics and potential Machine Learning applications certainly is an interesting topic to discuss, but would require substantially heavier mathematical machinery than what we felt comfortable showing to a general ML audience. Detecting single photons with spatial resolution is routinely done in quantum optics research, even at room temperature (typically via SPAD arrays), and we indeed consider it feasible to experimentally build a simplified version of the basic design presented in this work.\n\nThe reviewer's questions whether 'single photon corresponds to single pixel' (Yes for the \"classical baseline\" that can not use self-interference of a photon, No for the quantum case), and whether \"single photon denoted the very first photon that passed the filter\" (Yes for both the \"classical baseline\" and \"quantum\" case, as explained already in the abstract) were, in our view, already addressed by our original submission, but we agree that this work clearly would benefit from a schematic explanation of our set-up. We added an appendix with a diagram alongside a detailed description, and also now provide formula (8) that quantitatively specifies how the trainable parameters are related to classifier predictions. We would like to work with our reviewers to see what parts of the extra explanations in the appendices can be meaningfully folded back into the main text while not breaking the page count limit.\n\nBy the very nature of this work (see 1st response to AnonReviewer3), one would naturally want to study a monochromatic image classification problem, as the experimental physics aspects strongly prefer a monochromatic coherent light source for this sort of task. This suggests using MNIST, but given that there are well-known concerns about the MNIST dataset, we wanted to also explore performance on another dataset that is unrelated but similarly-structured.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2148/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2148/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Single-Photon Image Classification", "authorids": ["~Thomas_Fischbacher1", "~Luciano_Sbaiz1"], "authors": ["Thomas Fischbacher", "Luciano Sbaiz"], "keywords": ["quantum mechanics", "image classification", "quantum machine learning", "theoretical limits"], "abstract": "Quantum Computing based Machine Learning mainly focuses on quantum computing hardware that is experimentally challenging to realize due to requiring quantum gates that operate at very low temperature.

The introduction of quantum mechanics into the problem is through a trainable computational model of a beam splitter/phase shifter mechanism, aka a rotation in a high dimensional complex space, that's allowed to alter the photon's state before hitting the measurement device. The paper shows that using this overly simplified (and claimed to be physically feasible) quantum computer, which acts as the representation learning layer, improves classification accuracy over any other representation learning method that doesn't use quantum computing. The major take-away is an accessible demonstration of how an elementary quantum computer might work for ML, and what may be possible with actual qubits.\n\nStrengths:\n* The paper sets out to use two textbook problems in ML and quantum mechanics to introduce a textbook problem at the intersection, and does a fairly good job at analyzing the problem extensively. Given that the overall problem is of broad interest to the representation learning community, the solid execution of the paper is itself a good argument for acceptance.\n* Accessible explanation of quantum states, the measurement process, and the building blocks of quantum computing.\n\nComment:\n* The paper analyzes a single problem where no classical representation learning method can improve accuracy due to the fact that there is a single photon. It would be very beneficial to allude to other setups, perhaps in a related work section, to provide broader context and help the reader understand better the significance of the problem.", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2148/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2148/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Single-Photon Image Classification", "authorids": ["~Thomas_Fischbacher1", "~Luciano_Sbaiz1"], "authors": ["Thomas Fischbacher", "Luciano Sbaiz"], "keywords": ["quantum mechanics", "image classification", "quantum machine learning", "theoretical limits"], "abstract": "Quantum Computing based Machine Learning mainly focuses on quantum computing hardware that is experimentally challenging to realize due to requiring quantum gates that operate at very low temperature.
