The authors demonstrate that they have a mature understanding of modern techniques, which is not always the case among folks pushing deep learning into new application areas (demonstrated most by their use of Bayesian optimization, well done!).\n\nThe ReLU neural net clobbers both a classic Cox proportional hazards model with a Elastic Net-style regularization AND the survival analysis analogue of a random forest (often the most daunting foe of neural nets in empirical comparisons). The results are especially remarkable since they were obtained on a small data set (only 658 samples total, with 183 inputs). The deep learning community should celebrate empirical victories of this type (in new domains and problems, done by people who are applying the methods properly).\n\nSome questions and comments:\n\n  * The figure reference at the bottom of Page 2 is broken.\n\n  * The \"%NN\" format for numerical percents is non-standard. I suggest the authors change those to \"NN%.\"\n\n  * Some discussion of how performance varied with model architecture would be useful. Did 2-layers beat 1-layer and 3-layers?\n\n  * Unsupervised pretraining isn't typically used these days, especially for shallow neural nets. Did it, in fact, help?\n\n  * The authors might want to mention and cite which framework (if any) they used to implement their neural nets.\n", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"CMT_id": "", "title": "Learning Genomic Representations to Predict Clinical Outcomes in Cancer", "abstract": "Genomics are rapidly transforming medical practice and basic biomedical research, providing insights into disease mechanisms and improving therapeutic strategies, particularly in cancer.

The idea is to estimate survival of a cancer patient from genetic data.  The challenge for this is that many of the data are effectively censored -- we do not know how long currently living patients will survive.  This is a well-studied likelihood and the essential proposal is to use the last layer of the neural network to form the linear features used for survival prediction.  This last statement is a bit more of an inference than I would like, as the abstract is light on details.  There are various architectural choices that seem sensibly handled, and I commend the authors for systematically tuning hyperparameters with Bayesian optimization.  I was slightly surprised to see layerwise pre-training used on this model; this approach has gone somewhat out of fashion and it would be interesting if this offered improvements over directly training a multi-layer perceptron.  Overall, I think this abstract is well over the bar for acceptance.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"CMT_id": "", "title": "Learning Genomic Representations to Predict Clinical Outcomes in Cancer", "abstract": "Genomics are rapidly transforming medical practice and basic biomedical research, providing insights into disease mechanisms and improving therapeutic strategies, particularly in cancer.
