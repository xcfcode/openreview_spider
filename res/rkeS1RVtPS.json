The authors argue that this step size schedule allows the sampler to cross modes (when the step size is large) and locally explore modes (when the step size is smaller).  SG-MCMC is a very promising method for Bayesian deep learning as it is both scalable and easily to incorporate into existing models.  However, the stochastic setting often leads to the sampler getting stuck in a local mode due to a requirement of a small step size (which itself is often due to leaving out the Metropolis-Hastings accept / reject step).   The cyclic learning rate intuitively helps the sampler escape local modes.  This property is demonstrated on synthetic problems in comparison to existing SG-MCMC baselines.  The authors demonstrate improved negative log likelihood on larger scale deep learning benchmarks, which is appreciated as the related literature often restricts experiments to small scale problems.  The reviewers all found the paper compelling and argued for acceptance and thus the recommendation is to accept.  Some questions remain for future work.  E.g. all experiments were performed using a very low temperature, which implies that the methods are not sampling from the true Bayesian posterior.  Why is such a low temperature needed for reasonable performance?  In any case a very nice paper.", "title": "Paper Decision"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["rz297@cornell.edu", "chunyuan.li@duke.edu", "jz318@duke.edu", "cchangyou@gmail.com", "andrewgw@cims.nyu.edu"], "title": "Cyclical Stochastic Gradient MCMC for Bayesian Deep Learning", "authors": ["Ruqi Zhang", "Chunyuan Li", "Jianyi Zhang", "Changyou Chen", "Andrew Gordon Wilson"], "pdf": "/pdf/faffe100c21426695486861801522350e9587630.pdf", "abstract": "The posteriors over neural network weights are high dimensional and multimodal.

The key idea is to not keep lowering the step sizes, but -- at pre-specified times -- go back to large step sizes.\n\nThe paper is timely, the proposed algorithm is novel, and the theoretical analysis also seem quite novel.\n\nMy key concern is that with MCMC sampling it is often quite difficult to tune parameters, and by introducing more parameters to tune when step sizes should increase, I fear that we end up in a \"tuning nightmare\". How sensitive is the algorithm to choice of parameters?\n\nI would expect that the proposed algorithm is quite similar to just running several MCMCs in parallel. The authors does a comparison to this and show that their approach is significantly faster due to \"warm restarts\". Here I wonder how sensitive this conclusion is to choice of parameters (see nightmare above) ? I would guess that opposite conclusions could be reached by tuning the algorithms differently -- is that a reasonable suspicion ?\n\nIt is argued that the cyclic nature of the algorithms gives a form of \"warm start\" that is beneficial for MCMC. My intuition dictate that this is only true of the modes of the posterior are reasonable close to each other; otherwise I do not see how this warm starting is helpful. I would appreciate learning more about why this intuition is apparently incorrect.\n\nMinor comments:\n* on page 4 it is stated that the proposed algorithm \"automatically\" provide the warm restarts -- but is it really automatic? Isn't this a priori determined by choice of parameters for the algorithm?\n\n* It would be good to use \\citet instead of \\cite at places, e.g. \"discussed in (Smith & Topin, 2017)\" should be \"discussed by Smith & Topin (2017)\". This would improve readability (which is generally very good).\n\n* For the empirical studies I think it would be good to report state-of-the-art results as well.

There are only two additional hyperparameters compared to standard SG-MCMC methods: the number of cycles $M$ and the proportion of exploration stage $\\beta$. Given the training budget, there is a trade-off between the number of cycles $M$ and the cycle length. We find that it works well in practice to set the cycle length such that the model with optimization methods will be close to a mode after running for that length, but it is not too sensitive to this value. (e.g. the cycle length for CIFAR-10 is 50 epochs. The model optimized by SGD can achieve about 5% error after 50 epochs which means the model is close but not fully converged to a mode after 50 epochs.) Once the cycle length is fixed, $M$ is fixed. $\\beta$ needs tuning for different tasks by cross-validation. Generally, $\\beta$ needs to be tuned so that the sampler has enough time to reach a good region before starting sampling. We have added a discussion about hyperparameter tuning in Appendix. As per below (Q2), we have found performance robust to $M$ and $\\beta$.\n\nQ2: How sensitive the conclusion of superiority over parallel MCMC is to the choice of parameters\n\nA2: To test the sensitivity, we added an experiment in Appendix. H. With the same setup as in the experiment section, we compare our method with $M$ cycles and $L$ epochs per cycle with running $M$ chains parallel MCMC for $L$ epochs. The training budget is 200 epochs. We compare cSGLD and parallel SGLD with smaller and larger values of $M$ and $\\beta$ on CIFAR-10 ($M=4$ and $\\beta=0.8$ in the experiment section). From the results, we see that the conclusion that cSG-MCMC is better than parallel SG-MCMC holds with different values of $M$ and $\\beta$. \n\nTable: Comparison of test error (%) between cSG-MCMC and parallel algorithm with varying values of hyperparameters on CIFAR-10.\n\t\t| $M=2,\\beta=0.8$ | $M=5,\\beta=0.8$ | $M=4,\\beta=0.7$ | $M=4,\\beta=0.9$ |\ncSGLD\t\t |\t4.27\t      |\t4.33\t        |\t4.08\t           |\t      4.34\t     |\nParallel SGLD |\t5.49\t      |\t7.38\t        |\t6.03\t           |\t      6.03\t     |\n\n\nQ3: Is the \"warm start\" beneficial only when the modes of the posterior are reasonably close to each other?\n\nA3: The loss surfaces for neural nets are extremely complex, containing many modes, mode connecting curves, and a rich variety of high performing solutions even when taking small steps in weight space, which was recently discovered in [1]. In other words, high performing solutions in the weight space of neural networks are likely to be reasonably close to each other. Our method is developed particularly for Bayesian deep learning and we have demonstrated its effectiveness for modeling the posterior in Bayesian neural networks. \n\nQ4: Is the method really automatic?\n\nA4: As in A2, we did not find that our key conclusions are sensitive to the values of hyperparameters. But in order to achieve the best results, it is useful to tune the parameters through simple heuristics and validation, as described above. It is a relatively automatic approach.\n\nQ5: It would be good to use \\citet instead of \\cite\n\nA5: Thanks for pointing it out. We have revised the paper accordingly.\n\nQ6: Bayesian vs non-Bayesian methods for SOTA\n\nA6: State-of-the-art results often use complex architectures along with many other techniques, often orthogonal to Bayesian vs non-Bayesian statistics, as well as GPU or TPU resources well beyond reach for most academic laboratories, making a direct comparison with our approach difficult to obtain and interpret. In the experiments in this paper, we used the same ResNet architecture for all methods and compare our methods to both related sampling methods and optimization methods (Bayesian and non-Bayesian). Therefore the comparisons are fair, and demonstrate the improvement is due to the proposed cyclical sampling method. We note that our Bayesian approach outperforms the non-Bayesian training methods when controlling for the other factors (e.g. same architecture). Thus the results are a timely step forward for practical approaches to Bayesian deep learning.\n\n[1] Garipov et.al., Loss Surfaces, Mode Connectivity, and Fast Ensembling of DNNs\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper892/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper892/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["rz297@cornell.edu", "chunyuan.li@duke.edu", "jz318@duke.edu", "cchangyou@gmail.com", "andrewgw@cims.nyu.edu"], "title": "Cyclical Stochastic Gradient MCMC for Bayesian Deep Learning", "authors": ["Ruqi Zhang", "Chunyuan Li", "Jianyi Zhang", "Changyou Chen", "Andrew Gordon Wilson"], "pdf": "/pdf/faffe100c21426695486861801522350e9587630.pdf", "abstract": "The posteriors over neural network weights are high dimensional and multimodal.

Indeed, we have applied our method to ImageNet in Section 5.2, which is a hard large-scale image classification problem, containing 1000 categories and 1.2 million images for training. Most published work in Bayesian deep learning (sampling or otherwise) does not consider datasets at this scale. We have shown that our method significantly outperforms previous sampling methods and also provides better test likelihood than optimization methods. By exploring the parameter space more efficiently with the cyclical schedule, our method is able to collect more diverse samples and as a result increase the number of effective samples, reducing the number of needed samples and thus the cost of Bayesian averaging.\n\nWe agree that recent literature in Bayesian deep learning has been focusing on deterministic approaches such as variational inference. This is why this paper makes an extremely timely and significant contribution to Bayesian deep learning. While MCMC was once a gold standard for inference with neural networks, essentially all inference approaches currently use deterministic approximations for modern deep neural networks. A key advantage of MCMC is the ability to explore complex multimodal distributions. We show in this work for the first time how MCMC can be particularly developed for practical inference over multiple modes in modern deep learning, corresponding to meaningfully different representations of the data, providing complementary advantages to deterministic methods (which are largely unimodal) and classical optimization approaches (which do not perform Bayesian marginalization). We hope you can consider this response, and the foundational and timely nature of this contribution, in your final assessment.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper892/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper892/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["rz297@cornell.edu", "chunyuan.li@duke.edu", "jz318@duke.edu", "cchangyou@gmail.com", "andrewgw@cims.nyu.edu"], "title": "Cyclical Stochastic Gradient MCMC for Bayesian Deep Learning", "authors": ["Ruqi Zhang", "Chunyuan Li", "Jianyi Zhang", "Changyou Chen", "Andrew Gordon Wilson"], "pdf": "/pdf/faffe100c21426695486861801522350e9587630.pdf", "abstract": "The posteriors over neural network weights are high dimensional and multimodal.

The posteriors of Bayesian NN weights are highly multi-modal and present difficulty for standard stochastic gradient MCMC methods. The proposed cyclical version periodically warm start the SG-MCMC process such that it can explore the multimodal space more efficiently.\n\nThe proposed method as well as the empirical results intuitively make sense. The standard SG-MCMC basically has one longer stepsize schedule and is exploring the weight space more patiently, but only converges to one local mode. The cyclical SG-MCMC uses multiple shorter stepsize schedules, so each one is similar to a (stochastic) greedy search. Consequently, the cSG-MCMC can collect more diverse samples across the weight space, while the samples of SG-MCMC are more concentrated, but likely with better quality (as shown in Figure 3). \n\nPersonally I would like to see how Bayesian deep learning can be applied to real large-scale applications. Probabilistic inference is expensive; Bayesian model averaging is even more expensive. That's probably why recent literature focuses on variational inference or expectation propagation-based approaches.
