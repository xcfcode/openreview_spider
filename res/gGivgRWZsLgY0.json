The paper evaluates two fairly arbitrarily-chosen architectures on the CIFAR-10 and SVHN image labeling tasks, and shows that neither of these architectures is very effective, but that the conventional linear operator works better. The paper nevertheless advocates the use of the distance filtering operation on grounds of superior theoretical efficiency on e.g. FPGA hardware, but details of this argument and empirical substantiation are left for future work. The distance-based algorithm was more accurate than the linear-filtering architecture on a tracking task. How good the tracker is relative to other algorithms in the literature on the data set is not clear; I am admittedly not an expert in object tracking, and the authors simply state that it is 'not state-of-the-art.'\r\n\r\nThe paper's value as a report to roboticists on the merit of either clustering or linear operators is undermined by the lack of discussion or guidance regarding how one might go beyond the precise experiments done in the paper. The paper includes several choices that seem arbitrary: filter sizes, filter counts, numbers of layers, and so on. Moreover these apparently arbitrary choices are made differently for the different data sets. Compared to other papers dealing with these data sets, the authors have made the model much smaller, faster, and less accurate. The authors stress that the interest of their work is in enabling 'real-time' operation on a laptop, but I don't personally see the interest of targeting such CPUs for real-time performance and the paper does not argue the point.\r\n\r\nThe authors also emphasize the value of fast unsupervised learning based on clustering, but the contribution of this work beyond that of Coates et al. published in 2011 and 2012 is not clear.\r\n\r\n# Detailed Comments\r\n\r\nThe statement 'We used the Torch7 software for all our experiments [18], since this software can reduce training and learning of deep networks by 5-10 times compared to similar Matlab and Python tools.' sounds wrong to me. A citation would help defend the statement, but if you meant simply to cite the benchmarking from [18], then the authors should also cite follow-up work, particularly Bastien et al. 2012  ('Theano: new features and speed improvements').\r\n\r\nThe use of 'bio-inspired' local contrast normalization instead of whitening should include citation to previous work. (i.e. Why/how is the technique inspired by biology?)\r\n\r\nIs the SpatialSAD model the authors' own innovation? If so, more details should be listed. If not, a citation to a publication with more details should be listed. I have supposed that they are simply computing a squared Euclidean distance between filter and image patch as the filter response.\r\n\r\nRegarding the two architectures used for performance comparison - I am left wondering why the authors chose not to use spatial contrastive normalization in both architectures.  As tested, performance differences could be attributed to *either* the CL or the spatial contrast normalization.\r\n\r\nI am a little confused by the phrase 'correlate filter responses to inputs' - with the sum-of-squared-differences operator at work, my intuition would be that inputs are less-correlated to filter responses than they would be with a convolution operator.\r\n\r\nThe use of the phrase 'fully connected' in the second-last paragraph on page 3 is confusing - I am assuming the authors mean all *channels* are connected to all *channels* in filters applied by the convolution operator.  Usually in neural networks literature, the phrase 'fully connected' means that all *units* are connected between two layers.\r\n\r\nThe results included no discussion of measurement error."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Clustering Learning for Robotic Vision", "decision": "conferencePoster-iclr2013-workshop", "abstract": "We present the clustering learning technique applied to multi-layer feedforward deep neural networks.

The authors defer some of the more interesting bits to future work however: they note that sum-abs-diff should be much more efficient in silicon implementation then convolution style results. That would indeed be interesting, and would make this paper all the more exciting.\r\n\r\nMethods that make such learning efficient are certainly important.\r\n\r\nThe paper references [8] to explain seemingly significant details. At least a summary seems in order.\r\nIdeally a pseudo-code description. Currently the paper is close to un-reproducible, which is unfortunate as it seems easy to correct that.\r\n\r\nDetails of the contrast normalization would make the paper more self contained. This is a rather specialized technique (by that name), and should be discussed when addressing the community at large.\r\n\r\nI can't parse the second paragraph of Section 2.3.\r\n\r\nMany of the details elements seem a bit unmotivated. The authors repeatedly mention in the beginning (which seem like details too early in the paper) things they *don't* do (Whitening, ZCA?, color space changes), but these seem like details, and the motivation to *not* perform them isn't compelling. Why the difference in connectivity between the CNN and that presented here?\r\n\r\nThe video data-sets are very interesting and compelling. It would be good for a sense of scale to report the results for [22,30] as well.\r\n\r\nThe fact that second layers that are random still works well is interesting:\r\n'The randomly connected 2nd layer used a fixed CNN layer as described in section 2.2.'\r\n\r\nWhy was this experiment with a random CNN, and not a random CL (sum-abs-diff) to match the experiments?\r\n\r\nWhat does one conclude from these results?\r\nIt seems the first layer is, to a close approximate, equivalent to a Gabor filter bank. The second layer, random appears to be perfectly acceptable. (Truly random? How does randomly initialized from the data do?)\r\nThat seems rather disappointing from a learning point of view.\r\n\r\nIn general the paper reads a bit like an early draft of a workshop paper. Interesting experiments, but hard to read, and seemingly incomplete. \r\n\r\nA few points on style seem in order:\r\n\r\nFirst the authors graciously acknowledge prior work and say 'we could not have done any of this work without standing on the shoulders of giants.' Oddly, one of the giants acknowledged is one of the authors. I assume this is some last minute mistake due to authorship changes, but it reflects the rushed and incomplete nature of the work.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the advertisements for the laboratory in the footnotes are odd and out of place in a conference submission.\r\n\r\nThe title seems slightly misleading: this seems to be a straightforward ML for vision paper with otherwise no connection to robotics.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\nTacking important issues for the field.\r\nGood and interesting experiments.\r\nFocus on performance is important.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\nDifficult to understand details of implementation.\r\nMany design decisions make it hard to compare/contrast techniques and seem unmotivated.\r\nSome of the most interesting work (demonstrating benefits of technique in performance) are deferred to future work.\r\nStyle and writing make the paper difficult to read."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Clustering Learning for Robotic Vision", "decision": "conferencePoster-iclr2013-workshop", "abstract": "We present the clustering learning technique applied to multi-layer feedforward deep neural networks.

The basic system uses a clustering algorithm to train filters from small patches and then applies them convolutionally using a sum-abs-difference (instead of inner product) operation.  This is followed with a fixed combination of processing stages (pooling, nonlinearity, normalization) and passed to a supervised learning algorithm.  The approach is compared with 2-layer CNNs on image recognition benchmarks (StreetView house numbers, CIFAR10) and tracking (TLD dataset);  in the last case it is shown that the method outperforms a 2-layer CNN from prior work.   The speed of learning and test-time evaluation are compared as a measure of suitability for realtime use in robotics.\r\n\r\nThe main novelty here appears to be on a couple of points:  (1) the particular choice of architecture (which is motivated at least in part by the desire to run in programmable hardware such as FPGAs), (2) documenting the speed advantage and positive tracking results in applications, both of which are worthwhile goals.  Evaluation and training speed, as the authors note, are not well-documented in deep learning work and this is a problem for real-time applications like robotics.\r\n\r\nSome questions I had about the content:\r\n\r\nI did not follow how the 2nd layer of clustered features were trained.  It looks like these were trained on single channels of the pooled feature responses?\r\n\r\nWas the sum-abs-diff operation also used for the CNN?\r\n\r\nOne advantage of the clustering approach is that it is easier to train larger filter banks than with fine-tuned CNNs.  Can the accuracy gap in recognition tasks be reduced by using more features?  And at what cost to evaluation time?\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n(1)  Results are presented for a novel network architecture, documenting the speed and simplicity of clustering-based feature learning methods for vision tasks.  It is hard to overstate how useful rapid training is for developing applications, so further results are welcome.\r\n(2)  Some discussion is included about important optimizations for hardware, but I would have liked more detail on this topic.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n(1)  The architecture is somewhat unusual and it's not clear what motivates each processing stage.\r\n(2)  Though training is much faster, it's not clear to what degree the speed of training is useful for the robotics applications given.  [As opposed to online evaluation time.]\r\n(3)  The extent of results is modest, and their bearing on actual work in robotics (or broader work in CV) is unclear.  The single tracking result is interesting, but versus a baseline method.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think the 'cons' point to the robotics use-case not being thoroughly justified;  but there are some ideas in here that would be interesting on their own with more depth."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Clustering Learning for Robotic Vision", "decision": "conferencePoster-iclr2013-workshop", "abstract": "We present the clustering learning technique applied to multi-layer feedforward deep neural networks.
