PassNet approach is similar to UNet, having a downsampling and upsampling modules with a set of skip-connection between the two modules. To train their model, authors apply the log-loss at the location of the passing event.  Authors evaluate their approach on a soccer analytic dataset, where they demonstrate improvement over prior works relying on hand-crafted features.\n\nComment:\nContribution of the paper appears a bit incremental to me.  It seems that the paper is a direct application of Unet type of architecture on the specific problem of pass analytic. It would be nice to explicit what is the main contribution of the paper from the representation learning point of view.\n\nIn addition, some of the design choice of PassNet could be better justified. It would be nice to run an ablation study to show the importance of the different architectural component (conv2d prediction layers, backpropagating using only one outputs, skip-connection...)\n\nAuthors claim that their approach is an \"extreme case of weakly supervised learning\". I tend to disagree with the assessment. I understand that they only backprop the loss computed at one specific location of the output, but this a choice on the architectural part and not on the labelling. Training PassNet requires fine-grained label as it needs to know both label value and localization. Training the model without the use of label localization would be more akin to weakly-supervised learning.\n\nAuthors evaluate their approach on only one dataset.  It would be nice to extend the empirical results to other datasets/sports to ensure the robustness of the conclusions.  \n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1829/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1829/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "PassNet: Learning pass probability surfaces from single-location labels.

When performing a visual evaluation of the quality of the generated surfaces we can see that there are a few subtle differences between PasseNet-FL (see image https://ibb.co/WVpDq38 ) and PassNet (see image https://ibb.co/RNjj07s ), but they can be considered largely equivalent. Given that the best loss is achieved by PassNet-FL we could agree that the fusion layer could be removed from the architecture.\n\nAdditionally, PassNet-UP-FL performs similarly to PassNet in terms of log-loss. However, if we take a closer look at the generated surface (see image https://ibb.co/h1QqpDt ) we can see that the output is artifacted, while PassNet surface provides an eye-pleasing smooth surface. These smooth surfaces are preferable in practice for better communication with coaches. Given the marginal difference between both it is preferable to keep the upsampling layers.\n\nSingle Layer architectures perform similarly to PassNet according to log-loss, however if we take a look at the generated surface we can see that the net overfits and predicts exclusively 0.5 probabilities near dense opponents areas (see image https://ibb.co/hWHrDFd ).\n\nFrom this analysis we can conclude that all of the proposed components (with an exception of fusion layers) provide value to the model."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1829/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1829/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "PassNet: Learning pass probability surfaces from single-location labels.

The reviewer suggests to use the pass likelihood model that can be obtained by substituting the sigmoid activation output layer by a softmax and use that pass likelihood to evaluate different types of situations, that might be undersampled in the original data.\nIn order to test that the model performs robustly on less likely passes, so we can provide a higher confidence level of the quality of the predicted surfaces, we performed the following test: for all the passes in the new test dataset we predicted the likelihood of observed passes and we applied K-means with K=5 to obtain three incremental pass likelihood groups, named according the likelihood of the passing location within the group: very low, low, medium, high, and very high.\n\nThe table below shows the the likelihood ranges (for a 104x68 grid) and the log loss between the predicted probability in each group and the observed outcome for the PassNet architecture.\n\n\n+-----------------+-----------+-----------+------------------+\n| Pass Likelihood | Min Value | Max Value | PassNet log-loss |\n+-----------------+-----------+-----------+------------------+\n|     Very low    |   1e-10   |   0.007   |       0.543      |\n+-----------------+-----------+-----------+------------------+\n|       Low       |   0.007   |   0.019   |       0.134      |\n+-----------------+-----------+-----------+------------------+\n|      Medium     |   0.019   |   0.033   |       0.083      |\n+-----------------+-----------+-----------+------------------+\n|       High      |   0.033   |   0.052   |       0.061      |\n+-----------------+-----------+-----------+------------------+\n|    Very high    |   0.052   |   0.136   |       0.049      |\n+-----------------+-----------+-----------+------------------+\n\nWe can clearly observe that the more likely a passing destination location is the better the prediction of PassNet. Despite a worst than average prediction of \nvery unlikely passing locations, PassNet is able to perform considerably well in the rest of the cases. We expect the network to suffer from the noise introduced by the labels of destination locations, where in case of failed passes it is likely the data provider tags the interception location of the pass instead of the intended location. In future work we can address this problem by resampling the training set according to the unlikely passes ratio observed in the data, as well as developing an intended receiver prediction model."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1829/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1829/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "PassNet: Learning pass probability surfaces from single-location labels.

A network based on a fully-convolutional style semantic segmentation network is applied to a 2D, 8-channel game state representation, with final sigmoid layer to predict a pass success indicator at each location.  The system is trained using manually annotated pass success and destinations, which corresponds to a label on the destination point; locations other than the labeled point are not trained (treated as incomplete/\"don't-care\" training targets).  Evaluation is performed using both log loss and probability calibration measure, to measure effectiveness of predictions as well as how well they calibrate to correspond to probabilities in the sense defined by the measurement.\n\nThis is a fun application and it appears the system is effective at a basic level.  However, I think both the theory/explanation and experiments leave a fair bit of uncertainty as to what the probabilities mean and how to interpret them, including conflation of success probability and the model's certainty in its estimate.\n\nIn particular, it is unknown to what degree the values output by the model can be interpreted as a predictive probability of pass completion for anywhere on the field.  If one location says 0.8 and the other 0.5, does this mean that if the player were to actually pass to the 0.5 location, the chance of success is actually lower?  Or does it mean that the model is less confident or that this location was under-trained for this state?  The ECE measurement in conjunction with loss error doesn't quite address this:  although a good verification of calibration in its own sense, ECE simply confirms that for cases where the model predicts 0.5, there is success 0.5 of the time for locations that *exist in the test set*, which is sampled according to player action.  To verify the probability maps at all locations, one would need to be able to measure *any* point in the field, not just those already selected by the players' actions.  I think discussion and attempt to measure this is fairly important, as one of the intended applications in the motivation is analyzing what might have happened had a player selected a different destination point.\n\nUnfortunately, knowing the true outcomes at arbitrary locations the players didn't pass to is impossible, so addressing this issue is not straightforward, and unclear to me how it might be done.  A possible suggestion, is to use the destination selection predictions that the paper also mentions can be found using softmax instead of sigmoid.  Although this does not entirely eliminate the issue (these predictions themselves may conflate model confidence with actual selection probability), these maps would likely provide a good indication of player selections.  Thus they might be used to sample or reweight the test set, so that unlikely destination points are sampled more, to try to get a more uniform sample.\n\nEven with this issue, though, I feel that this is an interesting application and system that seems reasonable in its current state, if with important caveats.  Thus, I'd lean towards accepting.  However, I'd encourage the authors to discuss these differences and issues of output interpretation, and to try addressing if possible.\n\n\nAdditional questions and comments:\n\n* The train/val/test split appears to be uniform random by pass event.  It would be interesting to hold out all events for one or more teams, or holding out full games, to measure generalizability to these cases.\n\n* Are the destinations for unsuccessful passes the intercepted location, or an estimated intended location?  Does this difference affect the completion prediction at the intended location (beyond the interception location)?\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1829/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1829/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "PassNet: Learning pass probability surfaces from single-location labels.
