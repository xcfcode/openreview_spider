In order to defend against patches which could appear at any location, all the patches need to be considered. This is too computationally expensive, hence they proposed to use a random subset of patches, or a U-net to predict the locations of the patches and then use those patches to train. The algorithm is tested on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and it was shown that sometimes the IBP approach is useful for defense, although often with a significant loss on accuracy on clean data (e.g. on CIFAR the loss on clean accuracy is an astounding 300% -- from 66.5% - 35.7%).\n\nI think the technical contribution of this paper is a bit weak in that they mostly followed the original IBP and the only novelties are the random patch training and guided patch training. I partially like how the experiments are conducted, especially the one that generalizes to other shapes. On the other hand, the networks that are tested seem pretty poor by any standard. An experiment that is definitely missing is a CIFAR network that performs a little better than the current one. Clean accuracy of only 66.5% and 47.2% are very lousy for CIFAR.\n\nAnother missing experiment is one that would test on different epsilon values. I couldn't find what are the current epsilon values used?\n\nBesides, since this work is testing on adversarial patches, I would like to at least have it applied to some real-life images with patches that are of real-life size. I could care a bit less on how good it is, but one can still make an empirical test (e.g. certified defense accuracy on 5x5 patches, but empirical test using real-life sized patches 40x40 or 80x80) and see how the results would be. All the experiments mentioned above would significantly strengthen the experiments section of the paper.\n\nI don't think I read anywhere a confirmation that the testing is performed on all patches of the prescribed size. Could the authors please confirm whether this is true?\n\nMinor: \nThere is a typo in Eq. (5) and Eq. (6), where the second term multiplied by |W^(k)| should be \\underline{z}^(k-1) - \\bar{z}^(k-1) instead of \\underline{z}^(k-1) + \\bar{z}^(k-1)\n\nYou should mention that |W^(k)| stand for element-wise absolute value when it first appears.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1710/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1710/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["pchiang@cs.umd.edu", "rn9zm@cs.umd.edu", "akader@cs.umd.edu", "chenzhu@cs.umd.edu", "studer@cornell.edu", "tomg@cs.umd.edu"], "title": "Certified Defenses for Adversarial Patches", "authors": ["Ping-yeh Chiang*", "Renkun Ni*", "Ahmed Abdelkader", "Chen Zhu", "Christoph Studor", "Tom Goldstein"], "pdf": "/pdf/eca8d8043a2dd4f4bd5d4024fd96b917556bcb47.pdf", "abstract": "Adversarial patch attacks are among one of the most practical threat models against real-world computer vision systems.

Make sure to formally formulate the bound in this case and include these results in the final version of the paper. \n\nA caveat is that the input is bounded (e.g., for MNIST the image is in range 0 to 1). For example, if a pixel is already close to 1, it cannot be perturbed up even its corresponding element $w$ is large. A more careful approach will consider both the magnitude of elements in $w$, and the available perturbation budget. But it still only needs to check the elements in $w$ and the input bounds once, so does not increase time complexity.\n\nYes I also believe that this bound can be relatively loose for convolutional layers - especially when $k$ is large, e.g., $k$ equals to the number of non-zero elements in $w$, then the perturbation is like a L infinity perturbation with unbounded $\\epsilon$. For small $k$ the provided results look reasonable. Some discussions on this can be useful in the paper.\n\nI have changed my rating to weak accept, and tend to accept this paper based on the new results.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1710/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1710/AnonReviewer2", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["pchiang@cs.umd.edu", "rn9zm@cs.umd.edu", "akader@cs.umd.edu", "chenzhu@cs.umd.edu", "studer@cornell.edu", "tomg@cs.umd.edu"], "title": "Certified Defenses for Adversarial Patches", "authors": ["Ping-yeh Chiang*", "Renkun Ni*", "Ahmed Abdelkader", "Chen Zhu", "Christoph Studor", "Tom Goldstein"], "pdf": "/pdf/eca8d8043a2dd4f4bd5d4024fd96b917556bcb47.pdf", "abstract": "Adversarial patch attacks are among one of the most practical threat models against real-world computer vision systems. This paper studies certified and empirical defenses against patch attacks. We begin with a set of experiments showing that most existing defenses, which work by pre-processing input images to mitigate adversarial patches, are easily broken by simple white-box adversaries. Motivated by this finding, we propose the first certified defense against patch attacks, and propose faster methods for its training. Furthermore, we experiment with different patch shapes for testing, obtaining surprisingly good robustness transfer across shapes, and present preliminary results on certified defense against sparse attacks.

is interesting to note that fully connected only architecture performs the best among all architectures that we experimented in the past few hours. The approach does not perform very well when applied to the convolutional networks because the matrix is very sparse leading to very loose interval bounds with the top-k approach. Moreover, the interval bounds would be vacuous when the number of pixels k is larger than the size of the convolutional kernel.

The technique is simple\nbut effective. Since the number of possible patches are quadratic w.r.t image\ndimension, to reduce the number of bounds to propagate, the authors propose a\nU-Net based NN to predict the worst case scenario, and only propagate \"worst\ncase\" bounds predicted by the U-net.\n\nEmpirically, the proposed method gets good results, with certified accuracy\nsometimes even higher than empirical accuracy by previous methods.  The authors\nalso provide results for transferring robustness properties to shapes that are\nnot included during training.\n\nOverall, the contribution of this paper is novel, and results are promising,\nbut it still has some missing components, especially the idea of combining\nmultiple IBP bounds into one, which can be very effective for adversarial\npatches, as I will elaborate below.\n\nSuggestions and Questions:\n\nThe core idea behind IBP is that for whatever input perturbation is given (any\nLp norm or semi-norm, or non-norm based perturbations like patches at arbitrary\nlocations), it converts them to per-neuron lower and upper bounds after the\nfirst linear/conv layer.  For example, if the input perturbation is *two* patches\nB_1 and B_2, after propagating them through the first layer of the network, we\ngot two lower bounds l_{i,1}, l_{i,2} and two upper bounds u_{i,1}, u_{i,2} for\nthe i-th neuron. We then take the worst case bound, l_i = min(l_{i,1},\nl_{i,2}), u_i = max(u_{i,1}, u_{i,2}) and propagate only one set of bounds l_i\nand u_i to the next layer. The authors should explore on this direction, as\ndetailed below:\n\n1. For the exhaustive patch enumeration in (11), we can actually greatly reduce\nthe computation cost by combining the bounds of different patches after the\nfirst layer of the network, as I mentioned above. At the input layer, the\nnumber of bounds (each for one possible location of patch) are large; but after\nthe first linear/conv layer, we can compress them to one or a small group of\nbounds by taking the worst cast of them, like l_i = min(l_{i,1}, ...,\nl_{i,|L|}), u_i = max(u_{i,1}, ..., u_{i,2}). The patches close with each other\nshould also produces similar lower and upper bounds, so taking min or max over\nthem will not make the combined bounds much worse. This is better than U-net\nprediction since we are guaranteed to include the worst case scenario.\n\n2. Considering multiple patches (at different locations) on a single input. In\nthe simplest case, consider multiple 1x1 patches (in fact, this is equivalent\nto bounded L0 norm threat model); since each patch is 1x1 (only changing one\npixel), the bounds should be relatively tight after the first layer, and after\nthe first linear/conv layer we got 28*28 or 32*32 bounds which will be combined\ninto one or very few sets of lower and upper bounds that will be propagate into\nlater layers.  Multiple larger patches (2x2, 5x5) can be difficult since bounds\nare looser; multiple 1x1 in my opinion is both technically feasible and\npractically important, and should definitely be included in this paper.\n\n\nMinor issues:\n\n1. Eq. (5) and (6) are incorrect; the second term should be \\overline{z} -\n\\underline{z}. Also it is missing the bias term.\n\n2. In related works (section 4.1, page 3), (Weng et al., 2018) is not a defense\nmethod (it is a certification method, and no training is involved).\n\n3. In Table 3, it is better if the authors can provide empirical adversarial\naccuracy to IBP defended networks as well.\n\nOverall, I think it is a good paper but the authors should explore more to\nstrengthen their contributions. I gave a weak reject but I will not hesitate\nto recommend an accept as long as the authors can provide additional results\nmentioned above.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1710/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1710/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["pchiang@cs.umd.edu", "rn9zm@cs.umd.edu", "akader@cs.umd.edu", "chenzhu@cs.umd.edu", "studer@cornell.edu", "tomg@cs.umd.edu"], "title": "Certified Defenses for Adversarial Patches", "authors": ["Ping-yeh Chiang*", "Renkun Ni*", "Ahmed Abdelkader", "Chen Zhu", "Christoph Studor", "Tom Goldstein"], "pdf": "/pdf/eca8d8043a2dd4f4bd5d4024fd96b917556bcb47.pdf", "abstract": "Adversarial patch attacks are among one of the most practical threat models against real-world computer vision systems.

Please make sure to mention it in the main text for the final revision, as I believe it is an important contribution. \n\nI am considering increasing the rating. However I believe multiple 1x1 boxes are doable.\n\nLet consider there are 32x32 positions (so dimension of input $x$ 1024), and we have a linear layer with weights $W$ in shape $N \\times 1024$, where $N$ is the number of neurons. For each neuron, we can see its output as a dot product between the 1024-dimensional input, and a row of the weight matrix (denoted as $w$). Now we consider the case, where we can only perturb 1 of the 32x32 positions. What is the output lower bound and upper bound for that neuron? Apparently, we can increase the output of that neuron by increasing a pixel value that is corresponding to a positive coefficient in $w$, and vise versa. And apparently to reached the upper and lower bound, we perturb the single pixel corresponding to largest element in $w$. Importantly, you just need to look at the largest element in $w$ to determine its output upper and lower bound. We don't need 32x32 boxes at all.\n\nNow we consider the general case, where we can perturb $k$ of the 32x32 positions. Then you need to look into the $k$ largest element in $w$ to determine the neurons output lower and upper bounds. There is no need to construct 32x32 boxes, again.\n\nI strongly encourage the authors to look into the multiple 1x1 patch case above, as it is a very important use case, and also should be fairly straightforward and efficient to implement.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1710/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1710/AnonReviewer2", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["pchiang@cs.umd.edu", "rn9zm@cs.umd.edu", "akader@cs.umd.edu", "chenzhu@cs.umd.edu", "studer@cornell.edu", "tomg@cs.umd.edu"], "title": "Certified Defenses for Adversarial Patches", "authors": ["Ping-yeh Chiang*", "Renkun Ni*", "Ahmed Abdelkader", "Chen Zhu", "Christoph Studor", "Tom Goldstein"], "pdf": "/pdf/eca8d8043a2dd4f4bd5d4024fd96b917556bcb47.pdf", "abstract": "Adversarial patch attacks are among one of the most practical threat models against real-world computer vision systems.

We ran additional experiments using a larger model, as requested, and elaborated on the significance of the reported results w.r.t. state-of-the-art in certified accuracy.\n\n*** Main Comments ***\n\nR1: \u201cAn experiment that is definitely missing is a CIFAR network that performs a little better\u201d\n\nAuthor(s): Per your suggestion, in the revised manuscript, we have trained a new model which performs considerably better in terms of validation accuracy on benign examples. The new defended model which is a considerably larger model achieves 66.5% accuracy* on the benign examples (a 16.2% increase compared to the narrower convolutional models in the original submission). The certified accuracy for the new model on the CIFAR 2x2 task is also improved to 51.9% (a 10.3% increase). The large model significantly outperforms the previous all-patch trained model, even though it has only been trained using guided patches. Note that we were not able to complete all-patch training during the rebuttal phase on the large model as it takes almost 15 days to complete the training on our workstation.\n\n>>> We have updated our manuscript to include the experimental results for the large model in Appendix A.4. Upon acceptance, we will include all-patch results in the camera-ready version.\n\n(*) For the non-defended model, the large model achieve 88.9% clean accuracy.\n\n\nR1: \u201csometimes the IBP approach is useful for defense, although often with a significant loss in accuracy on clean data\u201d\n\nAuthor(s): The trade-off between robustness and generalization has been argued to exist both from a theoretical perspective and also empirically [3, 4]. Some loss in accuracy in certified robustness compared to clean accuracy is typical for all certified (and most empirical) defenses. Our proposed certified defense, which is the first certified defense against adversarial patch attacks, is no exception to this. To put our reported results in perspective, we consider state-of-the-art results for (a) certified robustness against L-inf perturbations, and (b) (non-certifying) empirical defenses against patch attacks; see below. \n\n(a) The State-of-the-art certified model for CIFAR with 16/255 L-inf perturbation using deterministic algorithms [5] achieves clean accuracy of 34.0%, whereas our clean accuracy for our most robust CIFAR 5 \u2a09 5 model is 47.8% (for the updated large model). To further appreciate the performance of our model, note that our threat model allows the attacker to change each pixel within the patch to any desired value, whereas the L-inf perturbation model of [5] assumes the adversary can only change each pixel by at most some epsilon, e.g., 16/255. \n\n>>> This remark was added to the manuscript at the bottom of Section 5.1.\n\n(b) State-of-the-art empirical (non-certified) defenses against patch attacks achieve much lower robustness (i.e, adversarial accuracy) than our approach. In particular, local gradient smoothing (LGS) [2] achieves 24.2% empirical accuracy on CIFAR 2\u2a092 while our method achieves 51.9% certified accuracy (for the largest model trained). Similarly, digital watermarking (DW) [1] achieves 15.6% empirical accuracy on CIFAR 5\u2a095 while our method achieves 30.3% certified accuracy (for the largest model trained).\n\nFinally, we acknowledge that certified defenses may not be ready for real world applications.  However, our contribution makes an important step towards securing ML systems against adversarial patch attacks by substantially improving both the clean and robust accuracy achievable by a certified model.\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Jamie Hayes.

Compared to the straightforward all-patch defense, under a fixed computational budget, the accuracy of the proposed random-patch training and guided-patch training is significantly improved, which is not necessarily obvious or expected. Even the seemingly interesting idea of incorporating bound pooling after the first layer, as proposed by the expert Reviewer #2, did not reduce computation enough to scale to larger models.\n\nWe also make a range of empirical observations that we think are important enough to count as contributions. Namely, we show that state-of-the-art empirical patch defenses are easily breakable, and quantify this effect.\n\nFinally, the clean and robust accuracies we achieve exceed other L-infinity certified models and existing patch defense methods. As such, we believe that our work makes an important step towards patch defenses.\n\nR1: \u201creal-life images with patches that are of real-life size\u201d\n\nAuthor(s): As CIFAR images are only 32\u2a0932, we are unable to experiment with patch size this big.

[..] This is better than U-net prediction ..\u201d\n\nAuthor(s): The proposed bound pooling still scales quadratically w.r.t. image dimension, although it does reduce computational costs compared to the straightforward all-patch training. In contrast, the proposed random- and guided-patch approaches scale better allowing the training of larger models.\n\nA new Appendix A.3 includes extra experiments with bound pooling: We tested bound pooling over 2\u2a092/4\u2a094 patches in the first layer, 2\u2a092 patches in the first layer and 4\u2a094 patches in the second layer. Compared to all-patch training, this implementation of bound pooling indeed reduces the computational cost by 25-35% while being only slightly worse in terms of certified accuracy; please refer to Table 5.\n\n\nR2: \u201cConsidering multiple patches (at different locations) on a single input. [..] multiple 1x1 in my opinion is both technically feasible and practically important, and should definitely be included in the paper\u201d \n\nAuthor(s): Unfortunately, this interesting setup is computationally infeasible. We actually considered this formulation earlier but could not pursue it due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of patches, see below for more details.\n\nIn the specific example of 1\u2a091 patch, when we take the maximum of upper bounds generated by all patches, we are not getting the upper bounds for moving all pixels at the same time, rather we get the worst case bounds when we are allowed to move a single pixel, but not moving any of them together. To give an actual certificate, we have to consider (32\u2a0932) position for the first patch and (32\u2a0932-1) position for the second patch, and we would have to forward pass all of these possible combinations forward in order to get an actual certificate. Unfortunately, this is computationally infeasible, but is very interesting nonetheless.\n\n\n*** Other Comments ***\n- We have removed reference to Weng's\n- We have fixed the typos in equation (5) & (6)\n- We have included empirical adversarial accuracy to Table 3\n- There was a minor bug in our code that didn\u2019t have a significant impact on any of the results.
