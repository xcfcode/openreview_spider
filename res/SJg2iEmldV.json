Moreover, the authors propose an extension of margin based sampling, titled Class Margin Sampling (CMS).\n\nWhile the idea of the paper sounds interesting and useful, this paper however is very difficult to read and is not reproducible. While I understand that the 4 page constraint limits how ample the explanations can be, there are some crucial details missing, that could have been added by simply citing other papers. I believe once this paper is rewritten it can make for an interesting contribution, but in its current form it requires a major revision.\n\nHere are, in my opinion, the main weaknesses, in the order of importance:\n\n1. Experiments: the experimental section reports accuracies on a dataset that is never mentioned. What is the task, how many classes are you classifying into? What is the input space? There is no description nor citation for this.\n\n2. The paper is difficult to read, although I read it multiple times. Quite a few statements are not supported by explanations, which made it hard to follow the paper. For example:\n- CMS is an extension to standard margin sampling, but standard margin sampling itself is never described or referenced. In order to understand why it needs improvement, we first have to understand how it works, even if it's a one sentence description. \n- \"adding an external more explicit memory-structure could be helpful in increasing the accuracy of the system, similar to (Santoro et al., 2016b)\" -- so how is this work different than Santoro et al., 2016b? \n- why is \"usually C_cms = C \u00d7 2\" ?\n- \"This is because the first sample in every episode shouldn\u2019t have considerable bias towards a specific class, which anyhow should be considered noise.\"  -- why would it have such bias and why should it be considered noise anyhow? \n- \"followed by a reset operation of both memory and hidden state\" -- no sharing of info between tasks/classes. Why?\n- I don't understand problem 1 described on page 3.\n- \"Our task structure is not compatible with a similar scheme, \"  -- why?\n\n3. Editing and grammar issues:\n- Forgetting fullstops at the end of sentences: e.g., \"[...] increasing accuracy on one-shot predictions Given that the NTM [...]\", also at the end of LSTM Baseline Model paragraph.\n- Issues with subject and verb in a sentence: \"all T samples from a class is used [...]\", \"Models that are capable of learning [...] is also of great interest\".\n- \"Figure Figure 2a\"", "rating": "1: Strong rejection", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper33/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper33/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Augmented Memory Networks for Streaming-Based Active One-Shot Learning", "authors": ["Anonymous"], "authorids": ["ahk9339@gmail.com", "massimiliano.ruocco@ntnu.no", "eliezer.souza.silva@ntnu.no", "erlend.aune@ntnu.no"], "keywords": ["Active Learning", "Reinforcement Learning", "Few-Shot Learning"], "abstract": "One of the major challenges in training deep architectures for predictive tasks is the scarcity and cost of labeled training data.
