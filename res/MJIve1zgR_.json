Although there are great progresses on semi-supervised classification, the SSOD is lying behind. This paper shows very good results over the supervised baselines, even when all annotations are used in COCO. \n\n+The proposed method is very simple. It seems the paper is easy to be reproduced.\n\n+It is a good idea to use EMA of mean teacher for SSOD. In addition, the focal loss (FL) is shown to be very useful in SSOD. \n\nA few questions:\n\n-The default FL is mainly for +/- class imbalance. Do you have modified for imbalance among all positive classes?\n\n-It seems FL is more useful than EMA. However, FL is not well ablated. For example, it is the balance between +/- classes more important or among all positive classes? How about the other SSOD, e.g. STAC, using FL?\n\n-It is understandable that EMA model is more reliable. But I don't see it can be beneficial for class imbalance issue explicitly. \n\n-The comparisons with the baseline supervised models seem to be not very fair. For example, in the last column of Table 1, the supervised model uses 1x schedule (90k iterations), but the proposed method uses 4x schedule. From the Detectron2 github, the 3x model should have AP of 40.2. When compared with 4x supervised baseline, the gain of this paper should be much smaller. The same issue could also be in the other COCO-standard experiments. More fair comparisons should be presented.\n\n-Don't quite understand Fig. 4. Too few description. What are burn-in limit and GT. Why are they constant?\n\n-For the paragraph of \"Class-imbalance on pseudo-labels\", if you don't show results, why you write it in Sec. 4.1, instead of Sec. 4.2?\n\n-It is very weird to cite Law & Deng, 2018, when you refer to AP50 saturation. There are tons of paper out there showing that. \n\n-For the AP curves, do you evaluate on the full val2017 set? It seems the data points are very dense. Isn't it expensive?\n\n-I don't think the smoother curve of EMA teacher is the weights of teacher model is detached from the student model. \n\n=====updates========\n\nMost of my concerns have been addressed by the rebuttal and all the other reviews are positive. l will remain my original recommendation.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper712/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper712/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unbiased Teacher for Semi-Supervised Object Detection", "authorids": ["~Yen-Cheng_Liu1", "~Chih-Yao_Ma1", "zijian@fb.com", "~Chia-Wen_Kuo1", "~Kan_Chen1", "~Peizhao_Zhang1", "~Bichen_Wu1", "~Zsolt_Kira1", "~Peter_Vajda1"], "authors": ["Yen-Cheng Liu", "Chih-Yao Ma", "Zijian He", "Chia-Wen Kuo", "Kan Chen", "Peizhao Zhang", "Bichen Wu", "Zsolt Kira", "Peter Vajda"], "keywords": ["Object Detection"], "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning, i.e., training networks with both labeled and unlabeled data, has made significant progress recently.

More specifically, the unbiased teacher framework combines the Mean Teacher model for semi-supervised image classification (Tarvainen and Valpola 2017) and Focal Loss (Lin et al. 2017) for fully supervised object detection to address the bias issue. Experiments on COCO and PASCAL VOC show that the proposed method obtains the state-of-the-art semi-supervised object detection results.\n\n\nPros:\n\n+ The paper is well written and easy to understand.\n\n+ The motivations of this paper are clear and interesting.\n\n+ A very simple but effective solution is proposed.\n\n+ Very solid experiments are conducted.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- The main weakness of this paper is that the proposed method is a simple combination of the previous methods including Mean Teacher and Focal Loss.\nIn addition, for the foreground/background imbalance issue, it is straightforward to generate pseudo gts to address this issue, which also has been studied by previous semi-supervised object detection work (Sohn et al. 2020). For the class imbalance issue in object detection, it is also straightforward to use Focal Loss to address this issue.\n\n- One minor thing: It would be better to show results of different detectors / CNN backbones.\n\n\nReview summary:\nIn summary, I think this is a good semi-supervised object detection paper because of its simple but effective solution and solid experiments.

Do we modify the Focal loss?**\n- Yes, we modify the binary focal loss to multi-class focal loss for all positive classes and the background class. Our ROIhead predicts all foreground classes and the background class ($N+1$ nodes class prediction). We have clarified this in the Section 3.3 of the revised paper.\n---\n**2. Ablation on variants of Focal loss**\n\nTo compare the effect of foreground-background imbalance and foreground classes imbalance, we construct two variants of focal loss, foreground-only focal loss and binary focal loss. For foreground-only focal loss, we only apply focal loss weight ($1-p$) on these foreground instances and apply constant $1$ on all background instances (*i.e.,* thus becomes standard cross-entropy for background instances). We experiment these Focal loss variants on COCO-standard 1% labeled setting. We observe that foreground-only Focal loss can improve $2.7$ AP compared to the model using the cross-entropy. When the binary Focal loss is used, it could further improve $0.83$ AP. By addressing both foreground-background imbalance and foreground classes imbalance, our model could perform the best result ($20.75$ AP). \n\n|              \t| Cross-entropy \t | Foreground-only Focal loss \t | Binary Focal loss \t  | Multi-class Focal loss \t|\n|--------------\t|:-------------:\t|:--------------------------:\t|:-----------------:\t|:----------------------:\t|\n| $AP^{50:95}$ \t|    $16.95$    \t|           $19.65$          \t|      $20.48$      \t|         $20.75$        \t|\n\n---\n**3. How does the STAC perform if the Focal loss is used?**\n- We also apply multi-class focal loss on STAC and experiment on the COCO-standard 1% labeled setting as shown in the following table. There is no improvement when we apply Focal loss on STAC. This is because the pseudo-labels generated by STAC are fixed and never refined during the training iterations, and thus STAC does not suffer from pseudo-labeling bias problems propagating across training, though the overall performance is much worse due to this limited training regime.\n\n|               \t| STAC w/ Cross-entropy \t     | STAC w/ multi-class Focal loss \t    |\n|---------------\t|:---------------------:    \t    |:------------------------------:\t    |\n| $AP^{50:95}$ \t|         $13.97$             \t|             $ 13.94$                 \t|\n\n---"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper712/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper712/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unbiased Teacher for Semi-Supervised Object Detection", "authorids": ["~Yen-Cheng_Liu1", "~Chih-Yao_Ma1", "zijian@fb.com", "~Chia-Wen_Kuo1", "~Kan_Chen1", "~Peizhao_Zhang1", "~Bichen_Wu1", "~Zsolt_Kira1", "~Peter_Vajda1"], "authors": ["Yen-Cheng Liu", "Chih-Yao Ma", "Zijian He", "Chia-Wen Kuo", "Kan Chen", "Peizhao Zhang", "Bichen Wu", "Zsolt Kira", "Peter Vajda"], "keywords": ["Object Detection"], "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning, i.e., training networks with both labeled and unlabeled data, has made significant progress recently.

For the COCO-additional experiments, we used the reported value from STAC paper. For a fair and better comparison, we show the complete results for COCO-additional in the following table. Our model achieves $41.30$ when $3$x schedule is used, and it performs favorably against CSD and STAC. Note that supervised-only baseline benefits from weight-decay learning scheduler, while our Unbiased Teacher only used a simple constant learning rate (*i.e.,* $0.01$) through whole training. We believe the Unbiased Teacher could be further improved by using a more advanced learning rate scheduler, but we leave this for future research. We appreciate the Reviewer 1 for pointing this out, and we have corrected this table accordingly in the revised paper (Table 2 of the revised paper).\n|                            \t| Schedule (x = $90K$)          | $AP^{50:95}$ \t|\n|----------------------------\t|:----------------------------------------:\t|:-------:\t|\n|      Supervised Only       \t|        $1$x        \t|  $37.63$  \t|\n|      Supervised Only       \t|         $3$x         \t|  $40.20$  \t|\n|    CSD (our reproduced)    \t|         $3$x         \t|  $38.82$  \t|\n| STAC (from original paper) \t|         $6$x         \t|  $39.21$  \t|\n|            Ours            \t|         $3$x         \t|  $41.30$  \t|\n|            Ours            \t|         $4$x         \t|  $41.53$  \t|\n\n- For the COCO-standard setting, all methods in Table 1 use a $2$x scheduler (*i.e.,* $180K$ iterations for training) for the fair comparison. We also observed that the supervised-only baseline converges in the early stage of the training due to the severe overfitting issue of classifiers as presented in Figure 1 of the main paper.\n---\n**6. Clarification on Figure 4** \n- Thank you for the question; we have revised the paper to better explain this. We intended to show that the teacher-student mutual learning stage could further improve the quality of pseudo-labels (in terms of pseudo-box accuracy, pseudo-box IoU, and number of pseudo-boxes) compared to the model. \n- The burn-in limit curves indicate the pseudo-boxes obtained from the model right after the burn-in stage without further refinement (*i.e.,* the model trained on labeled data only). GT curve on the number of boxes figure indicates the averaged number of bounding boxes in the ground-truth labels, and we showed that there are around $7$ bounding boxes per MS-COCO image on average. We have added further detail to the revision to make this clear.\n\n---\n**7. Paragraph of \u201cClass-imbalance on pseudo-labels\u201d in Section 4.1**\n- Thanks for the suggestion. We put the description in Section 4.1 to summarize the reasons why we could improve in comparison to existing works. We have re-organized this paragraph accordingly. \n---\n**8.

How does EMA alleviate biased pseudo-labeling issues?**\n\n- The reasons why EMA can alleviate biased pseudo-labeling issues are two-fold: \n    - In the teacher refinement stage, EMA **improves the stability (*i.e.,* consistent balance) of the teacher model** by preserving the previous teacher model weights.\n    - In the student learning stage, EMA **makes the prediction of the student model more balanced** by using more stable targets (*e.g.,* pseudo-labels) from a more balanced teacher.\n- **What if EMA is not used?** When EMA is not used and the teacher model does not preserve the previous teacher model weights, the teacher\u2019s prediction will gradually bias to the majority class. This is because biasing prediction toward the majority classes enables the model to minimize the training loss by easily predicting the majority classes for most instances. Thus, the new decision boundary of the teacher model moves towards the minority classes (*i.e.* pushes into the feature space of the minority class, hence causing the model to classify them as the majority classes). As the pseudo-labeling method uses the previous teacher\u2019s prediction as another supervision for the student in the next step, the pseudo-labeling, which is designed to address low-label scenarios, aggravates the imbalanced prediction issue. \n\n- **Higher stability of teacher model:** With the EMA mechanism, the new teacher model is regularized by the previous teacher model, and this prevents the decision boundary from drastically moving toward the minority classes. In detail, we could express the teacher model weight as the following equation:\n$$\n\\theta^i_t = \\hat{\\theta} - \\gamma \\sum_{k=1}^{i-1} (1-\\alpha^{-k+(i-1)}) \\dfrac{\\partial(L_{sup} + \\lambda_u L_{unsup}) }{\\partial \\theta^k_s},\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\theta}$ is the model weight after the burn-in stage, $\\theta^i_t$ is the teacher model weight in $i$th iteration, $\\theta^k_s$ is the student model weight in $k$th iteration, $\\gamma$ is the learning rate, $\\alpha$ is the EMA decay (which we use 0.9996),  $L_{sup}$ and $L_{unsup}$ are supervised and unsupervised loss respectively, and ${\\lambda}_u$ is the unsupervised loss weight.\nThe regularization of the previous teacher model is equivalent to putting an additional small coefficient on the gradients on student models in previous steps. With the slowly altered decision boundary (*i.e.,* higher stability), the pseudo-labels of these unlabeled instances are less likely to also change dramatically, and the teacher model thus generates more stable pseudo-labels. We have added this discussion in Section 3.3 of the revised paper.\n- **Better unbiased student:** The teacher model\u2019s predictions in the current step are processed to pseudo-labels and then guide the student model\u2019s prediction in the next step. Thus, if the teacher\u2019s prediction is more stable in its predicted class distribution, the student trained on more balanced pseudo-labels is less likely to be biased to specific classes. This avoids the consecutive biased prediction problem described in the main paper. (Pseudo-labeling methods for semi-supervised tasks aggravate the class-imbalance issue that exists in object detection, as pseudo-labeling methods can be regarded as a closed-loop system.) \n- To further empirically examine the effectiveness of EMA on imbalance, we present the pseudo-label distribution in different training iterations as presented in the following table (we also present the corresponding figure in the Appendix of the revised paper). At the beginning of training (*i.e.,* 30k), both teacher models with and without EMA could generate the balanced pseudo-labels (the KL divergence between ground-truth labels and pseudo-labels are both small). However, since the Student model is trained with the pseudo-labels generated by the Teacher models, the model without EMA starts biasing towards specific classes. In contrast, with the EMA training, the model generates less imbalanced pseudo-labels. Note that, although the EMA is applied, the balance issue still exists. We thus apply Focal loss to enhance the ability to mitigate the imbalance issue further. \n|             \t| $30K$ iterations | $140K$ iterations |\n|:-----------:\t|:--------------:\t|:---------------:\t|\n| Without EMA \t|     $0.0920$     \t|      $1.7915$     \t|\n|   With EMA  \t|     $0.0730$     \t|      $0.2482$     \t|\n\nWe appreciate the reviewer\u2019s constructive feedback, and we have added the above discussions in Section 3.3 and the appendix of the revised paper."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper712/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper712/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unbiased Teacher for Semi-Supervised Object Detection", "authorids": ["~Yen-Cheng_Liu1", "~Chih-Yao_Ma1", "zijian@fb.com", "~Chia-Wen_Kuo1", "~Kan_Chen1", "~Peizhao_Zhang1", "~Bichen_Wu1", "~Zsolt_Kira1", "~Peter_Vajda1"], "authors": ["Yen-Cheng Liu", "Chih-Yao Ma", "Zijian He", "Chia-Wen Kuo", "Kan Chen", "Peizhao Zhang", "Bichen Wu", "Zsolt Kira", "Peter Vajda"], "keywords": ["Object Detection"], "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning, i.e., training networks with both labeled and unlabeled data, has made significant progress recently.

Thus, if the teacher\u2019s prediction is more stable in its predicted class distribution, the student trained on more balanced pseudo-labels is less likely to be biased to specific classes. This avoids the consecutive biased prediction problem described in the main paper. (Pseudo-labeling methods for semi-supervised tasks aggravate the class-imbalance issue that exists in object detection, as pseudo-labeling methods can be regarded as a closed-loop system.) \n- To further empirically examine the effectiveness of EMA on imbalance, we present the pseudo-label distribution in different training iterations as presented in the following table (we present the corresponding figure in the Appendix of the revised paper). At the beginning of training (*i.e.,* 30k), both teacher models with and without EMA could generate the balanced pseudo-labels (the KL divergence between ground-truth labels and pseudo-labels are both small). However, since the Student model is trained with the pseudo-labels generated by the Teacher models, the model without EMA starts biasing towards specific classes. In contrast, with the EMA training, the model generates less imbalanced pseudo-labels. Note that, although the EMA is applied, the balance issue still exists. We thus apply Focal loss to enhance the ability to mitigate the imbalance issue further. \n|             \t|$30K$ iterations   |   $140K$ iterations  |\n|:-----------:\t|:--------------:\t|:---------------:\t|\n| Without EMA \t|     $0.0920$     \t|      $1.7915$     \t|\n|   With EMA  \t|     $0.0730$     \t|      $0.2482$     \t|\n\nWe appreciate the reviewer\u2019s constructive feedback, and we have added the above discussions in Section 3.3 and the appendix of the revised paper. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper712/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper712/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unbiased Teacher for Semi-Supervised Object Detection", "authorids": ["~Yen-Cheng_Liu1", "~Chih-Yao_Ma1", "zijian@fb.com", "~Chia-Wen_Kuo1", "~Kan_Chen1", "~Peizhao_Zhang1", "~Bichen_Wu1", "~Zsolt_Kira1", "~Peter_Vajda1"], "authors": ["Yen-Cheng Liu", "Chih-Yao Ma", "Zijian He", "Chia-Wen Kuo", "Kan Chen", "Peizhao Zhang", "Bichen Wu", "Zsolt Kira", "Peter Vajda"], "keywords": ["Object Detection"], "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning, i.e., training networks with both labeled and unlabeled data, has made significant progress recently.

Why is there a drop in $AP^{50}$?**\n- As mentioned in [1, 2],  $AP^{50}$ is a saturated metric for evaluating object detection tasks, since it counts predicted bounding boxes with IoU larger $0.5$ as correct predictions. This makes all methods perform close to upper-bound (using VOC07+VOC12 labeled set can perform $80.94$%).\n- In the case of VOC07 (labeled) + VOC12 (unlabeled), our number reported in the paper ($77.37$%) only performs $0.08$% lower than STAC ($77.45$%) in the metric of  $AP^{50}$. The reported value is from a single run. We conducted an additional run, and it achieved $77.71$% $AP^{50}$. We note that both methods have similar performance on the metric  $AP^{50}$ (*i.e.,* within the range of variance), while our model could significantly achieve $4.03$% absolute improvement in the metric of  $AP^{50:95}$, which is regarded as a more challenging metric for evaluating object detectors. \n\n[1] \u201cCascade R-CNN: Delving into High Quality Object Detection\u201d, Cai et al., CVPR 2018\\\n[2] \u201cA Simple Semi-Supervised Learning Framework for Object Detection\u201d, Sohn et al., arXiv 2020\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper712/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper712/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unbiased Teacher for Semi-Supervised Object Detection", "authorids": ["~Yen-Cheng_Liu1", "~Chih-Yao_Ma1", "zijian@fb.com", "~Chia-Wen_Kuo1", "~Kan_Chen1", "~Peizhao_Zhang1", "~Bichen_Wu1", "~Zsolt_Kira1", "~Peter_Vajda1"], "authors": ["Yen-Cheng Liu", "Chih-Yao Ma", "Zijian He", "Chia-Wen Kuo", "Kan Chen", "Peizhao Zhang", "Bichen Wu", "Zsolt Kira", "Peter Vajda"], "keywords": ["Object Detection"], "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning, i.e., training networks with both labeled and unlabeled data, has made significant progress recently.

We also observed that simply using the SOTA classification technique without considering imbalance issues leads to even worse performance than the supervised-only baseline as shown in Figure 5 (blue curve). On the other hand, as shown in the following table, simply combining STAC (Sohn et al.) and focal loss cannot perform satisfactory results, since the pseudo-labels generated by STAC are not further refined. \n|               \t| STAC w/ Cross-entropy \t    | STAC w/ multi-class Focal loss \t    |\n|---------------\t|:---------------------:    \t    |:------------------------------:\t    |\n| $AP^{50:95}$ \t|         $13.97$             \t|             $ 13.94$                 \t|\n\n- Another merit of our model is simplicity, which enables several extensions to the semi-supervised tasks based on object detectors (*e.g.,* scene graph parsing).

The authors introduced a training regime where a teacher and student network, who share the same initial weights pre-trained on labeled data, jointly learns on unsupervised data. They find that label imbalance in the object detection task can lead to inefficient pseudo-label training under the usual SSL training pipeline, and therefore proposes to train the teacher network via exponential moving average to avoid bias in pseudo-labels.\n\n\nPros:\n1. Revisiting of pseudo-labeling bias issue in semi-supervised object detection is good.\nThis paper analyze both classification and regression loss with different ratios of labelled data, which shows that classification branch can easily suffer from overfitting that limits current state-of-the-art semi-supervised object detectors. It shows that the misalignment between classification and regression branch not only exists in fully-supervised learning object detection, but also in self-supervised object detection. \n\n2. Experiments are solid and convincing.\nTable 1 & Table 2 show that unbiased teacher consistently improves state-of-the-art methods CSD and STAC by a large margin on both COCO and VOC dataset.\n\nCons:\n1. Process of VOC12 dataset.\nIn Table 2, since VOC12 has a large overlap with VOC07, is the VOC07 part removed from VOC12 as unlabeled data?\n\n2. Novelty\nNevertheless, some contributions seem a bit straight-forward and without significant novelty. The use of EMA is a direct adaptation from successful methods from classification, while Focal loss is already known to tackle class imbalance. The authors might need to provide more insights on the use of these methods (e.g. explaining in more detail how EMA alleviates such bias).\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper712/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper712/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unbiased Teacher for Semi-Supervised Object Detection", "authorids": ["~Yen-Cheng_Liu1", "~Chih-Yao_Ma1", "zijian@fb.com", "~Chia-Wen_Kuo1", "~Kan_Chen1", "~Peizhao_Zhang1", "~Bichen_Wu1", "~Zsolt_Kira1", "~Peter_Vajda1"], "authors": ["Yen-Cheng Liu", "Chih-Yao Ma", "Zijian He", "Chia-Wen Kuo", "Kan Chen", "Peizhao Zhang", "Bichen Wu", "Zsolt Kira", "Peter Vajda"], "keywords": ["Object Detection"], "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning, i.e., training networks with both labeled and unlabeled data, has made significant progress recently.
