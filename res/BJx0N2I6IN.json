It is a competently-executed reproduction attempt. It has successfully reproduced Bertinetto et al, modulo small, insignificant differences that do not affect the conclusions, provides a TensorFlow implementation of the original authors\u2019 proposed algorithm, and additionally resulted in the original authors releasing a PyTorch implementation.\n\nThe reproduction focuses on Bertinetto\u2019s proposed Ridge-Regression Differentiable Discriminator (R2D2), leaving aside their Logistic Regression Differentiable Discriminator (LRD2) because its solution is not truly closed-form. The reproduction provides a service to readers of Bertinetto\u2019s paper by providing the R2D2 algorithm in pseudo-code, rather than textual form.\n\nThe reproduction provides some background context for Bertinetto\u2019s paper, explaining the N-way K-shot (few-shot) meta-learning problem. Figures 1 & 2, however, do not succeed in explaining the problem well; They are as helpful as they are confusing.\n\nWhereas Bertinetto\u2019s paper fails to provide certain parameters of the neural network\u2019s convolutions layers, among others, the reproduction attempt correctly guesses and publishes them with their reproduction source code. Correspondence with Bertinetto et al via OpenReview has led to improvements to their paper and release of their code.\n\nThe reproduction attempt strengthens in some places Bertinetto\u2019s paper (and the older MAML paper), and is a worthy contribution to the workshop and to science in general. My only comment is that Figures 1 & 2 are not clear, and distract from the background explanation.\n", "rating": "5: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/RML/Paper3/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/RML"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Reproducing Meta-learning with differentiable closed-form solvers", "authors": ["Anonymous"], "authorids": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/RML/Paper3/Authors"], "keywords": ["reproducibility", "meta-learning", "closed-form", "few-shot", "miniimagenet", "cifar-fs", "deep learning"], "TL;DR": "We successfully reproduce and give remarks on the comparison with baselines of a meta-learning approach for few-shot classification that works by backpropagating through the solution of a closed-form solver.", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a reproduction of the paper of Bertinetto et al.
