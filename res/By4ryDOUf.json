However, I did not find any methods or discussions related to these claims. The method section is completely missing. \n\nAlthough the \"modular\" robot seems to be a big focus of this paper, it is not clear to me what part of the algorithm (which is missing) or the results are specific to improve learning for \"modular\" robots.\n\nThe results section is not clear too. For example, the terms PPO1 and PPO2 are not defined. I am not sure what their differences are. The task in the evaluation is a very simple reaching task. And I am not sure what is the conclusion of these preliminary results.\n\nIn summary, I think that this submission is not complete.
