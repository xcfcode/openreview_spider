The authors experimented on PTB and a temporal action detection method.\n\nNovelty:\n\nI dont see a lot of novelty to the method. The authors proposed a method very similar to TARDIS, the difference seems to be that MMARNN does not use extra usage vectors for reading from previous memory, but this is not a fundamental difference between MMARNN and Tardis.\n\nShortcomings of the paper:\n\n1. The experiments seem rather weak. The authors experimented on PTB and temporal action detection method. It is not clear why authors experimented with PTB, this is not a task with long-term dependencies, I do not see how this task (compared to many other tasks) can benefit from using external memory (especially when only 1 past hidden state is used\n\n2. The model uses a single past hidden state, it is not clear to me why this is better than using  a weighted sum of a few past hidden states, as many tasks requires long-term dependencies from multiple steps in the past. The authors should cite \"Sparse attentive backtracking\" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03702) at NIPS 2018. SAB is very related in that it also propagate gradients to a few hidden states in the memory. The difference is that SAB used a few hidden states from the past/ memory instead of one; another difference is that it propagates gradients locally to the selected hidden states/ memory slots.\n\n3. The paper only demonstrated experimental results on PTB and temporal action prediction. I think it would make the paper a lot stronger if the authors experimented with a variety of  different tasks. Tasks that requires long term dependencies can really demonstrate the strength of the model (copy and adding tasks).\n\n4. If the authors could run the model on copy and adding tasks, I would be curious to see if the model is picking the \"correct\" timestep in the memory / past.\n\npost rebuttal: I feel that the authors have addressed some of my concerns, in particular, in terms of additional experimental results. I have raised the score to reflect this changes.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper171/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "SEQUENCE MODELLING WITH AUTO-ADDRESSING AND RECURRENT MEMORY INTEGRATING NETWORKS", "abstract": "Processing sequential data with long term dependencies and learn complex transitions are two major challenges in many deep learning applications.

We apologize for not clearly stating our difference against TARDIS and causing some misunderstanding regarding the novelty. We have accordingly revised our paper and can address your concerns as follows:\n\nQ1:Novelty:I don't see a lot of novelty to the method. The authors proposed a method very similar to TARDIS, the difference seems to be that MMARNN does not use extra usage vectors for reading from previous memory, but this is not a fundamental difference between MARNN and Tardis.\n\nWe have discussed 5 important differences regarding the cell computation and addressing mechanism , supported by experimental evidences we added. Please refer to appendix B for a thorough comparison.\n\nQ2: The experiments seem rather weak. The authors experimented on PTB and temporal action detection method. It is not clear why authors experimented with PTB, this is not a task with long-term dependencies, I do not see how this task (compared to many other tasks) can benefit from using external memory (especially when only 1 past hidden state is used.\n\nWe apologize for not clearly stating the motivation of our dataset choice of PTB and THUMOS 14. As we state in the introduction, we aim at building a bridge between simple RNN and complex memory models. We primarily intend to focus on augmenting RNN's performance on real-world tasks with a light-weight external memory, but not focus on coming up with more functional and complex memory mechanism.  We choose PTB and THUMOS 14 tasks  because they are real-world tasks where we can examine if our memory network can be helpful.  In our network, each r_t , although only 1 past hidden state, is a summary of historical hidden states with skip connection selected by auto-addressing mechanism. The ARMIN(renamed from MARNN) cell learns to recurrently integrate the summary of historical information from r_t into h_t at every time-step, which favors a paradigm of deep transition, as is shown by the success of  deep-transition RNNs on PTB task.  We believe this  can explain why we choose PTB and why the ARMIN success on PTB.\n \nQ3: The model uses a single past hidden state, it is not clear to me why this is better than using  a weighted sum of a few past hidden states, as many tasks requires long-term dependencies from multiple steps in the past. The authors should cite \"Sparse attentive backtracking\" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03702) at NIPS 2018. SAB is very related in that it also propagate gradients to a few hidden states in the memory. The difference is that SAB used a few hidden states from the past/ memory instead of one; another difference is that it propagates gradients locally to the selected hidden states/ memory slots.\n\nThank you for pointing out this paper, and we have cited and introduced the SAB in our paper. As we state in Q1, each r_t is a summary of historical hidden states with skip connection selected by auto-addressing mechanism(we train the selecting process by backpropagation), so there is no fundamental difference from using  a weighted sum of a few past hidden states.  Another reason is that the gumbel-softmax can only sample 1-hot vector, so we think a more fundamental comparison between ARMIN and SAB should be : is the 1-hot sampling of gumbel-softmax better or multiple selecting of ReLU and softmax addressing mechanism in SAB is better? Due to time constraints, we leave this for future work.\n\nQ3&4. The paper only demonstrated experimental results on PTB and temporal action prediction. I think it would make the paper a lot stronger if the authors experimented with a variety of  different tasks. Tasks that requires long term dependencies can really demonstrate the strength of the model (copy and adding tasks). If the authors could run the model on copy and adding tasks, I would be curious to see if the model is picking the \"correct\" timestep in the memory / past.\n\nWe have added a set of algorithmic tasks introduced by the NTM paper, including copy, repeat copy, associative recall and priority sort. We think these tasks do require exact long-term dependency, and we demonstrate the efficiency of our network on these tasks. Specifically, our network can converge 3~4 time faster in terms wall clock time than NTM on most of the tasks. We also adds enwik8 char-level lm tasks. We are currently doing experiment on pMNIST, but can't report in time as the training is very slow. We will report the results in later revision of our paper. \n\nWe hope these answers can address your concerns, thanks!\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper171/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper171/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper171/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SEQUENCE MODELLING WITH AUTO-ADDRESSING AND RECURRENT MEMORY INTEGRATING NETWORKS", "abstract": "Processing sequential data with long term dependencies and learn complex transitions are two major challenges in many deep learning applications.

We have added more experiments and can address your concerns as follows:\n\nQ1:It would be nice to compare the computation time/memory usage of MARNN with other memory augmented network such as TARDIS, NTM or Memory Network during training and inference. \n\nWe have compared our network (renamed as ARMIN)  with LSTM, NTM, TARDIS, ARMIN+TARDIS-addr in terms of speed/memory consumption during training and inference in section 5. The results shows our network constantly outperforms other memory networks.\n\nQ2:Another claim is that MARNN can possibly boost training speed by reducing the lengths of TBTT.  But MARNN also haves a training time overhead as showed in Figure 2.  How does the overall training time/performances of MARNN with TBPTT of 50 compared to a LSTM with TBPTT of 100/150?\n\nWe conduct a control experiment in section 5, and compare 2 different setup of ARMIN with TBPTT  of 50 against LSTM with TBPTT of 100/150. We show that ARMIN setup 1 obtain 40% training speed gain than LSTM with TBPTT of 150 while keeping a slightly better performance and 16% less parameter count; in ARMIN setup 2, we observe that with only 8.8% more memory consumption, we obtain about 1.5 points of BPC performance gain and 7.1% training speed gain under similar parameter count.\n\nQ3:The writing can be sometime a bit imprecise. For instance authors say that MARNN \u201clearns better representations that many hierarchical RNN structure\u201d. I agree that MARNN outperforms in term of accuracy, however, it is not clear what the author are referring to by \u201cbetter representation\u201d of the MARNN hidden state? Performance gain of MARNN could also be due to the external memory which allows  to retain more information of the input? \n\nBy saying \u201cbetter representations\u201d, we refer to the concatenation of the gated contents from h_t and r_t.  The performance gain comes from two aspect. a)If we remove the gated contents of r_t from o_t, the ARMIN undergoes a BPC performance drop from 1.202 to 1.220, which is still better than the best performing BPC of 1.24 of the LSTM. b)The rest of the performance gain comes from the recurrent memory integration of the ARMIN cell, which also favors a paradigm of deep transition, as is shown by the success of the deep transition RNNs on this task. Please refer to line 10 in page 7 for more details.\n\nQ4:It would be nice to precise which type of hierarchical RNN structure MARNN does (or doesn\u2019t) outperform.\n\nWe have specified in our paper that our network outperforms HM-LSTM, 2-Layer HyperLSTM and 21 layer IndRNN, and is outperformed by state-of-the-art BPC of 1.19 of HyperRHN and FS-LSTM.\n\nQ5:Another claim is that MARNN can \u201ceasily learn long-term dependencies\u201d. While this is reasonable, I am unsure that the empirical evaluation support this. \n\nWe add algorithmic tasks which require exact long-term dependencies introduce by the NTM paper, where we demonstrate the fast converge speed in most of the tasks both in terms of wall clock time and iteration numbers. We think this can support our claim of being able to \u201ceasily learn long-term dependencies\u201d.\n\nQ6:it is not entirely clear to me what is the main advantage of MARNN relatively to other memory networks network such as TARDIS, NTM or Memory Network for training and/or inference. Although authors do compare with TARDIS, further comparison with the other networks and in term of computation time and memory could help clarify those points. \n\nWe have done further comparison to address the concern, as we state in Q1. Our main advantage with respect to NTM and TARDIS are faster running speed, less memory consumption and better performance in real-world tasks (where we doubt the practicability of the carefully designed and complex addressing mechanism of the NTM).\n\nWe hope these answers can address your concerns, thanks!\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper171/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper171/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper171/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SEQUENCE MODELLING WITH AUTO-ADDRESSING AND RECURRENT MEMORY INTEGRATING NETWORKS", "abstract": "Processing sequential data with long term dependencies and learn complex transitions are two major challenges in many deep learning applications.

As we state in the introduction, we aim at building a bridge between simple RNN and complex memory models. We primarily intend to focus on augmenting RNN's performance on real-world tasks with a light-weight external memory, but not focus on coming up with more functional and complex memory mechanism.  We show in our experiments that our network  is effective in more real-world tasks(PTB and THUMOS14) and is more light-weight than other memory networks.  \n\nQ3. Authors should consider more tasks, to show the efficiency of the proposed architecture. \n\nWe have added a set of algorithmic tasks introduced by the Neural Turing machine paper, as well as the char-level language modelling task on enwik8 dataset. We are also doing experiments on pMNIST task but we can't report the results in time cause the pMNIST experiments runs very slow. We will report the results in later revisions.\n\nWe hope these answers can address your concerns, thanks!\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper171/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper171/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper171/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SEQUENCE MODELLING WITH AUTO-ADDRESSING AND RECURRENT MEMORY INTEGRATING NETWORKS", "abstract": "Processing sequential data with long term dependencies and learn complex transitions are two major challenges in many deep learning applications.

In a nutshell, authors propose to augment a LSTM-type architecture with several memory cells. At each time-step, MARNN retrieves one memory cell, updates his state, and updates the memory cell content. To learn the retrieval operation that requires discrete addressing,  authors rely on the Gumbel-Softmax. Authors evaluate their approach on PennTreeBank character level modelling where they demonstrate competitive performances. They also report state-of-art performance on the Thumos dataset. The paper is overall clear and pleasant to read. \n\nAuthors highlight that MARNN is more lightweight compared to existing memory networks. MARNN can indeed retrieves only memory cells at inference. However,  since MARNN uses a Gumbel-Softmax to train the discrete addressing scheme, it is it not clear if there is any advantage in term of memory and computation of MARNN relatively to other network during training? It would be nice to compare the computation time/memory usage of MARNN with other memory augmented network such as TARDIS, NTM or Memory Network during training and inference. \n\nAnother claim is that MARNN can possibly boost training speed by reducing the lengths of TBTT.  But MARNN also haves a training time overhead as showed in Figure 2.  How does the overall training time/performances of MARNN with TBPTT of 50 compared to a LSTM with TBPTT of 100/150?\n\nThe writing can be sometime a bit imprecise. For instance authors say that MARNN \u201clearns better representations that many hierarchical RNN structure\u201d. I agree that MARNN outperforms in term of accuracy, however, it is not clear what the author are referring to by \u201cbetter representation\u201d of the MARNN hidden state? Performance gain of MARNN could also be due to the external memory which allows  to retain more information of the input? In addition, it would be nice to precise which type of hierarchical RNN structure MARNN does (or doesn\u2019t) outperform. Another claim is that MARNN can \u201ceasily learn long-term dependencies\u201d. While this is reasonable, I am unsure that the empirical evaluation support this.  It would be nice to show how the gradients backpropagated through time behave in practice to support this claim? \n\n\nMemory-augmented network are a very important research directions and the MARNN architecture is interesting. However, it is not entirely clear to me what is the main advantage of MARNN relatively to other memory networks network such as TARDIS, NTM or Memory Network for training and/or inference. Although authors do compare with TARDIS, further comparison with the other networks and in term of computation time and memory could help clarify those points. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper171/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SEQUENCE MODELLING WITH AUTO-ADDRESSING AND RECURRENT MEMORY INTEGRATING NETWORKS", "abstract": "Processing sequential data with long term dependencies and learn complex transitions are two major challenges in many deep learning applications.
