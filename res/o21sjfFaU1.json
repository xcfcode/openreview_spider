The derived bound was shown to tighten the standard error bound in domain-adaptation.", "review": "\nQuality: \nPros:\n- The role of spuriously correlated features in causing poor generalization in the target domain is well described.\n\nCons:\n- The derived bound consider unrealistically simple setup and makes strong assumptions that makes the derived bound practically useless.\n- Even if all the assumptions are right the suggested solutions for training a \"robust\" model is very ad-hoc and unlikely to be robust.\n\nClarity:\nThe paper is poorly written and most parts of the paper are difficult to follow.\n\nOriginality/Significance:\nAlthough deriving a generalization bound  as a function of spurious features is original, due to strong assumptions, the derived bound is unlikely to have much practical value and  make a significant impact in the field.\n\n\nDetailed Comments:\nThis work approaches cross-domain generalization from a relatively easier and somewhat unrealistic direction and does not consider the more challenging setup of emerging classes/subclasses in the target domain nor it discusses the effect of class imbalance on generalization. \n\nIt was not clear how invariance to spurious function can be imposed in ERM when the spurious function is not known during training.\n\nA3 is a very strong assumption. Two labeling functions both predicting same labels on the training set yet not sharing even a single feature is not a very practical assumption.\n\nSection 3.2 is hastily written and does not read well.\n\nIt is not clear what was so interesting about this finding \"This argument may also align with recent discussions suggesting that reducing the model complexity can improve cross-domain generalization (Chuang et al., 2020).\" \nIn the context of structural/empirical risk minimization Vapnik has demonstrated (more than 40 years ago) that model complexity can be reduced by reducing VC dimension, which in turn will tighten the VC bound and improve generalizability on test data. This  result is distribution independent and thus would hold nicely for cross-domain generalization setting  considered in this paper as well (no emerging classes in the test data). \n\nIt is not immediately clear what the benefit of the added c(\\theta) term would be. Comparing equation (6) with (2) we now have the test error upper bounded by a term that is larger by c(\\theta), which makes the bound loose compared to equation (2). This is a standard problem for domain-adaptation. So, I don't consider this as a flaw but some insight would have been useful. \n\nA5 (Sufficient of training samples) is also a very strong assumption that can not be easily justified in real-world domain adaptation problems.  Although theorem 3.2 shows that the extra term c(\\theta) is less than or equal to the empirical term in the standard domain adaption error bound, the difference may not be practically significant.\n\nIt is not clear under what conditions r(\\theta;A(fp; x))=1 suggest an adversarial sample. Possibly only when an adversarial feature is generated by perturbing spurious features that don't overlap with nonspurious features? However, an adversarial sample can also be generated by perturbing only a small fraction of non-spurious features. \n\n\"In short, in practice, while we do not know fp, we usually know A(fp; x) through intuition or common sense, such as texture or background of images. Thus, the estimation is to test the whether the model switches its correct prediction when these features are perturbed over the possible space.\"\nFor modern machine learning problems that use semantically rich and high-dimensional features (i.e., ResNet) such a task can quickly become impractical. One cannot easily and uniquely identify the subset of features to perturb as there will be an impractically large number of combinations to try.\n\nIn section 4.2 the solution that was suggested involves learning only with the top \\rho fraction of features ranked according to the gradient. This is somewhat counter-intuitive as this approach will inevitably create sudden spikes in the gradient between different epochs which is expected to make the gradient less useful for feature selection. The loss function being minimized is not the same between different epochs.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1463/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1463/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Robust Models by Countering Spurious Correlations", "authorids": ["~Haohan_Wang1", "~Zeyi_Huang3", "~Eric_Xing1"], "authors": ["Haohan Wang", "Zeyi Huang", "Eric Xing"], "keywords": ["robustness", "domain adaptation", "spurious correlation", "dataset bias"], "abstract": "Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable prediction accuracy over i.i.d data, but the accuracy often drops when tested with data from another distribution.

They formalize a generalization error bound for this setup and provide two solutions, one principled solution with the knowledge of spurious correlated features and one minimal supervision (MS) method without knowing this information, based on their bound. They also have some experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of their proposed MS method.\n\nPros:\n\n-The problem of spurious correlations widely exists in real-world machine learning tasks. This paper starts from analyzing the generalization with spurious correlation, comparing with existing results in domain adaptation, and then links to several existing solutions and provides their solution without requiring the spurious features knowledge.\n\nCons:\n\n-The paper seems to interchangeably use spurious correlation, confounding factors and dataset bias. But my feeling is that they have different definitions in specific problem settings. \n\nIn this paper, spurious correlation means there exists another labeling function other than the true mapping function that can achieve zero training error, but cannot generalize well on test data. But the dataset bias may generally mean that the training data (joint) distribution differs from the test data (joint) distribution. So in the latter case, the differences can only lie in labels, for example, noisy training labels. Those differences should be carefully discussed.\n\n-Another concern is that it is hard to verify the correctness of the selected active set defined in Eq 3. In the paper, it is said that those features are usually selected by intuition or common sense. It is still unclear to me how to select them in practice, and how this affects the performance.\n\n-There are some typos in Section 4.2 regarding f_d and f_p, for example, in the first sentence, f_b should be f_p. In my understanding, the proposed method in Eq 16 uses both f_d and f_p associated features, how to guarantee that the model does not learn spurious correlated features only, in the extreme case?\n\nOverall take\n\n-The paper studies an interesting problem and provides some useful analysis, but some unclear parts need to be clarified.

The paper's goal is to show that if we can make assumptions on the knowledge of the spurious features that may exist in the dataset, we can better analyze the error on potential test sets. \n\nStrengths:  \n1. The paper provides a good overview of different approaches within the areas of robustness and the \"spurious features\" phenomena, and the framing makes intuitive sense (albeit restrictive -- the belief that there always exists one labeling function for the source/target domain rules out situations where there is a temporal shift, or there are unobserved variables, yet we would still want a robust model)\n\n2. The experimental results on MS seem promising, given that the method does not use knowledge of the spurious features, although somewhat limiting in terms of the range of experiments/datasets. \n\n\nWeaknesses: \nIn general, I unfortunately found the paper very difficult to follow, with Sections 3 and 4 taking so much space that the experiments in Section 5 were very hastily described. One suggestion I would have would be to ground the analysis in an example -- perhaps that in Figure 1 -- to make it easier to discuss the different variables in the analysis without becoming too abstract and confusing.\n\n1. I found the notation in particular quite difficult to follow through, with many terms introduced and explained in a rather rushed way. Particularly, I think section A2 could be  improved, including a more detailed description of d_x(\\theta, f) and providing more intuition for r(\\theta, A(f,x)). It would also help to break down some of the definitions, such as c(\\theta) in (10)  into English descriptions first to help follow the different components.    \n\n2. There is little justification / explanation for why theta^(t-1) can be considered a good substitute f_d/ f_p?  \n\n3. I found the description of the experiments very limited. For example in the synthetic data experiment, what does it mean that \"f_p is simpler\"? What do the \"multiple choices\" refer to?\n\n4. At times, the authors mix up terms such as confounding factors, spurious correlations, spurious features, dataset bias, etc. but there are subtle differences in how the different works the authors cite define these terms. For example, dataset bias can be due to a lot more factors than spurious features learned by the model, while confounding factors can describe variables not included in the data at all, potentially making learning the right model from the data impossible. I think the authors should characterize the types of features they consider a lot more rigorously.  \n\nRecommendation:  \nI recommend rejection. While the ideas and intuition are definitely promising directions, I believe the paper in its current state needs significant improvement with respect to clarity.\n\nFurther Comments \n- For Figure 2, it might be better to plot 1.0-Error to make it easier to visualize all bars. \n- I was a bit confused by the difference between the P_s/P_t and (X,Y)P_s / (X,Y)P_t notations.  \n \nTypos:  \npg. 1\n\"we require the distributions of study similar but different\" --> \"to be similar but different\"  \n\"this scenario surly exists in real world tasks\" --> surely, it would also be good to describe such examples in the text (and why this is a reasonable assumption to make).    \n\"because human will nonetheless be able to agree\" --> humans \npg. 3 \n\"basic assumptions needed to derived (2)\" --> derive \npg. 6\n\"Thus, the estimation is to test the whether the model\" --> test whether\npg. 7\n\"we then test how the new method we introduced in comparison to previously developed methods\" --> how the new method we introduced performs in comparison to    \n\"We also Figure 1 to data with p features\" --> unclear ", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1463/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1463/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Robust Models by Countering Spurious Correlations", "authorids": ["~Haohan_Wang1", "~Zeyi_Huang3", "~Eric_Xing1"], "authors": ["Haohan Wang", "Zeyi Huang", "Eric Xing"], "keywords": ["robustness", "domain adaptation", "spurious correlation", "dataset bias"], "abstract": "Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable prediction accuracy over i.i.d data, but the accuracy often drops when tested with data from another distribution.
