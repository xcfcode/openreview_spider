Also the case with binary activations is considered. The authors consider two SOTA generative models (flow++ and RVAE) and develop technique to binarize all weights (and possibly activcations) in residual layers. They show that residual layers can be binarized with relatively small drop in performance and further binarization of remaining blocks in computational graph leads to significant degradation. Binary modification of weight normalization is suggested although no ablation is study is performed so it is unclear how crucial is BWN for robust learning. The training process itself is pretty standard way of training binary DNNs - they use STE + truncation of real-valued weights counter-parts.\n\nI have several questions on the proposed methodology:\n1. To compute density in flow++ model you need to be able to differentiate Jacobians. How would you compute them given the inputs are binary? Have you used STE for this purpose? If so then how can we be sure that what we get is correct (normalized) density function? I think this issue should be addressed in the paper since nomalizing flows by design assume continuous variables.\n2. Please define what is $n$ in you paper. Is it the total number of all weights in you network/layer or is it a number of weights in single convolution filter?\n3. You provide performance of binarized generative models and show that they require a lot less memory than their real-valued analogues. It would great to see what performance can be achieved by smaller real-valued generative model that requires approximately same amount of of memory as binarized network. Then we could understand what is better - to use large binary networks or small real-valued ones for generative modeling.\n4. My major concern is the visual quality of the images obtained by binary models. To be honest after I saw them I decided to downgrade my mark from 6 to 5. It seems that with such quality the model is quite useless. Do I understand right that there is a clear visual difference between objects generated by real-valued and binarized networks of similar size?

The difference is of course reflected in the slightly lower likelihoods achieved by the binary models, which can be seen in our quantitative results. We think the difference observable in the samples is in line with what we would expect from the difference in likelihoods (as it has to be), since in both cases the difference is noticeable but relatively small. There is going to be some degradation in the model performance when binarizing the weights, so the key problem is how to minimize it, which we attempt to do with our method.\n\nThis leads on to another important point. The class of methods we have examined are generative models with explicit densities, as opposed to implicit models such as GANs. As such, sample quality is not the primary goal of these methods. The primary goal is density modelling performance, which has a wide range of applications in its own right (e.g. anomaly detection). Of course, sample quality is always a good metric to examine to give a visual feel for a model, but we think that we should not place too much weight on the sample quality results, since they do not solely determine the usefulness of the model."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1523/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1523/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Reducing the Computational Cost of Deep Generative Models with Binary Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~Thomas_Bird1", "fhkingma@gmail.com", "~David_Barber1"], "authors": ["Thomas Bird", "Friso Kingma", "David Barber"], "keywords": ["binary", "generative", "optimization", "compression"], "abstract": "Deep generative models provide a powerful set of tools to understand real-world data.

Find our responses below:\n\n*Binary modification of weight normalization is suggested although no ablation is study is performed so it is unclear how crucial is BWN for robust learning*\n\nThis point was also raised by other reviewers, so we have performed an ablation and added the results to our paper in appendix B. To summarise our findings - we find it impossible to train the generative models without any normalization, due to unstable training. This is not too surprising, since binary weights are large in magnitude. When comparing binary weight normalization (BWN) to batch normalization (BN), we find that BN is also much more unstable during training, but can train. We find that BWN achieves better loss values than BN, probably due to BN\u2019s unstable training. Given also that the BWN layers are faster and simpler to compute, we think these ablations validate our hypothesis that BWN is a practical normalization procedure for binary-weighted generative models.\n\n*To compute density in flow++ model you need to be able to differentiate Jacobians. How would you compute them given the inputs are binary?*\n\nThis is an interesting question - you are correct that to train the Flow++ model we need to be able to evaluate and differentiate the log determinants of the Jacobian of each respective coupling layer. We recommend referring to section 3.2 of the original Flow++ paper to see a complete description of the method. The key point is that the log determinant of the Jacobian is the log density of the logistic mixture distribution which we parameterize at each coupling layer, so we just have to ensure that we produce a valid log density that we can differentiate through. We are guaranteed to get a normalized log-density simply by virtue of how we parameterize the logistic mixture distribution (similar to how any mean and log-variance always describe a normalized Gaussian distribution). As such, there is no problem in using the binary weights in these flow coupling layers, since we ensure differentiability by the use of the STE.  We have added a small point to clarify this at the beginning of section 4.\n\n*Please define what is n in you paper. Is it the total number of all weights in you network/layer or is it a number of weights in single convolution filter?*\n\nThe n you see in section 3.1 is the dimension of the binary weight vector, and we do say this just before equation 12. As per other normalization schemes, we apply this per output channel. So for example for a binary weighted convolution layer, n = input_channels * kernel_width * kernel height. Or for a linear layer n = input_channels.\n\n*It would great to see what performance can be achieved by smaller real-valued generative model that requires approximately same amount of of memory as binarized network*\n\nWe agree that this would be something interesting to see. We have given some results in this direction with our exploration in section 5.2 of how binary models perform with a larger architecture than a corresponding real-valued model. We show that increasing the width of the residual channels in the binary model does indeed improve performance.\n\nIn terms of shrinking the real-valued model to give it the same size as the binary model. We have a result which is close to this - our baseline method with no residual layers (table 1). This only has real-valued weights, and is similar in size to the model with binary residual layers, since the binary layers are so space efficient. It would be quite hard to make a real-valued model with a similar size as the binary model using the same architecture, since you would need to use very small filter sizes on the residual layers, or reduce the number of layers substantially. It would probably result in quite a poor model.\n\n(we continue the response in another comment, due to reaching the character limit)\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1523/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1523/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Reducing the Computational Cost of Deep Generative Models with Binary Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~Thomas_Bird1", "fhkingma@gmail.com", "~David_Barber1"], "authors": ["Thomas Bird", "Friso Kingma", "David Barber"], "keywords": ["binary", "generative", "optimization", "compression"], "abstract": "Deep generative models provide a powerful set of tools to understand real-world data.

However, the same thing can be said for regular weight normalization, and indeed batch normalization. We believe that referring to it as an affine transformation would simply cause confusion, since it breaks the link to existing weight normalization schemes (which our method is clearly a derivative of).\n\n*An experiment ablating an architecture with/without the proposed binary weight normalization is missing*\n\nWe agree that this is a valuable experiment, and have added an ablation in appendix B comparing binary weight normalization to batch normalization in the paper. The ablation shows that binary weight normalization achieves better results while also having faster execution and a simpler form. Note also, that the model is too unstable to train without any form of normalization. This is because using binary weights (in particular with binary activations) can result in very large pre-activations, as binary weights are large in magnitude to trained floating-point precision weights.\n\n*the paper would benefit from including several samples from binarized models*\n\nWe do include samples from the binary models, as well as from the models with floating-point precision weights for comparison.

Find our responses below:\n\n*Overall, motivation for binarizing generative models is unclear. To the best of my knowledge, training such generative models is an active research topic, and, unlike in image classifiers, object detectors, language and translation models, are not applied in practice in real systems where execution time and memory footprint matters*\n\nWe believe there is very clear motivation for binarizing generative models - there are many applications of unsupervised learning which are already in use. For example:\n* text generation models such as GPT-3, this has seen a large amount of interest recently given the breadth of the applications possible with a good text model.\n* image generation and related tasks such as inpainting, super-resolution and enhancement. Given the amount of visual data being created, these are inherently useful if they can become practical.\n* anomaly detection, where density models are used to detect low-probability points. This is highly relevant for applications of fraud detection in high data environments.\n* representation learning and inference about the structure of data.\n* compression, both lossless and lossy. Lossless compression can be performed directly by the generative models we use in this paper, along with an appropriate entropy coder. Lossy compression uses similar techniques (usually with an entropy penalisation on a bottleneck layer). This is an important application, given the explosion in the amount of data being transmitted over the internet, and the promising early results of neural compression.\n\n\n All of these examples are already used by industry, and as such would stand to benefit from decreased memory usage and faster inference times. Especially for compression software, in which the execution time and size of the program is almost as important as it\u2019s compression capabilities.\nGiven the power of unsupervised learning, it seems that the usages will also only increase as techniques improve. As such, understanding how to improve the efficiency of these (often quite large) models is key to enabling their widespread deployment.\n\n*training such models is already difficult and optimization is often unstable, so adding an extra variable might make it even more difficult*\n\nAlthough the Flow++ and ResNet VAE models are stable during training, we do accept your point - binarizing the weights does add noise to the training process. We believe that this is one reason that research into increasing the efficiency of generative models has not already been done - since it is simply harder than doing the equivalent to supervised models. We see this as a reason why our research is valuable, since we have demonstrated that with a certain set of techniques, stable training can be achieved for binarized versions state-of-the-art, complex models.\n\n*to keep baselines simple*\n\nBaselines are not generally optimized heavily for memory and time efficiency, given that they are not designed to be deployed in the wild, but instead used for research purposes. The same point could be made for supervised learning, where there is much research into the efficiency of those models that are candidates for real-world applications.\n\n*final execution time does not matter*\n\nAs per our above list, there are plenty of existing use cases, and also many more uses to come in the future. Therefore, execution time does matter for all users of these models, which can range from consumers on smartphones to large corporations.\n\n*It is also very likely that, in case such generative models find applied use-cases where execution time and memory footprint would matter, they would have undergone several research iterations and updates such that new binarization techniques would need to be developed*\n\nWe don\u2019t believe this is necessarily true - most use cases of generative models and unsupervised learning will be off-the-shelf models. This is certainly the case in supervised learning, where popular architectures such as ResNet backbones and the YOLO architectures are used extensively. The same thing seems to be true in unsupervised learning - popular VAE, GAN and transformer architectures are used in a similar format across a variety of applications. \n\nAlso, even if the architectures are iterated upon for a particular application, which is definitely possible, then our binarization techniques can still be used as long as the resulting model has residual layers, and maybe even without (using binary weight normalization). Therefore we think our contribution is still valuable, even if it is true that most applications of generative models required tweaking.\n\n(We continue our response in another comment, since we have reached the character limit)\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1523/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1523/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Reducing the Computational Cost of Deep Generative Models with Binary Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~Thomas_Bird1", "fhkingma@gmail.com", "~David_Barber1"], "authors": ["Thomas Bird", "Friso Kingma", "David Barber"], "keywords": ["binary", "generative", "optimization", "compression"], "abstract": "Deep generative models provide a powerful set of tools to understand real-world data.

We provide our responses below:\n\n\n*There is some discussion of residual layers as being the least susceptible to performance degradation, but it would be a stronger paper if some of this was explored a bit more through experimentation. Again, extracting a principle here would be useful to the field.*\n\n\nWe appreciate your point regarding the possibility of extracting a general principle for the binarization procedure of generative models. Ultimately, we believe that binarizing the residual layers is a principle that can be applied to these models. We do agree that this principle is not completely general, since not all models contain residual layers, and the extent to which they are deployed within models does vary. However, we still think our principle is useful for practitioners, given that the majority of modern generative models do use residual layers. We also believe that we have provided sufficient evidence that the residual layers are sensible to binarize, given the ablation we perform demonstrating that if the full model is binarized then the performance is significantly worse than if only the residual layers are binarized. We do also motivate the choice to binarize the residual layers, given that are naturally designed to avoid degradation, a primary concern when binarizing weights.\n\n*I think this might be the most interesting direction highlighted by this paper; how does precision/binarization interplay with hyperparameters to reduce the absolute computing requirements, which increasing algorithmic performance?*\n\nWe agree - indeed we believe that the best possible performance obtained for a fixed inference computation budget will be to use low-precision weights (e.g binary) for most of the network, with higher precision weights at bottlenecks. However, the key problem (which we discuss in our paper), is that the current training methods for low-precision weights generally still utilize floating point precision weights during training. Therefore training itself can be a memory bottleneck.\n\n*Section 5.3 Ablations, where is figure 3?*\n\nFigure 3 is in appendix A.

As Weight Normalization is commonly used in these models, the authors notice that Euclidean norm of binary [-1;1] vector is a square root of it\u2019s length, such that Weight Normalization can be reduced to affine scaling. They propose to call this scaling Binary Weight Normalization, and evaluate it on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets.\n\nOverall, motivation for binarizing generative models is unclear. To the best of my knowledge, training such generative models is an active research topic, and, unlike in image classifiers, object detectors, language and translation models, are not applied in practice in real systems where execution time and memory footprint matters. Researchers who train such generative would not apply binarization as:\n- training such models is already difficult and optimization is often unstable, so adding an extra variable might make it even more difficult;\n- to keep baselines simple;\n- final execution time does not matter.\nIt is also very likely that, in case such generative models find applied use-cases where execution time and memory footprint would matter, they would have undergone several research iterations and updates such that new binarization techniques would need to be developed.\n\nAs affine scaling is no longer a weight normalization, it is probably incorrect to call it that. An experiment ablating an architecture with/without the proposed binary weight normalization is missing. Also, as generative models are often evaluated qualitatively, the paper would benefit from including several samples from binarized models, to show that quality does not degrade.\n\nLiterature review also lacks several more recent binarization techniques such as [1] and [2] (more can be found there). It is not clear if one were to pick a simple (or more recent) binarization technique they would encounter difficulties.\n\nOverall, due to unclear motivation, introduction of binary weight normalization which is not weight normalization, and incomplete literature review I propose rejection.\n\n[1] Mark D.

This is an important issue as these methods are valuable to solving unsupervised problems, but are rapidly growing in size, necessitating large and expensive computing systems. And, the literature of low and binary precision hasn\u2019t considered these use-cases to date.\nThe choice of ResNet VAE and Flow++ are good representative candidates for methods in use widely today.  However, the largest models we see in the world today are knowledge representation and language models (transformers)). Showing that binarization will work for these models would be a valuable next step.\n\nThe authors call this a \u201cframework\u201d to go to binary weights and/or activations, but this is really a set of methods shown to work on a particular NN.

A major contribution of the paper is Binary Weight Normalization (BWN) and the binarizing method for residual layers.  There is something deeper there.\n\nI like this work as it is an increasingly important consideration to data science teams in building solutions that can work within real-world constraints.  However, binarization is still seen as a method to try and reduce the computational load of something that is already being done.

We train binary models that achieve loss values close to those of the regular models but are 90%-94% smaller in size, and also allow significant speed-ups in execution time.", "one-sentence_summary": "We demonstrate that deep generative models can be effectively trained using binary weights and/or activations", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "bird|reducing_the_computational_cost_of_deep_generative_models_with_binary_neural_networks", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/f99c5ad9af2c6681705bdc45fdbe8ac3bb619db6.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/4bc920fb592820a6d9fba3d58e93f6561f456f66.pdf", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Poster", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nbird2021reducing,\ntitle={Reducing the Computational Cost of Deep Generative Models with Binary Neural Networks},\nauthor={Thomas Bird and Friso Kingma and David Barber},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=sTeoJiB4uR}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
