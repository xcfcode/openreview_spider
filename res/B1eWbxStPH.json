To make the setup more consistent we changed this training detail, which made a surprisingly large difference. We achieved further small improvements by jointly representing interatomic distances and angles in a 2D basis and by increasing the number of interaction blocks from 4 to 6. We\u2019ve updated the description in the paper accordingly (see Sec. 5). We now set the state of the art on 11 out of 12 targets.\n\nDirectionality has not been explored in GNNs: Our proposed directional message embeddings are indeed related to edge embeddings, as we point out in the related work section. However, normal edge embeddings do not incorporate any directional information. By using directional information we essentially go beyond the graph representation and leverage the fact that molecules are in fact embedded in 3D space. Also, note that our model outcompetes a state-of-the-art GNN with edge embeddings (MEGNet, published in April 2019) on average by 71%, while relying solely on message embeddings. MEGNet on the other hand uses a combination of node, edge and graph embeddings.\n\nImplicit angles: Since SchNet only uses the distances between atoms it can not model angles (even implicitly) when it only passes messages between one-hop neighbors (see e.g. limitations of the Weisfeiler-Lehman test and our discussion in Section 4 and Appendix A).

Two key extensions are provided above and beyond previous GNN models that operated on graphs derived from pairwise distances between atoms. First, the encoding of atom distances for use in neural messages is no longer done in terms of Gaussian radial basis function representations but in terms of spherical Bessel functions. The provide an orthogonal decomposition at resolutions controlled by associated frequencies. The orthogonality is though lost due to the use of an envelop function to ensure differentiability at cutoff distance defining the graph (essential for molecular simulations) but this appears not to affect performance. The second and the primary contribution of the paper, beyond the architecture itself, is the use of directional embeddings of messages where angles are transformed into cosine basis for neural mappings. In other words, the message sent from atom i to j aggregates messages from i's other neighbors in a manner that takes into account the angle formed by i, j, and k's respective atom positions. Since local directions are equivariant with an overall molecular rotation, the message passing architecture in this new representation remains invariant to rotations/translations. The added directional information, embedded in local basis representation, clearly makes the network more powerful (able to distinguish higher order structures). \n\n- the authors suggest that the radial information can be transformed simply by element-wise multiplication while angular information requires more complex transformations in message calculations. Is there a physical insight to this or is this simply an empirical finding?\n\n- there are many layers of transformations introduced from the atom embeddings before reaching the property of interest. Are so many layers really necessary? \n\n- it seems models for QM9 data were trained separately for each different physical target. Is this really necessary? Given the many layers of transformations until the properties are predicted, couldn't the message passing component be largely shared? \n\n- what exactly is the training data for the molecular simulation tests? The description in the paper is insufficient. A separate model is trained for each molecule, presumably based on samples resulting from physical simulations (?). What is provided to the models based on each \"sample\"?\n\n- the ablation studies are helpful to assess the impact of the main differences (directionality, bessel vs Gaussian, node embeddings vs message) though I would wish to see what the degradation effect is on QM9 if one used a shared message passing architecture (just sharing the messages, resulting embeddings could be transformed separately for different predictions). \n\nThere's a recent workshop paper also making use of directional information (local coordinate transformations along a protein backbone chain) in message passing/transformer architectures: Ingraham et al., Generative models for graph-based protein design, ICLR workshop 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2126/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2126/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["klicpera@in.tum.de", "grossja@in.tum.de", "guennemann@in.tum.de"], "title": "Directional Message Passing for Molecular Graphs", "authors": ["Johannes Klicpera", "Janek Gro\u00df", "Stephan G\u00fcnnemann"], "pdf": "/pdf/0255ee67aa275932d71e466955039aabc8460e41.pdf", "TL;DR": "Directional message passing incorporates spatial directional information to improve graph neural networks.", "abstract": "Graph neural networks have recently achieved great successes in predicting quantum mechanical properties of molecules.

The authors proposed a specific type of graph neural network called directional message passing. Experimental results on the QM9 data set prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach over existing sota algorithms such as Schnet for some of the targets. \n\nOverall, the paper studies a very important problem, which aims to learn the representation of molecules. Modeling the angles of atoms is indeed less explored in existing literature. From the view of graph neural networks, the proposed technique is not that new since edge embedding has already been studied in existing literature. But for the technique could be particular useful for molecule representation learning, especially with the BESSEL FUNCTIONS. One question is that the schnet also leverages the coordinates of the atoms, which may also implicitly model the angles between the edges. In terms of the experiments, the proposed approach does not seem that strong, only achieving the best performance on 5 targets out of 12. \n\nOverall, I feel this paper is on the borderline.
