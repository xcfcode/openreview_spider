We chose to keep the same width at each layer, and varied depth and width to find optimal parameters (see details below).\nWe also tried several variants of the architecture and the training regime that did not improve performance or made it worse:\n\n* other types of architectures  (we tested expansion: 128-256-512, 512-1024; reduction: 64-48-32, 1024-512; and both: 128-256-512-256-128-64)\n* sampling new training points every nth epoch (tried every epoch, every 3, 10, 30 epochs) \n* varying learning rate decay (factors 1, 1.01, 1.05 or 1.1)\n* variants of hard negative mining: only using negatives for which there is no positive closer to the query point\n\nNone of these variants improved above the architecture/schedule, which had the advantage of being conceptually simpler.\nThe parameters reported in the paper were the best we found with the amount of training data available at hand and with our standard optimization scheme. To conclude on this point, on one side it is difficult to answer the question \"if/how we can improve it\" for most works in deep learning. What we suggested for the architecture is the best choice we found to date. On the other side, from our experiments, we generally observed that the choice of the discretization layer has more impact on the overall performance of the system than the choice of a particular structure for the catalyzer (compare binary and lattice for instance), therefore there is likely some margin on improvement in this direction. \n\n2) \"The performance improves when augmenting the width of the network, but with diminishing returns.', how was the width of the network(s) used for the empirical evaluation selected.

The best results with respect to depth were obtained with 2 latent layers; doubling the width provided increments of 2 - 5 points until 512, then 512 \u2192 1024 resulted in a 0.5 improvement and 1024\u2192 2048 resulted in a negligible improvement while having a longer runtime.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1282/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1282/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1282/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Spreading vectors for similarity search", "abstract": "Discretizing floating-point vectors is a fundamental step of modern indexing methods.

[...] It is not consist to the LSQ paper\"\nIn our experiments, we used the reference public implementation from the authors of LSQ [1]. The discrepancy in the reported 64-bit recall1@1 comes from the fact that the datasets are different: we use Bigann1m (28.4 recall) whereas the LSQ paper reports results on Sift1m. We conducted experiments on Bigann1m because the training set associated with Sift1m is too small (100k vectors) for learning the catalyzer. As a sanity check, we re-ran the code of [1] on Sift1m and obtained 28.99, which is consistent with the results reported by [A] (Table 1, LSQ, 29.37) and [Martinez et al, 2018] (Figure 3, LSQ SR-C and SR-D, ~28; Table 4 corresponds to another experimental setting).\n\n\u201c(2) Figure 5: similarly, how did you get the results of PQ and OPQ?\u201d\nWe used the open-source Faiss library [2] to obtain the results of PQ and OPQ. This library is used as a reference implementation in recent papers like [D, E]. There is a comparison point with [F] on Deep1M at 64 bit: the Faiss implementation of OPQ obtains recall@1 = 15.6 vs 16.1 in [F] (table 1). \n\n\u201c(3) There are some other advanced algorithms: e.g., additive quantization [B] and composite quantization [C]\u201d\nWe did not compare directly to AQ and CQ as it was shown that they underperform LSQ by some margin (Table 1 in [A]). Besides, in general, we insist in the paper that the encoding time for additive quantization methods is at least an order of magnitude slower than product quantization and our catalyzer + lattice (122s for LSQ vs < 10s for PQ/Lattice, cf.

Upon publication of the paper, we will open-source the code that replicates the experiments. In the meantime, we provide more details below:\n\n1) \u201cin the related work overview it would be good to also check possible connections with optimal transport methods using entropy regularization.\u201c \nIn the related work, we mention Bojanowski & Joulin (2017), who use optimal transport (without entropy regularization) to match images with random points on the sphere. The entropy regularization in optimal transport is a bit different than our entropy regularization as it is used mainly for speed purposes, whereas our entropy regularization provides a trade-off between the quality of nearest neighbors and how spread-out the output of the neural network is.\n\n2) \u201cat some points in the paper, e.g. section 3.3, the authors mention Voronoi cells. However, in the related work in section 2 vector quantization and self-organizing maps have not been mentioned.\u201d\nWe will update the related work with these references. In the context of section 3.3, Voronoi cells correspond to the quantization cells of the lattice.\n\n3) \u201cmore details on the optimization or learning algorithms for eq (3)(4) should be given. The loss function is non-smooth and rather complicated. What are the implications on the learning algorithm when training neural networks? Is it important to have a good initialization or not?\u201d\nWe found that standard practice for training neural networks worked quite well in our setting (even though we have no guarantee of getting to the global minimum of the objective function). More specifically, we train our networks with Stochastic Gradient descent with an initial learning rate of 0.5, momentum of 0.9, and decay the learning rate when the validation accuracy does not go up for an epoch. We did not need specific initialization to make the networks converge.\n\n4) \u201cHow reproducible are the results? In Table 1 only one number in each column is shown while eqs (3)(4) are non-convex problems. Is it the best result of several runs or an average that is reported in the Table? \u201c\nOur preliminary experiments have shown that the difference in performance between different trainings is very small (despite the problems being non-convex).  Therefore we train only once per set of hyper-parameters (d_out and lambda), and report the corresponding result. Our open-source code will reproduce these results up to the (very small) variations due to random initialization and mini-batch sampling.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1282/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1282/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1282/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Spreading vectors for similarity search", "abstract": "Discretizing floating-point vectors is a fundamental step of modern indexing methods.

Further more, we show that training without the quantization step results in almost no difference in accuracy, but yields a generic catalyser that can be applied with any subsequent quantization technique.\n", "keywords": ["dimensionality reduction", "similarity search", "indexing", "differential entropy"], "authorids": ["asablayrolles@fb.com", "matthijs@fb.com", "cordelia.schmid@inria.fr", "rvj@fb.com"], "authors": ["Alexandre Sablayrolles", "Matthijs Douze", "Cordelia Schmid", "Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou"], "TL;DR": "We learn a neural network that uniformizes the input distribution, which leads to competitive indexing performance in high-dimensional space", "pdf": "/pdf/a2cc89567545366738570fb6036d4fbb59ff3ab2.pdf", "paperhash": "sablayrolles|spreading_vectors_for_similarity_search", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nsablayrolles2018spreading,\ntitle={Spreading vectors for similarity search},\nauthor={Alexandre Sablayrolles and Matthijs Douze and Cordelia Schmid and Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkGuG2R5tm},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1282/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234264313, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "SkGuG2R5tm", "replyto": "SkGuG2R5tm", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1282/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335912542, "tmdate": 1552335912542, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1282/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 13}
