Graph homomorphism densities are permutation-invariant features that can be directly computed from graph data, and their approximation scales naturally to large graphs. We propose the use of efficient data structures for approximate set membership in the context of a sampling algorithm for graph homomorphism density which enables the use of large-scale datasets containing larger graphs. To validate our findings, we compare this method with existing approaches used for graph homomorphism features in synthetic experiments.", "pdf": "/pdf/7cf9ea277e3721270619c5037237a80082545706.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|scaling_up_graph_homomorphism_features_with_efficient_data_structures", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021scaling,\ntitle={Scaling Up Graph Homomorphism Features with Efficient Data Structures},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to ICLR 2021 Workshop on Geometrical and Topological Representation Learning},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=EwT8NpZIth8},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615225929161, "tmdate": 1615967298665, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
