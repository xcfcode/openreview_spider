What we can say, however, is that the Hessian of the loss function is degenerate at the point where training begins and ends. This is indeed the body of our work. Moreover, we can presume the statement will be valid for the intermediate points over the course of the training, as well. We clarified this further in the text.\n\n1) The actual one that is computed through the Hessian vector product using Lop: Barak A. Pearlmutter, \u201cFast Exact Multiplication by the Hessian\u201d, Neural Computation, 1994, -we added the reference in the text. (Also the approximate Hessian gives similar results.)\n\n2) We use gradient descent (the batch method, when the minibatch size is equal to the number of examples in the dataset) in our main expeirments. We revised the text to clarify this. The only exception is the line interpolation that is presented in the conclusion which compares GD and SGD. However, we would like to note that the network is *not* trained to its local minimum. We train the network for a long time even after the training cost is stabilized. Yet, the norm of the gradient is typically at the order of 10^{-3}. It is pretty laborious to get a network that uses a log-loss to a level where the norm of the gradient is at the order of say 10^{-10} or lower. The basin that the point is in at the stopping time is, for all practical purposes, a local minimum (see ICLR 2015 Workshop, Explorations on high dimensional landscapes, Sagun et al.).\n\n3) Thank you for the suggestion! Preliminary results with the mean square error also gives singular Hessian, pretty much in line with the observations laid out in our work. We added this new experiment in our work, as well.\n\n4) The short answer is (b). We included this in the previous bullet point, and we attempted to clarify it further. This point is actually one of the practical challenges in modern day deep learning. Pretty much none of the current models *converge* in the sense that they find a local minimum, the models stop way before it finds one, and for all practical purposes the point that did *not* converge doesn't perform any worse when one keeps training the model until it finds a point where the norm of the gradient is zero within the numerical accuracy. As references in the paper, there are reasons for GD to converge to a point where its Hessian has only non-negative eigenvalues. From a practical point of view, reaching stability in this dynamics would take a long time. In our work, we focus on the points we can find in practice, the ones whose grad_norm is relatively small, so that the gradient doesn't give any substantial signal for the gradient based model to move in the weight space. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Eigenvalues of the Hessian in Deep Learning: Singularity and Beyond", "abstract": "We look at the eigenvalues of the Hessian of a loss function before and after training.

It seems likely that the behavior for much larger networks would be different. A reason for optimism, though, is the fact that a clear bulk/outlier behavior emerges even in these networks. Characterizing this behavior for simple systems is valuable.

But what does this statement refer to? To my understanding, there are at least three interpretations:\n\n(i) The Hessian of the loss functions in deep learning is degenerate at any point in the parameter space, i.e., any network weight matrices.\n\n(ii) The Hessian of the loss functions in deep learning is degenerate at any critical point.\n\n(iii) The Hessian of the loss functions in deep learning is degenerate at any local minimum, or any global minimum.\n\nNone of these interpretations is solidly supported by the observations provided in the paper.\n\nMore comments are as follows:\n\n1) The authors state that \u201cwe don\u2019t have much information on what the actual Hessian looks like.\u201d Then I just wonder what Hessian is investigated. Is it the actual one or approximate one? Please clarify and provide the references for computing the actual Hessian.\n\n2) It is not clear whether the optimization was done by a batch gradient descent algorithm, i.e., batch back propagation (BP) algorithm, or a stochastic BP algorithm. If the training was done via a stochastic BP algorithm, it is hard to conclude that the the Neural Network has been trained to its local minimum. When it was done by a full-batch BP algorithm, what was the accumulating point? Was it local minimum or global minimum?\n\n3) Since the negative log likelihood function was used as at the end of training, it is essentially a joint learning approach in both the Newton weight matrices and the negative log likelihood vector. Certainly, the whole loss function is not convex in these two parameters. But if least squares error function is used at the end, would it make any difference in claiming the degeneracy of the Hessian?\n\n4) Finally, the statement \u201cThere are still negative eigenvalues even when they are small in magnitude\u201d is very puzzling. Potential reasons are:\n(a) If the training algorithm did converge, the accumulating points were not local minima, i.e., they were saddle points.\n(b) Training algorithms did not converge, or have not converged yet.\n(c) The calculation of the actual Hessian might be inaccurate.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Eigenvalues of the Hessian in Deep Learning: Singularity and Beyond", "abstract": "We look at the eigenvalues of the Hessian of a loss function before and after training.

In other words, when we follow a gradient based method to locate a point with the norm of the gradient zero, in an ideal case where all eigenvalues are non-zero, the question would be to look at the Hessian there to describe the nature of the critical point judging by the number of negative eigenvalues it has. It turns out, in the case of neural networks most of them are zero or very small. This leads to a drastically different geometry for the bottom of the landscape. We completely agree that the Hessian throughout the optimization is also important from the point of view of the training, however, we believe that this is a different question than just wondering about the shape of the bottom of the landscape. We will gladly work on this aspect, as well.\n\nIn Figure 7, the norm of the weights of the parameters are, in fact, very similar to each other. We believe that the change in the sizes of eigenvalues should depend on a quantity other than the norm of the weights. However, it's a great idea to perform a controlled experiment in which the norm of the weights for separate layers are monitored to show that this is indeed not caused by the norm of the weights.\n\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Eigenvalues of the Hessian in Deep Learning: Singularity and Beyond", "abstract": "We look at the eigenvalues of the Hessian of a loss function before and after training.

However, the current paper could be significantly improved.\n\nQuality:\nIt seems that the arguments in the paper could be enhanced by more effort and more comprehensive experiments. Performing some of the experiments discussed in the conclusion could certainly help a lot. Some other suggestions:\n1- It would be very helpful to add other plots showing the distribution of eigenvalues for some other machine learning method for the purpose of comparison to deep learning.\n2- There are some issues about the scaling of the weights and it make sense to normalize the weights each time before calculating the Hessian otherwise the result might be misleading.\n3- It might worth trying to find a quantity that measures the singularity of Hessian because it is difficult to visually conclude something from the plots.\n4- Adding some plots for the Hessian during the optimization is definitely needed because we mostly care about the Hessian during the optimization not after the convergence.\n\nClarity:\n1- There is no reference to figures in the main text which makes it confusing for the reading to know the context for each figure. For example, when looking at Figure 1, it is not clear that the Hessian is calculated at the beginning of optimization or after convergence.\n2- The texts in the figures are very small and hard to read.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Eigenvalues of the Hessian in Deep Learning: Singularity and Beyond", "abstract": "We look at the eigenvalues of the Hessian of a loss function before and after training.
