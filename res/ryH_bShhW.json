Also it is not preferred to look at the generated images and claim diversity, instead it's better to have some kind of quantitative metric such as the inception score.\n\nFinally, given the fact that we have too many GAN related papers now, I don't think the innovation contained in the paper (which is using random features) is good enough to be published at ICLR.

We hope our further explanations clear any confusion left in the paper.\n\n     -> This manuscript explores the idea of adding noise to the adversary's play in GAN dynamics over an RKHS. This is \n     equivalent to adding noise to the gradient update, using the duality of reproducing kernels.\n\nThe approach is not equivalent to adding noise to the gradient update. The introduced stochasticity is the result of the stochastic functions as the adversary\u2019s strategies. The introduced approach, however, can be perceived as a mechanism for smoothing the gradients. This is to mitigate the model collapse issue. In order to see how DS-AAE can address the mode collapse issue, please consider a case when there is a \"hole\" in the learned coding space (which would be expected in the course of training - The learned coding space is also visualized in Fig.2a and Fig. 2c after training).  In such cases, the adversary cannot discriminate against the boundaries around the \"hole\" properly.  This is because of the bumpy gradients terms. This leads to mode collapse issue, discussed at the introduction and is indeed the main motivation for proposing DS-AAE. The bumpy gradient terms can be avoided using DS-AAE architecture. This is mathematically explained at the bottom of page 3, right before Theorem 1. \n \n    -> No concrete practical algorithm specification is given (only a couple of ideas to inject noise listed), only a qualitative \n    one on a 2-dimensional latent space in MNIST, and an inconclusive one using the much-doubted Parzen window KDE \n    method.
