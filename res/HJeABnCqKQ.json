It is based on the idea of leveraging previously encountered high-reward trajectories for reward shaping. This shaping is learned automatically using an adversarial setup, similar to GAIL [Ho & Ermon, 2016]. The paper clearly presents the proposed approach and relation to previous work. Empirical evaluation shows strong performance on a 2D point mass problem designed to examine the algorithms behavior. Of particular note are the insightful visualizations in Figure 2 and 3 which shed light on the algorithm's learning behavior. Empirical results on the Mujoco domain show that the proposed approach is particularly strong under delayed-reward (20 steps) and noisy-observation settings.\n\nThe reviewers and AC note the following potential weaknesses: The paper presents an empirical validation showing improvements over PPO, in particular in Mujoco tasks with delayed rewards and with noisy observations. However, given the close relation to SIL, a direct comparison with the latter algorithm seems more appropriate. Reviewers 2 and 3 pointed out that the empirical validation of SIL was more extensive, including results on a wide range of Atari games. The authors provided results on several hard-exploration Atari games in the rebuttal period, but the results of the comparison to SIL were inconclusive. Given that the main contribution of the paper is empirical, the reviewers and the AC consider the contribution incremental.\n\nThe reviewers noted that the proposed method was presented with little theoretical justification, which limits the contribution of the paper. During the rebuttal phase, the authors sketched a theoretical argument in their rebuttal, but noted that they are not able to provide a guarantee that trajectories in the replay buffer constitute an unbiased sample from the optimal policy, and that policy gradient methods in general are not guaranteed to converge to a globally optimal policy. The AC notes that conceptual insights can also be provided by motivating algorithmic or modeling choices, or through detailed analysis of the obtained results with the goal to further understanding of the observed behavior.

Please check the common response as well as our revised paper.\n\n- Regarding buffer size\nThere is a trade-off between the number of samples in the buffer and the quality (i.e., average return) of the trajectories in the buffer, because the data in the buffer is collected by the agent as opposed to experts in standard imitation learning setup. More specifically, as the size of buffer increases, the average return of trajectories in the buffer generally decreases, while the samples become more diverse. So, the agent would not perform well if the buffer size is too small (due to lack of samples) or too large (due to low-quality data). To just clarify, the performance does not always decrease as the buffer size decreases (1000 is better than 500 in Figure 7a) in our experiment.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1589/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1589/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1589/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Adversarial Self-Imitation Learning", "abstract": "This paper explores a simple regularizer for reinforcement learning by proposing Generative Adversarial Self-Imitation Learning (GASIL), which encourages the agent to imitate past good trajectories via generative adversarial imitation learning framework.

We removed the term \u201csparse\u201d to prevent confusion. Our method does not improve the exploratory behavior of the agent. Thus, if the agent fails to reach the sparse goal even once, GASIL would not improve the performance because there is no good trajectory to imitate. For this type of extremely sparse-reward task, advanced exploration methods (e.g., count-based exploration, stein-variational-policy-gradient) would be necessary to discover reward signals, which is not addressed in our paper. However, once the agent reaches the goal, GASIL would exploit such rare experiences and encourage the agent to reproduce the same behavior much more easily compared to baseline algorithms (e.g., PPO).

We have observed that PPO+GASIL significantly improves PPO on 3 out of 6 hard Atari games. This shows that GASIL is a useful RL regularizer that can be applied to a variety of domains with rich observations. On the other hand, we observed that the overall result is not clearly better than A2C+SIL [Oh et al.], though this is not a fair comparison as the actor-critic algorithms are different (PPO, A2c). In fact, GAIL [Ho et al.] has not been shown to be efficient on this type of domain. Thus, we conjecture that GASIL is more beneficial than SIL particularly for continuous control as shown in our MuJoCo experiments.\n\n- Regarding the lack of theoretical result\nOur preliminary investigation shows that GASIL can guarantee policy improvement if 1) the average return of the trajectories in the buffer is higher than that of the agent\u2019s policy, and 2) there exists a valid policy (i.e., occupancy measure) such that the trajectories in the buffer are unbiased samples from it. However, we did not manage to show that there exists a valid policy that can generate any trajectories in the buffer. Thus, we leave this for future work and present GASIL as an empirical study. \n\n- Regarding overfitting to local minima and exploration\nNot only GASIL but also any policy gradient algorithms generally do not guarantee convergence to the global optimal policy and rely on the stochasticity of the policy for exploration (e.g., e-greedy, dithering, entropy regularization). In practice, however, we observed that the buffer in GASIL tends to be constantly updated with better trajectories as the policy improves and uses a form of exploration (e.g., stochasticity encouraged by entropy regularization). Introducing a better form of exploration (e.g., curiosity-based exploration bonus, SVPG [Liu et al.]) would improve the performance of any policy gradient algorithms including ours. Thus, we believe that this is an orthogonal research direction.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1589/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1589/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1589/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Adversarial Self-Imitation Learning", "abstract": "This paper explores a simple regularizer for reinforcement learning by proposing Generative Adversarial Self-Imitation Learning (GASIL), which encourages the agent to imitate past good trajectories via generative adversarial imitation learning framework.

The proposed method in the paper has the same high-level idea as \"Self-imitation learning\" [Oh et.al. ICML 2018] with a different objective. Instead of performing imitation learning to distill the knowledge from past best trajectories, this proposes to use inverse reinforcement learning via GAIL objective [Ho and Ermano, 2016]. The best k trajectories from past experience are stored to train a discriminator which is then used to augment the external reward function with a discriminator reward.\n\n[Paper Strengths]:\nThe paper combines ideas from GAIL and self-imitation learning to propose a method that leverages past best trajectories via inverse-RL. This combination allows one to interpret self-imitation of best trajectories as a mechanism for \"reward shaping\" where learned discriminator shapes the environmental reward using past experiences. This is an exciting perspective and needs further discussion.\n\n[Paper Weaknesses and Clarifications]:\n=> This paper is very closely related to self-imitation learning [Oh et.al.], however, there is no theoretical justification provided (unlike [Oh et. al.]) whether the policy learned by optimizing Equation-11 is in anyway related to the optimal policy -- which was the case as shown in [Oh et.al.]. That being said, this is not a requirement for a paper to show theoretical justification as long as the paper justifies given approach with ample empirical evidence.\n=> The main comparison point for the proposed approach, \"GASIL\", is \"SIL\" [Oh et.al.]. This paper provides a good comparison on continuous control tasks on Mujoco where \"GASIL\" performs slightly better than \"SIL\" in 3 out of 6 environments. However, \"SIL\" [Oh et. al.] showed extensive experiments on all Atari Games + Mujoco tasks. Since the proposed approach is mainly empirically motivated, the experiments should at least show a comparison on all the environments of the closely-related prior work. It would be much more convincing to see a bar chart across all 48 Atari Games showing relative improvement of \"GASIL\" over \"SIL\", as shown in Figure-4 of [Oh et. al.].\n=> Other concerns:\n    - The paper mentions on multiple occasions that the proposed method would handle delayed and \"sparse\" reward. However, it is not clear how can past best trajectories help with \"sparse\" rewards (\"delayed-dense-rewards\" seems alright, but they are not the same as \"sparse\"!). For instance, suppose the agent gets only terminal-reward in a maze. In such a case, the agent would need to rely on some form of exploration bonus (count-based, curiosity etc.) to reach the sparse-goal even once.\n    - What prevents the learned policy from over-fitting to the local minima of the \"locally\" best trajectories seen so far?\n\n[Final Recommendation]:\nI request the authors to address the comments raised above. The paper has good potential, but sufficient empirical evidence is needed to justify the proposed technique. If the results on all Atari games can be included and shown to improve over \"SIL\", I would update my final rating.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1589/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Adversarial Self-Imitation Learning", "abstract": "This paper explores a simple regularizer for reinforcement learning by proposing Generative Adversarial Self-Imitation Learning (GASIL), which encourages the agent to imitate past good trajectories via generative adversarial imitation learning framework.

Thanks!!\n\n- Intuitive algorithm and good experiments with ablation studies on MuJoCo.  \n\n- My main concern is that the paper while offering a good self-imitation algorithm fails to really shine light on when/why this is expected to work. Especially in the following natural areas:\n\na. Why is it that performance decreases as buffer size B increases?\nb. Why doesn't the policy get stuck imitating the first few good trajectories? the conjecture offered is that policy gradient strongly encourages greedy myopic behavior while GASIL does not. Wouldn't one expect GASIL to suffer more?\nc. Does GASIL work better on rich observation spaces (e.g. Atari games) as well?\n\nWithout good answers (theoretical or empirical) to the above questions it is a bit hard to assess how significant of an improvement GASIL actually is and what is the prescription for using this over non-GAIL style self-imitation learning algorithms?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1589/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Adversarial Self-Imitation Learning", "abstract": "This paper explores a simple regularizer for reinforcement learning by proposing Generative Adversarial Self-Imitation Learning (GASIL), which encourages the agent to imitate past good trajectories via generative adversarial imitation learning framework.
