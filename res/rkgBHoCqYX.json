More importantly, we show in this paper how sparse principal components (PCs) can be consistently estimated through element-wise application of a smooth function f to the sample covariance matrix (precisely, we find that the necessary conditions on f are f\u2019(0)=f\u2019\u2019(0)=0, while soft thresholding has all its derivatives null at zero). \n\nWe argue that our method gives equivalent results to the covariance thresholding method (in the sparse PCA context). However, our approach is constructive, in the sense that it establishes the necessary conditions on f to consistently estimate the PCs, unlike the soft thresholding method which was proposed as a heuristic initially by (Krauthgamer et al., 2015). \n\nThe reviewer questioned about the term \u201ckernel\u201d in our paper\u2019s title and we argue that it is questionable. Note that we have used this terminology (namely, the term \u201ckernel random matrix\u201d) to highlight that our work falls within the framework of kernel random matrices (Cheng & Singer, 2013; El Karoui, 2010). Indeed, as mentioned by the reviewer, the resulting matrix after applying a function element-wise to the sample covariance may not result in a positive semi-definite matrix. \n\nConcerning the reviewer\u2019s comment about the case of rank K with K>=1, it should be clarified that this point is not the scope of the paper since we do not focus on the decidability problem that already occurs even if P were perfectly known.\n\nAs discussed above, our approach provides insights about the behavior of element-wise functionals of the sample covariance matrix for a wide class of functionals. Our subsequent step, as mentioned in the conclusion, is precisely to determine optimal choices of f, depending on the underlying scenario. This will be accessible through a study \u201cnear\u201d the phase-transition where sparse PCA becomes a hard task; there, a more thorough comparison of the residual noise (there having a semi-circle spectrum) and the signal information can be performed similar to previous works in related settings (Cheng & Singer, 2013; Couillet & Benaych, 2016). Yet this analysis demands quite elaborate tools, currently under investigation, which the present \u201cintroductory\u201d article does not cover so far. \n\nOn this aspect, the reviewer raises the fact that our proposed method leads to equivalent results to the covariance thresholding method in the sparse PCA context, under ideal parameter settings. Assuming, as we believe, that our subsequent study will provide means to properly select those ideal parameters, the resulting findings will allow for a more efficient and flexible ultimate sparse-PCA algorithm (where the choice of the soft-thresholding parameter is made harder by the uneasy theoretical analysis of the non-differentiable soft-thresholding function). Indeed, the continuously derivability property on the kernel function f is a necessary property to address the theoretical analysis of the spectral norm of f(sample covariance) as hinted in Theorem 1.4. in [Fan et al.], note that a quadratic interpolation of the soft-thresholding function is considered in [Fan et al.] to satisfy this property, thereby highlighting the importance of using a smooth kernel function f as we propose.  \n\nFinally, concerning the remark about Figure 1 (right), note that we have illustrated the phase transition for standard PCA which occurs at $\\omega = sqrt( p / n)$, which suggests that our method performs efficiently beyond this phase transition. We will clarify this aspect in the updated version of the article to avoid misunderstanding.\n\n[Fan et al.] Zhou Fan and Andrea Montanari. \"The spectral norm of random inner-product kernel matrices.\" Probability Theory and Related Fields (2015): 1-59."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper82/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper82/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper82/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Kernel Random Matrix-Based Approach for Sparse PCA", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a random matrix approach to recover sparse principal components from n p-dimensional vectors.

We have added an explanation for the used notations in page 2 before section 2.\n3. f and f^{(k)} are applied element-wise to the actual covariance matrix, in particular, the subscript {\\odot k} stands for the element-wise k-th power. We will add clarifications about these notations in the updated article.\n4. We have introduced the notation O_\\eta in Corollary 1, but will be recalled in Theorem 2 for clarification.\n\nThe reviewer also discusses the assumption before Theorem 1. Note that when P is sparse (which is the scenario of interest for the sparse PCA problem) and when the signal-to-noise-ratio is finite (cf. assumption A2) then beta_p = O(1). As such, the assumptions and Theorem 1 are reasonable as our main interest lies in the sparse PCA setting.\n\nFinally, the reviewer highlights the use of our proposed method to other thresholding procedures. Note that the proposed approach imposes that the key features of f, to attenuate the noise component of the sample covariance, lie in its local behavior at zero. So one can use other thresholding procedures (with different behaviors far away from zero), depending on the application, with only the soft constraints f\u2019(0)=f\u2019\u2019(0)=0 on f.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper82/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper82/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper82/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Kernel Random Matrix-Based Approach for Sparse PCA", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a random matrix approach to recover sparse principal components from n p-dimensional vectors.

We believe that there might be a slight misunderstanding in the main consequences of our findings. Indeed, our work does not propose a low rank approximation of kernel matrices per se. The approximation matrix given in Theorem 1 is only useful from a mathematical standpoint, which, by leading up to a mathematically tractable spiked model (Eq. (3)), allows for a deep and thorough asymptotic analysis of the matrix F. In particular, Theorem 1 allows us to show that a careful choice of the function f (namely with f\u2019(0)=f\u2019\u2019(0)=0) leads to an accurate method for estimating the principal components in a sparse context. As a consequence, we find here a necessary and sufficient condition for generic functions f applied entry-wise on the sample covariance matrix to retrieve sparse principal component, thereby largely generalizing the so-far uniquely known case of the soft-thresholding function (which has all its derivatives null at zero).\n\nIn the following, we provide answers to the detailed review comments:\n\n1. As we pointed out above, the proposed approach falls within the sparse PCA problem which is different from the kernel approximation problem and, thus, we are not aiming here at a numerically improvement of PCA but at an actual improvement of PCA for sparse eigenvectors.\n2. To simplify our arguments, we have chosen to work under the Gaussian assumption. However, our results are extensible to more general cases, particularly to the case of concentrated vectors (Lipschitz-ally transformed Gaussian vectors or random vectors with independent entries) which is a consequence of Remark 1.\n3.a) In this work, we have considered a sparsity level s = O(1) which corresponds to the case e = 0 from the e-sparsity notion perspective. As the main purpose of our paper is to provide the conditions under which the PCs can be consistently recovered from a smoothly transformed sample covariance matrix, providing bounds for the sparsity level is out of the scope of the proposed findings. However, note that we consider in Theorem 2 the estimation of element-wise functionals of e-sparse covariance matrices with e >= 0, which implicitly suggests that our results are still valid for s = O(n^e).\n3.b) As we have mentioned in point 3.a), the aim of the paper is to determine the necessary conditions for f to powerful sparse PCA recovery and our results guarantee the approximation of f(actual covariance) through f(sample covariance). In particular, a power method can be used to fast compute the (dominant) eigenvectors of f(actual covariance).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper82/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper82/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper82/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Kernel Random Matrix-Based Approach for Sparse PCA", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a random matrix approach to recover sparse principal components from n p-dimensional vectors.

They claim to generalize the use of soft thesholding to more general functions applied element-wise to the empirical covariance matrix.\n\nThere is a questionable term in the paper's title: the word \"kernel\" is mistakenly used. In fact a symmetric matrix is the Gram matrix of a kernel if it is positive semi-definite. The empirical covariance is PSD, but when you apply a function to it elementwise it has no guarantee of conserving the PSD property.\n\nRegarding the motivation of the paper (1) the paper claims to study the rank K case with arbitrary K>=1. Deshpande and Montanari studied K=1 and the analysis is already an interesting result. Generalizing it to higher ranks poses many questions, including the sparse vector supports' overlaps. \nIt is not clear to me why authors insist on trying to generalize the result to a function f that has broader properties. The main motivation is to recover the support of the (leading) sparse eigenvector / PC. It should not be to try denoising the empirical covariance with a complicated function f. If the focus is on generalizing the soft-thresholding part of the approach, then the real question can be formulated as what is the optimal f given that we have this or that property in the data? This often leads to Bayesian analysis of the problem. \n\nThe numerical experiments do not show any substantial improvement obtained using the prescribed method over using the baseline method (covariance thresholding). I suspect that authors can emphasis the benefit of their method by picking f to hold certain properties that reflect the noise process and beat covariance thresholding in those regimes.\nFigure 1 right hand side.
