It is built on top of the famous PPO algorithm (https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347). The authors break down the novel component of their model into three categories: target network, circular buffer, and importance sampling. They evaluate the effectiveness of each component through different experiments. \n\nOverall the paper is well-written and the ideas are communicated clearly. I like how the evaluation is done in different environments (discrete and continuous action-space) and improves the results independent of the task settings.  \n\nOne question: you mentioned in section 4.3: \"For fairness, same network hyperparameters were used across PPO, IMPALA, and IMPACT.\" I suppose it would be a fair comparison if you choose the hyperparameters for each algorithm separately ( according to the highest value they achieve on the measured metric.) How did you end up choosing the hyperparameters for your own experiments? Are they fine-tuned for IMPACT?\n\nIt seems like IMPACT is not always doing better than PPO in the discrete control domain as shown in Figure 6. Specifically, in part (a) it looks like PPO is beating both IMPALA and IMPACT for BreakoutNoFrameskip and PongNoFrameskip. It would be nice if authors could do an analysis of these cases and add a discussion as to why this is happening.\n\nOverall I think this is an interesting paper which can motivate more work in this area.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUpdates:\nI would like to thank the authors for their response.

Improved wall-clock training time has been achieved through distributed actors and learners, but often at the expense of sample efficiency.  IMPACT repurposes successful concepts from deep RL - the target network, importance sampling and a replay buffer to demonstrate improvements on both axes in on three continuous environments and three games from the Atari Learning Environment.\n\nPositives\nThis was a well-written paper proposing to address the sample efficiency of distributed RL algorithms.  The diagrams of the algorithm were also well-done.  Improving the sample efficiency of algorithms is an important objective and the approaches followed here are sensible.\n\nAdditionally, the ablations and examination of the sensitive hyperparameters of the algorithm are useful analyses.  These indicate relative insensitivity to the target network update frequency, but both the importance sampling equation and the circular buffer hyperparameters are described.\n\n\nNegatives\nIMPACT introduces additional hyperparameters which are tuned for each continuous control task and discrete control task.  However, there is no description of the hyperparameter tuning budget allocated to IMPACT, PPO, IMPALA.  \n\nRegarding the discrete environment, the game selection should be elaborated upon and if sufficient compute is available, the algorithm should be tested elsewhere.  Specifically, it is atypical (though not necessarily incorrect) to tune specific hyperparameters for each game in the Atari Learning Environment.  Traditionally, algorithms have been justified as robust and useful by the lack of need to tune per game.  Table 4 demonstrates a high degree of tuning for IMPACT due to game-specific changes for clip param, grad clip, lambda, num sgd iter, train_batch_size, value function loss coeff, kl coeff.  However, Table 5 (IMPALA) and Table 6 (PPO) have fewer noted changes.\n\nSmall nits: \n- Define advantage in the policy gradient equation\n- Figure 4 is ahead of Figure 3 in the compiled LaTeX\n\n\nQuestions\n- How were the discrete control games selected?\n- What was the hyperparameter tuning budget for IMPACT versus PPO or IMPALA?\n- If a fixed hyperparameter budget is allocated in advance and new environments are randomly selected, does IMPACT favorably compare to IMPALA and PPO?\n- IMPALA performs remarkably badly in the three continuous control tasks, even on wall-clock time.  What validations have been done here to ensure the algorithm is operating as intended?\n\nI will increase my rating if the robustness and improvements of this algorithm can be validated in randomly chosen games/continuous control environments for a fixed hyperparameter budget for IMPACT and both baselines.  Also, the IMPALA baseline should be validated for the continuous control tasks - it's surprising that this once SOTA-algorithm flounders in even simple tasks like Hopper-v2 or HalfCheetah-v2.\n\n\n-----------------\nUpdate:\nThe authors have addressed my initial concerns carefully through extra experiments and details in the Appendix and I have updated my rating accordingly.

We found your suggestions very helpful and have implemented all your suggestions in our revision.\n\nOne note: the IMPALA curves for the requested new experiments are still WIP in Appendix A. We will update them again shortly once runs complete (hopefully in a few hours).\n\n>> How were the discrete control games selected?\n\nOur three original discrete control games were chosen based on popular environments in existing distributed Reinforcement libraries such as Intel Coach. Based on your suggestions, we also selected three more games: two from Mnih et al. (2016), and also Gravitar, and have added results in Appendix A. All these games were selected by us without knowing their performance on any particular algorithm beforehand.\n\n>> What was the hyperparameter tuning budget for IMPACT versus PPO or IMPALA?\n\nThe budget per algorithm was similar: (19, 17, 21) and (21, 17, 20) distinct trials for (IMPACT, IMPALA, and PPO) respectively on the discrete and continuous environments. We show the search space, which we searched over with coordinate descent, in Appendix B.3 and B.4. We note that the optimal hyperparameters for IMPACT are quite close to IMPALA's and PPO's.\n\n>> If a fixed hyperparameter budget is allocated in advance and new environments are randomly selected, does IMPACT favorably compare to IMPALA and PPO?\n\nYes. We tested our final hyperparameter choice on Qbert, BeamRider, and Gravitar. In terms of real-time efficiency, IMPALA was the best for all three new environments. Timestep-wise, the agent did well on Qbert and BeamRider, but was beaten by PPO on Gravitar.\n\n>>I will increase my rating if the robustness and improvements of this algorithm can be validated in randomly chosen games/continuous control environments for a fixed hyperparameter budget for IMPACT and both baselines. \n\nWe have chosen three additional discrete environments at random (Qbert, BeamRider, Gravitar) from the Atari-57 and we included their performance in Appendix A. Furthermore, we have evaluated our environments with a fixed set of hyperparameters for all of these environments: the same as chosen for previous experiments.\n\nWe found IMPACT to attain very similar gains in performance when we used this universal hyperparameter baseline. The exact hyperparameters used are shown in Appendix B.1 and B.2.\n\n>>The IMPALA baseline should be validated for the continuous control tasks - it's surprising that this once SOTA-algorithm flounders in even simple tasks like Hopper-v2 or HalfCheetah-v2.\n\nWe investigated this further, and believe our baseline is reasonable. We support this as follows:\n\nIn Appendix C we added an ablation study interpolating between the IMPALA and IMPACT algorithms. This was done by incrementally adding the PPO objective, replay, and target network respectively on top of the baseline IMPALA implementation. It shows that each IMPACT component provides an improvement on top of IMPALA. We also note that, beyond these component changes, the code of our IMPACT implementation and IMPALA baseline are identical.\n\nIn Appendix D, we discuss prior work that support our result that VPG agents fail to attain good performance in non-trivial continuous tasks (Achiam, 2018). Our results with IMPALA reaches similar performance compared to other VPG-based algorithms."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1498/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1498/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["michael.luo@berkeley.edu", "jiahaoyao@berkeley.edu", "rliaw@berkeley.edu", "ekhliang@gmail.com", "istoica@berkeley.edu"], "title": "IMPACT: Importance Weighted Asynchronous Architectures with Clipped Target Networks", "authors": ["Michael Luo", "Jiahao Yao", "Richard Liaw", "Eric Liang", "Ion Stoica"], "pdf": "/pdf/87ad6a9e60c26bdafc068f45a83fa53977cab2eb.pdf", "TL;DR": "IMPACT helps RL agents train faster by decreasing training wall-clock time and increasing sample efficiency simultaneously.", "abstract": "The practical usage of reinforcement learning agents is often bottlenecked by the duration of training time.
