The paper introduces the auxiliary variables $u_t$ and assume they plus $x_t$ satisfy the sequential ignorability. How do we ensure the learned $u_t$ satisfy the condition? I am wondering whether there are metrics (for example, in static case, it would be something similar to a conditional independence test) for the sequential case. And whether this constraint should be reflected in the learning process, for example, adding a regularization function?\n\n2. The paper argues that we should consider the continuous case interventions. However, in the applications/experiments, it appears the interventions and problem settings are all discrete time spaced. For example, the tumor growth function is formulated as V(t) = f * V(t-1), which looks like discrete time points. I would love to hear more discussions on the choice between discrete and continuous, and why we should consider the continuous case. \n\n3. What are the exact number of parameters used by each of the method? I would assume to learn the effect of a continuous time process $a_t$, we need much more parameters, however, the paper said we use similar parameters, so would love to know more the size of the parameters.

For this, they employ neural ODEs as a latent time-series model, which they augment with additional latent variables. They test their approach on synthetic and real-world data and demonstrate improved performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art.\n\n##########################################################################\nReasons for score: \n \nOverall, I vote for weak rejection (5) in its current form. This is mainly due to the following reasons:\n1.\tMarginal theoretical contribution \n2.\tAnalysis of the method is lacking. How critical is the introduction of dynamic variables for the performance? How much is the performance increasing by only increasing the number of parameters of a vanilla neuralODE? How significant are the results, e.g., in figure 2? \n\n##########################################################################\nPros: \n1.\tThe paper is well and concisely written and is understandable to a broad audience.\n2.\tThe authors apply an interesting model to an interesting problem. \n3.\tTo the best of my knowledge, neuralODEs have not been applied to counterfactual inference before, but it is hard to keep track of those two fast-evolving fields (neural ODEs and counterfactuals). I believe, however, that this approach is very promising. The idea of introducing additional dynamic variables to neuralODEs to account for the bias introduced by hidden confounders is also novel. \n4.\tThe presence of clusters in the inferred auxiliary variable states is an exciting finding.\n \n##########################################################################\nCons: \n1.\tThe theoretical contribution is marginal. The authors only slightly extend the model without further studying the implications of the model. \n\n2.\tI would have expected to see the following analysis: \nA)\tAuxiliary states vs. history-dependent (non-Markovian) neuralODE\nB)\tAuxiliary states vs. additional parameters of neuralODE\nThis is due to the following reasons: A) In prior work, a similar approach has been employed in various prior works to model hidden confounders, e.g. [Nodelman, U., Shelton, C. R., & Koller, D. (2012). Expectation-Maximization and Complex Duration Distributions for Continuous-Time Bayesian Networks. UAI], or see \u201cMori-Zwanzig\u201d formalism, in order to model non-Markovian behavior. I would have liked to see some discussion on auxiliary variables vs. non-Markovian neuralODEs (f(x,u,t) vs f(x_1,\u2026x_t,t))?. What is the better approach? To introduce auxiliary variables into the neuralODE, or to extend the neuralODE also to have the time-series\u2019 history as input? B) My kneejerk reaction is that decreased bias and increased variance can be expected when introducing auxiliary variables, solely because this increases the number of parameters of the neuralODE. I would suggest performing a dedicated experiment that allows for disentangling the number of parameters from the presence of auxiliary variables.\n3) Further, the results in fig. 2 should include the variance of results. The curves are all close together, and it would be interesting to see whether the improvement is significant.\n4) How would I determine k in practice?\n##########################################################################\nQuestions during the rebuttal period: \n\nPlease address and clarify the cons above. \n \n#########################################################################\nSome typos: \n\u2022\tAlgorithm 1,2,3 \u201cODESlove\u201d\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3021/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3021/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Time Series Counterfactual Inference with Hidden Confounders", "authorids": ["~Guangyu_Li2", "~Jiahao_Chen1", "samuel.a.assefa@jpmorgan.com", "~Yan_Liu1"], "authors": ["Guangyu Li", "Jiahao Chen", "Samuel A Assefa", "Yan Liu"], "keywords": ["Time Series Analysis", "Counterfactual Inference", "Differential Equations."], "abstract": "We present augmented counterfactual ordinary differential equations (ACODEs), a new approach to counterfactual inference on time series data with a focus on healthcare applications.

This is done by modelling interventions in continuous time with differential equations augmented by auxiliary confounding variables to reduce bias. They demonstrate the proposed method on tumor growth simulation and sepsis patient treatment response. \n\nPros:\n+ The proposed method can predict how a continuous-time time series will evolve under a sequence of interventions. \n+ The proposed method is naturally constructed upon the neural ODE framework by additionally modelling the effects of incoming interventions. \n\nConcerns:\n- The major concern in this paper is that the authors did not deal with the identifiability issue of the proposed method for counterfactual inference. It is widely acknowledged that identifiability plays a pivotal role in counterfactual inference, without which any counterfactual quantities cannot be guaranteed. In particular in the methods based on neural networks, it is extremely difficult to address the identifiability issue. In light of this, instead it might be a better idea to provide some counterfactual bounds (Pearl, 2009) for the quantities of interest. \n- From the experimental results, it seems that the proposed method does not have an obvious advantage in comparison with the baselines. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3021/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3021/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Time Series Counterfactual Inference with Hidden Confounders", "authorids": ["~Guangyu_Li2", "~Jiahao_Chen1", "samuel.a.assefa@jpmorgan.com", "~Yan_Liu1"], "authors": ["Guangyu Li", "Jiahao Chen", "Samuel A Assefa", "Yan Liu"], "keywords": ["Time Series Analysis", "Counterfactual Inference", "Differential Equations."], "abstract": "We present augmented counterfactual ordinary differential equations (ACODEs), a new approach to counterfactual inference on time series data with a focus on healthcare applications.
