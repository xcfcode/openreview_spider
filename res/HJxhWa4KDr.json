Instead of using Gaussian kernel on the top of the learned embeddings from the discriminator, it combines existing deep forests kernels. The theory of being differentiable is carefully studied (to prove zero measure) and the experiments are well conducted.  \n\n1.  Some important  references are missing.  One very related paper is \n\n* Li et al., Implicit Kernel Learning,  AISTATS 2019. \n\nThat paper is using the same idea to learn to manipulate the random features on the top of the learned embedding.  The main difference between it and the proposed algorithm is they use MLP parameterization instead of the tree-based model.    Also, the deep forest model can be treated as a sparse neural network, does it have more advantage over Li et al., (2019)? given they use simple dense MLP.   Please at least discuss the similarity and difference in the rebuttal and update the draft correspondingly.  I would even encourage the author to empirically compare with it in the camera ready version.  It would be interesting to see which parameterization is better in this space. \n\nThere are also other recent MMD GAN extensions should be cited in the discussion, such as \n* On gradient regularizers for MMD GANs. \n\n2. For the theory part, based on Binkowski (2018), the gradients for the generator parameters should be biased. Could you discuss it with Theorem 2? \n\n3. For most MMD GAN results, one important property in Li et al., (2017),  Arbel et al., (2018) and Li et al., (2019) is weak* topology.  Does the proposed Random Forest MMD GAN also has that property? In Li et al., (2019), they need some condition to ensure that, how's case in the proposed algorithm?

Besides, being an asymmetric kernel, our random-forest kernel is much more flexible, in terms of capturing the differences between distributions. Sharing the advantages of CNN, kernel method, and ensemble learning, our random-forest kernel based MMD GAN obtains desirable empirical performances on CIFAR-10, CelebA and LSUN bedroom data sets. Furthermore, for the sake of completeness, we also put forward comprehensive theoretical analysis to support our experimental results.", "title": "MMD GAN with Random-Forest Kernels", "code": "http://anonymous.4open.science/repository/a233b01f-f072-430d-8b3d-3871804c58f1", "keywords": ["GANs", "MMD", "kernel", "random forest", "unbiased gradients"], "authors": ["Tao Huang", "Zhen Han", "Xu Jia", "Hanyuan Hang"], "TL;DR": "Equip MMD GANs with a new random-forest kernel.", "authorids": ["tao.huang2018@ruc.edu.cn", "handarkholme@ruc.edu.cn", "jiayushenyang@gmail.com", "hanyuan0725@gmail.com"], "pdf": "/pdf/448f26dd1c7692fabce2a1f7ff4f56af03d97b01.pdf", "paperhash": "huang|mmd_gan_with_randomforest_kernels", "original_pdf": "/attachment/448f26dd1c7692fabce2a1f7ff4f56af03d97b01.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nhuang2020mmd,\ntitle={{\\{}MMD{\\}} {\\{}GAN{\\}} with Random-Forest Kernels},\nauthor={Tao Huang and Zhen Han and Xu Jia and Hanyuan Hang},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJxhWa4KDr}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
