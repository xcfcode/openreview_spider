As the authors and reviewers/AC seem to agree, the actual benefits of sparse matrix multiplies are hard to realize, especially on embedded devices, so the contributions at this point are mainly hypothetical and only about the new idea. Each reviewer brought up issues (even the most positive reviewer) and mostly the reviewers were not persuaded by the rebuttal. In short, there wasn't evidence that this new idea could really contribute to the state-of-the-art.  This is now a fairly crowded topic (e.g., all the  papers brought up by R3 in just that one class of methods), and new papers should beat state-of-the-art and/or introduce new theory -- an example would be a paper from last year's ICLR, https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJfwJ2A5KX , \"Data-Dependent Coresets for Compressing Neural Networks with Applications to Generalization Bounds\" (Baykal, Liebenwein, Gilitschenski, Feldman, Ru) which not only gives an efficient technique (not based on sparsity of weights) but also gives types of generalization guarantees.\n\nAs R1 said, the results are not state-of-the-art, and we have to believe the authors that \"an iterative-like extension of our method could reach even better results\". The rebuttal says that the paper's goal is to \"pioneer a new approach to neural network compression\". But if you can get better results with something better than Palm4MSA, then please do so, and demonstrate the evidence!  Right now, the paper assumes we could implement sparse multiplication efficiently on embedded devices, and assumes we could get better results: both these are quite hypothetical.

This approach is in line with the initial methods on neural network compression: direct (task-independent) compression of weights, which is followed by NN task-dependent fine-tuning. In this case, the direct compression is obtained using the Palm4MSA method of Magoarou and Gribonval (2016), and then models are fine-tuned in an end-to-end fashion using TensorFlow.\n\n**Decision**: Given the contributions of the paper and the lackluster experimental evaluation, I am recommending rejection.\n\n**Detailed comments**:\nThe factorization as a product of sparse matrices is an interesting approach, and in its general form, such a scheme has not been studied in the context of neural network compression. However, the evaluation of the proposed approach is not convincing:\n\n - Effect of chaining sparse matrices for the actual inference is not discussed. As authors are well aware, the support of sparse matrix-vector products is limited in major frameworks and hardware. Therefore, chaining multiple sparse products might significantly delay the actual inference, even though it has fewer parameters and theoretically fewer FLOPs. \n\n - Comparison of different compression mechanism for neural networks is a very complex task: since most methods are applied per layer, the parameters of the compressions must be tuned per layer too: e.g., ranks/sparsity of every layer cannot have the same value, as some layers require more/fewer parameters. However, in the comparison, authors use uniform settings across layers for their method (e.g., M=4 cores) and for other methods. The conclusions under such comparison strategy have a limited value: it says that chosen hyperparameters of compression A beats the chosen (by hand) hyperparameters of compression B in terms of final compression ratio/tradeoff etc. It leaves the possibility that by tuning parameters of B we might outperform A. To fully understand the usefulness of the compression scheme, we need to ask a different question: given the scheme A and B (with the best selection of hyperparameters for both), compression using which scheme gives the smallest model for a given accuracy?  Or even better, which compression results in a better tradeoff when optimizing the shape/form of the schemes to suit the compression target?\n\n- Related to the previous point, authors miss a large body of the methods that instead of expecting the weights to be in a certain form (e.g., sparse or low-rank), actually force the network to attain such form using penalties and constraints. For example, in terms of low-rank compression, here are some of the relevant works:\n   1. Accelerating Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Classification and Detection (IEEE TPAMI 2016)\n   2. Coordinating Filters for Faster Deep Neural Networks (ICCV 2017)\n   3. Compression-Aware Training of Deep Networks (NIPS2017)\n   4. Constrained Optimization Based Low-rank Approximation of Deep Neural Networks (ECCV 2018)\n   5. Automated Multi-Stage Compression of Neural Networks (ICCV Workshops 2019)\n   6. Low-Rank Compression of Neural Nets: Learning the Rank of Each Layer (CVPR 2020)\n   7. Factorized Higher-Order CNNs with an Application to Spatio-Temporal Emotion Estimation (CVPR 2020)\n   8. TRP: Trained Rank Pruning for Efficient Deep Neural Networks (IJCAI 2020)\n\nThere is an equally large body of literature on network sparsification. Please add the comparison to best-in-its-class results from the literature in order to fully evaluate the proposed scheme.\n\n*Minor concerns*:\nI strongly believe citing Li Deng for the MNIST dataset is inadequate.  Please correct.\n\n*Post rebuttal comments*: I appreciate the author's efforts for the rebuttal, however, the feedback did not adequately address my questions. I am not changing the score.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3317/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3317/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Sparse matrix products for neural network compression", "authorids": ["~Luc_Giffon1", "~hachem_kadri2", "~Stephane_Ayache1", "~Ronan_Sicre3", "~thierry_artieres1"], "authors": ["Luc Giffon", "hachem kadri", "Stephane Ayache", "Ronan Sicre", "thierry artieres"], "keywords": ["Compression", "sparsity"], "abstract": "Over-parameterization of neural networks is a well known issue that comes along with their great performance.

In this work, we show that PSM layers are serious contenders to achieve model compression. This same idea motivates the comparison with 'PSM random' and 'PSM re-init' methods. Indeed, these experiments show that the weights and sparse support returned by Palm4MSA are of crucial interest for the network to be able to learn something. In that case, the natural question that arises is whether or not other strategies than Palm4MSA (or improvements of it) can be used to build PSM layers that achieve better performance.

We can\u2019t deny that, in the current state of available hardware, an architecture with PSM layers could not compete with usual dense architectures, especially if run on modern GPU where most multiplications can be run simultaneously. However, we think that the accumulation of papers achieving interesting performances with sparsity based techniques can provide incentives to develop new hardware that would benefit from sparse multiplications. \n- In fact, concerning the Tucker decomposition, we use the VBMF strategy to discover the ideal rank for each layer; concerning the iterative sparsity inducing technique, we use a global compression rate for the network but no particular constraint is set so that every layer should have the same compression rate: at each iteration a percentage of the global network weights are removed. The reviewer is correct concerning the other compression methods (tensortrain and PSM) and the general idea that it would be better to tune every compression strategy for every layer to achieve the best possible performance with a given compression rate. However, the combinatory of such experiment is so huge that only a few laboratories in the world could conduct it. And even they would require to make some arbitrary choices at some point. We do not have the infrastructure for such experiments so we chose the approach that seemed the fairest: our method is actually at a disadvantage compared to Tucker and Iterative Sparsity and tensortrain induces a huge overhead in convolution layers, which makes it unusable for wide networks. Anyway, we do not pretend that our technique is so good that it would beat every existing compression scheme. We believe that the idea of defining weight matrices as product of sparse matrices is very flexible and could set the basis for a new line of research for compressing neural networks. Our approach is simple yet it achieves good results, we think that can be inspiring for the community.\n- We particularly thank the reviewer to point out these works that are very interesting. Unfortunately, we doubt that such approach could be used for our method as the theory behind what makes a matrix a good candidate for being \"sparse factorized\" is not known yet. In the presence of such condition, it would be very interesting indeed to try to set constraint on the initial network to achieve this goal."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3317/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3317/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Sparse matrix products for neural network compression", "authorids": ["~Luc_Giffon1", "~hachem_kadri2", "~Stephane_Ayache1", "~Ronan_Sicre3", "~thierry_artieres1"], "authors": ["Luc Giffon", "hachem kadri", "Stephane Ayache", "Ronan Sicre", "thierry artieres"], "keywords": ["Compression", "sparsity"], "abstract": "Over-parameterization of neural networks is a well known issue that comes along with their great performance.

Imposing sparsity is generally interesting and meaningful. The experimental results are appreciated.\n\nThere are some concerns that make this paper cannot be fully appreciated:\n1. There are so many structured matrix schemes to compress neural networks. Now, the authors claim sparsity + low-rank can provide better accuracy-efficiency tradeoff.  \n    This is surely not enough.  We compress neural networks for mobile computing devices, while the \"best\" accuracy-efficiency tradeoff is not the final goal, unless you are theoretically drawing the boundaries.  \n    A more important question with the proposed scheme is as follows: 1). the current compression schemes in the literature are good enough in balancing accuracy-efficiency. Sparsity will surely contributed. 2). however, when the compressed model is downloaded onto a mobile device, will sparse neural networks easy to run on such platforms?\n   This is a naturally question that needs an answer.  The best accuracy-efficiency tradeoff is not the final goal;  a high cost-performance is the objective to optimize. I mean you may add sparsity to achieve better accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, but we do not allow it to introducing much computation overhead of sparse computations.\n\n2. I have to raise the principle of \"simple and effective\" is the best, for this kind of tasks.\n    The previous schemes (circulant, low-rank, sparsity only, etc) are simple and shown to be effective. Now, your model is more sophisticated and the overhead is higher. Will this solution serve the purpose of compressing neural networks for mobile devices?\n    I would hope the authors do not answer too quickly.  The purpose of achieving better accuracy-efficiency tradeoff is finally making deep learning be practically deployed onto mobile devices, while computing power, memory, bandwidth and energy are limited.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3317/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3317/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Sparse matrix products for neural network compression", "authorids": ["~Luc_Giffon1", "~hachem_kadri2", "~Stephane_Ayache1", "~Ronan_Sicre3", "~thierry_artieres1"], "authors": ["Luc Giffon", "hachem kadri", "Stephane Ayache", "Ronan Sicre", "thierry artieres"], "keywords": ["Compression", "sparsity"], "abstract": "Over-parameterization of neural networks is a well known issue that comes along with their great performance.
