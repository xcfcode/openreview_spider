The SET-OUT results show that the model is able to learn to identify the difference between two unseen sentences and, if that difference has been seen before, return a consistent label that corresponds to that difference. Perhaps more important is the fact that the model shows 100% accuracy on unseen examples like 'some dog bark [entails] some animal bark\u201d (seen in ALL-SPLIT for example) where lexical items differ between sides. Here the model is both learning to do this reasoning about differences, and learning to use information about entailment between lexical items (animal > dog) in novel environments.\r\n\r\nAs you suggest, I do use correct hand-assigned parses in both training and testing. I agree that it would be interesting to see what effect using randomly assigned parses instead would have, and I may be able to get those numbers at least by the conference date. It does seem worth mentioning, though, that the sentences are mostly three or four words long, so I would expect that the parse structure would be far less important in these experiments than in ones with longer sentences (and thus more deeply nested tree structures), since every word is already quite close to the top of the composition tree regardless of the structure here.\r\n\r\nSince you brought up the (important) Scheible and Schuetze paper, I should mention that the prior motivation for using high quality parse structures for this task is considerably stronger than the motivation for using them in binary sentiment tasks like the one reported on in that paper. In binary sentiment labeling, the label is largely (but not entirely) dependent on the presence or absence of strongly sentiment expressing words, and decent performance (~80%) can be achieved using simple regression models with bigram or even unigram features. I don\u2019t have exactly comparable numbers for the dataset that I present in this paper, but RTE/NLI does not lend itself to comparable quality baselines with simple features. My task is deliberately easier than the RTE challenge datasets, but the average tuned model submitted to the first RTE workshop in 2005 got less than 55% accuracy on *binary* entailment classification.

The essential idea is to train an additional comparison layer that takes the representations of two sentences and produces an output that describes the relation between the two sentences (entailment, equivalence, etc.)  This approach is in fact closely related to the 'restricted entailment operator' suggested near the end of  Bottou's white paper http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6192v3.pdf.  Experiments are carried out using a vastly simplified language and Socher's supervised training technique. According to the author, the results are a mixed bag. On the one hand, the system can learn to reason on sentences whose structure matches that of the training sentences.  On the other hand, performance quickly degrades when using sentences whose structure did not appear in the training set.\r\n\r\nMy reading of these results is much more pessimistic. I find completely unsurprising that the system can learn to 'reason' on sentences with known structure. On the other hand, the inability of the system to reason on sentences with new structure indicates that the recursive embedding network did not perform what was expected.  The key of the recursive structure is to share weights across all applications of the grouping layer. This weight sharing was obviously insufficient to induce a bias that helps the system generalize to other structures. Whether this is a simple optimization issue or a more fundamental problem remains to be determined.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that the author always trains the system using the correct parsing structure in a manner similar to Socher's initial work (please confirm).  It would be very interesting to investigate whether one obtains substantially different results if one trains the system using incorrect parsing structures (either a random structures or a left-to-right structure). Worse results would indicate that the structure of the recursive embeddings matters.  Similar results would confirm the results reported in http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2811 and strongly suggest that recursive embeddings do not live up to expectations.

The pretraining settings that I experimented with involved first training the model on some or all of the pairs of individual words from Appendix B, annotated with the relations between them.\r\n\r\nI'm certainly sensitive to the concern that the model might be overparameterized, and I will see about getting a training curve together in the next week or two.\r\n\r\nSection 4: \r\n\r\nThe numbers referenced in those subsections do refer to Table 2, but the '(as in 2)' reference is a mistake.

A set of seven entailment relations from MaCartney are used, and a data set of 12,000 logical statements (of pairs of sentences) are generated from these relations and from 41 predicate tokens.  The task is multiclass classification, where given two sentences, the system must output the correct relation between them. A simple recursive tensor network is used. The study is limited to considering quantifiers like 'some' and 'all', which have clear monotonicity properties.  Results show that the model can learn but that generalization is limited.  Unfortunately because the training process converges to an inferior model, results are given after very early stopping, in which subsequent iterations can give widely different results.\r\n\r\nThis is an exciting direction for research and it's great to see it being tackled. Unfortunately, however, the paper is unclear in crucial places, and the training methodology is questionable.  I would encourage the author to clarify the paper (especially for the likely non-linguist audience) and strengthen the training algorithm (in order to demonstrate usefully reproducible results).  Even if the results remain negative, this would then still be of significant value to the community.\r\n\r\nSpecific comments:\r\n\r\nSection 2\r\n---------\r\n\r\nYour example of 'some dogs bark' seems confused.  For both arguments of 'some' (not just the first), the inference works if the argument is replaced by something more general. You write that 'some' is downward monotonic in its second argument, but your examples show upward monotonicity in both. (Specifically, you write 'The quantifier 'some' is upward monotone in its first argument because it permits substitution of more general terms, and downward monotone in its second argument because it permits the substitution of more specific terms.' - but in the same paragraph you also write that 'some' is upward monotonic in both arguments.) Readers who are asked to expend mental energy on disentangling unnecessary confusions like this can quickly lose motivation.\r\n\r\nTable 1: this table is central to your work, but it needs more explanation.  What is calligraphic D?  You seem to be using the 'hat' operator in two different senses (column 2 versus column 3). What does 'else' mean in column 3 - how exactly is independence defined? \r\n\r\nThe whole paper rests on MacCartney's framework, so I think it's necessary to explain more about this scheme here. In particular, I do not understand your 'no animals bark | some dogs bark' example (and I fear most others won't, too).\r\n\r\nTypo: much hold --> must hold\r\n\r\nSection 3\r\n---------\r\n\r\n'Several pretraining regimes meant to initialize the word vectors to reflect the relations between them were tried, but none offered a measurable improvement to the learned model' - please say which were tried.  In particular, did you try fixed, off-the-shelf vectors, for example from Socher's work, or trained using a large unlabeled dataset using Mikolov's Word2Vec?\r\n\r\nI counted 4624 parameters in the composition parameters, 13,005 for the comparison layer (with dimension 45), and 800 for the 50 (16 dimensional) word vectors, giving a total of 18,429 parameters.  Your training set size is quite a bit smaller than this, and regularization can only help so much.  I wonder if the limited results and difficulty of training (converging, but to poor solutions) just indicates the need for more training data. You can test this by generating a training curve - that is, plot performance on a validation set for various training set sizes (when trained to convergence, and using whatever regularization you settle on).  If the curve is still steep when using all the training data, then more data will help.  If it's flat, then the task may not be learnable with the model used.\r\n\r\nSection 4\r\n---------\r\n\r\nYour description of the 'basic monotonicity' datasets was unclear to me.  Does 1, 2 refer to Table 2?  If so it's not clear how 'In some of the datasets (as in 1), this alternation is in the first argument, in some the second argument (as in 2), and in some both.'\r\n\r\nSection 5\r\n---------\r\n\r\nIt is not very surprising that the model can learn the all-split data, since the training data is so tightly constrained.  Set-out is also very close to the training data.\r\n\r\nI found that exactly how the data splits were done, and what was tested on, was unclear.\r\n\r\ntypo: 'the it is'\r\n\r\n'I choose one of three target datasets' - how did you choose the three?  (From the 200?)\r\n\r\n'potentially other similar datasets...' is imprecise.  How did you choose?\r\n\r\n'The model did not converge well for any of these experiments: convergence can take hundreds or thousands of passes through the data, and the performance of the model at convergence on test data was generally worse than its performance during the first hundred or so iterations. To sidestep this problem somewhat, I report results here for the models learned after 64 passes through the data.'  I'm afraid that this greatly reduces the value of these results (they are close to being irreproducible).  The training algorithm should at least converge, or be more reproducible than this.  (If the test error is still fluctuating wildly on the stopping iteration, other small changes, e.g. in the data, may give completely different results).\r\n\r\nSection 6\r\n---------\r\n\r\n'Pessimistically...
