We appreciate that you highly evaluate our work.\n\n\n> The analysis is mostly for dense graphs. However, most of the real-world networks are large-scale sparse networks.\n\nFirst, we think that Erdos-Renyi graphs Theorem 3 can support are not that dense. For example, suppose the node size is $N = 20000$ (approximate node size of the PubMed dataset) and the edge probability $p = \\log N / N$, each node has the order of $Np=\\log N\\approx 4.3$ adjacent nodes (we use the common logarithm).\nIn addition, although Theorem 3 cannot support the extremely sparse case (e.g., $p=o(\\log N / N$) for Erdos-Renyi graphs), our theory gives a unified way to investigate the behavior of graph NNs regardless of the sparsity of underlying graphs through graph spectral.\nRegarding experiments, we can obtain insights about sparse graphs that the sparsity of practically available graphs can be one of the reasons for the success of graph NNs for node classification tasks. To confirm this hypothesis, we artificially added edges to citation networks to make them dense in the experiments and observed the failure of graph NNs as expected. Of course, our experiments are just supporting evidence of the hypothesis. We need more theories to understand the oversmoothing phenomena for sparse graphs.\n\n\n> It would be great if the authors could provide suggestions on how to eliminate the information loss in GNN.\n\nOne idea is to (randomly) sample edges in an underlying graph. As we wrote in the previous answer, the sparsity of practically available graphs could be a factor of the success of graph NNs. Assuming this hypothesis is correct, there is a possibility that we can relive the effect of oversmoothing by sparsification. Since we can never restore the information in pruned edges if we remove them permanently, random edge sampling could work better as FastGCN [Chen et al., 2018] or GraphSAGE [Hamilton et al., 2017] do.\nAnother idea is to scale a signal (i.e., intermediate or final output of graph NNs) appropriately so that the signal keeps away from the invariant space $\\mathcal{M}$. Our proposed weight scaling mechanism takes this strategy. Recently, Zhao and Akoglu (2019) have proposed PairNorm to alleviate the oversmoothing phenomena. Although the scaling target is different -- they rescaled signals whereas ours normalized weights -- there can be some relationship between theirs and ours.\n\n\n[Chen et al., 2018] Jie Chen,  Tengfei  Ma,  and Cao Xiao.

We are also interested in how residual links affect behaviors of graph NNs (both in the finite-depth regime and in the continuous-limit regime). Considering the correspondence of graph NNs and Markov processes (see Remark 1 and Appendix E), we thought at first that residual links do not contribute to alleviating the oversmoothing phenomena: our intuition was that adding residual connections to a graph NN corresponds to converting a Markov process to the lazy version. When a Markov process converges to a stable distribution, the corresponding lazy process also converges eventually. It implies that residual links might not be helpful.\nHowever, Li et al. (2019) reported that graph NNs with as many as 56 layers performed well if they added residual connections. Considering that, the situation could be more complicated than our intuitions. We think it is a promising direction for future research.\n\n[Li et al., 2019] Guohao Li, Matthias Mller, Ali Thabet, and Bernard Ghanem. DeepGCNs: Can GCNs go as deep as CNNs?

We reply to your comments one by one.\n\n\n> Understanding the behavior in sparse graphs seems like an important research avenue, without which the picture is incomplete. \n\nFirst, we think that Erdos-Renyi graphs Theorem 3 can support are not that dense. For example, suppose the node size is $N=20000$ (approximate node size of the PubMed dataset) and the edge probability $p=\\log N / N$, each node has the order of $Np=\\log N\\approx 4.3$ adjacent nodes (we use the common logarithm).\nIn addition, although Theorem 3 cannot support the extremely sparse case (e.g., $p=o(\\log N / N$) for Erdos-Renyi graphs), our theory gives a unified way to investigate the behavior of graph NNs regardless of the sparsity of underlying graphs through graph spectral.\nRegarding experiments, see the answer to the next question.\n\n\n> What should we learn about the actual task from the experiments on the noisy version? \n\nOur theory claims that GCNs tend to fail when graphs are dense (e.g., Theorem 3).  From this, we can hypothesize that the sparsity of practically available graphs is one of the reasons for the success of graph NNs for node classification tasks. To confirm this hypothesis, we artificially added edges to citation networks to make them dense in the experiments and observed the failure of graph NNs as expected. Of course, our experiments are just supporting evidence of the hypothesis. We need more theories to understand the oversmoothing phenomena for sparse graphs.\n\n\n> Could the double descent curves [...] reconcile the discussion therein? How would over-parameterization from the interpolation perspective and the results of the current work relate?\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, no literature reported the double descent phenomena for graph NNs. Therefore, we had in mind the classical U-shaped risk curve, in which the bias-variance trade-off exists, and conjectured that there is a sweet spot of the weight scale (see the discussion section for detail). We are happy if some people share research that has studied it.\nIt is known that the double descent phenomena do not occur in some situations, especially depending on regularization types. For example, while Belkin et al. (2018), the first paper of the double descent, employed the interpolating hypothesis with the minimum norm, Mei and Montanari (2019) found that the double descent was alleviated or disappeared when they used Ridge-type regularizations. Therefore, one can hypothesize the oversmoothing is a cause or consequence of regularization that is more like a Ridge-type rather than minimum-norm inductive bias. \n\n[Belkin et al., 2018] Belkin, Mikhail, et al. \"Reconciling modern machine learning and the bias-variance trade-off.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.11118 (2018).\n[Mei and Montanari, 2019] Mei, Song, and Andrea Montanari. \"The generalization error of random features regression: Precise asymptotics and double descent curve.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1908.05355 (2019)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper47/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper47/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["kenta_oono@mist.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp", "taiji@mist.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp"], "title": "Graph Neural Networks Exponentially Lose Expressive Power for Node Classification", "authors": ["Kenta Oono", "Taiji Suzuki"], "pdf": "/pdf/cacaf3786dbc21f6c2d66c22723f7933227c22d1.pdf", "TL;DR": "We relate the asymptotic behavior of graph neural networks to the graph spectra of underlying graphs and gives principled guidelines for normalizing weights.", "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (graph NNs) are a promising deep learning approach for analyzing graph-structured data.

The authors study a very important problem. It has long been observed that additional depth does not help GNN. The authors provide a convincing theoretical explanation for the behavior.\n2. The theoretical results are very close to practical models with little assumptions. Most importantly, the non-linearity is kept compared to other analysis that takes essential components out from the model. Moreover, the technique used in the paper could potentially benefit other theoretical analysis for NN.\n3. The authors provide supporting empirical experiments for the theoretical analysis. The observation on s in section 6.3 and the perpendicular component experiment on section 6.4 provide interesting insight to the performance of GNN.\n\nWeakness:\n1. The analysis is mostly for dense graphs. However, most of the real-world networks are large-scale sparse networks.\n2.

Using the assumptions from Kawaguchi 16' is essentially linearizing the network, though we found that it aligns with practice well for node classification tasks.\n\nFrom a more general perspective, i.e. beyond the node classification datasets, we find such \"graph expander phenomenon\" is subtle for more general tasks. For example, in reasoning tasks, e.g. VQA, learning graph algorithms, people usually use complete graphs, which for sure have high expansion, but  more layers is usually needed and not harmful. So this has to do with the \"true underlying function\" of these node classification datasets (maybe that's also why adaptivity of aggregation range for these node classification tasks is desirable). This is an observation we had after JK-Nets so unfortunately we did not have chance to include this in final version of JK, but we think this would reveal a better picture of what's going on.

In the case of a GCN, we show that when its weights satisfy the conditions determined by the spectra of the (augmented) normalized Laplacian, its output exponentially approaches the set of signals that carry information of the connected components and node degrees only for distinguishing nodes.\nOur theory enables us to relate the expressive power of GCNs with the topological information of the underlying graphs inherent in the graph spectra. To demonstrate this, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of GCNs on the Erd\\H{o}s -- R\\'{e}nyi graph.\nWe show that when the Erd\\H{o}s -- R\\'{e}nyi graph is sufficiently dense and large, a broad range of GCNs on it suffers from the ``information loss\" in the limit of infinite layers with high probability.\nBased on the theory, we provide a principled guideline for weight normalization of graph NNs. We experimentally confirm that the proposed weight scaling enhances the predictive performance of GCNs in real data.
