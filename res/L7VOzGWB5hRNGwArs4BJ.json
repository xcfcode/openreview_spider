The encoder is never described very carefully, but is basically a conventional, human-designed categorical features soft-max classifier, from what I can tell. The decoder is then asked to predict one entity given the relation and other entity in a continuous space model: the entities are embedded, and the relations are represented as a matrix. Three models are investigated. The work outperforms previous work by Yao et al. (2011, 2012).\n\nI think the general approach is novel, and interesting - the encoder-decoder factorization, and the way the decoder is trained by masking and asking it to predict one entity is novel, good, and opens up a space for others to try things. As such, I think it is an okay workshop contribution, worthy of acceptance.\n\nSome aspects of the paper are not so good:\n - The description of the experiment is very vague: re they using the same corpus and filtering as the Yao et al. and subsequent papers. I suspect not, since they say they end up with about 2 million entity pairs, whereas Yao et al. report 2.5 million. Why aren't they using the same corpus? What has been left out? You can't tell. What forms of preprocessing are provided. You can't tell. \n - No qualitative output from the experiments is given. Other papers in this area typically show examples of the relation clusters induced, and the sets of entity arguments they pick up. Here we are completely in the dark except for seeing an F1 number.\n - The paper seems to limit itself in comparisons to 2011-era work, and barely considers work since then. That is, looking at just work involving Limin Yao (their chosen point of comparison), this paper:\n     o Shows a comparison to the results of Yao et al. (2011), but doesn't really explain why their results for the methods of Yao et al. (2011) are 10 F1 points below the methods reported by Yao et al. on a \"similar\" corpus, except for the annotation \"(our feats)\", where the \"feats\" used are never explained, unlike in Yao et al. 2011.\n     o Shows a comparison to one method (HAC) used as a baseline in Yao et al. (2012), but doesn't cover the main result of that paper which does 6 F1 points better, presumably meaning that it is about equal to the results of this paper - the sense clustering of that paper could be argued to be quite analogous to what the encoder-decoder of this paper should be motivated to do to perform well.\n     o Except for a token cite at the beginning, there is no discussion of the \"universal schema\" work of Riedel, Yao, McCallum and Marlin (2013), which many would now regard as the standard go-to comparison for this line of work. Unfortunately, they use a different evaluation metric, so I can't do an easy comparison - but the authors of this paper could have - but they too show results signficantly above those of Yao et al. 2011.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"CMT_id": "", "title": "Autoencoding for Joint Relation Factorization and Discovery from Text", "abstract": "We present a method for unsupervised open-domain relation discovery. \nIn contrast to previous (mostly generative and agglomerative clustering) approaches, our model relies on rich contextual features and \nmakes minimal independence assumptions. \nThe model is composed of two parts: a feature-rich relation extractor, which predicts a semantic relation between two entities, and a factorization model, which reconstructs arguments (i.e., the entities) relying on the predicted relation.\nWe use a variational autoencoding objective and estimate the two components jointly so as to minimize errors in recovering arguments.\nWe study factorization models inspired by previous work in relation factorization.  \nOur models substantially outperform the generative and agglomerative-clustering counterparts and achieve state-of-the-art performance.", "pdf": "/pdf/L7VOzGWB5hRNGwArs4BJ.pdf", "paperhash": "marcheggiani|autoencoding_for_joint_relation_factorization_and_discovery_from_text", "conflicts": ["isti.cnr.it", "uva.nl"], "authors": ["Diego Marcheggiani", "Ivan Titov"], "authorids": ["marcheggiani@uva.nl", "titov@uva.nl"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "tmdate": null, "cdate": 1456579938379, "ddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "duedate": 1460725200000, "tcdate": 1456579938379, "id": "ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/-/paper/87/review/11", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "reply": {"pdf": null, "forum": "L7VOzGWB5hRNGwArs4BJ", "replyto": "L7VOzGWB5hRNGwArs4BJ", "writers": {"values-regex": "(~.*)|ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/paper/[0-9]+/reviewer/[0-9]+)"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "(~.*)|ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/paper/[0-9]+/reviewer/[0-9]+)", "description": "Your displayed identity associated with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "review": {"order": 2, "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"]}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"]}}}, "invitees": [], "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/paper/87/reviewer/11", "ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "expdate": 1468501200000}}}, {"tddate": null, "number": null, "ddate": null, "cdate": null, "tmdate": 1457660662452, "tcdate": 1457660662452, "id": "p8j4MO1NVCnQVOGWfpJg", "invitation": "ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/-/paper/87/review/10", "forum": "L7VOzGWB5hRNGwArs4BJ", "replyto": "L7VOzGWB5hRNGwArs4BJ", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/paper/87/reviewer/10"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/paper/87/reviewer/10"], "content": {"title": "This paper describes an elegant and general method for unsupervised relation extraction from text.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "review": "In this paper, the authors introduce a new method for unsupervised relation extraction from textual data. In their approach, the relations are treated as latent variables in an auto-encoder like model.\n\nThe proposed model is composed of two parts:\n(1) an encoder, which predicts a relation between two entities, given a sentence that contains these two entities. This encoder is a feature rich discriminative classifier. In the paper, the authors propose to use a log-linear model with handcrafted features. As the authors point out, any discriminative model can be used, as long as the relation posteriors and gradients can be easily computed.\n(2) a decoder, which reconstructs the entities-relation triplet. More precisely, given the relation and one of the entity (and nothing else), the goal of the decoder is to predict the other entity. As for the encoder, many different models can be used as a decoder (e.g. matrix factorization based model). The authors propose to use the RESCAL model.\n\nThe encoder and the decoder are then trained jointly, by minimizing the prediction error of one entity (given the other one) and by marginalizing over the relations. The authors performed experiments on the New York Times corpus, showing that their approach outperforms a generative model for unsupervised relation extraction.\n\nI think that the method described in this paper is interesting, elegant and general (as pointed by the authors, many different models could be used as encoder or decoder). The authors demonstrate on a large dataset (2 millions entity pairs), that their approach is competitive with existing generative models for this task. The paper is clear and well written.
