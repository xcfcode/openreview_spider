The method starts with identifying semantic object classes in an image (with a supervised semantic segmentation network) and then manipulates the network units to study the impact.

If it is, that means for the same object occurring in different images, there will be different network units responsible.

This is an interesting topic, and the authors proposed a simple method that can be used to visualize and understand the internal representations that GAN has learned.\n\nPros: The experimental results are very interesting. For example, by using the proposed approach, one can identify GAN units that match trees, and therefore one can ablate the corresponding units to remove tree, or activate the corresponding units to add tree. The authors also provide many other quantitative results in order to better understand GAN. The provided video link is also very interesting. It provides a kind of controllable manner to manipulate generated images.   \n\n Cons: Though the proposed method looks simple, I find it a little bit difficult for me to follow the details. More clarity is needed.
