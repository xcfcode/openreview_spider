However, there may be some misunderstanding we want to clarify. \n\nSorry for the confusion of our VACN layer with the traditional graph convolutions. We have included some explanations in the introduction section (marked by color blue) to elaborate the key difference between VACN and GNNs. Both the observations and responses for the prediction of graph convolutions are vertex-level variables. On the contrary, the OD flows that we discuss in this paper are generated in the edge space according to our definition, and this is why we introduce a novel CNN architecture \u2018VACN\u2019 to model the adjacency information between edges in a graph. This is the reason that the models proposed in Yu et.al. and Li et.al. are not applicable here. \n\nTo better understand the differences between our proposed VACN over edges of a graph with those convolutions over vertices of a graph such as GCN, we can use the concept of line graphs L(G) with each node in L(G) corresponding to an edge in G. Each individual edge in $L(G)$ can be mapped to a pair of edges in G that share a common vertex. L(G) contains 1/2 [N^3 - N(N-1)], while there are only 1/2N(N-1) in G. Thus, applying GNNs over $L(G)$ is memory intensive. Our edge-based convolution operations VACN is much more efficient.\n\nOn the other hand, we have included mean, variance and confidence intervals for all the experiments and compared different models. We have also included new plots such as Figure 3 in order to demonstrate how the complete LSTOD model outperforms its variants from both local and global perspectives."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper327/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper327/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "Origin-Destination (OD) flow data is an important instrument in transportation studies.

Below are some responses to your concerns.\n\n## P1: Need to simplify notation\nWe have removed the \"m\" and layer \"l\" in Eq2. Moreover, we have rewritten Section 3.1 to more clearly clarify our proposed spatial-level operator and how the connected OD flows contribute to the output representation of the target OD flow. We have also rewritten Sections 3.2 \u2013 3.4 to simplify notation and clarify various definitions. Please refer to the red parts in Sections 3.1-3.4 for more details. \n\n## P2: Name of the convolution operation\nThanks a lot! We have replaced the name \u2018SACN\u2019 by \u2018VACN\u2019 to emphasize the adjacency between OD flows that share common vertices in the graph. \n\n## M1: Complexity analysis missing, scaling could be a problem\nYes, the computational complexity of our proposed VACN is O(N). However, both VACN and standard local CNN are applied to all the N^2 entries in this case. Therefore, when the side length of the CNN filter is in the order O(N^0.5), the total costs of our VACN and standard CNN are also in the same order. Please refer the last paragraph in \u2018ACN VS standard local CNN\u2019 subsection of Section 4.4\n\n## E1: Why not use a 7-day past history?\nThanks a lot! We have now used the same day in the previous 4 weeks for Historical Average instead of previous 5 days. The reduced RMSEs demonstrate that there exists significant long-term periodicity. \n\n## E2: Lack of error bars / uncertainty quantification\nAs suggested, we have added the mean, variance, 25% quantile and 75% quantile of the 14 day-wise RMSEs on the testing set and the results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. We have also included more explanations to these new results, which are marked in red in Section 4. Moreover, we do not use 2.5% and 97.5% here since there are only 14 observations in each sample. We have also added some new plots such as Figure 3 to show how the complete LSTOD model outperforms its variants from both local and global perspectives. More details can be found in Section 4 and Figure 3. \n\n## E3: Why focus only on the N=50 most common cells?\nThe main reason is that the computation complexity and memory cost highly increases as N gets larger since all the compared CNN operators need to be applied N^2 times at each timestamp. On the other hand, the N^2 = 2500 OD flows can cover a sufficient proportion of the total demands (more than 80%) to satisfy the operation requirement of the ride-sharing platform. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper327/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper327/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "Origin-Destination (OD) flow data is an important instrument in transportation studies.

I have concerns that the evaluation doesn't focus enough on application-relevant scenarios (why exclude cells that are not in the top 50? why not use 7-day windows to capture day-of-week effects?), and that the evaluations don't quantify uncertainty (and thus the claimed improvements due to attention may not be significant). The presentation quality of the method details in Sec. 3 needs a significant rewrite to improve clarity. I do think the non-standard convolution operator is a nice idea.\n\nPaper Summary\n-------------\nThis paper addresses the forecasting of origin-destination demand data, with a focus on ride-sharing transportation applications. We assume an urban area has been divided up into N cells (known in advance). The problem is to forecast demand for *directed* rides from cell i to cell j, using historical demand data.\n\nThe paper's first contribution is the design of a convolutional neural net architecture that uses non-rectangular receptive fields more suitable to origin-destination data. Instead of assuming that cells in a given 2D euclidean neighborhood are correlated, it assumes that all journeys that overlap with the one of the cells in the current origin-destination pair are similar. They call this the \"SACN\" architecture.\n\nThe second contribution is developing an \"ST-Conv\" block that combines the above SACN convolution with gated temporal convolutions, so that both space and time can be summarized via convolution operators. A periodically-shifting attention mechanism is further used to measure long-term data's similarities to short-term data and weight accordingly.\n\nOverall, these two ideas (SACN convolutions and ST-Conv blocks with attention) are combined into what they call their Latent Spatio-Temporal Origin-Destination or \"LSTOD\" architecture, which is claimed to be the first to use both short-term and long-term features in prediction.\n\nEvaluation examines demand for ride-sharing in two major cities, A and B (presumably masked because they are proprietary). RMSE error comparing to several classic (e.g. ARIMA) and deep feature learning (e.g. LSTMs and SRCN) baselines, with primary results in Table 1. A few side experiments examine superiority over standard convolutions (Fig 3) and experiments without the attention and long-term bits of the model (Table 2). \n\n\nNovelty & Significance\n-----------------------\nThe current paper is quite niche when it comes to significance; I think it may be a bit too specialized for most ICLR readers. Solving this kind of forecasting problem seems important to ride-sharing applications, but is highly specialized for origin-destination demand data. Would be nice to see the paper attempt to connect to other problems beyond ride-sharing (maybe animal migration? maybe package logistics?).\n\nThat said, I think there's sufficient novelty. The architectural design contributions here do appear new to me (though I don't follow this kind of data closely). \n\n\nMethod Concerns\n------------------\n\n## M1: Complexity analysis missing, scaling could be a problem\n\nWhen comparing the current square receptive field architecture for CNNs with the proposed SACN, I felt there was an opportunity to clarify how both scale with N and other key problem size parameters in terms of number of parameters or execution time. I'm concerned that it will be non-scalable given the O(N) cost in terms of number of parameters and the O(N^2) cost of runtime (you need to execute Eq. 2 for each of the N^2 entries at each layer). I'd like to see some careful breakdown of this compared to other approaches. \n\nExperimental Concerns\n---------------------\n\n## E1: Why not use a 7-day past history?\n\nShouldn't ride share demand have a day-of-week trend? Why wouldn't we use last Sunday's demand to predict this Sunday's demand? I find it quite odd that for the Historical Average baseline, only the last 5 days (rather than last 7) are used, and for the presented method, only the last 3 days are used. I'd be happy to be proven wrong, but I'd guess including a 7-day window would lead to noticeably better results.\n\n## E2: Lack of error bars / uncertainty quantification\n\nA natural question is, can we reliably tell that the difference between (for example) RMSE 2.49 and 2.54 is significant and not noise?  I'd like to see some attempt at quantifying the uncertainty for measurements in Table 1 (perhaps taking each full day in test set as its own \"mini\" test set that produces one RMSE score, then reporting average as well as 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles or something across each day). Without this, I think the claim that attention is useful here is unproven, since the change in performance is so small (less than 0.1 RMSE). \n\n## E3: Why focus only on the N=50 most common cells?\n\nI would think to really assess demand forecasting, you want to know when to task drivers to visit less-common cells. The focus on the cells with only the top 80% of journeys means that 1 of every 5 rides would not be covered by this prediction system. I wonder if part of the reason is that using N much larger than 50 is problematic due to the scaling mentioned earlier.\n\n\nPresentation Concerns\n---------------------\n\n## P1: Need to simplify notation\n\nI found the descriptions of the neural net architecture throughout Sec. 3 quite hard to parse. I think there's an overreliance on math notation and there could be more simple description of high level intent and motivation.\n\nFor example, Eq. 2 could be simplified to avoid the channel \"m\" and layer \"l\" notation and thus let the reader focus on what matters, which is how any part of input A that involves the origin node i or the destination node j is included in the weighted sum.  Words can be used around this to clarify this same operation can happen across channels and layers. \n\nSimilarly, Eq. 3 and Eq. 4 could perhaps be replaced by a good diagram. Currently, Eq. 3 both P and Q are undefined and quite confusing.\n\n## P2: Name of the convolution operation\n\nI'm not sure \"SACN\" is the best name. The receptive field of a standard CNN looks much more \"spatially adjacent\" to me (a compact rectangle surrounding the target cell). Instead, you might call it \"topologically adjacent\" or even something like \"vertex adjacent\". You want to emphasize that you are getting strength by finding all journeys whose start or end overlaps with one of the endpoints of the current journey."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper327/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper327/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "Origin-Destination (OD) flow data is an important instrument in transportation studies.
