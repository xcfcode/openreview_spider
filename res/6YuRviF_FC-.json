The authors consider tree- and neighbourhood-based methods for predicting amplitudes and phases for seven antennas. The results show that the methods perform quite well in terms of RMSE and explained variance.\n\n# Evaluation\n## Strong points\nIt is a timely and interesting application, and it is clear that the field of astronomy holds lots of potential for machine learning applications.\n\n## Weak points\n* From a machine learning point of view, the methods are very simple.\n* The evaluation overall is confusing and somewhat weak. For instance, it is unclear to me whether the competing method, CASA, can be considered as the ground-truth or as a method to outperform.\n* The evaluation based on figures 4 and 5 seem to be done qualitatively.\n\n## Recommendation\nRejection.\n\nThe main reason for my recommendation is that ICLR is not the right venue for this paper. It does not deal with representation learning, and the methods are too basic for a top-tier machine learning conference in general.\nIn addition, the experimental evaluation, which is the main body of the paper, is quite weak and will need significant improvements.\n\n## Detailed feedback\nThe methods considered in the paper (k-NN and tree-based methods) all base their predictions directly on the input features; thus, no representation learning is happening. Thus ICLR is not the right venue, and I doubt the paper would be accepted to a top-tier machine learning conference since it only considers (quite simple) off-the-shelf methods. KDD might be a better fit or an astronomical journal such as PASP.\n\nFurthermore, there seems to be some confusion with regards to what a multi-output regression model is. As described in Borchani et al. (2015), multi-output regression methods also make use of correlations between outputs. It seems the authors are aware of this, as they cite the models' ability to make use of the 'relationships between the targets', which I assume refers to modelling correlations between the output dimensions. However, this is not how the methods used in the paper work. For both k-NN and tree-based methods, there is a clear separation between inputs and outputs, so the paper does not deal with multi-output regression either. This is not a problem per se, however, as it is not clear that a multi-output model would be better suited for the task considered here.\n\nThe paper completely lacks a section on prior work - both regarding related uses of machine learning and different ways to perform calibration.\n\nRegarding the methods, and given that the predictions seem to be part of a time-series, I am not convinced the chosen ones are the most suited for the tasks. It would make sense to test methods from signal processing as well, for instance Gaussian processes or a recurrent neural network like an LSTM.\nThere are also no specific details on how the methods in the paper are constructed. Do they only use the instrumental and environmental sensor data as inputs, or do they use the temporal dimension in some way? Which hyperparameters were adjusted, and how were they selected?\n\nThere is very little information regarding the experimental setup. How large were the training and test sets? What are the dimensionalities of the inputs and outputs? It seems like only one source was considered; why is that? Only testing one source seems brittle. Similarly, was cross-validation used? If not, why? If it was, we need details on how it was set up and what it was used for (hyperparameter tuning, experimental evaluation, etc.).\n\nFor the experimental evaluation, I am confused about whether CASA is considered the ground-truth to compare with, or whether it is a method to outperform. Regardless, would it be possible to evaluate both CASA and your method on simulations to get an idea about how well each performs?\n\nIt also confuses me that antenna 5 is referred to as 'the reference antenna'. In what way was it used as a reference?\n\nFurther to the experimental evaluation, it would make sense to include the performance of a baseline or two, such as linear regression. I would also like to see error bars in figure 3, e.g., from cross-validation.\n\nSince the paper deals with quite simple methods, I would expect some analysis of why they work and when they might fail. In figure 3, especially for the amplitude, some antennas have dramatically larger errors. What happens here? Also, which of inputs were most informative for predicting the phase and amplitude? You could get a feeling for the importances by, e.g., training the models on only one feature, or all features expect one, and repeating this for all features in turn.\n\n# Questions\n1. Why did you choose these particular machine learning methods?\n2. How did you determine which method was the best? From the plots in figure 3, it looks like k-NN is slightly better overall.\n3. Did you perform any cross-validation? If so, where are the error bars in figure 3? If not, why not?\n  1. You mention 'large rms error bars in each model per antenna 3H and 4H'. Which error bars are you referring to?\n4. Are the RMSEs in Figure 3 wrt. the CASA estimations?\n  1. Also, to me (with no background in radio astronomy, though), it seems like a phase error of 0.3-0.4 is quite large (assuming one phase is 2\\pi). How large errors can we expect from CASA?\n\n# Suggestions for improvement\n* Evaluate more than one calibration source. Without more sources, we can't be sure if your method performs consistently well.\n* Figures 4 and 5: it might be useful to see instead residuals between your method and what you consider ground-truth.\n\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3194/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3194/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ZCal: Machine learning methods for calibrating radio interferometric data ", "authorids": ["~Simphiwe_Zitha1", "aka.bhagya@gmail.com", "osmirnov@gmail.com", "risunawisdom@gmail.com"], "authors": ["Simphiwe Zitha", "Arun aniyan", "Oleg Smirnov", "Risuna Nkolele"], "keywords": ["Radio astronomy", "Calibration", "Radio interferometry", "ska", "kat-7", "MeerKat"], "abstract": "Calibration is the most critical data processing step needed for generating images of high dynamic range \\citep{editioncasa}. With ever-increasing data volumes produced by modern radio telescopes \\cite{aniyan2017classifying}, astronomers are overwhelmed by the amount of data that needs to be manually processed and analyzed using limited computational resources \\citep{yatawatta2020stochastic}. Therefore, intelligent and automated systems are required to overcome these challenges. Traditionally, astronomers use a package such as Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) to compute the gain solutions based on regular observations of a known calibrator source \\citep{thompson2017interferometry} \\citep{abebe2015study} \\citep{grobler2016calibration} \\citep{editioncasa}. The traditional approach to calibration is iterative and time-consuming \\citep{jajarmizadeh2017optimal}, thus, the proposal of machine learning techniques. The applications of machine learning have created an opportunity to deal with complex problems currently encountered in radio astronomy data processing \\citep{aniyan2017classifying}. In this work, we propose the use of supervised machine learning models to first generation calibration (1GC), using the KAT-7 telescope environmental and pointing sensor data recorded during observations. Applying machine learning to 1GC, as opposed to calculating the gain solutions in CASA, has shown evidence of reducing computation, as well as accurately predicting the 1GC gain solutions and antenna behaviour. These methods are computationally less expensive, however they have not fully learned to generalise in predicting accurate 1GC solutions by looking at environmental and pointing sensors. We use an ensemble multi-output regression models based on random forest, decision trees, extremely randomized trees and K-nearest neighbor algorithms. The average prediction error obtained during the testing of our models on testing data is $ \\approx 0.01 < rmse < 0.09$ for gain amplitude per antenna, and $0.2 rad < rmse <0.5 rad$ for gain phase. This shows that the instrumental parameters used to train our model strongly correlate with gain amplitude effects than a phase.\n", "one-sentence_summary": "Machine learning as a calibration tool for radio interferometric data", "pdf": "/pdf/480c948902c97e3f8e1c8304a8db1b1de8020e2a.pdf", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "zitha|zcal_machine_learning_methods_for_calibrating_radio_interferometric_data", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=MBfsoZSL-g", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nzitha2021zcal,\ntitle={{\\{}ZC{\\}}al: Machine learning methods for calibrating radio interferometric data },\nauthor={Simphiwe Zitha and Arun aniyan and Oleg Smirnov and Risuna Nkolele},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=6YuRviF_FC-}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
