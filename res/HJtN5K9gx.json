In particular, our formulation allows us to handle different\nparts of the model being observed for different data points.\n\nFor example, in the experiment with intrinsic faces (Section 4.2), some labelled\ndata points could each have only lighting as their observed variables, and some\nothers only identity.\n\nHaving to reformulate each such case to recover the minimal version is a tedious\nand potentially unnecessary process, when instead one can have this happen\nautomatically.\n\n> [...] experiments show a large deviation in these two methods' results\n> [...] give a possible explanation on the superiority of their method\n\nThe MNIST results are marginally lower that the comparison largely due to our\nuse of the plug-in estimator. The comparison marginalises out the discrete label\nvariable when unsupervised.\n\nThe SVHN results are better than the comparison due to our use of CNNs for the\nrecognition (convolutional) and generative (deconvolutional) networks in\ncontrast to using (multi-stage M1+M2) MLPs.\n\n> if the experimental setup is the same [...] for the results [...] not clear\n> if Kingma et al. do the same\n\nThe experiment setup is the same as the M2 model from Kingma et.al 2014 for the\nMNIST dataset. That is, we go directly from data to latents and back to data.\nFor the SVHN dataset, we compare against the M1+M2 model (since that is the only\nmodel reported for that dataset), but we don't do the preprocessing steps of PCA\nwhitening and learning the M1 model that they do with MLPs.\n\nInstead, we directly employ a CNN as a feature learner, and simultaneously learn\na classifier with it.\n\n> [...] comparison with Jampani et al. 2015 [...] is that model also using the\n> same rate of supervision for a fair comparison?\n\nThe comparison with Jampani et al. 2015 is not equal as they employ\n*fully-supervised* learning. We in contrast, only use a fraction of available\nlabels to perform semi-supervised learning.\n\n> Moreover, from the intro I expected to see a more general approximation\n> scheme for the variational posterior (similar to Ranganath et al. 2015 which\n> truly allows very flexible distributions), however this is not the case\n> here.\n\nUnless we misunderstand the reviewer\u2019s point, our formulation is indeed general\nenough to represent a wide variety of models, including control-flow structures\nlike if-then-else, folds, and loops. We can express the model indicated in\nRanganath et al. 2015 (Figure 1, right) using the constructs in our domain\nspecific language. Maybe the reviewer could clarify in what sense the model\ndescribed by Ranganath et al. could be seen as more flexible?\n\nThe exposition in the manuscript talks about a particular simple factorisation\nof the approximation q(z,y|x) as q(y|x) and q(z|y,x), in order to separate the\nobserved and unobserved variables. However, nothing in the formulation requires\nthe factorisation to be exactly this. In fact, z, y, and x can all be viewed as\nmultivariate, with dependencies between the dimensions.\n\nIndeed the experiments incorporate much richer factorisations.\n\n> Minor note: three of Kingma's papers are all cited in the main text as Kingma\n> et al. 2014, causing confusion.

It is of course true that the prior on latent\nvariables has no (or minimal, in the case of multi-MNIST) structure. It is\nhowever not clear whether such structure in the prior is necessary, since the\nneural network that approximates the generative model can capture correlations\nand dependencies between variables. Our results show that dependency structures\nin the recognition networks (Figures 3, 6, and 8) help capture the complex\ndependencies which occur in the true model posterior.

Title change\n\n     We changed the title to\n     \t``Learning Disentangled Representations in Deep Generative Models''\n     to better reflect the contributions of the submission.\n\n  b. Clarification for 'structure'\n\n     We realise that the term 'structure' can have multiple meanings, even\n     within the confines of graphical and generative models.\n\n     Our use of the term is intended to refer to the (arbitrary) dependencies\n     one would like to employ in the recognition model, particularly in regard\n     to there being consistent 'interpretable' semantics of what the variables\n     in the model represent.\n\n     We have updated the abstract and the introduction (Section 1, end) in the\n     manuscript making this clarification and removing extraneous instances.\n\n- Relation to Kingma.et.al 2014 [1]\n\n  We would like to note here that we do not simply reformulate the\n  semi-supervised work in [1]. Our formulation is not a trivial extension of\n  [1], rather, it allows us to extend semi-supervised learning to a broader\n  class of latent-variable models.\n  We list below the important distinctions:\n\n  a. Continuous-domain semi-supervision\n\n     We can handle partial labels for continuous random variables, not just\n     discrete ones. In this case, the factorisation in Eqn 4 corresponds to a\n     *regressor* instead of a classifier. The work in [1] requires\n     marginalization over the partially-observed variable\u2019s support in the\n     unsupervised case, which means that latent variables must in practice be\n     discrete.\n\n     Indeed we make use of continuous latent variables in the Faces experiment\n     (Section 4.2), where the lighting is a partially supervised 3-dimensional\n     Gaussian random variable.\n\n  b. Scaling the classifier term\n\n     The formulation in Eqn 4 naturally incorporates the classifier term, as\n     opposed to a separate fixed hyper-parameter (alpha, in Eqn 9 in [1]) that\n     controls the contribution of the classifier term in the objective. \n\n     This makes the formulation more flexible and general purpose for different\n     factorisations of the variational approximations used.\n\n  c. Framework for  implementation of models\n\n     As pointed out by the reviewers, our formulation allows for easy automated\n     implementation of a wide variety of models. This is in the same spirit as a\n     number of approaches such as Automatic Differentiation (AD) and\n     Probabilistic Program inference, where the choice of a particular means of\n     representation enables ease of automation for a great variety of different\n     cases.\n\n     The ease with which one can describe even minimally complex models, such as\n     that employed for the Multi-MNIST experiments, is shown in the Appendix.\n\n  d. Semi-supervised learning on varying subsets of variables\n\n     A particular benefit of the automation mentioned above, is that we derive\n     the ability to partially supervise any subset of variables, regardless of\n     type.

From a methodological point of view, there is nothing fundamentally novel (it is very similar to the semi-supervised work of Kingma et al; although this work has sometimes more than two latent nodes, it is not a complex extension). There is a fairly classical auxiliary variable trick used to make sure the inference network for y is trained over all data points (by supposing y is in fact is a latent variable with an observation \\tilde y; the observation is y if y is observed, or uninformative for unobserved y). Alternatively, one can separate the inference used to learn the generative model (which throws out inference over y if it is observed), from an inference used to 'exercise' the model (approximate the complex p(y|x) in the model by a simpler q(y|x) - effectively inferring the target p(y|x) for the data where only x is collected). Results are strong, although on simple datasets. Overall this is a well written, interesting paper, but lacking in terms of methodological advances.\n\nMinor:\n- I feel the title is a bit too general for the content of the paper. I personally don't agree with the strong contrast made between deep generative models and graphical models (deep generative models are graphical models, but they are more typically learned and un-interpretable than classical graphical models; and having multiple stochastic variables is not exclusive to graphical models, see DRAW, Deep Kalman Filter, Recurrent VAE, etc.). The word 'structure' is a bit problematic; here, the paper seems more concerned with disentangling and semanticizing the latent representation of a generative model by supervision.

From the experiment results it seems that these terms do not do much as the new formulation and the performance difference between the proposed method and Kingma et al. 2014 are not very significant (Figure 5).  Therefore the benefit of the new formulation is likely to be just software engineering flexibility and convenience.\n\nThis flexibility and convenience is nice to have, but it is better to demonstrate a few situations where the proposed method can be applied while for other previous methods it is non-trivial to do.\n\nThe paper's title and the way it is written make me expect a lot more than what is currently in the paper.  I was expecting to see, for example, structured hidden variable model for the posterior (page 4, top), or really \"structured interpretation\" of the generative model (title), but I didn't see any of these.

The authors present a way of introducing structure (observed variables) inside the recognition network.\n\nI find that the presentation of the inference with auxiliary variables could be avoided, as it actually makes the presentation unnecessarily complicated. Specifically, the expressions with auxiliary variables are helpful for devising a unified implementation, but modeling-wise one can get the same model without these auxiliary variables and recover a minimal extension of VAE where part of the generating space is actually observed. The observed variables mean that the posterior needs to also condition on those, so as to incorporate the information they convey. The way this is done in this paper is actually not very different from Kingma et al. 2014, and I am surprised that the experiments show a large deviation in these two methods' results. Given the similarity of the models, it'd be useful if the authors could give a possible explanation on the superiority of their method compared to Kingma et al. 2014. By the way, I was wondering if the experimental setup is the same as in Kingma et al. 2014 for the results of Fig. 5 (bottom) - the authors mention that they use CNNs for feature extraction but from the paper it's not clear if Kingma et al. do the same. \n\nOn a related note, I was wondering the same for the comparison with Jampani et al. 2015. In particular, is that model also using the same rate of supervision for a fair comparison?\n\nThe experiment in section 4.3 is interesting and demonstrates a useful property of the approach.\n\nThe discussion of the supervision rate (and the pre-review answer) is helpful in giving some insight about what is a successful training protocol to use in semi-supervised learning.\n\nOverall, the paper is interesting but the title and introduction made me expect something more from it. From the title I expected a method for interpreting general deep generative models, instead the described approach was about a semi-supervised variant of VAE - naturally including labelled examples disentangles the latent space, but this is a general property of any semi-supervised probabilistic model and not unique to the approach described here. Moreover, from the intro I expected to see a more general approximation scheme for the variational posterior (similar to Ranganath et al. 2015  which trully allows very flexible distributions), however this is not the case here.\n\nGiven the above, the contributions of this paper are in defining a slight variant of the semi-supervised VAE, and (perhaps more importantly) formulating it in a way that is amendable to easier automation in terms of software. But methodologically there is not much contribution to the current literature. The authors mention that they plan to extend the framework in the probabilistic programming setting. It seems indeed that this would be a very promising and useful extension. \n\nMinor note: three of Kingma's papers are all cited in the main text as Kingma et al. 2014, causing confusion.

This is similar to the formulation in Sohn et.al. 2015.\n\nb.\n\nThe auxilliary-variable formulation enables a unified implementation that handles the different cases by separating out *where* the value for a label/interpretable latent comes from in the estimation.\n\nWhen supervised, the label is given and is scored against q(y|x), and when unsupervised, the label is sampled from q(y|x), along with it's associated score. However, for the rest of the latent variables, the conditional elbo is computed without regard to where the value y_i came from.\n\nIn our framework, we can handle this by having the stochastic computation graph simply mark variables as observed or not, and automatically factor the distribution over latents into its supervised and unsupervised factors.\n\nc.\n\nThe use of a \"supervision-rate\" is not necessarily something only our model allows.\nFor example, the setup in Kingma et.al. 2014 could be modified such that for a dataset of size D (with D_s elements supervised) instead of partitioning the supervised data over all the minibatches, effectively drawing a fixed proportion (D_s/D), *without replacement*, it could draw *with replacement* from D_s to fill any requisite proportion r of a minibatch.\nOur particular formulation is a consequence of the fact that our minibatches consist of wholly supervised or unsupervised data instead of having each minibatch be mixed.\n\nPractically, the rate controls how well one learns the generative and recognition-network parameters under interpretability constraints.\nFor a given (small) labelled set, full supervision, i.e always observing only the labelled data, can overfit even though it learns a disentangled representation. Conversely, no-supervision can avoid overfitting to generalise well, but loses out on interpretability.\nFor a fixed-size labelled set, the rate helps explore the spectrum between these two cases by adjusting how many times one observed a particular labelled data point.\n\nd.\n\nThanks for pointing it out and apologies for the omission!\nWe updated the manuscript to include a sentence on which estimator we use for our experiments.\n\nFor the particular experiments run for the manuscript, we used the plug-in estimator where applicable (discrete latent variables).\nHowever, our framework (the torch library) has the ability to use any of the three kinds (REINFORCE, marginalise, plug-in) of estimators through the use of appropriate modelling primitives.\n\nWe use the plug-in estimator because it's computationally cheaper than both REINFORCE and marginalisation, requiring just a single sample to estimate, and also, performs comparably to both the other methods qualitatively (quite a bit better than REINFORCE with a few samples)."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Learning Disentangled Representations in Deep Generative Models", "abstract": "Deep generative models provide a powerful and flexible means to learn complex distributions over data by incorporating neural networks into latent-variable models.
