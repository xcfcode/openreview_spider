However, even without this assumption, a zero regularizer value implies equal marginal distributions and convergence in CMD implies convergence in distribution of the marginals.\nThat is, we don\u2019t need the independence assumption for the application of our method but for guaranteeing some metrical and convergence properties w.r.t. the joint distributions. In the new version of our paper, we added a detailed description of the properties that are obtained with the independence assumption and the properties that are obtained without the independence assumption.\n\nThe question about the higher numbers of hidden units (>10.000) is very interesting and we consider the answer as future work.\n\nThe absolute value of a central moment ck(X) of a distribution is smaller than the absolute central moment (proof of proposition 1). For this absolute central moment there exists an upper bound (Egozcue et al., 2012). For distributions on the interval [0,1], this bound is decreasing with increasing moment order. That is, for random variables on [0,1], the absolute values of the higher central moments have a small upper bound.\nIn order to guarantee distributions on [0,1] we introduce the normalization factor 1/|b-a|^k in the CMD metric, where [a,b] is the interval of the activation functions. This is equivalent to dividing the activations by their maximum range. Please note that we restrict our method on bounded activation functions. Unbounded activations need to be clipped or normalized to be bounded.\n\nWe removed figure 3 as it is hardly interpretable and it does not contain any additional information not contained elsewhere.\n\nIndeed, also the sixth and the seventh central moment are related to geometrical properties (hyperskewness, hyperflatness). K=5 is heuristically set a priori large enough to capture rich geometrical information (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis), and small enough to be computationally efficient. However, the experiments in subsection Parameter Sensitivity show that similar results are obtained for K>=6.

The biggest limitation I can see with the proposed method is the assumption that the hidden activations are independently distributed. For example, this assumption will clearly be violated for the hidden activations of convolutional layers, where neighboring activations are dependent. I guess this is why the authors start with the output of dense layers for the image dataset. Do the authors have insight on if it is beneficial to start adaptation from lower level? If so, do the authors have insight on how to relax the assumption? In these scenarios, if MMD has an advantage as it does not make this assumption? \n\nFigure 3 does not seems to clearly support the boost of performance shown in table 2.

Compared to a more well-known variant, MMD, CMD has the benefit of not over penalizing the mean, and therefore can focus more on the shape of distribution around the center.\n\nIn terms of discriminative power (the ability to tell two distributions apart), MMD and CMD should be equivalent, but in practice I can understand that CMD may be better as MMD tries to match the raw moments which may over penalize data that are not zero centered.\n\nIn the paper CMD is used only up to Kth order, and not all the central moments are used, but rather only the diagonal entries are considered in the CMD objective, I think this is mostly motivated for computation efficiency.  A natural comparison with MMD therefore can be made, by also explicitly include raw moments up to Kth order.  Another thing to compare against is to include all moments, not just the diagonal terms, in the objective.  This is computationally expensive, but can be done for e.g. 1st and 2nd orders.\n\nSince the experiments only compare CMD in the above form with kernelized MMD, the claim that explicit moment matching is helpful is not very well supported.  To make this a solid claim CMD should be compared against MMD with explicit raw moments.\n\nThe claim that the kernel parameter in MMD is hard to tune and CMD does not have such parameters only applies to kernel MMD, not explicit MMD.  For kernel MMD, there are also studies on how to set these parameters, for example:\n\nSriperumbudur et al.  Kernel choice and classifiability for rkhs embeddings of probability distributions.\nGretton et al.  A kernel two-sample test.\n\nand also using multiple kernels (Li et al. 2015) which removes the need to tune them.  Tuning the beta directly like done in this paper is usually not the way MMD is tuned.  At least simple heuristics like dividing |x-y|^2 by dimensionality or mean pairwise distance first should be applied first before trying beta in the way done in this paper.\n\nOverall I think CMD could be better than MMD, and could have applications in many domains.  But it also has the problem of not easily kernelizable (you can argue this both ways though).  The experiments demonstrating that CMD is better could be done more convincinly.\n\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Central Moment Discrepancy (CMD) for Domain-Invariant Representation Learning", "abstract": "The learning of domain-invariant representations in the context of domain adaptation with neural networks is considered.

This paper gives an additional method along the scoring rules direction that uses the matching of central moments to match two probability distributions. The technique is simple, and in the case of domain adaptation, highly effective.\n\nCMD seems like a very nice and straightforward solution to the domain adaptation problem. The method is computationally straightforward to implement, and seems quite stable with respect to the tuning parameters when compared to MMD. I was skeptical reading through this, especially given the fact that you only use K=5 in your experiments, but the results seem quite good. The natural question that I have now is: how will this method do in training generative models? This is beyond the scope of this paper, but it\u2019s the lowest hanging fruit.\n\nBelow I give more detailed feedback.\n\nOne way to speed up MMD is to use a random Fourier basis as was done in \u201cFastmmd: Ensemble of circular discrepancy for efficient two-sample test\u201d by Zhao and Meng, 2015. There are also linear time estimators, e.g., in \u201cA Kernel Two-Sample Test\u201c by Gretton et al., 2012. I don\u2019t think you need to compare against these approaches since you compare to the full MMD, but they should be cited.\n\nThe paper \u201cGenerative Models and Model Criticism via Optimized Maximum Mean Discrepancy\u201d by Sutherland et al. submitted to ICLR 2017 as well, discusses techniques for optimizing the kernel used in MMD and is worth citing in section 3.\n\nHow limiting is the assumption that the distribution has independent marginals?\n\nThe sample complexity of MMD depends heavily on the dimensionality of the input space - do you have any intuitions about the sample complexity of CMD? It seems like it's relatively insensitive based on the results in Figure 4, but I would be surprised if this were the case with 10,000 hidden units. I mainly ask this because with generative models, the output space can be quite high-dimensional.\n\nI\u2019m concerned that the central moments won\u2019t be numerically stable at higher orders when backpropagating. This doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem in the experimental results, but perhaps the authors could comment a bit on this? I\u2019m referring to the fact that ck(X) can be very large for k >= 3. Proposition 1 alleviates my concerns that the overall objective is unstable, I\u2019m referring specifically to the individual terms within.\n\nFigure 3 is rather cluttered, and aside from the mouse class it\u2019s not clear to me from the visualization that the CMD regularizer is actually helping. It would be useful to remove some of the classes for the purpose of visualization.\n\nI would like some clarification about the natural geometric interpretations of K=5. Do you mean that the moments up to K=5 have been well-studied? Do you have any references for this? Why does K >= 6 not have a natural geometric interpretation?\n\nFigure 4 should have a legend", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Central Moment Discrepancy (CMD) for Domain-Invariant Representation Learning", "abstract": "The learning of domain-invariant representations in the context of domain adaptation with neural networks is considered.

This answer is underpinned by a new experiment in subsection Parameter Sensitivity. Please note that this experiment additionally shows that the default setting (\\lambda=1, K=5) of the CMD is applicable independently of the number of hidden nodes.\n\nQ2) Will more data be required to estimate the central moments when the number of hidden nodes are large?\nNo, as we compute the central moments for each hidden node (activation coordinate) separately. That is, the introduction of new nodes defines new central moments. Each central moment estimation is based on all input examples. We formulated a statement about the effect of more data: The replacement of the expected value with the empirical expectation creates a consistent estimator of the CMD metric. That is, by increasing the number of input examples, the resulting approximation of the CMD metric converges in probability to the true CMD metric. This can be proven by the joint application of the weak law of large numbers (Billingsley, 2008) with the continuous mapping theorem (Billingsley, 2013). For clarification, we added this statement, the proof sketch and some words on the activation coordinates with the last revisions. \n\nQ3) Has MMD an advantage in the case of more hidden nodes?\nIn terms of computational complexity, MMD has a clear disadvantage. MMD needs O(N(n^2+mn+m^2+1)) arithmetic operations to be computed whereas CMD needs only O(N(n+m+1)) operations, with N being the number of hidden nodes, n being the number of source samples and m being the number of target samples. That is, the computation time increase, induced by increasing N, is higher for the MMD.\nIn terms of parameter sensitivity, the new experiments show that the default setting (\\lambda=1, K=5) of the CMD can also be used for higher number of hidden nodes, whereas the MMD needs additional parameter tuning steps. Please note that the parameter tuning process for the Gaussian kernel parameter of the MMD is sophisticated since no labels are available in the target domain. The tuning of the Gaussian kernel parameter is even complicated if labels are available (Chih-Wei Hsu, 2003).\nIn terms of prediction accuracy, some state-of-the-art networks with weighted sums of different Gaussian kernels and large number of hidden nodes, see e.g. Long et al., 2015 with 4096 hidden nodes and fine-tuning of AlexNet, show lower classification accuracy on the Office data set compared to our CMD networks (subsection Results).\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Central Moment Discrepancy (CMD) for Domain-Invariant Representation Learning", "abstract": "The learning of domain-invariant representations in the context of domain adaptation with neural networks is considered.

Due to the low classification accuracy of MMD5-based networks and the recommended paper length of 9 pages, we did not include the results in our paper.\n\nQ2) Computation cost.\nWe compute the N-dimensional central moments vector as E((X-E(X))^k) with E(.) being the N-dimensional expectation vector. That is, for each k we compute only N scalar central moments, one for each dimension. The differences ||E((X-E(X))^k)-E((Y-E(Y))^k)|| of the source activations X and the target activations Y are then aggregated and minimized.
