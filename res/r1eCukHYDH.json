See below for more details.\n\nThe authors propose a GAN architecture that aims to align the latent representations of the GAN with different interpretable degrees of freedom of the underlying data (e.g., size, pose).  While the text, motivation, and experiments are fairly clear, there are some spelling/grammar mistakes throughout, and the draft could use a solid pass for overall clarity.\n\nWhile the idea of using the log trace covariance as a regularizer for the manifold is certainly interesting, it seems fairly incremental upon previous work (i.e., DMWGAN).  Even modulo the work being incremental, I still have concerns regarding the comparison to baselines/overall impact, and thus I suggest a Weak Rejection.\n\nTable 1 seems to indicate that the author's proposed method is on par with or worse than every method compared against except for 3D chair (bright).  Additionally, the lack of comparison against DMWGAN for every task (except the first) is a bit concerning, considering its similarity to the proposed method.

We would like to resolve the concerns by analyzing Table 1 in detail, but before that, we invite you to see the qualitative results from Figure H.6 in Appendix H for the better discussion.\n\nBy comparing (a) and (c) of Figure J.8, we can clearly see the superior performance of MLA-GAN over DMWGAN (Note the samples are arranged in the same manner as Figure 3.). Column-wise, we see the samples share the same smooth features (e.g., stroke, slant) in MLA-GAN, but this is not the case at all in DMWGAN. Row-wise, we see the generators of MLA-GAN present distinct digit manifolds with a clean separation, whereas the generators of DMWGAN present manifolds involving a few crossovers between the digits; this is likely because the generators of MLA-GAN are enforced to share the smooth features, driving more regular manifold structures in all the generators.\n\nFrom these clear differences and benefits, we disagree that MLA-GAN is incremental to DMWGAN. Most of all, our principal objective was not only the multi-manifold learning but also the manifold alignment, but DMWGAN cannot perform the manifold alignment, as illustrated in Figure 1 and discussed in Section 3. Also, we would like to emphasize that the generalizability of MLA-GAN to an untrained manifold, demonstrated in the style-transfer experiments, is another very distinct property of MLA-GAN over other models.\n\nThat being said, we agree that Table 1 is lacking information about DMWGAN. We are currently running the experiments, and we assure you that all the unfilled scores will be reported in a couple of days (The reason that we did not report the disentanglement scores at first was that the DMWGAN has almost nothing to do with the manifold alignment).\n\nYour last concern about Table 1 was that the disentanglement scores of our model are inferior to that of $\\beta$-VAE. But as we have pointed out in Section 4.2, the manifold learning performance (FID) of $\\beta$-VAE is far worse than our model (see also, Figure J.8 (e) and Figure J.9 (b)). We emphasize that the FID and the disentanglement scores should be simultaneously considered to evaluate the MLA task, and MLA-GAN is showing the best performance in that regard. \n\nTypos and grammatical errors: We have fixed the most, if not all. We will review the text more thoroughly and revise it before submitting the final version.\n\n== Minor Edit ==\nWe updated some of the appendix-figure indices in this comment, since they are changed as we add more figures in the revised manuscript.

Our formulation is indeed not the most general one that meets the consistency of encoders. However, we would like to note that this does not substantially restrict the expressiveness of our model as we use multiple layers. Although the top linear layer would only produce a set of parallel manifolds, the following nonlinear activation bends or folds the manifolds at different points. Processed similarly by the rest of the linear and nonlinear layers, the resulting manifolds in the bottom layer are much more complex than just being parallel to each other.\n\nNevertheless, it is true that intersecting manifolds are hard to be represented by our model, as you pointed out. In practice, however, the intersecting manifolds are successfully learned in the form of manifolds with small gaps at the intersecting points. You can observe this in Zap50k results in Figure 3, the fourth column from the right, \"the high heels.\" Although each of the four manifolds presents a different class of shoes, they seem to intersect near the high heels, and our model shows no difficulty in modeling such an intersection (except the intersection could have been approximated as a small gap)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1823/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1823/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Manifold Learning and Alignment with Generative Adversarial Networks", "authors": ["Jiseob Kim", "Seungjae Jung", "Hyundo Lee", "Byoung-Tak Zhang"], "authorids": ["jkim@bi.snu.ac.kr", "sjjung@bi.snu.ac.kr", "hdlee@bi.snu.ac.kr", "btzhang@bi.snu.ac.kr"], "keywords": ["Generative Adversarial Networks", "Manifold Learning", "Manifold Alignment"], "TL;DR": "We present a generative adversarial network that performs both multi-manifold learning and manifold alignment, utilizing the abstraction ability of encoder architecture.

We would like to address the points one by one.\n\n1. We agree that the number of generators ($A$) is one of the crucial factors in modeling. In fact, the number of classes in the dataset is not the optimal number, but only a reasonable number for $A$. In this regard, we conducted additional experiments with MNIST using different $A$'s, as shown in Figure F.3. It can be seen that our model, regardless of the different $A$ values, performs consistently better than the baseline WGAN model. Interestingly, $A=10$ was not the best setting for MNIST; it was $A=25$. This suggests a need for learning $A$ from data, but we think this is beyond our current scope, as discussed in Sec. 2.3.2.\n\n2. This is a very good point. Although the original purpose of sharing weights in MADGAN was to avoid redundant computations, it is definitely worth checking if this design contributes to the manifold alignment. We are working on reproducing the MADGAN experiments, and we will report the results in a few days.\n\n3. Good point. Note the current version already includes the results for $\\lambda=0$ (see Table 1 and Appendix G). We will add the results for different $\\lambda$'s and $\\mu$'s soon.\n\n4. As the generators of DMWGAN are not at all correlated to each other, we initially thought that showing the manifold-alignment performance of DMWGAN makes little sense. We will report these scores, both for MNIST and 3D-Chair, in a couple of days (InfoGAN scores are filled now).\n\nTypos: We have fixed the typos, if not all.

A paper demonstrates a clear motivation and a working solution for the problem. Experiments are convincing.\n\nThe only question is that the regularization term forces something stronger than just consistency of encoders.

The method utilizes a special regularizer to guide the training. It has been empirically well tested on a multi-manifold learning task, manifold alignment, feature disentanglement, and style transfer.\nOverall, this is an interesting idea with a motivated approach, however, I would like several points to be addressed before I could increase a score.\n1. It seems that the method makes direct use of the number of classes in the datasets used. How would it fare compared to other models when the number of manifolds is not known (e.g. CelebA dataset)?\n2. In MADGAN (Ghosh et al., 2017) generators share first layers which possibly makes them not independent as claimed in the paper, thus it is worth checking if MADGAN exhibits any kind of manifold alignment and could be a baseline for disentanglement with multiple generators.\n3. There are hyperparameters \\lambda and \\mu for the regularizers in the model. It would be helpful to study their effect of different values on the training and encoding.\n4.
