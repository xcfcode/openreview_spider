Proposed an algorithm for learning robust local features.\n2. Demonstrated that learning robust local features is effective to improve the robustness of the model.\nThe possible downside is\n3.

Following your constructive suggestion, we have performed revision in the conclusion section.\n\nIn this work, in order to explore the relationship between the generalization of adversarial training and the robust local features, we advocate for exploring robust local features by reducing the impact of global information, which is necessary to validate our main hypothesis in this work. However, as you indicated, it does not mean that the global information is useless, as the global information is useful for some tasks, e.g. as you suggested, answering \"How many apples in the image\".\n\nWe agree that training a robust model that can capture both global and local information will be an important direction. From a methodological standpoint, the discovered relationship may also serve as an inspiration for new adversarial defenses, where not only the robust local features but also the global information is taken into account. One way of introducing the global information would be through adding the term of \"adversarial training on original adversarial examples\", whereas it is beyond the scope of our main theme (i.e., on the relationship between the generalization of adversarial training and the robust local features) in this work. These questions are indeed worth investigation in future work, and we hope that our observations on the benefit of robust local features will inspire more future development.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper291/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper291/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["cbsong@hust.edu.cn", "brooklet60@hust.edu.cn", "jdlin@hust.edu.cn", "wanglw@cis.pku.edu.cn", "jeh@cs.cornell.edu"], "title": "Robust Local Features for Improving the Generalization of Adversarial Training", "authors": ["Chuanbiao Song", "Kun He", "Jiadong Lin", "Liwei Wang", "John E.

We have revised our paper accordingly.\n\nA1. This suggestion is great and realistic, which focuses more on the adversarial robustness in the physical world. In Section 4.3, LOSS SENSITIVITY UNDER DISTRIBUTION SHIFT, we replace the \u201cuniform noise addition\u201d to the \u201cbrightness perturbation\u201d. We adopt the brightness perturbation with varied daylight intensity, and present the results in Table 2a in the revision. We observe that, as compared to PGDAT and TRADES, both RLFAT_P and RLFAT_T show lower gradients of the models on different data distributions, which we can directly attribute to the robust local features.\n\n\nA2. We report the running time of 400 iterations of training for RLFL_p with or without line 7, on a single Titan X GPU.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Dataset\t|     RLFL_p     | RLFL_p without line 7  |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n| STL-10\t        |\t681s\t|\t680s\t                   |\n| CIFAR-10\t|\t720s\t|\t719s\t                   |\n| CIFAR-100\t|\t541S\t|\t540s\t                   |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe see that the computational cost is mainly concentrated on the generation of adversarial examples and the optimization of the loss function, and the cost of RBS transformation is negligible in the total computational cost.\n\n\nA3. Thanks for introducing the multiple instance setting [1]. Multiple instance setting usually combines the features of different instances in a bag, where the instances share the label of the original image.\n\nThe similarity between the two is that the original image need to be split into several blocks or patches. But intrinsically they are different. First, the goal of multiple instance learning (MIL) is to reduce the effect of noisy labels introduced by data augmentation, whereas the goal of our approach is to explore the robust local features. Second, MIL has a large computational cost, as MIL has multiple input instances in the bag. In contrast, the cost of RBS can be ignored. Third, our objective function differs to MIL that considers the probabilities of the instances, which is more like an ensemble learning. While our approach utilizes the random shuffled blocks as a whole to learn the robust local features. \n\n[1] Multiple Instance Learning Convolutional Neural Networks for Object Recognition.

We have performed the corresponding revisions based on your constructive suggestions. And our responses to your concerns are as follows: \n\n\nA1. We have strengthened the motivation of the feature transfer term in the revision, Section 3.2: \u201cSince the type of input images in the training phase and the inference phase is different (RBS transformed images for training, versus original images for inference), we consider to transfer the knowledge of the robust local features learned by RBSAT to the normal adversarial examples.\u201d With this purpose, we insert the feature transfer term in the objective function.\n\nIn this work, we advocate for learning the robust local features. The difference of \"minimizing the loss on original PGD image\" and \"the feature transfer term\" is the supervised information. Instead of using our proposed feature transfer term, if we directly minimize the loss on the original PGD images, the supervised information is the true label of the images. But as [1] suggests, then the model might explore the global structural features. In contrast, our term uses the robust local feature representation learned from RBS adversarial training as the supervised information for the original PGD images.\n\n\nA2. Sorry for the confusion, and we will try to explain as follows:\n\nReproducing the results with our released codes might provide more intuitive understanding on the performance. Our code builds on the code framework of Madry\u2019s. To make an apples-to-apples comparison, we re-implement the loss function of TRADES with Tensorflow, and use the same training hyper-parameters for all the methods. The implementation code and all the models are released with the submission. \n\n(a)\tThe difference of performance for PGDAT:\n\nThe iteration step of PGD in Madry's paper is set to 7. For CIFAR10, following the settings in TRADES, the iteration step of PGD to generate adversarial examples is set to 10 in our paper, as we want to use the same parameters for all methods for a fair comparison. In the literature, many researchers also use different steps like 10 [2], or 20 [3] for PGD, as long as they keep the same parameters for all methods. Using 10 indicates that we have a stronger training but at the same time a stronger attack that may reduce the robust accuracy. \n\n(b)\tThe difference of performance for TRADES:\n\nFor TRADES, the authors reported the \u2018best\u2019 result of 1/\u03bb=6 rather than the \u2018mean\u2019 result of 1/\u03bb=6. Our result (50.95%, 1/\u03bb=6\uff09is slightly higher than the mean result (50.64%) of 1/\u03bb=5 in TRADES\u2019s paper (Table 4). The mean robust accuracy increases slowly by the increasing of 1/\u03bb. Thus, we think the mean result of 1/\u03bb=6 is supposed to be slight higher than 50.64%, which is close to our result of 50.95%. \n\n \nA3. Local features are like the local texture and local edges of the object in an image, while global features are like the global shape of the object and some details are ignored. \n\nLocal features seems to be well-generalized on unseen shape variation [4] but less robust against adversarial perturbation. We use RBS transformation to break up the global structure information of the adversarial images, and training on the reshuffled adversarial images can force the model to explore the robust local features. In addition, the random shuffle is a way of augmenting the adversarial examples that can help the generalization.\n\nTo provide more intuition, we investigate the features of the input images that the models are focused by the visualization of SmoothGrad. Our model captures more local feature information of the object, aligning better with human perception. \n\n[1]\tInterpreting adversarially trained convolutional neural networks.

We will try to address your concern as follows.\n\nWe thank you for raising the question of formal theoretical foundation. The theoretical foundation of the proposed approach is highly dependent on the theory of the feature disentanglement. The disentanglement of the features from images is a rising direction, such as how to disentangle the robust local features, the features strongly related to label or the features aligning better with human perception from images, and actually there is little disentanglement work [1] in the field of deep learning for adversarial robustness. \n\nWhile this work shows the general relationship between the generalization of adversarial training and the robust local features, there remains several open questions: how to explicitly disentangle the robust local features? what is the best way to leverage the robust local features for adversarially robust generalization? These are also our future work to make further investigation. We hope this work inspires more work on the theoretical side of the adversarial robustness, and analysis on the disentanglement of robust features.\n\n[1] Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features.
