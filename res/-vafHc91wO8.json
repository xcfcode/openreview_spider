However, the standard training procedure overlooks the dynamic nature of the real-world where object classes are likely to occur at different frequencies. While it is generally understood that imbalanced tasks harm the performance of supervised methods, there is no significant research examining the impact of imbalanced meta-datasets on the FSL evaluation task. This study exposes the magnitude and extent of this problem. Our results show that ML methods are more robust against meta-dataset imbalance than imbalance at the task-level with a similar imbalance ratio ($\\rho<20$), with the effect holding even in long-tail datasets under a larger imbalance ($\\rho=65$). Overall, these results highlight an implicit strength of ML algorithms, capable of learning generalizable features under dataset imbalance and domain shift.", "pdf": "/pdf/521f19a63434104d59ddbd80f9415ba3fefd4f0b.pdf", "proposed_reviewers": "", "paperhash": "anonymous|how_sensitive_are_metalearners_to_dataset_imbalance", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021how,\ntitle={How Sensitive Are Meta-Learners to Dataset Imbalance?},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to Learning to Learn - Workshop at ICLR 2021},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=-vafHc91wO8},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "proposed_reviewers": {"value-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615595596483, "tmdate": 1615844205826, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
