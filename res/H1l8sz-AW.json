The new derivation of the method yields a much simpler interpretation, although the relation to the natural gradient remains weak (see below). The experimental evaluation is now far more solid. Multiple data sets and network architectures are tested, and equally important, the effect of parameter settings is investigated. I enjoyed the investigation of the effect of L_2 regularization on qualitative optimization behavior.\n\n\nCRITICISM:\n\nMy central criticism is that the introduction of the L_2 norm as a replacement of KL divergence is completely ad-hoc; how it is related to KL divergence remains unclear. It seems that other choices are equally well justified, including the L_2 norm in parameter space, which then defeats the central argument of the paper. I do believe that L_2 distance is more natural in function space than in parameter space, but I am missing a strict argument for this in the paper.\n\nAlthough related work is discussed in detail in section 1, it remains unclear how exactly the proposed algorithm overlaps with existing approaches. I am confident that it is easy to identify many precursors in the optimization literature, but I am not an expert on this. It would be of particular interest to highlight connections to algorithm regularly applied to neural network training. Adadelta, RMSprop, and ADAM are mentioned explicitly, but what exactly are differences and similarities?\n\nThe interpretation of figure 2 is off. It is deduced that HCGD generalizes better, however, this is the case only at the very end of training, while SGD with momentum and ADAM work far better initially. With the same plot one could sell SGD as the superior algorithm. Overall, also in the light of figure 4, the interpretation that the new algorithm results in better generalization seems to stand on shaky ground, since differences are small.\n\nI like the experiment presented in figure 5 in particular. It adds insights that are of value even if the method should turn out to have significant overlap with existing work (see above), and perform \"only\" on par with these: it adds an interesting perspective to the discussion of how network optimization \"works\", how it handles local optima and which role they play, and how the objective function landscape is \"perceived\" by different optimizers. This is where I learned something new.\n\n\nMINOR POINTS:\n\npage 5: \"the any\" (typo)\n\npage 5: \"ture\" -> \"true\" (typo)\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving generalization by regularizing in $L^2$ function space", "abstract": "Learning rules for neural networks necessarily include some form of regularization.

I upgraded the rating.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSummary: The paper considers the use of natural gradients for learning. The added twist is the substitution of the KL divergence with the Wasserstein distance, as proposed in GAN training. The authors suggest that Wasserstein regularization improves generalization over SGD with a little extra cost.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows:\n1. KL divergence is used as a similarity measure between two distributions.\n2. Regularizing the objective with KL div. seems promising, but expensive.\n3. We usually approximate the KL div. with its 2nd order approximation - this introduces the Hessian of the KL divergence, known as Fisher information matrix.\n4. However, computing and inverting the Fisher information matrix is computationally expensive.\n5. One solution is to approximate the solution F^{-1} J using gradient descent. However, still we need to calculate F. There are options where F could be formed as the outer product of a collection gradients of individual examples ('empirical Fisher').\n6. This paper does not move towards Fisher information, but towards Wasserstein distance: after a \"good\" initialization via SGD is obtained, the inner loop continues updating that point using the Wasserstein regularized objective. \n7. No large matrices need to be formed or inverted, however more passes needed per outer step.\n\nImportance:\nSomewhat lack of originality and poor experiments lead to low importance.\n\nClarity:\nThe paper needs major revision w.r.t. presenting and highlighting the new main points. E.g., one needs to get to page 5 to understand that the paper is just based on the WGAN ideas in Arjovsky et al., but with a different application (not GANS).\n\nOriginality/Novelty:\nThe paper, based on WGAN motivation, proposes Wasserstein distance regularization over KL div. regularization for training of simple models, such as neural networks. Beyond this, the paper does not provide any futher original idea. So, slight to no novelty.\n\nMain comments:\n1. Would the approximation of C_0 by its second-order Taylor expansion (that also introduces a Hessian) help? This would require the combination of two Hessian matrices.\n\n2. Experiments are really demotivating: it is not clear whether using plain SGD or the proposed method leads to better results. \n\nOverall:\nRejection.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving generalization by regularizing in $L^2$ function space", "abstract": "Learning rules for neural networks necessarily include some form of regularization.

The major changes include a change of theoretical justification, empirical analyses of this justification, additional optimization experiments, and a rework of the text (including the title and abstract).\n\n1.\nThe largest change is a shift away from the framework of Wasserstein distance in favor of one that establishes a metric of function distance in an L^2 Hilbert space, and regularizes that distance throughout learning. We believe this framework better emphasizes our overall message, which is that it is important to consider the behavior of optimizers in function space, not just parameter space.\n\nAs reviewer 1 noted, our original claim of regularizing the Wasserstein distance of the output distribution was not quite correct. We were limiting the change on specific examples, rather than between two distributions. After some thought, we realized that the expected norm of the change in output on specific examples is equivalent to an L^2 distance in a Hilbert space. A better description of our algorithm, then, is that it performs gradient descent through this L^2 function space. \n\nThis conceptual change required that we re-name the learning rule. The title, abstract, and algorithm description reflect this change. \n\n2. \nThe foundation of this work is a shift from thinking in parameter space to thinking in functional space. Previously, we did not adequately highlight or discuss this shift. We included a set of plots designed to evaluate the typical motion of a network through both parameter space and function space. These plots serve to justify an L^2 function space as a useful one for analysis.\n\n3.\nAll three reviewers were unsatisfied with the small number of optimization experiments. We included more experiments, including those using techniques like momentum, batch normalization, and alternative architectures.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving generalization by regularizing in $L^2$ function space", "abstract": "Learning rules for neural networks necessarily include some form of regularization. Most regularization techniques are conceptualized and implemented in the space of parameters. However, it is also possible to regularize in the space of functions. Here, we propose to measure networks in an $L^2$ Hilbert space, and test a learning rule that regularizes the distance a network can travel through $L^2$-space each update.  This approach is inspired by the slow movement of gradient descent through parameter space as well as by the natural gradient, which can be derived from a regularization term upon functional change. The resulting learning rule, which we call Hilbert-constrained gradient descent (HCGD), is thus closely related to the natural gradient but regularizes a different and more calculable metric over the space of functions. Experiments show that the HCGD is efficient and leads to considerably better generalization.
