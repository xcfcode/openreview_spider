Its main component is the combination of OR-based 2-opt search and learning-based k-opt search. Monte Carlo tress search is employed to train the learning-based k-opt search. The experimental result suggests state-of-the-art performance over existing RL-based solvers. \n\nMy main criticism is about the positioning of the paper in the literature. This algorithm is more of an \"online\" RL algorithm with learning done for each TSP instance separately, while the compared \"offline\" RL algorithms perform learning over the TSP algorithm (and training dataset). Regarding this matter, I failed to understand the advantage or promise of the proposed algorithm over the existing solvers such as Concorde. The motivation in the paper states that existing OR algorithms are \"very complicated and consist of many hand-crafted rules and heavily rely on expert knowledge, thus being difficult to generalize to other combinatorial optimization problems\", but this algorithm seems to suffer the same problems. In particular, one could even assert that the proposed algorithm is an instance of the Tabu search method [1], which is based on keeping a record of actions taken and penalizing to revisit it. \n\nFurthermore, I think the experiment lacks some detail regarding the complexity of the algorithm. The comparison of the proposed algorithm to the existing RL-based algorithms is slightly unfair, given that the proposed algorithm is implemented in C and others are implemented in Python (except S2V-DQN). For instance, when MCTS and the method of (Joshi et al., 2019) both take 40 minutes on the TSP-100 dataset, it is likely that MCTS is slower when implemented in Python. I would suggest the authors to avoid misleading the readers by including this fact in the paper. I also suggest providing the number of iterations it took to achieve the reported results since one could compare it to other local search methods. Furthermore, the experiments seem to lack the details on the number and type of GPUs used for obtaining the reported results.  \n\n[1] Zachariasen and Dam, Tabu Search on the Geometric Traveling Salesman Problem, Meta-Heuristics.

The\nauthors state that the reference algorithms were executed on different\nplatforms, even though at least some of them are publicly available and the\nauthors could have run them themselves. In their own experimental setup, the\nauthors overload the machines by solving instances on each hyper-threaded\nlogical core instead of the physical cores for no apparent reason.

This\nexperimental setup is changed for instance set 2 for no apparent reason.\n\nThe authors claim to improve on the optimal solution that concorde finds,\nconfirmed by a non-peer-reviewed paper, without providing a justification -- if\nthis is due to rounding errors, are the found tours the same and just the length\ncomputation is flawed? Or are the tours different?\n\nTables 1 and 2 present results in completely different formats. This makes it\nunnecessarily hard to compare results. In particular, Table 2 presents no run\ntimes.\n\nFinally, the instances used to evaluate the approach seem relatively easy.\nTSPlib contains many more instances that are more challenging to solve, with\nhundreds to thousands of cities.

Results show that the algorithm matches the optimal objective value on a dataset of 2D Euclidean TSP instances with 20, 50, and 100 cities, and achieves better objective value than S2V DQN on a subset of instances from TSPLIB with 50 to 318 cities. It is interesting that the algorithm is fairly simple (apart from the definition of the local moves) and still able to achieve competitive objective values on small instances.\n\nThe rating is a weak reject for the following reasons:\n1. Domain knowledge: The proposed algorithm has significant domain knowledge about TSP hand-coded into it via the choice of 2-opt local search as well as the k-opt moves with top-10 nearest neighbor filtering used in MCTS. These types of moves are same/similar to the expert-designed ones used in state-of-the-art local search algorithms like LKH. This can give the proposed algorithm a significant advantage over S2V-DQN which does not have such built-in knowledge. So the comparison to S2V-DQN is unfair and improved results may not be due to any differences in the learning approaches at all. Perhaps a more generic definition of local moves that is not so TSP-specific would be a fairer comparison. This issue is particularly important because the definition of \u201clocal moves\u201d appropriate for a problem domain is one of the main challenges in applying local search successfully. Bypassing that challenge can simplify the problem.\n\n2. Baselines: Better comparisons to baselines are needed in Table 2. S2V-DQN was published two years ago, and since then many other learning-based have been proposed (which are referenced in the paper), but they are not included in Table 2. It would also be good to discuss non-learning local search algorithms that use same/similar local moves as the proposed algorithm and how they perform.\n\n3. Scalability to large instances: TSP experts consider problems with hundreds of cities as practically \u201csolved\u201d by the current state-of-the-art solvers like Concorde and LKH, and it is not at all clear what benefit learning can provide on such small instances. Much larger instances (e.g., 10^4-10^6 cities) would have to be considered for improvements over the state-of-the-art to become plausible with learning. So if the goal is to improve on the state-of-the-art with learning (even if it is a long-term goal), then it is important to consider whether the proposed approach has a plausible path for scaling up to such sizes. But like most papers on learning-for-TSP, this paper does not consider scalability. \n\nMisc comments:\nIt would be useful to include the exact running times of Concorde in Table 2. The results given are \u201creported by Concorde within 1 hour for each instance\u201d, but it would be good to know what the actual running time is.\nTypo: \u201csub-decisions sequently\u201d\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1119/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1119/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Targeted sampling of enlarged neighborhood via Monte Carlo tree search for TSP", "authors": ["Zhang-Hua Fu", "Kai-Bin Qiu", "Meng Qiu", "Hongyuan Zha"], "authorids": ["fuzhanghua@cuhk.edu.cn", "20150008030@m.scnu.edu.cn", "qiumeng.sz@gmail.com", "zhahy@cuhk.edu.cn"], "keywords": ["Travelling salesman problem", "Monte Carlo tree search", "Reinforcement learning", "Variable neighborhood search"], "TL;DR": "This paper combines Monte Carlo tree search with 2-opt local search in a variable neighborhood mode to solve the TSP effectively.", "abstract": "The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem with a variety of real-life applications. We tackle TSP by incorporating machine learning methodology and leveraging the variable neighborhood search strategy. More precisely, the search process is considered as a Markov decision process (MDP), where a 2-opt local search is used to search within a small neighborhood, while a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) method (which iterates through simulation, selection and back-propagation steps), is used to sample a number of targeted actions within an enlarged neighborhood. This new paradigm clearly distinguishes itself from the existing machine learning (ML) based paradigms for solving the TSP, which either uses an end-to-end ML model, or simply applies traditional techniques after ML for post optimization. Experiments based on two public data sets show that, our approach clearly dominates all the existing learning based TSP algorithms in terms of performance, demonstrating its high potential on the TSP. More importantly, as a general framework without complicated hand-crafted rules, it can be readily extended to many other combinatorial optimization problems.", "pdf": "/pdf/7512e3f79bc9eabfcf24d241a3517e75cb44486f.pdf", "code": "https://github.com/Spider-scnu/Monte-Carlo-tree-search-for-TSP", "paperhash": "fu|targeted_sampling_of_enlarged_neighborhood_via_monte_carlo_tree_search_for_tsp", "original_pdf": "/attachment/7512e3f79bc9eabfcf24d241a3517e75cb44486f.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nfu2020targeted,\ntitle={Targeted sampling of enlarged neighborhood via Monte Carlo tree search for {\\{}TSP{\\}}},\nauthor={Zhang-Hua Fu and Kai-Bin Qiu and Meng Qiu and Hongyuan Zha},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxtHCVKwB}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
