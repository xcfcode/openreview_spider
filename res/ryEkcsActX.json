We responded to each comment below: \n\n1. \"As it is well known from the literature[1, 2, 3], just using the premature performance as a surrogate for the mature performance leads to poor prediction,...\": \nWe agree with the reviewer that comparing the efficiency of our method with some of these alternative methods is valuable. Experiments reported in the current version of our paper were selected to enable us to compare our method against a different battery of search methods [1-3] and unfortunately are not suitable to present a direct comparison with the papers suggested by the reviewer. Given the time limit for the review period it is unlikely that we can finish these experiments in time. Nonetheless, we like to note that all three of the studies cited by the reviewer require generating large datasets (on the order of several hundred models) to construct a predictive model of the mature performance. Hence, we anticipate that our method would still be more efficient than the competing methods because of no computational overhead for creating such model, but we also acknowledge that only a direct comparison between the methods could enable us to make that claim. \n\n2. \"It seems that authors only use CIFAR-100 because of its larger number of classes that provide a better RDM... \": \nRegarding applicability on CIFAR-10 dataset, we performed a correlation analysis on CIFAR-10 dataset similar to that reported in Figure-2 fro CIFAR-100. We found that the correlation between object-level RDMs and mature-performance on C10 dataset was much lower than those we found for C100 and P+TG score was only marginally better than performance only measure during early stages of training. Since the main difference between these two datasets is in the number of classes, we conjectured that this observation is potentially because of lower resolution RDMs on C10 dataset. However, another possibility that we have only partly explored so far is to use image-level RDMs that are computed over specific images instead of objects. Image-level RDMs produce the same resolution regardless of the number of classes. \n\n3. \"The authors use only one teacher network for all the experiments. ...\":\nWe had conducted an analysis reported in supplementary material (ALTERNATIVE TEACHER NETWORK - NASNET) in which we performed the correlation analysis on a second teacher network (NASNet) with higher mature performance. We found that although the P+TG correlation with mature performance was higher for this teacher network, the enhancement in correlation over ResNet teacher network was negligible when the candidate networks were trained for about 2 epochs or more (Figure-5). \n\n\n[1] Zoph, B., Vasudevan, V., Shlens, J., & Le, Q.

There might be some misunderstanding regarding how RDM is computed and how it allows us to compare representational spaces in biological and artificial systems. We responded to each comment below: \n\n1. \"As far as I understood, the RDM is computed on the intermediate representations of the neural network. However, given a CNN it is possible to rearrange the filters without the networks predictions. RDM however does not account for that because this is not the case for the human brain. So what is your explanation why RDM works?\": \nRDM characterizes a representational space with respect to the similarity of responses to inputs of different categories. As an example consider a simple case that we are only considering two categories of inputs (e.g. cats and fish). We show the neural network an image of a \u201ccat\u201d and an image of a \u201cfish\u201d. For a given layer, we compute the activations of \u201cN\u201d features in that layer in response to these two images. We rearrange these features into a vector (i.e. flatten the tensor into a vector) that constitutes the response vector to each image at the given layer. Note that we maintain the same order of features in the response vector for all images. In other words, feature \u201ci\u201d in the response vectors for \u201ccat\u201d and \u201cfish\u201d images contain activations from the same feature in the network. \nHaving these response vectors, to construct the RDM, we find the correlation between the response vectors for each pair of images. In this case the possible pairs are \"cat to cat\", \"fish to fish\" and \"cat to fish\". The correlation for the trivial cases (\"cat to cat\", \"fish to fish\") are equal to one and for the nontrivial case (\"cat to fish\"), it quantifies how similar the response vectors are at the given layer. \nFor the specific case of \u201crearranging the filters in CNN\u201d (as the reviewer suggests), the RDM would not change as long as the same feature-order is maintained when collecting the response vectors for all the images. We hope this explanation has clarified the RDM procedure. A more thorough explanation is given in [1].\n\n2. \"How exactly do you compute the RDM between a CNN and sensor readings of a monkey brain? I'm not a neuroscientist but this does not sound right to me at all. Why should we expect similarities between brain activation patterns and intermediate representations of a CNN?\":\nFor the case of measuring the cortical activity, you can think of these measurements as subsampled features from the full set of features (neurons) in a specific brain region (similar to a layer in the network). Because these measurements are recorded using chronic implants, each neural site records from the same neuron in the brain in response to all the presented images. We use RDM to characterize the similarities between (neural) responses to images from different categories. \nTo compare the similarity of the representational spaces in brain and CNN, we first compute the RDM for each space (one layer in CNN and one region in the brain), and then calculate the similarity between the RDMs by flattening both matrices and finding the correlation between the two vectors. \nThe RDM similarity between neural responses in area V4 and IT and CNN features using RDM metric have been extensively studies previously[2, 3, 4]. Specially, Please see Fig. 4 in [2] and Fig. 7 in [3] that demonstrate and quantify the similarity of RDMs between the brain and several classes of CNNs. \n\n3. \"I'd really like to see an experiment which compares the proposed method to methods predicting the mature performance based on observed premature performance.\":\nThe experiments in sec 4.1 and results reported in Table-1 and Figure-3 were aimed at making a fair comparison between the two methods as the reviewer suggests (i.e. premature performance versus P+TG). \n\n[1] Kriegeskorte, N.

We provide specific responses to each point below. \n\n1. \"Why should a new architecture necessarily mimic ...\": \nWhile the exact feature space that each specific network converges to is unique to that network, there are many similarities between the feature spaces in different networks. For example, it has previously been shown that object-level representations (like those obtained from object-level RDM that is also used in our work) at higher layers of several convolutional neural networks are largely similar to each other and also to measurements from the brain [1]. Our approach encourages the representational similarity to that of the teacher model. However, it should be noted that the similarity comparison is done between the candidate network at an early stage during the training and the fully trained teacher network. Therefore, we would argue that it would be unlikely that the representational similarity score would lead to finding an exact copy of the teacher network during the search. Instead, it encourages to find networks that are able to construct representations early during their training that are most similar to those of a teacher network found after orders of magnitude more training. \n\n2. \"Probably, in the most scenarios on new tasks, a teacher network is not available...\": We agree with the reviewer that the goal of NAS/AutoML is to discover good networks with minimal dependence on the human intervention/knowledge. Our approach requires measurements from a high-performing network to function. As was mentioned in response to the previous comment, current state-of-the-art models bear remarkable similarity to those from brain measurement [1]. In addition, it has further been shown that performance on object-recognition tasks is highly correlated with the representation similarity between the network and the brain [2]. These two observations constitute the core of our approach. We consider the brain as a high-performing (biological) neural network with unknown architectural parameters and partially observable activity. We discussed the plausibility of this approach in more detail in response to the next comment. \n\n3. \"I think, arguing that one can use the human brain as a teacher...\": \nAs of now, in many labs including our own, simultaneous neural measurements on the order of several hundred neurons are possible and the emerging new technology is making larger population recordings possible (please see [3, 4] for references). As a proof of concept, we also conducted another search experiment guided by measurements from macaque monkey brains. We discussed the outcomes of this search in the newly added section 4.4. Briefly, we used neural population (n=296) response patterns to 5760 images to produce object-level RDMs. We then conducted a search experiment on the space of convolutional cells with the goal of maximizing the combined P+TG score. The best discovered model achieved similar performance levels to those found with a ResNet teacher model. \n\n4. \"It is unclear to me how to compute ...\": RDM can be computed for any representation space in response to a set of inputs. Given a feature matrix, we first compute the average response vectors for each object category by computing the average response over all inputs belonging to the same object category. Then we compute the Pearson correlation between average response vectors of each pair of objects to form the RDM. We added a new figure (Figure-1) and added a more detailed explanation in section 3.1.\n\n5. \"Figure 1, middle: while the ...\": The left and middle panels in Figure 1 were plotted for training after 1.5 epochs. We updated this figure with the scatter plot for 2 epochs of training that was used during our experiments. It is clear from these plots that by around 2 epochs of training the correlation between \"P+TG\" and Mature performance is both higher and more uniform across the range of scores. \n\n6. \"Section 3.3 first sentence says: \"Sequential Model-Based Optimization approaches are greedy numerical method...\": We agree with the reviewer that because of the sampling function these methods are not necessarily greedy. We dropped the term \"greedy\" from the statement. \n\n7. \"Section 3.3 says that TPE fits ...\": We thank the reviewer for bringing this issue up. We changed this to \"TPE fits a kernel density estimator with Gaussian kernels\" \n\n[1] Cadieu, et al. (2014).

To address this, we added a paragraph in section 2 to discuss these approaches and compare them to ours. We also updated Table-2 with more baseline methods including ENAS that were previously applied to a similar cell-based architecture space. In Table-2, we only included methods that were previously tested on the same search space of convolutional networks. \n\n2. \"How do you find the teacher's architecture in the first place?\": By definition, our method requires a teacher to operate. As stated in the abstract and introduction sections, our motivation for this work was to ultimately use measurements from primate brain as the \"teacher\" in this setup. As of now, in many labs including our own, simultaneous neural measurements on the order of several hundred neurons are possible and the emerging new technology is making larger population recordings possible (please see [1, 2] for references). Moreover, as a proof of concept, we conducted another search experiment guided by measurements from macaque monkey brains. We discussed the outcomes of this search in the newly added section 4.4. \n\n3. \"Does the method also work in cases where the teacher is performing poorly?\": We examined mature/premature correlations for two alternative teacher networks (i.e. ResNet and NASNet). These networks had a relatively large difference in their mature performance (75 vs. 82). We observed that features from the higher performing teacher model (NASNet) were better predictors of mature performance (Figure 4-right panel). While here we tested only two teacher models, it is plausible to think that lower performing teacher networks would deliver weaker prediction of mature performance and therefore lesser gain in search efficiency. \n\n4. \"The P+TG score depends on a hyperparameter alpha. There is no empirical evidence supporting that alpha can be fixed once and applied for any arbitrary dataset. So I have concerns whether this approach is able to generalize over different datasets. The experiment in the appendix confirms this by showing that a badly chosen alpha will lead to worse performance.\": Parameter alpha dictates the weight on the \"TG\" portion of the score compared to the premature-performance. It is true that this parameter affects the expected gain in correlation over the \"performance-only\" search. However, most alpha values produce an acceptable gain over the \"performance-only\" during the early stage of training. On the contrary, as in the later stages of training the premature-performance becomes a stronger predictor of the mature-performance, TG signal becomes irrelevant and only smaller values of alpha lead to marginal gain in correlation. In this work, our focus was on the early stages of training in which the gain is mostly robust to the choice of alpha (e.g. alpha = 1-5). \n\n5. \"Additionally, I think the paper would benefit from spending more space on explaining the proposed method.\": We agree with the reviewer on the need for providing more details about the RDM method and how it is used to guide the architecture search. For this, we moved the RL and TPE search methods to the supplementary material, added a section on RDM in methods, provided more information about how RDM is used to guide the search and added a new figure (Figure-1) explaining RDM and motivating the method. \n\n[1] Stevenson, Ian H., and Konrad P.

The reason for doing so was to discard the potential differences in performance values due to training procedures. However, we acknowledge that these values could be confusing for the reader and hence, we updated Table-2 and included both the original and retrained performances for these two networks in Table-2. In addition we included the performance values for several other related methods in tables 2 for the sake of completeness. \n\n2. \"The experiments only consider 10 and 20 layer ConvNet.\": We used convolutional neural networks of depth 10 and 20 in our experiments in section 4.1 to motivate our approach. In addition to that, we did an additional experiment on a cell-based search space in the experiment in section 4.3 and the newly added section 4.4. The cell-based search space considered in section 4.3 and 4.4, contains diverse architectures with a wide range of variation with respect to depth. For instance, for a cell repetition value of N=5, a cell with 5 sequential sep-conv blocks could potentially produce a network of up to 210 layers deep. \n\n3. \"The paper has lots of typos and missing articles or verbs.\": We thank the reviewer for bringing up this issue.

Given a network with premature performance (i.e. one trained only for few epochs), it tries to compute the mature performance (accuracy achieved when training the network to completion). A score for each architecture is given by \"P+TG\" which considers the validation accuracy and the similarity of instance representations at different layers to a given teacher network. In an experiment against using the validation accuracy as a score only, they achieve higher validation accuracies on CIFAR-10/100. In a comparison against NASNet and PNASNet, their experiments indicate higher validation accuracy in orders of magnitudes faster run time.\n\nThis is a well-written paper with an innovative idea to forecast the mature performance. I am not aware of any other work using the internal representation in order to obtain that. However, there is plenty of other work aiming at accelerating the architecture search by early stopping based on premature performance. Hyperband [1] uses the premature performance (considered in this paper), many others try to forecast the learning curve based on the partial observed learning curve [2,3]. ENAS [4] learns shared parameters for different architectures. Predictions on batches are then used as a surrogate. SMASH [5] uses a hypernetwork to estimate the surrogate. While this work was partly mentioned, neither the close connection to this work is discussed nor serves any of these methods as a baseline.\nTypically, the premise of automatic neural architecture search is that the user does not know deep learning well. However, the authors assume that a teacher exist which is an already high performing architecture. It is unclear whether this is a realistic scenario in real-life. How do you find the teacher's architecture in the first place? Does the method also work in cases where the teacher is performing poorly?\nThe P+TG score depends on a hyperparameter alpha. There is no empirical evidence supporting that alpha can be fixed once and applied for any arbitrary dataset. So I have concerns whether this approach is able to generalize over different datasets. The experiment in the appendix confirms this by showing that a badly chosen alpha will lead to worse performance.\nAdditionally, I think the paper would benefit from spending more space on explaining the proposed method. I would rather see more details about RDM and maybe a nice plot explaining the motivation rather than repeating NAS and TPE.\n\n[1] Lisha Li, Kevin G.

However, because of the large architecture search spaces and the high computational cost associated with evaluating each candidate model, further gains in computational efficiency are needed.  Here we present a method termed Teacher Guided Search for Architectures by Generation and Evaluation (TG-SAGE) that produces up to an order of magnitude in search efficiency over PGAS methods. Specifically, TG-SAGE guides each step of the architecture search by evaluating the similarity of internal representations of the candidate networks with those of the (fixed) teacher network. We show that this procedure leads to significant reduction in required per-sample training and that, this advantage holds for two different search spaces of architectures, and two different search algorithms. We further show that in the space of convolutional cells for visual categorization, TG-SAGE finds a cell structure with similar performance as was previously found using other methods but at a total computational cost that is two orders of magnitude lower than Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and more than four times lower than progressive neural architecture search (PNAS).
