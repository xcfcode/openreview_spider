The paper gives two application use-cases: MNIST and path planning. \n\nHereafter I give how I see the pros and cons of this paper. \n\n+ The idea of using HRR is interesting \n+ I like the path planning application. \n+ spatial relationship that can be integrated in neural nets is certainly useful\n\n- The novelty does not look very high. Considering the prior works on HRR and spatial relationships, this looks like a straightforward application paper. \n- The literature review is minimalist. In particular, many works in computer vision have addressed the problem of encode spatial relationship. This has also been done with complex vectors, for instance the recent paper by Bursuc and Tolias in the journal Computer Vision and Image Understanding: ``Rotation and translation covariant match kernels for image retrieval'', which also exploits the convolution theorem (as in HRR anyway). As a result, it is not clear to me if there is anything novel in this submission. The worse is probably that CNN or its spatial extensions (like transformers networks) are not even mentioned, see my last point below. \n- Poor experiments compared to what is normally done in papers dealing with images. There is not evaluation nor any comparison to any reasonable concurrent method, like a CNN architecture: CNN representations are state of the art, and thanks to convolution they also implicitly encode the translation invariance. They are now routinely used in computer vision system. It is very surprising that these papers are not cited/mentioned given the massive impact they had in the previous years. \n- In my opinion details are missing for the idea to be reproducible.

The operation is differentiable, and can be inserted into neural networks to endow them with the ability to perform spatial reasoning. The approach is validated by experiments on two toy problems: identifying MNIST digits based on spatial queries, and performing value iteration for path planning.\n\nOver the past year we have seen many approaches for inserting spatial attention into neural network models such as soft and hard attention over discrete locations, and differentiable forms of spatial attention as seen for instance in DRAW (Gregor et al, 2015) and Spatial Transformer Networks (Jaderberg et al, 2015). In light of this prior work, I believe that the frequency-domain based approach for spatial reasoning put forth by this paper is indeed novel and interesting; however the paper in its current form does not do a good job of explaining its relationship and significance with respect to these existing methods.\n\nMy major complaints about the paper revolve around the quality of its experiments and in the clarity of exposition describing them. For the first experiment: what, concretely, are the inputs and outputs of the network? What is the network architecture? How exactly are the spatial queries encoded and passed as input to the network? How does the network specify its glimpse locations, and in what format does it receive information about its glimpses? How is it trained? How well do baseline methods perform on this task and dataset? As written, the experiments do not contain enough information to highlight the strength of the proposed method.\n\nThe details of the second experiment are mostly left as an exercise to the reader, and the only experimental result is a single qualitative example.\n\nPROS\n- The underlying idea has is interesting and has merit\n\nCONS\n- Relationship to prior work is not clearly discussed\n- Numerous details are missing from experiments\n- The proposed approach is not tested against any baseline methods\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"CMT_id": "", "title": "A Neural Architecture for Representing and Reasoning about Spatial Relationships", "abstract": "We explore a new architecture for representing spatial information in neural networks.
