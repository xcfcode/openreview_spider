There is no significant theoretical innovation in this paper. Specifically, the learning approach for optimizing the parameter set W in the presence of \\mu is not much different from the one proposed by (Kidzinski & Hastie, 2018) and the optimal value of \\mu is simply the solution for L2 loss function. Besides, the narrative of section 2 shares too much similarity with the context of Kidzinski & Hastie, 2018.\n\n2. The practical significance of the paper is rather limited considering that the framework can only take into account one specific treatment at a time when training a model. There are usually different treatments for a certain disease and it is hard to control enough patients to all take the same treatment. Sometimes, even the same patient could take multiple treatments at the same time or along his trajectory. \n\n3. The paper is poorly written. There are too many grammatical errors. Some sentences are hard to understand. E.g. \u201cTreatments of various types, however, rely on human decisions and to some extent, an exogenous variable to the development of disease. Thus they need to modeled differently.\u201d should be \u201cTreatments of various types, however, rely on human decisions and to some extent, are exogenous variables to the development of disease. Thus they need to be modeled differently.\u201d. \u201cwe add a penalty term on the nuclear norm of W .\u201d, Do you mean \u201cwe add a penalty term which is the nuclear norm of W .\u201d? Cause I don\u2019t see any additional penalty term in the nuclear norm compared with equation 2.2. \u201c...where (I_S)_{i,j} = 1 if and only T_i \u2265 s(i)...\u201d should be \u201c...where (I_S)_{i,j} = 1 if and only if T_i \u2265 s(i)...\u201d. \u201cFinally we show that if the sequence {(\\mu_{\\lambda}^{(k)}, W_{\\lambda}^{(k)} )}_k, it has to converge to a solution of (4.1).\u201d Grammatically speaking, the if clause is not even a complete clause.

In this study, we develop a machine learning framework named Coordinatewise-Soft-Impute (CSI) for analyzing disease progression from sparse observations in the presence of confounding events. CSI is guaranteed to converge to the global minimum of the corresponding optimization problem. Experimental results also demonstrates the effectiveness of CSI using both simulated and real dataset.", "pdf": "/pdf/b9d9a9440e4cded2c949526f7ec68601c1afc0ad.pdf", "code": "https://www.dropbox.com/sh/y7h9utzsord2k79/AABpL0qWjOse-6dgj3-k0vina?dl=0", "paperhash": "wang|modeling_treatment_events_in_disease_progression", "original_pdf": "/attachment/b9d9a9440e4cded2c949526f7ec68601c1afc0ad.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nwang2020modeling,\ntitle={Modeling treatment events in disease progression},\nauthor={Guanyang Wang and Yumeng Zhang and Yong Deng and Xuxin Huang and Lukasz Kidzinski},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1gm-a4tDH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
