The reviewers highlight the novelty of the approach. Some of the concerns with regards to clarity have been addressed by the authors satisfactorily. \n\nHowever, an important issue of the approach is that of estimating model parameters, which the authors do not address explicitly by simply referring to that as the task of the modeller. I believe this is an important issue and, although some of the parameters can be estimated along with the neural network parameters, this has not been shown empirically. Along a similar vein, the paper only presents results on a single real dataset (the bike-sharing dataset), which questions the applicability of the approach and no other baseline method is presented. At the very least, the authors should have provided an objective evaluation to other doubly stochastic point process models, e.g. based on Gaussian processes, where modern stochastic variational inference algorithms have been presented. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variational inference for diffusion modulated Cox processes", "authorids": ["~Prateek_Jaiswal1", "~Harsha_Honnappa1", "~Vinayak_Rao1"], "authors": ["Prateek Jaiswal", "Harsha Honnappa", "Vinayak Rao"], "keywords": ["Cox process", "variational inference", "stochastic differential equation", "smoothing posterior density"], "abstract": "This paper proposes a stochastic variational inference (SVI) method for computing an approximate posterior path measure of a Cox process.

It is not clear how equation (13) is a .......be nice here. \\\nR. Thank you for your comments. You are correct in pointing out that the class of measures induced by (13), denoted as $\\mathcal{Q}$$\\bar b$, cannot be a subset of the measures induced by the SDE in (2); and we are also not claiming this, as this is false. In the sentence above eq (13), we say that $\\mathcal{Q}_{\\bar b}$ is a subset of all absolutely continuous measure with respect to $\\Pi_0$, which is a larger class of measures that also includes $\\Pi_0$. Since the measure induced by SDE (13) is absolutely continuous with respect to $\\Pi_0$, therefore it is also included in set $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{C})$. We have updated the paragraph after eq. (13) to clarify this fact.\n2. The proposed framework requires to ...... in more detail.\\\nR. Thank you for your comments. $b(\\cdot)$,  $\\sigma(\\cdot)$, and $h(\\cdot)$ are the parameters of the model. Setting parameters is the task of the modeler, while our focus is mostly on inference given the model. In the interest of clarity, we decided not to include learning these in our paper. Instead, we heuristically set $\\sigma(x)$ to $1.1$ in the Bike sharing experiment as the count observations had higher variance than the first experiment as evident from the last plots in Figures 1 and 2 respectively. Moreover, we should point out that the target drift is not $b$, but in fact the target is the intractable drift derived for the smoothing SDE in eq. (11). \n3.

The methodology relies on a restriction of candidate solutions the the subset for which the drift depends on $x_t$, $N_t$ and $t$; the drift is then modelled with a neural network. By simulating from the candidate model, a sample average approximation of the ELBO is used to compute a stochastic gradient descent algorithm, optimize the bound and thus estimate non-parametrically the drift.\n\nThe paper is clear and well written with original and significant contribution. The paper would benefit from clarifications about the following points:\n\n\n## Major points\n* It is not clear how equation (13) is a subset of the solution of (2) in general more parameters implies more degree of freedom and thus the drift in (13) could look more general than $b(x)$ (the use the $\\bar{b}$ notation suggesting it refers more to (11) than (2)). This probably comes from the fact that all variables are indexed by $t$ but more details would be nice here.\n* The proposed framework requires to specify both $b$ and $\\sigma$ a priori. It would be nice to explain what is the impact and restrictions of doing so. For instance, the first experiment set $\\sigma$ to $1$ and the second to $1.1$ without further justification. Could the author(s) elaborate(s) on this point? Similarly, the authors use a very flexible model (NN) for $\\bar{b}$, so the main restriction comes from the choice of the `target' $b$: the impact of this choice should be discussed in more detail.\n* Similarly to the previous points, in the methodology, the link function $h$ must be set a priori (and its uncertainty is not taken into account). Would it be possible to have an inference methodology estimating not only the drift but also $h$ (and $\\sigma$?) at the same time? If not, is it possible to explain why?\n\n\n## Minor points\n* p.1 l.1: the reference for Cox processes is not the 'original' work.\n* p.2: 'in particular, we show that...' either 'that' or 'how'.\n* p.2: VBSP has never been defined at this stage of the paper.\n* p.3: Wiener.\n* p.3: the notation $\\mathbb{E}^\\dagger$ is undefined.\n* p.3: defined the indicator function that you are using.\n* p.3: shouldn't the $x$ in the definition of $\\bar{v}(x_t)$ be bold?\n* p.3: which 'section'?

The variational inference method looks sound. \n\nPros:\n+ The generalization of SDE-type intensity is novel. The proposed stochastic variational inference makes sense. Especially the neural network solution is meaningful and will have an impact on the learning of point processes. \n+ Good empirical performance and analysis. \n\nCons:\n- I strongly recommend the authors to further improve the presentation of the current draft. Sometimes the notations are not consistent, like $\\mathbb{E}$ and $E$, $\\mathbb{R}$ and $R$. The definition of some of the notations are not very clear, such as Eq(3), what is the definition of the conditional expectation? Is it the expectation of the intensity function given all the information about the process?  Besides, please give a brief introduction of the mathematical background, such as the smoothing posterior. It would also be better if the authors can give some examples to illustrate the advantages of the proposed diffusion modulated cox process.\n- Please discuss the influence of the non-negativity of the intensity function.
