Please have a look at our other reply as well.\n\nWe have provided more details about the policy network in the text, and highlighted our previous publication, where the pure policy net is described in all details [Segler, Waller, Chem. Eur. J, (2017) DOI: 10.1002/chem.201605499 ]. In short, the molecules get encoded as ECFP4 fingerprints, which are then fed into a 5 layer Highway network, which in turn predicts the probability of the graph transformations.\n\nWe have also adapted the description of the training data in the manuscript. Our training data are 5.5 million published organic (and many inorganic and organometallic) reactions carried out in synthetic chemistry labs, taken from the Reaxys database. It does not contain metabolic pathways. \n\nIn the upcoming full paper we are investigating in detail where MCTS and BFS differ in performance. Initial empirical evidence suggests that for more complex molecules (with a much larger tree), MCTS finds solutions more often. Our random test set consists of molecules that have not been described in the literature before \u2013 they were generated by sampling from a charRNN [1] trained on drug-like molecules.

Due to the restricted space in the extended abstract, referred to our previous publication, which already describes the full details about the training data, molecular descriptors, the policy networks, and their architectures [Segler, Waller, Chem. Eur. J, (2017) DOI: 10.1002/chem.201605499] We have clarified this in the manuscript.\n\nYou are right about chemical reaction data, they are indeed hard to come by. There is unfortunately no \u201creaction MNIST\u201d. The reaction dataset we use stems from the Reaxys database, which is one of the most widely used databases by practicing organic chemists. The statement that it contains \u201cthe complete published knowledge of chemistry\u201d may seem bold if one considers the huge challenge of constructing common sense knowledge bases, e.g. for natural language understanding. However, organic chemical reactions are a narrow domain and straightforward to represent computationally as graph transformations. There are only a few million reactions published in the chemical literature. Therefore, it is actually feasible to construct a knowledge base that covers almost every reaction ever published. Nevertheless, we have removed the statement from the text to avoid confusion.\n\nThe best moves for a particular molecule are the reported reactions that have been used to make it. This is completely analogous to AlphaGo, where, given a board position, the actually played moves are predicted to the best. It is possible to have different winning moves/reactions for the same position/molecule both for Go and for us. This is possibly one reason why neither AlphaGo nor our system reaches a very high accuracy.\n\n\nThe improvement of MCTS is more a philosophical one, as it allows estimating the \u201cvalue\u201d of a molecule, which is its synthesizability (not all reasonable looking molecules can be made, which is a huge problem for computer aided drug design). BFS by definition finds only one solution, and then stops. MCTS on the other hand usually finds several solutions, and will backpropagate rewards from different branches to lower game tree nodes. Even though MCTS eventually converges to one optimal branch, it is desirable to find not just one, but several alternative and robust routes, and MCTS more readily allows for that.\n\nIs MCTS is thus less useful for retrosynthesis than in Go? To some degree yes! Empirically, we found that BFS is usually on par with MCTS on smaller, \u201ceasier\u201d molecules, while MCTS usually finds better solutions for larger molecules (and thus larger search trees), where BFS sometimes struggles. We are currently investigating this in detail for the full paper. We would say what\u2019s most useful about our findings is that the DNN policy (or DNN cost function for BFS) outperforms the hand-annotated heuristics regardless of the search method used.\n\nBFS is faster because it does less calculation, due to the lack of the rollout phase. This is also what (probably) makes MCTS stronger. The two main bottlenecks in our system is the neural network and the application of the transformations, the tree search itself is much faster than these two steps. Restricting wall-clock time and simply sampling from the policy network are indeed interesting experiments, which we will carry out for the full paper. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Towards \"AlphaChem\": Chemical Synthesis Planning with Tree Search and Deep Neural Network Policies", "abstract": "Retrosynthesis is a technique to plan the chemical synthesis of organic molecules, for example drugs, agro- and fine chemicals.

While not the first to propose machine learning to model an 'expert chemist' for chemical synthesis, the particular reinforcement learning approach with MCTS in this work is novel as far as I know. However, I have a couple questions and concerns.\n\nPrimarily, not enough information is given about the training data or the policy network trained from it. In general, good chemistry data is hard to obtain; information tends to be scattered, in different formats, and of varying quality. So I'm skeptical about the claim that the data set contains \"essentially the complete published knowledge of chemistry.\" What are these reactions, how are they represented, and how do you determine the _best_ move for a particular molecule when training? For the policy network, what is the network architecture? These may have been published elsewhere, but more details should be provided here, especially for a machine learning audience.\n\nI don't completely understand the performance improvement due to the MCTS. It seems less useful in this application than in Go, because here whenever you reach a reward of Q(v)=1, the problem is solved and you stop. In the experiments, MCTS shows an improvement over BFS+NN, which is definitely interesting, but this doesn't account for the fact that BFS is more than twice as fast (due to searching the tree in order?). If the constraint was wall-clock time, would MCTS still outperform BFS?

In combination with a Deep Neural Network policy trained on 5.5 million reactions, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can be used to evaluate positions. In exploratory studies, we demonstrate that MCTS with neural network policies outperforms the traditionally used best-first search with hand-coded heuristics.", "pdf": "/pdf/f687feb7b6be703d451d149622d53cfc421b8d9b.pdf", "TL;DR": "Analogous to AlphaGo, chemical syntheses can be planned by combining Neural Networks that select actions with Monte Carlo Tree Search.", "paperhash": "segler|towards_alphachem_chemical_synthesis_planning_with_tree_search_and_deep_neural_network_policies", "keywords": ["Deep learning", "Applications", "Games"], "conflicts": ["wwu.de", "shu.edu.cn"], "authors": ["Marwin Segler", "Mike Preuss", "Mark P.
