During training, the prover is improved incrementally by using the current version to prove theorems and add proved theorems to the training data. The authors propose to use TF-IDF for premise selection. They show that it enables the prover to outperform a supervised learning baseline without using human proofs.\n\n\nStrengths:\n\nThe paper addresses an interesting and important problem\u2014learning theorem provers without explicit supervision from human proofs.\n\nThe evaluation is sound. The authors are able to show some benefits from their IF-IDF premise selection. The proposed method outperforms the baseline on the HOList benchmark. \n\nThe paper is well-written overall, though some sentences are difficult to parse, e.g.,  \"comparison OF the effect OF availability OF human proofs\" in the intro. \n\nWeaknesses:\n\nThe method is not new. There exists a body of work leveraging reinforcement learning to learn theorem provers [A, B, C, etc.]. Many of them also do not rely on human proofs, e.g., [B]. Although the authors may be the first to apply reinforcement learning to prove theorems in interactive theorem proving environments, this is not a sufficiently novel contribution.\n\n[A] Kaliszyk, Cezary, et al. \"Reinforcement learning of theorem proving.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2018.\n[B] Piotrowski, Bartosz, and Josef Urban. \"ATPboost: Learning premise selection in binary setting with ATP feedback.\" International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning.

Brown. \"Prolog technology reinforcement learning prover.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.06997 (2020). \n\n\nBesides, using TF-IDF for premise selection is not new.

The ones which don't use DNN don't get state of the art performance. This is also established in our ablation experiments. The ones using only tf-idf for premise selection do significantly worse.

But I don't think this is a valid difference between this paper and prior work. [A, B] discussed or experimented with deep neural networks. They didn't use it in their final methods because they found XGBoost is faster and equally accurate in their task. \n\nThough many theorem proving in ITP papers use DNNs (Bansal et al., Paliwal et al. Yang and Deng, etc.), they didn't compare with non-DNN method, and it is unclear whether DNNs have a performance advantage in the theorem proving domain. \n\nFurthermore, the use of DNNs is not a contribution of this paper. The authors are using exactly the same model architecture as Paliwal et al.\n\n\nBartosz raised a good point, which is also acknowledged by the authors, that [B] also performs premise selection in large knowledge bases without human supervision.\n\n\n\n## The Use TF-IDF\n\nThe authors mentioned that their method uses TF-IDF only during training but not during evaluation. Is this a significant design choice? What will happen if we also include premises selected by TF-IDF during evaluation?\n\n\nUsing TF-IDF for premise selection seems to be simplistic. It essentially selects premises that are similar to the current goal in a very shallow sense (treating both as bags of tokens).  Conceptually, the right premise does not need to be similar to the goal. Since TF-IDF works empirically, I'm wondering if authors have tried alternative methods for exploration in premise selection. If TF-IDF works, I would guess there is a large space of methods that are at least as good as TF-IDF.\n\nRelated to the previous question, maybe the right premise is frequently similar to the goal in HOL Light. But I'm not sure if that's universally true for other proof systems.\n\nWhat is the vocabulary for TF-IDF? How large is it?\n\n\n\n## Additional Questions\n\nWhile addressing theorem proving, the paper actually focuses on premise selection. How important is premise selection compared to selecting the right tactic? Maybe it would help to give an estimate of the number of tactics and the number of potential premises.  Also, different proof assistants may have a different number of tactics. Maybe HOL Light has only a handful of simple tactics, while its expressiveness relies heavily on premises. There may be other proof assistants with more complex designs in the space of tactics.  If that's the case, the proposed method may not generalize beyond HOL Light.\n\nAre there tactics taking more than one premises? And how is it handled?\n\nIn the introduction, the authors state, \"We establish the underlying properties of the proof assistant ... that makes our approach work.\" Maybe I have missed it, but I didn't see any experiments about the underlying properties of the proof assistant.\n\n\nIn the bootstrapping ablation: \"we try to understand to what extent is the failure a bootstrapping issue\". What do the authors mean by \"bootstrapping issue\"?\n\n\n\n## Additional Comments\n\nIt would be great to use bold font in Table 1 to mark the best method.\n\nIf the dropout doesn't bring any statistically significant benefit, it would be better to remove it from the paper."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2255/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2255/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Reason in Large Theories without Imitation", "authorids": ["~Kshitij_Bansal1", "~Christian_Szegedy1", "~Markus_Norman_Rabe1", "sarahmloos@gmail.com", "vtoman@ist.ac.at"], "authors": ["Kshitij Bansal", "Christian Szegedy", "Markus Norman Rabe", "Sarah M.

This was in the appendix, so might have been missed -- \"Some parameters are picked independently by each prover. These are picked uniformly at random from a given interval, are indicated below as $[n_1, n_2]$.\" For $k_2$, in explore experiments the range is $[0,8]$. The upper bound is informed by a side-experiment discussed in Section 4.2.\n\n\"instead of choosing $k_1$ and $k_2$ at hand, could we use a bandit algorithm for selecting premises? Here, the \u201ccontext/user\u201d would be the theorem to prove, and the \u201citems/documents\u201d would be the candidate premises.\"\n- We would like to note that even after picking $k_1$ or $k_2$, the hard part really is to find which $k_1$ or $k_2$ sized subset of premises to pick out of 20000 available premises. So we are guessing under this suggestion, that there is ranking already available? If so, we agree with the reviewer that it might be possible to further improve the results by fine-tuning this as well other hyperparameters picked from a range. That said, our focus in this work was to come up with a ranking in the first place, which is the hard part. As we mentioned above, we did not tune as it would be computationally prohibitive.  So rather than picking a fixed value in a experiment, we are making attempts over the course of a single experiment with different values to add more diversity.\n\n\"it would be nice to give more details about the (higher-order) language used to define expressions\"\n- Thanks for the suggestion, we will add more detail and update the rebuttal revision."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2255/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2255/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Reason in Large Theories without Imitation", "authorids": ["~Kshitij_Bansal1", "~Christian_Szegedy1", "~Markus_Norman_Rabe1", "sarahmloos@gmail.com", "vtoman@ist.ac.at"], "authors": ["Kshitij Bansal", "Christian Szegedy", "Markus Norman Rabe", "Sarah M.

We have updated Appendix B to address this question in detail. Briefly: the best zero loop takes 1.35 times the resources taken by the best human loop to reach 50% (continuous) validation performance. Looking purely locally at generating actions, the impact of adding tf-idf ranking doesn't add much relative to other components. Please take a look at Appendix B.3 let us know if it addresses your question.\n\n* \"with enough time resources, even zero-reference can eventually match zero-explore\" -- theoretically, yes, but practically, we think it will take several orders of magnitude more resources.\n\n* On for final question/comment. We looked at the average proof length statistic (of theorems that were proven on continuous validation at each round), and do not see a clear trend/difference there (across rounds, or human-vs-non human). That said, we think your intuition about \"branching factor\" is probably correct in the sense that there is already a very large \"branching factor\" for premise selection at the first step itself for tactic parameters. For tactics that take theorem parameters, the premise selection is picking a theorem from a knowledge base of up to 20,000 theorems.  For tactics that take theorem parameter lists, it is a subset of theorem parameters, if we restrict to 20 theorems, there is a really large number of possible actions (20000 choose 20).

Even when subgoals are syntactically similar, their proofs can be very different. Thus utilizing as-is short proof of H given a newly generated G (where G and H are similar) might not help much. In our experience, syntactic similarity (tf-idf-based or otherwise) is inferior to the semantic representations that deep neural networks can capture when given enough training data ([Lee et al., 2020] is an excellent example). In our work, tf-idf is a mechanism for bootstrapping and RL exploration, in order to train a deep neural network (graph neural networks in our case) for premise selection. The deep neural network becomes the dominant force, and does the heavy lifting.\n\n(2) Yes, the numbers are comparable as mentioned in Appendix A: \"To keep this work comparable to prior results on the HOList benchmark, we have verified that the timeout and maximum explored nodes are the same as in Paliwal et al. [2020]. We have also verified that the results in Bansal et al. [2019] are within half a percent of the reported results with these timeout and maximum explored nodes.\".

[A;C] are experiments for RL in proof search, but do not address the issue of premise selection from a large knowledge base in any way.\n\nWe are also happy to elaborate on the difference with Gauthier et al. (2017). In our work, tf-idf is a mechanism for bootstrapping and RL exploration, in order to train a deep neural network (graph neural networks in our case) for premise selection. In the final evaluation (validation performance), only the deep neural network itself is used for premise selection. On the other hand, Gauthier et al. (2017) rely on a static tf-idf based similarity metric alone for premise selection.\n\nThis is important since deep neural networks (*if there is enough training data*) are superior [Alemi et al 2016, Wang et al. 2017, Paliwal et al. 2020] for premise selection from large knowledge bases. This is because they are able to learn more semantic representations, not relying on purely syntactic aspects such as what terms or operators appear. This is the reason most recents works for premise selection use deep neural networks. The difference between use of only tf-idf to deep neural networks on the HOList benchmark is also demonstrated in our paper (Section 6, Ablation Studies).\n\nThese state-of-the-art approaches for premise selection have so far relied on human proof data. We remove this reliance with a novel learning system, inspired from ideas that were only used separately in previous works. Our evaluation and ablation studies (see Sections 5 and 6) establish that the separate pieces alone do not suffice. Also, we provide a side-by-side comparison of the final theorem proving performance in the presence and absence of human proofs -- something that has been lacking in the literature.\n\nReferences\n- Thibault Gauthier, Cezary Kaliszyk, and Josef Urban.

In [B] there are 3 experimental scenarios in which premise selection is performed. The first two of them, indeed, do use human-originating training examples. However, in the last scenario, which is the main experiment of the paper, we start with no training proofs at all (neither human-originating nor purely ATP-originating). When the learning-proving feedback loop is started, the prover makes an initial pass using standard settings and a low time limit, and attempts to find proofs using all the premises allowed by the chronology in the formal library. Then the loop bootstraps from the few simple proofs found in this way; the premise selection model may be trained to provide the advice, more proofs is found, the model becomes stronger, etc. \n\nThe scenario of starting with zero training proofs was used in a (much) earlier work too [D].

The key idea of this study lies in the choice of premises for helping the prover. Here, the list of premises is formed by interleaving $k_1$ premises of highest score and $k_2$ premises to explore. The sublist of exploration premises is generated using a standard TF-IDF metric. The authors study how many extra premises can be added before the prover fails. They also propose a simple pruning technique for rapidly demoting irrelevant premises and promoting potentially relevant ones. Experiments using the HOLlist framework corroborate the interest of the approach.\n\nOverall, this approach is conceptually simple and the experimental results look promising. Yet, I am not entirely convinced that this study provides a novel contribution since it is essentially using well-known techniques.\n\nMy main comment is that the hyper-parameters $k_1$ and $k_2$ have been carefully tuned, according to the table in Appendix A. It seems that the problem of choosing the top-k premises (included exploration premises) is intimately connected to online learning to rank with top-k feedback (e.g. Chaudhuri & Tewari, 2017). So, instead of choosing $k_1$ and $k_2$ at hand, could we use a bandit algorithm for selecting premises? Here, the \u201ccontext/user\u201d would be the theorem to prove, and the \u201citems/documents\u201d would be the candidate premises. \n\nAs a minor comment, it would be nice to give more details about the (higher-order) language used to define expressions. It would help the reader in understanding more precisely the components of $r(G)$ and $r(P)$. \n\n----\nSougata Chaudhuri and Ambuj Tewari. Online learning to rank with top-k feedback.

The paper views premise selection as an information retrieval problem where the goal to prove is the query and the knowledge base of previously proven theorems is the document set. The proposed method achieves better theorem proving performance than systems purely trained on human proofs, and approaches the performance of a prover trained by a combination of imitation and reinforcement learning. Overall, the paper is well organized and easy to follow.\n\nReasons to accept the paper:\n1. The paper demonstrates that training the theorem prover without human data can succeed when using deep reinforcement learning.\n2. The paper provides a side-by-side comparison of the effect of the availability of human proofs on the final theorem proving performance.\n3. Experimental results show that the theorem prover trained without human proofs outperforms provers that are trained only on human proofs. Also, multiple ablation studies are provided to understand the underlying properties of the proof assistant and reinforcement learning setup.\n\nReasons to reject the paper:\n1. The computational complexity and cost of the proposed method is not discussed in detail. Since the method is proposed to reason in large theories, the training efficiency should be important.\n2. The proposed method relies on tf-idf based premises selection, which may limit the application scenario of the proposed method.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2255/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2255/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Reason in Large Theories without Imitation", "authorids": ["~Kshitij_Bansal1", "~Christian_Szegedy1", "~Markus_Norman_Rabe1", "sarahmloos@gmail.com", "vtoman@ist.ac.at"], "authors": ["Kshitij Bansal", "Christian Szegedy", "Markus Norman Rabe", "Sarah M.
