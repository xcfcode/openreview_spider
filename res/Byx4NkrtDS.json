In particular both points #1 and #2 address the novelty concerns raised by reviewer #3. \n\nThe main changes are:\n\n1) Following reviewer 2's suggestion, we added a modular system composed of PosNet, MemNet and an action selection module. This modular system was able to perform well on both topological and metric tasks, surpassing the performance of any individual network we trained.  The success of modular system roots in understanding of tradeoff postulated in most part of paper. \n\n2) We compared our two-stage learning to a direct end-to-end protocol, in which we modify the entire connectivity to perform the various tasks. The main conclusions from this comparison are: (A) Two-stage learning is faster than end-to-end. (B) Good performance on topological tasks could only be achieved with two-stage learning.(C) Performance on metric tasks(except implicit context) is similar.  (D) Generalization (transfer) to new tasks is better for two-stage learning. This implies potential to use our methods in other multiple tasks learning(meta learning) problems. \n\n3) We repeated our dynamics analysis for LSTM units, revealing qualitatively similar behavior.\n\n4) We improved the clarity of text and figures:\n4.1) Example trajectories are provided in figure 2 and in the appendix.\n4.2) Figure 4 was remade, and the slow point concept illustrated with a cartoon.\n4.3) Pre-training description was improved.\n\n5) We added in the discussion part: possible reason for trade-off between different dynamics according to request of both reviewer 1 and 2.\n\n6) Note that the new experiments (end-to-end, modular, LSTM) were only done for a small number of networks due to the time constraint, and we will gather more statistics for the final version.\n\nWe hope these changes strengthen the paper in the eyes of the reviewers. \nWe will be happy to answer any further questions.\n\nSincerely,\nThe authors."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1651/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1651/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Implementing Inductive bias for different navigation tasks through diverse RNN attrractors", "authors": ["Tie XU", "Omri Barak"], "authorids": ["fexutie@gmail.com", "omri.barak@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["navigation", "Recurrent Neural Networks", "dynamics", "inductive bias", "pre-training", "reinforcement learning"], "TL;DR": "Task agnostic pre-training can shape RNN's attractor landscape, and form diverse inductive bias for different navigation tasks   ", "abstract": "Navigation is crucial for animal behavior and is assumed to require an internal representation of the external environment, termed a cognitive map.

Accurate path integration implies an ability to marginalize over stimulus memory and other features to obtain a clean version of the position. In principle, accurate decoding of the position could be done even if the hidden state contains all the other information. However, perhaps a more \"natural\" way is to allow the dynamics to suppress these aspects of the representation, and thus facilitate readout of the desired position information.\n\nFurthermore, the attractor landscape picture provides a dynamical reason for the tradeoff.

Additional details provided.", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for appreciating the novelty of our work, and for the thoughtful comments.\n\nQ1) I think the presentation the pretraining objective (eq 3) could be clearer. Is eq 3 what is minimized during pre-training? How are \\alpha, \\beta, and \\gamma chosen? \\alpha is used to separate the two types of networks (MemNet from PosNet), which is the critical difference studied in the paper, so it would helpful to go into more detail about what \\alpha controls and how it was chosen.\n\nA1) This part will be rewritten for clarity. Yes - Eq. 3 is minimized during pre-training. The ratio between alpha and beta controls the relative strength/tradeoff of memory and position. We found that, in general, with $\\alpha$ larger than 0 , the position representation dominates over the memory one. The exact values were chosen manually through trial and error.\n\n\nQ2) For the first task, I am surprised that the agent is able to navigate the environment using only the eight neighboring locations. What is the size of the arena? What fraction of the states are simply surrounded on all sides by empty space? It would be informative to show some trajectories of agents solving the basic task.\nA2) We were initially also surprised by this. The size is 15 (will be written clearly), which means that 161 (8 reward + 56 border) out of 225 are surrounded by empty space (71.5 %).  The agent is able to perform the task because it collects information into its recurrent dynamics. The information is gathered continuously in the trajectory, and not only from wall encounters. For instance, in many trials the agent reaches the reward before touching the wall twice \u2013 that is, without full metric information.  Regarding the size of arena,   we were able to train networks on the topological tasks for large arenas (50x50, 92% empty). We will include several example trajectories in the supplementary material, illustrating the various ways in which the agent solves the task.\n\nQ3) For Fig 3A and 3B, it would be nice to show the other network's performance (i.e. show the PosNet on the scaling task in 3A, and the MemNet on the bar task in 3B). \nA4) We will add this.\n\nQ4) How come there are no networks that are able to solve both sets of tasks? That is, how come there are no networks in the upper right region of Fig 3C? Does this suggest that an agent needs to combine two separate RNNs to solve the whole suite of tasks?\nA4) We think this is indeed the case (as we mention in the discussion). We tried to carefully select networks (post-hoc) and could get a partial improvement towards the upper right, but still there was a tradeoff.\nWe will also train a modular network to perform the task, but are not sure whether the results will be ready in one week.\n\nQ5) What happens if you train recurrent networks with more sophisticated cell architectures (e.g. a GRU or an LSTM)? These are typically easier to train (and using automatic differentiation techniques are also amenable to fixed point analysis).\nA5) We will train the gated architectures on the task and analyze them. Initially, we did use GRU for the task, and found that a vanilla RNN with the average effective timescale performs as well. We thus chose the \u201csimpler\u201d model. It is true that fixed point analysis can be equally applied to the more sophisticated architectures, and we will do this. Preliminary results show that pre-training LSTM networks for PosNet results in similar topology to the vanilla case.\n\nQ6) ## Minor comments\n- In eq. (1), use `\\left(` and `\\right)` to make the first set of parentheses have an appropriate height.\n- Typo on the first line after eq. (6) (matrices)\n- Relevant reference on comparing networks using dynamics around approximate fixed points: \nA6) Will be fixed. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1651/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1651/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Implementing Inductive bias for different navigation tasks through diverse RNN attrractors", "authors": ["Tie XU", "Omri Barak"], "authorids": ["fexutie@gmail.com", "omri.barak@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["navigation", "Recurrent Neural Networks", "dynamics", "inductive bias", "pre-training", "reinforcement learning"], "TL;DR": "Task agnostic pre-training can shape RNN's attractor landscape, and form diverse inductive bias for different navigation tasks   ", "abstract": "Navigation is crucial for animal behavior and is assumed to require an internal representation of the external environment, termed a cognitive map.

(e.g no technical novelty in eq. 1 and eq. 2)\n\nA1) These equations are indeed not novel \u2013 they are the dynamics of a simple RNN and appear in the \u201cTask Definition\u201d section where we define the framework. The novel aspects, which appear later, are: (1) Using a neuroscience inspired pre-training protocol. (2) Showing how pretraining biases subsequent RL performance on different tasks. (3) Uncovering the mechanistic reason for this bias. Namely, different arrangements of slow points in the phase space of the recurrent network.   \n\nQ2) The experimental results are weak and only a simple domain is tested.  \nA2) We chose a simple domain to increase our analysis power. In particular, this choice enabled a more systematic study of many tasks and networks than would be feasible for a more complex setting. Our choice of a simple domain also allowed for an easier interpretation of the slow point analysis which revealed that the underlying mechanism behind the effect of pre-training is the dynamical objects. The correlation between slow points and task features is easier to see in our setting.\nPretraining is also used in other domains such as NLP or image recognition (Devlin et al. 2018, You et al. 2015). We believe that obtaining deeper understanding in a simple setting could pave the way for implementations in other domains in the future.\n\n\nAs for the weakness of the experimental results \u2013 we are not sure we completely understand this comment and would welcome clarification. Figures 2 and 3 clearly show a tradeoff between the two pretraining protocols, and figure 4 shows different dynamical objects (the clarity of this figure will be improved). These are the two main results, and we believe the data support them.    \n\nQ3) It is not clear how efficient the method would be compared to other approaches.\nA3) We performed additional experiments that address this point. We trained the network using end-to-end learning, without pretraining. This was done both by extending our Q-learning to start from random networks, and by an adaptation of a different method (DDPG, Heess et al. ). These experiments show that: (1) Training in our pre-training protocol is faster. (2) Performance in our pre-training protocol is much better for the topological tasks (end-to-end was not able to learn it), and it is comparable in most metric tasks. \nWe believe these new results strengthen the case for the importance of inductive bias in the form of discrete fixed points to learn the topological tasks.\n\nQ4) Visualizations can be improved. As an example, Fig. 4 is not quite self-representative.\nA4) We thank the reviewer for this comment. The visualizations will be improved. In particular, we will better illustrate the main points of figure 4.\n\nReferences:\nHeess, N., Hunt, J. J., Lillicrap, T. P., & Silver, D. (2015).

The main result of the paper is obtained by finding the slow points of the dynamics of the trained RNNs. The paper finds that the RNNs pre-trained to use path integration contain 2D continuous attractors, allowing position memory. On the other hand, the RNNs pre-trained for landmark memory contain discrete attractors corresponding to the different landmarks.\n\nAn interesting implication of the findings for neuroscience is that the same underlying network architecture can learn different dynamics, explaining diverse types of navigation-related signals found in the mammalian brain (place cells, border cells etc.).\n\nI am not entirely sure about the novelty or impact of the presented results. However, the exposition and the results are clear and it is interesting how pre-training can shape the dynamics of a network. I therefore recommend acceptance.\n\nMinor comments:\n- Please describe how the networks 1, 13, 20 used for Figure 4 were selected. Were they selected at random or selected according to some criteria?\n- It may be interesting to study the effect of more modern RNNs, e.g. LSTMs or GRUs, on the dynamics.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1651/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1651/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Implementing Inductive bias for different navigation tasks through diverse RNN attrractors", "authors": ["Tie XU", "Omri Barak"], "authorids": ["fexutie@gmail.com", "omri.barak@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["navigation", "Recurrent Neural Networks", "dynamics", "inductive bias", "pre-training", "reinforcement learning"], "TL;DR": "Task agnostic pre-training can shape RNN's attractor landscape, and form diverse inductive bias for different navigation tasks   ", "abstract": "Navigation is crucial for animal behavior and is assumed to require an internal representation of the external environment, termed a cognitive map.

First, networks are pretrained on an objective that either emphasizes position (path integration) or landmark memory (identity of the last wall encountered). This pretraining generates recurrent networks of two classes, called PosNets and MemNets (in addition to no pre-training, called RandNets). Surprisingly, the authors found that pre-training confers different benefits that manifests as differential performance of PosNets and MemNets across the suite. Some evidence is provided that this difference has to do with the requirements of the task. Moreover, the authors show how the different pretraining manifests as different dynamical structures (measured using fixed point analyses) present in the networks after pre-training. In particular, the PosNets contained a 2D plane attractor (used to readout position), whereas the MemNets contained clusters of fixed points (corresponding to the previously encountered landmark).\n\nOverall, I thought this was a very interesting paper--it is one of the first papers I have seen that demonstrates how different pre-training requirements both change network dynamics (as measured by fixed points), and how those differences can yield different benefits on downstream navigational tasks.\n\n## Major comments/concerns\n- I think the presentation the pretraining objective (eq 3) could be clearer. Is eq 3 what is minimized during pre-training? How are \\alpha, \\beta, and \\gamma chosen? \\alpha is used to separate the two types of networks (MemNet from PosNet), which is the critical difference studied in the paper, so it would helpful to go into more detail about what \\alpha controls and how it was chosen.\n\n- For the first task, I am surprised that the agent is able to navigate the environment using only the eight neighboring locations. What is the size of the arena? What fraction of the states are simply surrounded on all sides by empty space? It would be informative to show some trajectories of agents solving the basic task.\n\n- For Fig 3A and 3B, it would be nice to show the other network's performance (i.e. show the PosNet on the scaling task in 3A, and the MemNet on the bar task in 3B).\n\n- How come there are no networks that are able to solve both sets of tasks? That is, how come there are no networks in the upper right region of Fig 3C? Does this suggest that an agent needs to combine two separate RNNs to solve the whole suite of tasks?\n\n- What happens if you train recurrent networks with more sophisticated cell architectures (e.g. a GRU or an LSTM)? These are typically easier to train (and using automatic differentiation techniques are also amenable to fixed point analysis).\n\n## Minor comments\n- In eq. (1), use `\\left(` and `\\right)` to make the first set of parentheses have an appropriate height.\n- Typo on the first line after eq. (6) (matrices)\n- Relevant reference on comparing networks using dynamics around approximate fixed points: https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08549."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1651/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1651/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Implementing Inductive bias for different navigation tasks through diverse RNN attrractors", "authors": ["Tie XU", "Omri Barak"], "authorids": ["fexutie@gmail.com", "omri.barak@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["navigation", "Recurrent Neural Networks", "dynamics", "inductive bias", "pre-training", "reinforcement learning"], "TL;DR": "Task agnostic pre-training can shape RNN's attractor landscape, and form diverse inductive bias for different navigation tasks   ", "abstract": "Navigation is crucial for animal behavior and is assumed to require an internal representation of the external environment, termed a cognitive map.
