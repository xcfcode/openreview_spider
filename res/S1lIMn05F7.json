On the other hand our work is more focused on the defense using GAN, and we co-train the adversarial noise generator together with the discriminative network for classification (not the network for ensuring noisy images look like the original).  We didn't include Lee et al. 2018 in our original version, and it has been included in the updated veresion. Lee et al. 2017 also tried to use GAN to defend against adversarial attacks, but there are two main difference to our work. First, the inputs to their generative network is the gradient of the discriminative network with respect to the image x, not just the image x as in our current work. This causes complex dependence of the gradient of the generative network parameters to the discriminative network parameters, and makes the parameter updates for the generative network more complicated. Second, there doesn't seem to be a single minimax objective that they are solving for in their work; the update rules for networks D and G optimize related but different objectives. Our work on the other hand has only one minimax objective, and the updates on D and G networks are directly derived from it. \n\nAnd as for the attacks suggested by the reviewers, we didn't include them for various reasons. \nTargeted FGS is more useful when there are many close categories like ImageNet.  Since we are mostly dealing with datasets with small number of classes (10) in this paper, we believe the marginal benefit of including T-FGS is small since we already have FGS. For C&W attack, it is costly to run and Madry et al. 2018 showed that it is no more powerful than PGD attacks, so we stick to PGD attacks in this paper.  For GAN attacks, the results we have in Table 5 using generative networks to attack undefended models are equivalent to the GAN attacks used in earlier work by Xiao et al. 2018 and Baluja & Fischer 2017. We have also included extra results on GAN attacks on adversarial PGD and our adversarial networks in the Appendix. \n\nFor the question on why undefended models sometimes work better than defended models under black box attacks, it really depends on how the black box attacks are constructed. What we have observed across experiments is that black box attack examples constructed (with FGS or PGD) from models trained using the same method but different random seeds are the most effective in attacking the same type of models. Therefore it is possible for the undefended model to work well against adversarial examples constructed from adversarial PGD(B') or our adversarial network(C') approach, as those adversarial examples might not transfer well to the undefended model. The undefended model is weak in the sense that it has low white box attack accuracies, and also it has the lowest black box accuracies when models of the same type (A') are used to attack it.

However, the generator learned can sometimes be transferred to attack other models, although not necessarily as effective. In Table 5, the generator learned to attack model A, and were then used to attack other models A', B', and C'. It is very effective against A' trained using standard training but with a different random seed, somewhat effective against our adversarial network (C'), taking away close to 10% of accuracy. But it is not effective at all against adversarial PGD (B'). How well these learned generators can transfer to attack other models is an interesting question for further investigation. \n\nThank you for pointing out the issues with table captions.

In contrast to the state-of-the-art \u201censemble adversarial training\u201d approach, which relies on several pre-trained neural networks for generating adversarial examples, the authors introduce a way for dynamically generating adversarial examples on-the-fly by using a generator, which they along with their clean counterparts are then consumed for training the discriminator. \n\nQuality: The paper is relatively well-written, although a little sketchy, and its motivations are clear. The authors compare their proposed approach with a good of variety of strong defenses such as \u201censemble adversarial training\u201d and \u201cPGD adversarial training\u201d, supporting with convincing experiments their approach.\n\nOriginality: Xioa et al. (2018) used very similar technique for generating new adversarial examples (generator attack), then used for training a robust discriminator. Likewise, Lee et al. (2018) also used GANs to produce perturbations for making images misclassified. Given this, what is the main novelty of this approach comparing to the (Xioa et al., 2018) and (Lee et al., 2018)? These references should be discussed in details in the paper.\n\nMoreover, limited comparison with different attacks: Why did not compare against targeted attacks such as T-FGS, C&W or GAN-attack?\n\nIt is really surprising that undefended network is working better (showing more robustness) than the defended network \u201cadversarial PGD\u201d on black-box attacks, why this is happening?\n\nReferences:\n- Xiao, C., Li, B., Zhu, J.

The performance on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR10 demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, and in general, the performance is on par with carefully crafted algorithms for such task. \n\npros\n- the presentation of the approach is clean and easy-to-follow.\n- the proposed network structure is simple, but it surprisingly works well in general. \n- descriptions of training details are reasonable, and the experimental results across several datasets are extensive\n\ncons\n- the network structure may not be novel, though the performance is very nice. \n- there are algorithms that are carefully crafted to perform the network defense mechanism, such as Samangouei et al, 2018. However, the method described in this paper, despite simple, works very good. It would be great if authors can provide more insights on why it works well (though not the best, but still reasonable), besides only demonstrating the experimental results.\n- it would also be nice if authors can visualize the behavior of their design by showing some examples using the dataset they are working on, and provide side-to-side comparisons against other approaches.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1270/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Direct Approach to Robust Deep Learning Using Adversarial Networks", "abstract": "Deep neural networks have been shown to perform well in many classical machine learning problems, especially in image classification tasks.

Thank you for pointing out this issue. We found that the weight decay we use (1E-5) was too small for CIFAR10. By changing the weight decay to 1E-4 the models can achieve accuracies of about 92% on clean data. We will update the results table accordingly. Using a deeper or wider network can push the results to 95% or above. \n\n2. FGSM training, depending on how it's done, could lead to label leakage during test time.
