The paper justifies the value of these datasets as an aid in both understanding and building classifiers that are robust to spurious features, and releases two small examples.\n\nOn my reading, this paper presents a very substantially new idea that is relevant to a major ongoing debate in the applied machine learning literature: How do we build models that learn some intended behavior, where the primary evidence we have of that behavior comes in the form of datasets with spurious correlations/artifacts.\n\nOne reviewer argued for rejection on the grounds that dataset papers are not appropriate for publication at a main conference. I don't find that argument compelling, and I'm also not sure that it's accurate to call this paper primarily a dataset paper. We could not reach a complete consensus after further discussion.

This finding holds across model classes. We have also conducted experiments using ELMo as suggested by R4, further validating the usefulness of counterfactually augmenting data.

We are glad to see that you appreciate the genuine flavor of causality in our paper and support our paper\u2019s acceptance.\n\nWe agree that a formal exposition introducing an NLP/deep learning audience to the basics of interventions and counterfactuals and expressing a toy DAG to explain the spurious associations between the review sentiment and the manifestation in text of other attributes of the review, including but not limited to the genre, actors, budget, etc. We are actively working on preparing this exposition and while it is not yet in the draft we plan to have it prepared in advance of the camera-ready version.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out that we should have been more thorough in explaining that while genre is a clear example of such a spurious association, it is far from the only one captured in Figure 4. Indeed, many other words, including \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cmy\u201d, \u201chas\u201d, \u201cespecially\u201d, \u201clife\u201d, \u201cworks\u201d, \u201cboth\u201d, \u201cit\u201d, \u201cits\u201d, \u201clives\u201d, \u201cgives\u201d, \u201cown\u201d, \u201cjesus\u201d, \u201ccannot\u201d, \u201ceven\u201d, \u201cinstead\u201d, \u201cminutes\u201d, \u201cyour\u201d, \u201ceffort\u201d, \u201cscript\u201d, \u201cseems\u201d, and \u201csomething\u201d, appear to be spuriously associated with sentiment and are captured by the original-only and revised-only classifiers as highly-weighted features., Notably all of these features fall out from the highly-weighted features when our classifier is trained on counterfactually-augmented data.\n\nRegarding the sensitivity of BERT models, Table 9 shows the ability of a model explicitly trained to differentiate between the original and the revised data. This is to shed some insight on how much the two differ (on account of our intervention). Because the two indeed are different, we expect that a model should be able to differentiate them to some degree. We note that a model class\u2019s ability to differentiate between the original and revised data when explicitly trained to do so may not necessarily be correlated with how susceptible that model is to breaking when evaluated out of sample.\n\nWe\u2019re grateful for your comments on exposition and will continue to address these points as we improve the draft.

Of chief importance here is the intellectual contribution casting the problem of learning \u201csuperficial associations\u201d coherently in the language of intervention, and producing a dataset that addresses counterfactuals in a real sense (as pointed out more eloquently by R1).

We are glad that you think of this paper as a timely contribution addressing an important problem that must be addressed in order to build more robust NLP systems.\n\nWe agree with your point that it would be great to have a practical takeaway guiding practitioners for what to do in practice. We believe that the first step here is to characterize the problem coherently and that having laid this groundwork, one immediate next step is, as you suggest, to develop a more practical solution that requires a less expensive/onerous annotation effort. \n\nThe key contribution of our paper is to provide a clear characterization of a variety of concerns in the language of interventions and to demonstrate that indeed, they can be addressed by acquiring interventional data. The knowledge that (i) NLP models trained on counterfactually augmented data suffer less from these problems and (ii) transport better out of sample (see new results in the updated draft, per R3\u2019s suggestion) validates this. \n\nAs you mentioned, our solution requires significant expenditure (both financial and human capital) compared to simply labeling data. As a follow-up, for existing datasets, our next steps include investigating how to make these adjustments in a cost-effective way. In preliminary work, we have been investigating how to use humans in the loop more effectively. One approach involves using generative models to propose candidate substitutions and relying on humans only accept or reject the revisions (vs having to write them from scratch). Our experience with crowdsourcing suggests that this feedback would be significantly cheaper to collect (provided that a reasonable fraction of suggestions were appropriate). \n\nWe additionally note that for some tasks, such as NLI, creating new datasets already requires annotators to synthesize examples de novo and the fractional increase for soliciting counterfactually-augmented data might not be as onerous as compared to tasks where the default is to rely on annotators only for tags.\n\nWe are also appreciative of your constructive suggestions to improve the paper, and have taken several steps to improve the draft. These include updating the draft to include (i) a detailed analysis of edits performed on SNLI, (ii) results on various datasets using an ELMo based classifier; (iii) concerning your question about larger Bi-LSTMs, we had tried a large Bi-LSTM but it overfit badly. We have updated the draft to include this detail. \n\nThanks also for catching several typographic errors.

This is because the original sample and its counterfactual pair the label changed , has the difference in the text that matters to the change and this pair could reduce spurious correlations that models might find in the data distribution. \n\nPros: \n This is a very interesting experiment and certainly the dataset that will be released would be extremely valuable to the community. The one part (I dont have much NLP background but I do have a causality background) that I like most is that the new text generated are counterfactual in some real sense with respect to a real world generating process - that is people modifying text with changed targets.\n\n A lot of existing work that claim to do counterfactual changes do not specify assumptions about the generating mechanism. For counterfactuals to be valid they have to be intervention on the actual generating mechanism (or an assumed one) acting on a given unit (latent) that produced the current sample. The paper in that respect (even if it does not explicitly specify relationship between counterfactuals and generating mechanisms) tries to be faithful to a \"strict causal notion\" by actually asking people to modify the text. \n\nCons:\n    - I think the authors want to make an explicit connection to counterfactuals as understood in the causality community. Then they shy away from it saying they are inspired by it. May be a formal exposition in the supplement about counterfactuals and generating mechanisms could help readers from other communities (NLP) even it means repeating standard/synthetic examples. Its good to say what exactly in a counterfactual generation process, the \"people\" in amazon turk were substituting. \n\n   -  Is the romantic/ horror flips and their absence the only spurious thing in Figure 4 ? \n  -  In figure 6, it appears that BERT is sensitive to the domain - does it mean that it is bad ? - Authors indicate that ideally it must not be so. Because Table 3 results seem to indicate that BERT performs the best in almost all the cases .\n -  Can the authors highlight the best performances in each case in the Tables by a bold face.  It helps easily eye ball the best performing model.\n ", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1305/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1305/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["dkaushik@cs.cmu.edu", "hovy@cmu.edu", "zlipton@cmu.edu"], "title": "Learning The Difference That Makes A Difference With Counterfactually-Augmented Data", "authors": ["Divyansh Kaushik", "Eduard Hovy", "Zachary Lipton"], "pdf": "/pdf/6267805abf4a2ab7b3f971c759b8c669e6060774.pdf", "TL;DR": "Humans in the loop revise documents to accord with counterfactual labels, resulting resource helps to reduce reliance on spurious associations.", "abstract": "Despite alarm over the reliance of machine learning systems on so-called spurious patterns, the term lacks coherent meaning in standard statistical frameworks.

The proposed approach is to ask human annotators to alter examples in a minimal way that changes the label. Thereby the humans separate out the causal features (those changed) from the spurious or irrelevant features (those left unchanged).\n\nExperiments show that classifiers trained on the original data perform poorly on the altered data and vice versa, but (unsurprisingly) training on the union of the two datasets results in a classifier that performs well in both cases. Furthermore, training an SVM on the original results in irrelevant attributes (such as movie genre) being weighted, whereas these weights are largely removed when training on the union of the datasets. This suggests that the augmented training data results in weighting the \"right\" features more.\u00a0\n\nOverall, I think this paper should be accepted because it makes several interesting contributions: It proposes an interesting approach, shows intriguing experimental results, and produces an interesting dataset (size ~2k) that may be useful for future testing.\n\nThe main limitation of the paper is that the evidence is largely circumstantial. The method has intuitive appeal and the experimental results are suggestive, but the experiments do not conclusively show that the method achieves something that ordinary machine learning does not.\n\nMy suggestion for a further experiment would be to apply the movie review classifiers to, say, book reviews -- something where the task is fundamentally the same but the context is different. If the classifier trained on the union of the original and altered datasets performs better than a classifier trained on only on dataset, then that is strong evidence that this approach yields better extrapolation.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1305/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1305/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["dkaushik@cs.cmu.edu", "hovy@cmu.edu", "zlipton@cmu.edu"], "title": "Learning The Difference That Makes A Difference With Counterfactually-Augmented Data", "authors": ["Divyansh Kaushik", "Eduard Hovy", "Zachary Lipton"], "pdf": "/pdf/6267805abf4a2ab7b3f971c759b8c669e6060774.pdf", "TL;DR": "Humans in the loop revise documents to accord with counterfactual labels, resulting resource helps to reduce reliance on spurious associations.", "abstract": "Despite alarm over the reliance of machine learning systems on so-called spurious patterns, the term lacks coherent meaning in standard statistical frameworks.

They refer to this process as counterfactual augmentation.  The authors apply this method to the IMDB sentiment dataset and to SNLI and show (among other things) that many models cannot generalize from the original dataset to the counterfactually-augmented one.\n\nThis contribution is timely and addresses a very important problem that needs to be addressed in order to build more robust NLP systems.\n\nBecause, however, of a few limitations, I recommend weak acceptance.\n\nMy main hesitation comes from a lack of clarity about the main lesson we have learned.  In particular, if the goal is to use this method to augment the data we use to train NLP systems in order to make them more robust, it seems that the time cost of the process will be prohibitive.  On the other hand, perhaps these methods could be used to identify the kind of spurious correlations that models tend to rely on, which could then be used in a more automated data augmentation process.  If that's the goal, however, a more detailed error analysis would need to be included.\n\nA few small comments:\n\n* There was some analysis of the augmented IMDB dataset, but none of the SNLI dataset.  I would love to see a more detailed investigation of what annotators usually did.  For instance, a reason that hypothesis-only models do well is that certain words are very predictive of certain labels (e.g. \"not\" and contradiction).  Do people leave the negations in when modifying such examples for entailment or neutrality, thus breaking the simple correspondence?  That's a very simple kind of question; more generally, I'd like to see more analysis of the new dataset.\n\n* The BiLSTM they use is very small (embedding and hidden dimension 50).  Given that BERT is most robust against their manipulation, it would be good to see a more powerful recurrent model for comparison.  It would be easy to use ELMo here, if the main question is about Transformers vs recurrent models.\n\n\nSome very minor / typographic comments:\n\n* abstract: \"with revise\" should be \"with revising\"\n* first paragraph page 2: some references to causality literature and definition of spuriousness as common cause\n* page 2, \"We show that...\" I'd break this into two sentences to make it easier to parse.\n* Table 3: I would make two columns for each model with accuracy on original versus revised.  With the current table, one has to compare cells in the top half of the table to those in the bottom half of the table, which is quite difficult to do."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1305/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1305/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["dkaushik@cs.cmu.edu", "hovy@cmu.edu", "zlipton@cmu.edu"], "title": "Learning The Difference That Makes A Difference With Counterfactually-Augmented Data", "authors": ["Divyansh Kaushik", "Eduard Hovy", "Zachary Lipton"], "pdf": "/pdf/6267805abf4a2ab7b3f971c759b8c669e6060774.pdf", "TL;DR": "Humans in the loop revise documents to accord with counterfactual labels, resulting resource helps to reduce reliance on spurious associations.", "abstract": "Despite alarm over the reliance of machine learning systems on so-called spurious patterns, the term lacks coherent meaning in standard statistical frameworks.
