They also report promising empirical results in the game of Hex, with varying board sizes.  I found the paper to be well-written and easy to read, possibly due to revisions in the rebuttal discussions.\n\nThe reviewers consider the contribution to be small, mainly due to the fact that the key algorithmic insights were already published decades ago.  Reintroducing them is a service to the community, but its novelty is limited.  Other critiques mentioned that results in Hex only provide limited understanding of the algorithm's behavior in general Alternating Markov games.  The lack of comparison with modern methods like AlphaGo Zero was also mentioned as a limitation.\n\nBottom line: The paper provides a small but useful contribution to the community, as described above, and the committee recommends it for workshop.\n", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Policy Gradient for Alternating Markov Games", "abstract": "Policy gradient reinforcement learning has been applied to two-player alternate-turn zero-sum games, e.g., in AlphaGo, self-play REINFORCE was used to improve the neural net model after supervised learning.

We have also included a comparison with ExIt. It appears that ExIt might not as strong as MoHex 2.0 (the ExIt paper was comparing their player with MoHex 2011).  Another advantage of our new player is that it is able to play on multiple board size with only one trained model, while ExIt is limited on 9x9. \n\nDetained responses are in below. \n\nThe methods ExIt (I assume you mean ExIt by saying HexIt) and AlphaGo Zero are similar. They work well but one problem is the computation cost is very high. For example, when applied to chess and shogi, it is mentioned that 5000 TPUs were used for MCTS self-play data generation. \n\nFor ExIt, by the time our paper is submitted, only first version is available on arxiv, though we are aware their work has been accepted in NIPS 2017.  The newest version can be found from this URL.\n https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08439\n\nThey did all experiments on 9x9 Hex. In the first version on arxiv,  their player is a search+NN player not pure neural net.  \nOn other hand hand, even if the learned neural net policy itself is strong by following MCTS, it is likely the playing strength of this pure neural net can be improved by doing a policy gradient on it, though after such a policy gradient, the policy might not good for Monte-carlo tree search any more (as shown by first Alphago paper).  \n\nIn the newest version, they compared their policy_value net + MCTS player with MoHex 2011, however, there is MoHex 2.0, which is much stronger than MoHex 2011. \n\nExIt only conducts experiments on 9x9 Hex. It is not very clear how much time could be used to produce significant results on larger board size, such as 11x11, presumably, this is not a easy task with only one GPU computer. We note that even ExIt was specially applied only to this board size, MoHex 2.0 and our new program both seem to be able achieve better playing results than ExIt. \n\nOur AMCPG-A or AMCPG-B follows traditional \u201clight self-play\u201d. No tree was built. To estimate the \u201cminimum\u201d critic, extra roll-outs are conducted. But it is very much due to the Monte-Calro nature of the method, and that is why we mention an actor-critic style might be more efficient. Our methods work essentially similar as traditional policy gradient, that's why we only compared with REINFORCE variants. \n\nWe argue that it could be unfair to say that our better results compared to classic REINFORCE is merely due to extra roll-outs.  One can see that in REINFORCE-B, extra roll-outs are also conducted the same way as AMCPG-A and AMCPG-B.  Their extra computation costs due to extra roll-out are the same.  However, the results in Figure 2 suggests that REINFORCE-B has similar performance as REINFORCE-A and REINFORCE-V.

Experiments show that this provides faster progress per iteration on the game of Hex against a fixed third party opponent.\n\nThere is no comparison against state of the art methods like AlphaGo Zero which uses MCTS root move distribution and MCTS rollouts outcome to train policy and value network, even though the author do cite this work. There is also no comparison with Hexit which also trains policy net on MCTS move distribution, and was also applied to Hex.\n\nThe actual proposed method is actually a one liner change, which could be introduced much sooner in the paper to save the reader some time. While the idea is interesting, the paper felt quite verbose on introducing notations and related work, and a bit lacking on actual change that is being proposed and the experiment to back it up.\n\nFor example,  was it really necessary to introduce state transition probabilities p(s\u2019, a, s) when all the experiments are done in the deterministic game of Hex ?\n\nAlso the experiment seems not fully fair to the reinforce baseline. My understand is that the proposed method is much more costly due to extra rollouts that are needed.

I found myself reading and re-reading descriptions to make sure I understood what math was being implied by the descriptions.\n\nSection 6\n\n> Hex is simpler than Go in the sense that perfect play can \n> often be achieved whenever virtual connections are found \n> by H-Search\n\nIt is not clear here what virtual connections are, what H-Search is, and how these imply perfect play, if perfect play as previously discussed is unknown.\n\nOverall, the results on Hex for AMCPG-A and AMCPG-B vs. standard REINFORCE variants currently used are very encouraging.  That said, empirically it is always a question of whether these results are specific to Hex.  Because this paper is not proposing the best Hex player (i.e., the winning rate against Wolve never exceeds 0.5), I think it is quite reasonable to request the authors to compare AMCPG-A and AMCPG-B to standard REINFORCE variants on other games (they do not need to be as difficult as Hex).\n\nFinally, assuming that the results do generalize to other games, I am left wondering about the significance of the contribution.  On one hand, the authors have introduced me to literature I was not aware of, but on the other hand, their actual novel contribution is a rather straightforward adaptation of ideas in the literature to policy gradients (that could be formalized in a more technically precise way) with an evaluation on a single type of game.  This is a useful contribution no doubt, but I am concerned with whether it meets the significance level that I am used to with accepted ICLR papers in previous years.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Policy Gradient for Alternating Markov Games", "abstract": "Policy gradient reinforcement learning has been applied to two-player alternate-turn zero-sum games, e.g., in AlphaGo, self-play REINFORCE was used to improve the neural net model after supervised learning.

In our experiments, training is very fast, took only a few hours on 9x9 and 11x11 Hex. Since all training/evaluation are conducted on the same computer with a single GTX 1080 GPU. We briefly list the detailed training time for each method here: \n  \n9x9 Hex:  total time usage for 400 iterations training: \nAMCPG-A: k=1: about 1 h 40 m,  k=3: about 2.5 h,  k=6: 4h 10 minutes, k=9: about 6h\nAMCPG-B:  similar as above\nREINFORCE-B:  similar as above\nREINFORCE-A: 1 hour 15 minutes\nREINFORCE-V: 1 hour 20 minutes\n\n11x11 Hex: \nAMCPG-A: k=1: about 3h15 minutes, k=3: about 5h, k=6: about 9h, k=9: about 12h\nAMCPG-B: similar as above\nREINFORCE-B:  similar as above,\nREINFORCE-A: 2.5 hours\nREINFORCE-V: 2.5 hours\n\nIn fact, most of our time was not spending on training the neural net, but for evaluation the neural net model by playing against Wolve, as Wolve's search is orders of magnitude slower than a pure neural net player. \n\nWe note that, even though a pure neural net self-play training might not be able to provide state-of-the-art playing, such methods have its own merits.  For example, due to their fast speed, the first version of Alphago uses such a method for generating data to train a value net which is useful in search. \n\nOn other hand hand, even though search+NN self-play might also be able to learn a neural net policy that itself can play strongly. It is likely that such a neural net could be further improved by  policy gradient. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Policy Gradient for Alternating Markov Games", "abstract": "Policy gradient reinforcement learning has been applied to two-player alternate-turn zero-sum games, e.g., in AlphaGo, self-play REINFORCE was used to improve the neural net model after supervised learning.

But, as the reviewer has pointed out, perhaps it is because of the difference in terminology, those classic works were much \"unknown\" for many researchers.\n\nIn this paper, we brought those again to the community, one goal is to stimulate more thorough thinking about the difference between two-player alternate-turn games and single agent MDPs.  It is apparent that two-player alternate-turn zero-sum games are more \"challenging\" in many aspects. A more careful examination about the fundamental differences between AMGs and MDPs will perhaps help people develop more effective/efficient RL methods specifically for this domain. \n\nWe only did our experiments on the game of Hex, primarily because this is the game we are most familiar. But it should be noted that we didn't conduct any game specific modifications when applying those AMCPG variants to this specific game, just as  REINFORCE. \n\nIt is true that doing more games would be more convincing; however, due to various constraint (i.e., hardware constraint, knowledge about other games), we did not manage to have an attempt in this direction while writing this paper. \n\nAs for advancing the state-of-art,  the state-of-the-art for Hex are still search based methods. In the first version we submitted, we did not attempt to advance the state-of-art, since we were concentrated on introducing new fast and better policy gradient methods. \n\nHowever, after receiving the reviewers' comments about state-of-art, we proceed to combine our neural net with search, and the resulting program is indeed be able to surpass MoHex 2.0. \n\nMost notably, we use a single model for multiple board sizes, the new program consistently defeats MoHex 2.0 on every board size.  This is much due to the architecture we introduced, where we deliberately removed fully connected layers, so that the learned parameter weights can generalize to multiple board sizes.\n\nSince expert data is often difficult to obtain or generate, while generating expert data on smaller board is usually much easier and cheaper than larger board sizes, our result provides an encouraging direction for more efficient learning on games which has similar characteristics as Hex (e.g., other connection games). \n\nWe have also investigated \u201cminimum return\u201d in Monte-carlo tree search, experimental results show that incorporating \u201cminimum playout\u201d also improved MCTS. \n\nFuture work direction is using value net in pure neural net training as well as use it to replace the playout in MCTS.  However, different from previous work, we argue that a \u201cmin\u201d operator might be able to lead better results in alternating markov games. \n\nWe have included a psude-code for Algo.1, Algo.2 and Algo.3 in the appendix, which provides a more formal discription about each procedure. Also, explanation about Virtual Connections and H-Search have been added  in the revised paper. \n\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Policy Gradient for Alternating Markov Games", "abstract": "Policy gradient reinforcement learning has been applied to two-player alternate-turn zero-sum games, e.g., in AlphaGo, self-play REINFORCE was used to improve the neural net model after supervised learning.
