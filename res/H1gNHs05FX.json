Why not so in your case? How do you make sure your comparison is fair in this case?\"\"\"\nThe outcomes of interest are not marked, but the features may be.  Thus, if our features processing e.g. in Hawkes captures the timing but not the mark, there is no contribution of marks to the hazard, but the hazard remainds finite.  W.r.t. fairness, our goal is to compare against (1) closely related classic baselines and (2) closest recent methods.  Hawkes is a closesly related classic baseline and (Lipton et al) LSTM1 and (our preprocess) LSTM2 are closely recent methods because they are high performing health care deep learning temporal models, and they account for marks.\n\n\"\"\"The Mei and Eisner 2017 you cited designed such a model called D-SM-MPP. What is the difference from that? If no crucial difference, maybe you should note that in your paper.\"\"\" \nThanks, we use the dual form of the constrained optimization requiring lambda >= 0, applying a large and linearly-increasing penalty factor for negative values.  This is described in the Appendix. D-SM-SPP is a generalized Hawkes process (Daley 1988) with the activation defined as softplus.  We were concerned that the softplus approach might have adverse gradient step update effects since hazards are often close to zero, mandating very large negative value predictions as inputs into the softplus and subsequent instability of the backprop gradient calculation.\n\n'''Can you clearly distinguish interrogability and interpretability? You mention both in your paper but did not clarify. If there is no difference, why not use interpretability which seems more commonly known? Moreover, since interrogability is a major contribution that you claim, do you have a way to evaluate its accuracy? (Not only showing the figure but also somehow decide if your figure makes sense.) '''\n- Within the interpretability literature, there is a push for recognition that interpretability is the high level descriptor (i.e. somewhat vague), and that other phrases should be used to state the characteristic of interpretability the model provides.  We believe that the visualizations admitted by our model provides interrogability.\n- Interpretability often requires usability studies, e.g. surveys, and quantified downstream evaluation.  We felt this was out of scope for this submission. \n\n\"\"\"Please explain your sentence *our method remains interpretable for small data sets*\"\"\"\nThanks, revised in text (the next version) to denote interpretability for data sets with few features.\n\n\"\"\" > Mei and Eisner 2017 does not allow for marked events, is limited to nowcasting, and does not have GLM form. Neither does Hawkes process. But you compare to Hawkes process anyway.

We will work to integrate them into the manuscript.\n\n'''H. Poisson is not a meaningful baseline to include based on your description'''\nPoisson rates are commonly used, i.e. whenever someone models events in aggregate as counts over periods. We feel it is important to know how much better we are doing than the simple baseline.\n\n'''You can easily look at the patient records and see if he has missed doctor appointments.'''\nIt turns out this is a hard problem and there is a whole literature on appointment adherence.  The EHR provides a history of scheduled and completed appointments, but rescheduling is common.  Using only the completed appointments is also problematic because there are visits for all sorts of maladies, not ones that are focusing on diabetes care.  A1c is a good proxy for having a visit with respect to diabetes (it is highly specific to outpatient diabetes care).  Predicting visits for diabetes based on doctors appointments is problematic because sometimes a patient goes to a family practitioner, an internist, an endocrinologist, and who they see is not at all standard.  Translating the risk function into an alert system is ongoing but we believe it is outside the scope of this work.  But, briefly, you want to know how early you can make an alert because early is better (more time to perform intervention), and unless you do multi-forecasting you don't have a sense of the tradeoff in prediction quality and early alerting.\n\n'''Higher number of parameters in your model, then the comparison is not fair'''\nWe respectfully disagree. It is common to compare MLPs with logistic regression, decision trees, ensembles, etc.  The number of parameters differs significantly across these methods and does not invalidate the comparison. In our experiment, the LSTMs have far more parameters than our model, and we outperform them.  The Hawkes model we compared against has fewer parameters, and we also outperform them.  We used the tune set and early stopping to select hyperparameters for the various methods to prevent overfitting, but this did not completely resolve the implicit bias-variance tradeoff.\n\n'''Regarding deep Cox and Hawkes models: ...'''\nWe are aware of Deep Cox models, e.g. including two recent publications, DeepSurv (Katzman et al 2018) and DeepHit (Lee et al 2018), which are evaluated on vertical lines of Figure 3.

Here are my comments on your response.\n\nI see your point now. Figure 7 is not very readable for me though.\n\nI think H. Poisson is not a meaningful baseline to include based on your description.\n\nIf the reason for better performance is the higher number of parameters in your model, then the comparison is not fair. Basically, the baseline models are underfitting.\n\nI think the insight provided by the algorithm is not very useful. You can easily look at the patient records and see if he has missed doctor appointments; you don't need a learning algorithm for that. Moreover, the treatment adherence measurement and control is a well-studied field in behavioral science and you need to provide stronger pieces of evidence that this algorithm can play any role in it. The current explanation is only hand-waving.\n\nRegarding deep Cox and Hawkes models:\nI am still not clear what is the novelty of your contribution. The goal of all rate estimation techniques such as Cox and Hawkes models is to estimate a rate \\lambda(t, X), where t is an arbitrary time in future and X represents a slice of history of the patient. While the very original definitions of Cox and Hawkes models had different assumptions on the timing of the prediction and slice of the patient history that are used, the numerous extensions have covered different options for these two.

With your aid we have reorganized section 3, specifically defining absolute-time kernels (h) and presenting the rate function as a linear combination of reductions of them.  We: (1) state the rate function form, (2) define h, and (3) specify the causally-protective translation function from g to h.\n\nMethods:\n- The notations regarding the translation function has been fixed and updated in the revised PDF.\n- Mapping g_es is fixed. s is defined further in the revised text as a value interval.\n- The Hadamard product example is modified to include a column vector of 1's denoting dimension expansion.\n- The j=1 is the temporal analogue of a missingness indicator in atemporal analysis.  That the event occurred may be independently informative of the value of the event in the same way as a missingness indicator can improve prediction. Thus it makes sense to include both kernels for j=1 and j=2.\n- We have fixed Figure 3, the two time dimensions figure in alignment with the text.  Namely, t is the (absolute-time) forecast time, and t' is the (absolute-time) time at prediction. The time t' is the placeholder for the time dimension corresponding to the t_i which is the time-stamp of observed event e_i.  \n- c is a non-negative value, however, it is visually more common to view time from left to right.  We will denote that the axes correspond to -c values.\n\nThe multi-forecast setting is now stated (as the average negative log likelihood across as vector of pre-chosen c).  Optimizer details are in the attached Appendix.  Code will be released upon publication.\n\nExperiments:\n- The Fourier methods do include the values of the events using the same value intervals (s \\in S).  The Hawkes process does not, and the performance hit they take is shown in the ACS example where the numeric value is central to prediction. Revised in text.\n- Goodman Kruskal statistic is computed using all test set pairs.  For every test set pair with different counts of outcome events, compare the empirical and predicted average hazards (count/period and cumulative hazard/period) of each.  If the difference in counts has the same sign as the difference in predicted cumulative hazards, this increases the \"agree\" count, otherwise this increases the \"disagree\" count.  The formula is (# agree - # disagree - prior) / (# agree + # disagree + prior), where we chose prior = 1000.\n- We require a positivity constraint as negative rates are not well defined.  Revised in text. \n\nInterrogability:\n- Figure 7 illustrates the interrogability of the model, as the relative effect of a kernel on the rate can be visualized. In the ACS example, it is evident the troponin, only at specific relative times and values, impacts the call of ACS.\n- Furthermore, WRN has GLM form, which are commonly used for relationship estimation (linear, logistic, Cox) and this model allows for those types of interpretations.  GLMs suffer in interpretability when 100+ features are used, and the same is true for this model.  Large sample sizes do not impact interpretability of our model beyond the standard wider confidence intervals in parameter estimates.\n- Mei and Eisner 2017 does not allow for marked events, is limited to nowcasting, and does not have GLM form.

For example, training vanilla Hawkes model is relatively easy and efficient, even though it may not perform as good as the proposed model. 2) Presentation of the model in section 3 lacks sufficient explanation and heavily relies on high level remarks on how the model is developed, a more detailed explanation (even including how the wavelet coefficients are computed) could be far more useful than the schematic view of the network architecture presented in Figure 1.\n\nOverall, I think this paper provides a novel contribution for modeling event data specifically for medical data.

The paper is vague at various important points in both method and experiments, thus leaving their correctness and soundness undetermined. \n\nIn the method section, the authors did not specify a well-defined and self-consistent notation system. This makes the paper really hard to understand. For example, one may be easily confused with things like: \n1) How q, q(g(t), t_i), g(t), g_{es}, g_{d} are connected and distinguished? \n2) The function g_{es} maps from t to R, then is t a space or a variable? \n3) The state s seems crucial in the function g_{es}, but why it is only mentioned one time in the paper? How it is defined and how it is used?\n4) How the Hadamard product is applied to two matrices of different sizes? \n5) j=1 is time dimension and j=2 is time and value dimension, then why j=1 is not part of j=2? Time is needed in both cases and it seems natural that the associated parameters are shared. \n6) Figure-3 has t_i in figure, t\u2019 in caption, but the text in main paper mentions t_0 for Figure-3. How are they related? Are they actually the same?\n\nThe most confusing part is the censoring distance c. Its introduction around eqn-(2) suggests that c > 0 and the censoring section clearly mentions that. But c is also used to denote the forecast distance, which is clearly < 0 according to Figure-6 and Figure-7. What\u2019s worse, there is also a term called forecast censoring distance. What are the relationships among these terms? If they are all the same, then is the c actually a model parameter or an evaluation control knob? Such things are very important to clarify. \n\nMoreover, the paper did not clearly explain how the model is trained in each case, especially for (multi-)forecasting. In details:\n1) What is the training objective?.\n2) What is the optimization method for this objective?\n3) How is it implemented and would the code be released?\n\nIt is good that the experimental section lists many appropriate baseline models and multiple evaluation metrics, but it is not clear how they are used. For example:\n1) Fourier methods and Hawkes process do not deal with the value v, then how are they fairly compared to the proposed model which takes v into account as in eqn-(2)? \n2) How is the Goodman-Kruskal gamma exactly computed? On all the instances of the held-out set? What is exactly the rank in this case?\n3) The authors also leave out the positiveness constraints of a Hawkes process to incorporate inhibitory interactions, but how the positivity of the intensity function is ensured in this case? \n\n[quality and significance]\n\nThe method is well-motivated and innovative. But details of the model and experiments are very unclear, so its overall soundness is hard to judge. For example: \n1) The authors claim that, compared to neural models, their model has the advantage of the interpretability (for small datasets), but they also have neural components in their model. So why their model is more interpretable than others (e.g. Mei and Eisner 2017 as they cited) is not clear to me. \n2) It is not clear why the interpretability is associated with the size of the dataset (quote `remains interpretable for small data sets\u2019). What\u2019s worse, the interpretability seems the only advantage of the model over other neural models (please correct me if I am wrong). If this edge could not scale up to large datasets, then does it mean on large datasets, a neural model should always be preferred over this model, because they are supposed to be more expressive? \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper78/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Clinical Risk: wavelet reconstruction networks for marked point processes", "abstract": "Timestamped sequences of events, pervasive in domains with data logs, e.g., health records, are often modeled as point processes with rate functions over time.

They rely on a classical sparse generalized linear model using the wavelet basis set and Hawkes loss function to estimate a shallow kernel function. This approach is opposite to the deep function estimation approach which does not rely on a predefined basis set [e.g. see [Du et al, 2016]]. However, it can have an advantage that the learned functions are interpretable, thought the authors never demonstrate it in the paper.\n\nGiven this view of WRNs (an unfortunate coincidence with WideResNets), we understand how LSTM2 outperforms LSTM1 in the results. However, the results tables do have peculiar numbers too. For example, why the Goodman-Kruskal gammas for H. Poisson are exactly -1? Why is it always pointing in the wrong direction? There are other observations in the results table that the authors have listed without much explanation. For example, in Section 5, what is the reason for \u201cThe WRN-PPL method excelled particularly in tasks with many target occurrences\u201d?\n\nAnother example is the arguments in the discussion section about the use-case of rate functions. For example, the authors state: \u201c For example, the rate prediction for the individual denoted in green in Figure 5 (right) suggests that individual may have skipped, missed, or rescheduled 5 to 6 appointments over the last decade.\u201d How did the authors conclude this claim? What is the clinical significance of missing or rescheduling 5-6 appointments in the context of A1c prediction?\n\nWriting can be seriously improved (basically the paper is not ready in the current state). For example, only in Section 6, the authors have introduced the full name of WRN-PPL after using it many times before. \n\nThe motivation for this paper is misleading. There have been several works on \u201cDeep Cox\u201d and \u201cDeep Hawkes\u201d models. I don\u2019t see the novelty in the authors\u2019 contribution in defining the clinical risk. Especially Fig. 3 (left) is already known and does not add much value.\n\nOverall, on the positive side, this paper shows that in some datasets going back to the classical shallow models we might achieve better performance than the alternative deep models. Unfortunately, the authors do not clearly state how many training data points they have. They have a vague statement: \u201c798,818 timestamped events in a study population of 4,732 individuals\u201d, but it does not say exactly how many training examples they have.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper78/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Clinical Risk: wavelet reconstruction networks for marked point processes", "abstract": "Timestamped sequences of events, pervasive in domains with data logs, e.g., health records, are often modeled as point processes with rate functions over time.
