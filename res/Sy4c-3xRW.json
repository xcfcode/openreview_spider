Even if the logits are zero, the class would have a\nnon-zero probability and would receive gradients. Do the authors mean\nexp(o_t(x;w)) = 0 ?\n\n- Related to the above, it should be clarified what is meant by dropping a\n  class. Is its logit set to zero or -\\infty ? Excluding a class from the\nsoftmax is equivalent to having a logit of -\\infty, not zero. However, from the\nequations in the paper it seems that the logit is set to zero. This would not\nresult in excluding the unit. The overall effect would just be to raise the\nmagnitude of logits across the entire softmax.\n\n- It seems that the model benefits from at least two separate effects - one is\n  the attention mechanism provided by the sigmoids, and the other is the\nstochasticity during training. Presently, it is not clear if only one of the\ncomponents is providing most of the benefits, or if both things are useful. It\nwould be great to compare this model to a non-stochastic one which just has the\nmultiplicative effects applied in a deterministic way (during both training and\ntesting).\n\n- The objective of the attention mechanism that sets the dropout mask seems to\n  be the same as the primary objective of classifying the input, and the\nattention mechanism is prevented from solving the task by adding an extra\nentropy regularization. It would be useful to explain more why this is needed.\nWould it not be fine if the attention mechanism did a perfect job of selecting\nthe class ?\n\nQuality\nThe paper makes relevant comparisons and is overall well-motivated. However,\nsome aspects of the paper can be improved by adding more explanations.\n\nClarity\nSome crucial aspects of the paper are unclear as mentioned above.\n\nOriginality\nThe main contribution of the paper is similar to multiplicative gating. The\nadded stochasticity and the model ensembling interpretation is probably novel.\nHowever, experiments are insufficient to determine whether it is this novelty\nthat contributes to improved performance or just the gating.\n\nSignificance\nThis paper makes incremental improvements and would be of moderate interest to\nthe machine learning community.\n\nTypos :\n- In Eq 3, the numerator has z_t.

In the spirit of the latter series of papers on variational dropout there is a derivation of this algorithm using ideas from variational inference. The variational approximation is a bit odd in that it doesn't have any variational parameters, and indeed a further regulariser in equation (14) is needed to give the desired behaviour. A fairly small, but consistent improvement on the base model and other similar ideas is reported in Table 1. I would have liked to have seen results on ImageNet.

Presently, it is not clear if only one of the components is providing most of the benefits, or if both things are useful. It would be great to compare this model to a non-stochastic one which just has the multiplicative effects applied in a deterministic way (during both training and testing).\n\n: As said, our model benefits from two separate effects - 1) adaptive input-dependant attention generation and 2) stochasticity during training. \n\nThe effect of 1) is clear since our adaptive dropmax significantly outperforms random dropmax. To show the effect of 2) we added in the results from the deterministic model in the revision, which we name as Deterministic-Attention, in Table 1. This model is almost identical to \u201cAdaptive-Dropout\u201d, except that the stochastic \u2018z_t\u2019 is replaced with deterministic \u2018\\rho_t\u2019.\n\nWe observe that stochasticity does indeed help improve the model performance, as Adaptive-Dropmax outperformed Deterministic-Attention by 0.59% in MNIST-1K, 0.22% in MNIST-5K and similarly on the other datasets (except on MNIST-55K). \nFurther, our deterministic attention model has both KL term and entropy regularizer as in \u201cAdaptive-Dropout\u201d, with \\lambda found via separate holdout set, such that the target class is strongly attended for each input while non-target classes are not. This design, which is also used in our Adaptive-Dropmax, is also a novelty of our model since a naive implementation of deterministic attention produces much worse results than the base model,\n\n\n- The objective of the attention mechanism that sets the dropout mask seems to be the same as the primary objective of classifying the input, and the attention mechanism is prevented from solving the task by adding an extra entropy regularization. It would be useful to explain more why this is needed. Would it not be fine if the attention mechanism did a perfect job of selecting the class?\n\n: The objective of the dropout mask generator is to stochastically rule out non-target classes such that the model can learn features for both coarse-grained and fine-grained classification. If we allow the dropout mask generator to become another classifier, then the original classifier has no problem to solve and will not learn anything useful, and thus we should differentiate the role of the classifier and the dropout mask generator.\n\nWe found that even in the case where it is easy enough for the mask generator to do a perfect job of selecting the target (See Figure 4(a) in the revision - Figure 3(a) in the original paper) the performance was the best when the non-target classes are not completely ruled out as \\lambda was found to be nonzero (0.1 ~ 0.0001).\n\nTo verify it, we experimented with Deterministic-Attention model, with the Sigm() in Eq. (4) replaced with Softmax(). It makes the mask generator to be another classifier, because generated masks become mutually exclusive, with only one of them close to 1 per each instance. The entropy regularizer (14) is removed for our purpose. We tested it on MNIST and Cifar-100, and the results are as follows:\nMNIST-1K: 7.13\nMNIST-5K: 2.57\nMNIST-55K: 1.09\nCifar-100: 30.38\nThe results are similar to or worse than the baseline, meaning that the role of the mask generator should be controlled in a principled way.\n\n\n- The main contribution of the paper is similar to multiplicative gating. Experiments are insufficient to determine whether it is just the gating that contributes to improved performance.\n\n: As mentioned above, the newly added in experimental results for the deterministic attention model shows that the stochasticity is still important for obtaining meaningful performance improvement, as it enables to obtain an ensemble of exponentially many classifiers in a single model training.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DropMax: Adaptive Stochastic Softmax", "abstract": "We propose DropMax, a stochastic version of softmax classifier which at each iteration drops non-target classes with some probability, for each instance.

Even if the logits are zero, the class would have a non-zero probability and would receive gradients. Do the authors mean exp(o_t(x;w)) = 0 ?\n\n: This is indeed correct and is a mistake caused by the explanation of a legacy model. We have experimented with two different versions of Dropmax (one that drops out the o_t and the other that drops out the exp(o_t) and opted to go with the former. \n\nIn the revision, we have corrected the inaccurate description of the model and added in new experimental results based on the dropout of the exponential term (including Figure 4). The results show that dropping exp(o_t) =0 yields similar classification errors to dropping o_t=0, except on Cifar-10, on which the former significantly outperforms the latter.\n\n\n- Related to the above, it should be clarified what is meant by dropping a class. Is its logit set to zero or -\\infty ? Excluding a class from the softmax is equivalent to having a logit of -\\infty, not zero. However, from the equations in the paper it seems that the logit is set to zero. This would not result in excluding the unit. The overall effect would just be to raise the magnitude of logits across the entire softmax.\n\n: Dropping class logits (o_t = 0) does not raise the magnitude of logits of negative classes. Rather, it is equivalent to setting class probabilities to neutral (p_t = 1/T), which is \u201cneither certainly positive(+) nor negative(-)\u201d for a given instance. However, we corrected it by setting exp(o_t)=0 to completely exclude a class from classification boundary as suggested.

This isn't a huge conceptual leap given previous work, for instance that of Ba and Frey 2013 or the sequence of papers by Gal and his coauthors on variational interpretations of dropout.\n\n: The main focus of this paper is not interpreting dropout (or adaptive dropout) wrt variational inference. Those are simply our choice of tools for solving the proposed problem, and the main novelty comes from stochastically ruling out classes from consideration at each iteration. None of the previous work exploits such idea.\n\n\n- The variational approximation is a bit odd in that it doesn't have any variational parameters.\n\n: Our decision of setting the q (or recognition) network the same as the p (or prior) network is motivated from (Sohn et al., 2015) (Section 4.2).  Since we are training with q network while predicting with p network, the consistency between the two network is crucial in obtaining the desired performance. It is indicated by KL[q||p] term in the Eq. (7). \n\nSuppose use a different set of variational parameters \\phi for q(z|x,y). The problem in this case is that reconstructing y with q(z|x,y;\\phi) and reconstructing y with p(z|x;\\theta) are significantly different in their difficulties. The former is much easier because it learns trivial mapping y -> z -> y, where the dimension of z is the same as that of y. Thus, we decided to replace q(z|x,y;\\phi) with q(z|x,y;\\theta) that shares the same structure and the set of parameters with p(z|x;\\theta). In our preliminary experiment, we also experimented with the model that uses a separate parameter for q, but it did not work well.\n\n\n- a further regulariser in equation (14) is needed to give the desired behaviour.\n: Since regularized variational inference is a general framework and allows us to avoid the weird solution all z=0 or z=1, we argue that (14) is reasonable.\n\n\n- I would have liked to have seen results on ImageNet.\n: We will run the experiments on the ImageNet dataset and will include the results in the revision if we obtain the results by the rebuttal deadline. \n\n\n- I don't find (the too small) Figure 2 to be compelling evidence that \"our dropmax effectively prevents overfitting by converging to much lower test loss\". The test loss in question looks like a noisy version of the base test loss with a slightly lower mean.\n\n: The plot was not the most representative and we included in a more stable version in the revision. Also the main point we want to make with Figure 2 is that our model is still able to achieve lower test loss, while retaining the same convergence speed as the baseline.\n\n\n- There are grammatical errors throughout the paper at a higher rate than would normally be found in a successful submission at this stage.\n: We have corrected the grammatical errors in the revision. \n\n\n- Which of the MNIST models from Table 1 was used?\n: We used the MNIST-1K model.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DropMax: Adaptive Stochastic Softmax", "abstract": "We propose DropMax, a stochastic version of softmax classifier which at each iteration drops non-target classes with some probability, for each instance.

", "comment": "Rating: 7 It does produce a better result\nReview: Our review is based on reproducibility\n\nOverall the paper seemed to reasonably comply with the standards of reproducibility set out for this challenge. The data was very easily obtainable and its partitions were well de\ufb01ned. The DropMax paper mentioned what frameworks were used but did not give any code or pseudo-code. The DropMax paper\u2019s hyperparameter selection for the adaptive DropMax model was well stated but was non-existent for the other models. Despite this lack of documentation, we were able to show the distinct improvement DropMax had over the base networks. The language of the DropMax paper was clear but could have been made drastically more clear by including a diagram of the network the paper was proposing. The DropMax paper did not mention any of the computing hardware used. The runtime of the experiments was signi\ufb01cant but reasonable for an academic research setting. Based on the above compliance with the criteria of reproducibility set forth by Joelle Pineau we believe that DropMax is adequately reproducible. We give it a 7/10 overall on reproducibility.\n\n\nAs other commentators pointed out, DropMax, as proposed in the paper, drops class logits and not classes. This is the cause of z being identically 1 without regularization of rho; if o_t is negative for some non-target class, then \u2202L/\u2202\u03c1t\nis positive since dropping the logit for that class actually increases the predicted\nthe probability for that class. We confirm that this is the cause of failure experimentally\nby applying ReLU activation to o_t, and successfully avoid z = 1 without having to use\nregularization on \u03c1. However, our validation experiments show that regularization of \u03c1\ncan still be helpful, even when dropping classes.\n\nhttps://github.com/jamesal1/DropMax.git\n\nConfidence: 4 We are basing our opinions on the code we used to copy the results.
