In general however we do not think that the rating of \"3 - weak reject\" is properly motivated. Addressing the points:\n- We agree that, since the kernel distance is defined as $d(X, Y) = K(X, X) + K(Y, Y) -2K(X, Y)$ for a kernel $K$, producing a valid EDM $D_{ij}=M_{ii}+M_{jj}-2M_{ij}$ (Eq. (3) in the manuscript) is equivalent to learning the symmetric positive semi-definite (kernel) matrix evaluations $M_{ij}$. The rank of $M$ corresponds to the embedding dimension.\n- Equation (5) holds whenever the function $g$ has a preimage space that contains the eigenvalues. There are different ways to define a matrix function, one of them is via the Jacobi canonical form, which reduces in our case to an eigenvalue decomposition and application of the function on the individual eigenvalues (see, e.g., Higham, N. J. (2008). Functions of matrices: theory and computation (Vol. 104). Siam.).\n- Algorithm 1, step 14: It is now noted that G is a neural network. All the steps are differentiable so depending on the optimization objective (for instance in a GAN architecture) backpropagation can yield a target distribution in EDM space (indicated by \\nabla L). SchNet in this case is used as a Critic (or in classical GANs as Discriminator) network but is not strictly required to sample in EDM space.\n- Comparison to simple and straightforward baselines is going to be included in future research. While the GAN implementation of our approach generates substantial diversity in configuration space, the diversity in chemical space is limited, but can be improved by choosing different generative structures, e.g., autoregressive (arXiv 1906.00957).\n- The standard way to compare two structures strongly depends on the considered type of graph. In proteins for example there is a polymeric backbone structure that can be leveraged for identity assignment via the help of sequence alignment. Since these are small molecules without polymeric structure and finding the right assignment is in principle NP hard, the Hungarian algorithm is often used to tractably find an optimal solution, where optimal refers to the choice of cost matrix."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1707/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1707/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generating valid Euclidean distance matrices", "authors": ["Moritz Hoffmann", "Frank Noe"], "authorids": ["moritz.hoffmann@fu-berlin.de", "frank.noe@fu-berlin.de"], "keywords": ["euclidean distance matrices", "wgan", "point clouds", "molecular structures"], "TL;DR": "We introduce a neural network architecture which builds on the generation of Euclidean distance matrices to one-shot generate molecular structures and potentially other forms of point clouds.", "abstract": "Generating point clouds, e.g., molecular structures, in arbitrary rotations, translations, and enumerations remains a challenging task.

We have adressed your points in the following manner:\n- Main request 1a: The unclear sentence about the type vector and cross entropy is expanded with further details in the manuscript. There is another linear transformation between the output of the neural network parameterizing the symmetric matrix $\\tilde{L}$ and a vector $\\mathbf{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n\\times n_\\mathrm{types}}$ which is due to the use of a softmax non-linearity a probability distribution over the types per atom. This probability distribution is compared against a one-hot encoded type vector $\\mathbf{t}_\\mathrm{ref}$ representing the type composition in the considered isomer with a cross entropy term $H(\\mathbf{t}, \\mathbf{t}_\\mathrm{ref})$. As in this example the chemical composition never changes, the type vector $\\mathbf{t}_\\mathrm{ref}$ is always constant.\n- Main request 1b: Bonds and bond types are not generated by the network but inferred by OpenBabel which uses a method based on spatial proximity and atom type for assignment. We discard samples which are disconnected and/or violate valencies based on the inferred bonds. This is something that can potentially be included at least approximately during training by using penalty terms. We consider this a good addition for future work, thank you for the suggestion! A sentence reflecting this (as well as including an energy term) has been added to the conclusion.\n- Main request 2: Indeed adding penalty terms which encourage a valid bonding structure as well as including a force field (in this case for small molecules) should help results and we now mention this in the conclusion.\n- Algorithm 1 now mentions that G is a neural network, z a sample from a simple prior, and that sampling in EDM space is in general not uniform. We added an explanation to the application of the softplus activation in the main text, in particular that one can also apply it for the first $d$ eigenvalues and set it to $0$ for the rest, in which case the rank of $M$ does not need to be optimized for. Which of the two methods (setting to $0$ versus penalizing) is better demands further research. In Line 8 it is not the eigenvalues of $D$ but the eigenvalues of $-0.5JDJ$, which is now mentioned in the text for clarification. It is an if and only if condition on EDMness.\n- In the WGAN section we mention that the prior distribution can be chosen as normal distribution to make the connection to the algorithm and application better/easier.\n- An intuitive explanation for the values of the critic for an individual sample has been added: Low values indicate the belief a sample stems from the generated distribution, high values indicate the belief that a sample stems from the data distribution.\n- The condition on the Lipschitz constant comes from the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality theorem for the Wasserstein-1 metric. Without it, we are not actually minimizing a metric between distributions. The constant can actually be any positive bound, in which case it is not the Wasserstein-1 metric but a fixed multiple of it, i.e., $L\\cdot W^1(p, q)$. Intuitively it is a restriction on the maximal gradient that the critic function can attain, which produces a one-dimensional embedding in which a decision can be made which sample belongs to which distribution.\n- The drift term (Eq. (9)) helps to fixate the critic values for real samples around $0$, otherwise the optimization objective only considers the relative difference; ambiguity is reduced. A short explanation has been added to the main text.\n- We emphasize more on the energies result by an additional sentence in the main text. Also we added that while our GAN implementation has substantial diversity in configuration space and only limited diversity in chemical space, this can be improved by using different generative structures, e.g., (Gebauer et al 2018, 2019).\n- We agree that enriching Figure 3 with new structures by differentiating the very similar ones would improve it and plan to work on that in the future.\n- We fixed the duplicate entry in the bibliography, thanks for spotting that!"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1707/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1707/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generating valid Euclidean distance matrices", "authors": ["Moritz Hoffmann", "Frank Noe"], "authorids": ["moritz.hoffmann@fu-berlin.de", "frank.noe@fu-berlin.de"], "keywords": ["euclidean distance matrices", "wgan", "point clouds", "molecular structures"], "TL;DR": "We introduce a neural network architecture which builds on the generation of Euclidean distance matrices to one-shot generate molecular structures and potentially other forms of point clouds.", "abstract": "Generating point clouds, e.g., molecular structures, in arbitrary rotations, translations, and enumerations remains a challenging task.

After a second more careful read I understood most of it and was much more enthusiastic. Disclaimer: I am inexperienced in this particular field (GANs and GANs for molecular generation) so I lack literature knowledge, and I may be over-evaluating the quality of performances (compared to recent results).\nBut currently I believe that the authors are a bit too humble about their results (a rather uncommon phenomenon). There is a part of the method that I would like to have clarified (about bond/atom types), but other than this clarification, I strongly recommend the paper to be accepted.\n\nThe paper deals with a couple of distinct, related problems.  One is that of sampling valid (Euclidean) distances matrices (EDM). This is done with algorithm 1.\nThe paper uses these EDM to train a generator G directly in EDM-space, against a Critic network C (the architecture of which is taken from existing literature).\nSome of the output configurations have to be discarded due to incorrect bond types assignment (this is the part that is still obscure to me).\nThe remaining outputs are chemically sensible in terms of bond types/valence/local chemistry/etc, but also, and quite impressively, have reasonable ground state energies !  In this sense, the paper produces samples that may deserve to be added into the QM9 data set (After some data augmentation using DFT or other physics-validated methods of course).\n\n\nI have mainly two requests:\n\n1. The bond type or atom assignment is not clearly explained. I ask further detailed questions below, but overall I think you should attempt to make a pedagogical explanation of how the atom types are assigned/learned, and how some of them are later discarded.\n\n'The  generator produces an additional type vector in a multi-task fashion which is checked against a  constant type reference with a cross-entropy loss.'\nCould you explain this better ? At least in the appendix. Otherwise this very dense sentence remains mysterious. Eq.11 is currently the single occurrence of the H, t, and tref terms.\n\nAbout the validity test using Open Babel. Again, what happens with bond types is not very clear. Are they set in stone at generation time, and then most of these affected types are 'wrong' and are discarded by Open Babel ?\nWhy don't you include this validation at training time (if it's very complicated to do, explain why) ?\nIn any case, please clarify this paragraph, as for now it is cryptic.\n\n2. Part of the paper goal is to achieve learning of point clouds distributions and not about chemistry.  However, discovery of new structures (and their conformations) is in itself a big topic.  I think it would be good to mention a couple of follow ups to your work in the conclusion. For instance, it would seem rather natural to me to include some equivalent of OpenBAbel and Energy-estimates within the learning loop, so that the generator directly generates valid (open-babel wise) and reasonable (energy level-wise) structures.\nBesides the conclusion, you should stress out better the significance of your results with a couple of comments here and there. (I have more precise suggestions below).\n\n\nSome other comments to improve the paper (in clarity or other):\n\nIn algorithm 1, you should precise that G() is your NN-based generator network. At this point of the paper G and z and N_z have never been mentioned. This is a problem when reading the paper for the first time.\nLine 5, you could explicitly precise, 'with (5)'.  Also I am puzzled by the use of the softplus here, but later in page 5 you say g() is softplus for the first three eigenvalues, and set to 0 for all others. Why not already anticipate and say this in section 2 ?\nLine 8, I would have written 'eigenvalues .... of D'  (what is the role of Eq. 1 here?)\n\nAt some point (i.e. around end of section 2), a comment would be welcomed, about whether you may sample the space of EDMs uniformly at random using algorithm 1 (I think you do not, and it is ok, but the question naturally arises and it's not addressed).\n\n\u00b4\u00b4which transforms a prior distribution into a target distribution\u00b4\u00b4\nyou could specify that this prior is the Gaussian N(0,1)^Nz in this case, to better connect with algorithm 1.\n\nAbout equation 6: it would be nice to have some intuitive explanation of what the output values of C(x) mean. They are scalars that represent the opinion of C on the molecule x, so they are the probability that the observed molecule is 'a true molecule x' ?  You should recall that for the inexperienced reader.\n\nStill about Eq.6 : could you quickly provide the motivation for demanding C to be L-Lipschit with  $L \\leq 1$ ?\n\nThe drift term Eq.9 seems to be some sort of regularization, maybe it could be mentioned once in the text for completeness?\n\nUsing Mopac Stewart and figure 4: you could insist more on this result. Up to that point I was very dubious about the usefulness of the whole work, because I would have expected many generated samples to be highly unrealistic, i.e. having huge energies, and so being extremely unstable. Instead here you show it is not the case, and even all your energies lie within the range of observed energies !  This is a very strong result, that is not obvious to expect, and is highly valuable (even after keeping only 7.5% of structures, this is still a strong result.)\nI think this test and the corresponding result should be emphasized more.\n\nYou observe new topological types and complain there are not many. I think ~20 new topologies is not a small number (for so few atoms), and you may be rather proud of it.  What is too bad is that you do not have a tool for differentiating between the very similar conformations (that correspond to thermal fluctuations around a given structure) and the conformations that encode a new structure (which does not necessarily means new topology). \nIf you had this tool, you could enrich figure 3 with a curve showing the new structures (not counting conformational variants).\n\nrefs 2017a and 2017b are the same.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1707/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1707/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generating valid Euclidean distance matrices", "authors": ["Moritz Hoffmann", "Frank Noe"], "authorids": ["moritz.hoffmann@fu-berlin.de", "frank.noe@fu-berlin.de"], "keywords": ["euclidean distance matrices", "wgan", "point clouds", "molecular structures"], "TL;DR": "We introduce a neural network architecture which builds on the generation of Euclidean distance matrices to one-shot generate molecular structures and potentially other forms of point clouds.", "abstract": "Generating point clouds, e.g., molecular structures, in arbitrary rotations, translations, and enumerations remains a challenging task.
