Improvements of the combined system are then shown relative to the ART system alone. Measures are number of found clusters and frequencies of assignments.\n\nART networks are typically tightly coupled to models of neural information processing; and it is important to investigate neuro-dynamic models for learning. Also neuro-scientifically motivated approaches frequently use MNIST for evaluation\n(e.g.,Neftci et al different years, Nessler et al., PLOS CB 2013, Keck et al. PLOS CB 2012, Schmuker etal PNAS 2013 etc). Performance measures are classification (e.g. using few labels, or hand-assigned labels after clustering), also less neuroscientific approaches (Boltzmann Machines, SBNs etc) are frequently used and provide, e.g., likelihoods as performance measures. These approaches are not mentioned, and it is unclear how the reported performance should be interpreted in relation to these other works. Note that many of the above mentioned systems seem to have less problems in separating digits, so some mechanisms might be useful for the line of research pursued here.\n\nIn general, combinations of deep learning ideas and neuro-dynamic approaches are a good idea. Here, I feel that neither performance measures nor the discussion of the literature is (at least currently) sufficient (also given that this is a workshop paper).\n\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ConvART: Improving Adaptive Resonance Theory for Unsupervised Image Clustering", "abstract": "While supervised learning techniques have become increasingly adept at separating images into different classes, these techniques require large amounts of labelled data which may not always be available.
