The paper notices the similarity between a dynamical system and an RNN. Then it demonstrates that learning a pair of siamese RNNs is similar to learning synchronization between two subsystems of a dynamical system. Finally, the paper proposes to introduce coupling between the two RNNs in order to improve synchronization.\n\nThe paper conducts experiments comparing the siamese GRUs with the proposed couples siamese GRUs.\n\n\n# Quality\n\nWhile this is an interesting idea to explore, I am not entirely convinced about its value. The main claim of the paper seems to be that the baseline siamese GRU exhibits chaotic behavior while the proposed architecture does not. The former has to be tested experimentally. I would like to see an experiment that shows this chaotic behevior at least qualitatively. Secondly, the proposed architecture intermixes two sequences. Therefore, it is not possible to learn embeddings.\n\nThe experimental section is very scarce. The only dataset used in the paper, UCI HAR, is very small. Furthermore, there are not enough benchmarks for the metric learning on this dataset. The results reported here are not comparable with the supervised methods (~90-95%). This work needs more experiments on datasets with several published results.\n\nThe section 4.2.1 seems to contain a logical error. The linear relation between the norm and the loss cannot show that the coupling helps or hurts the model. Instead, a model with coupling should be compared to a model without coupling. Would it be better to plot separately the norm for positive samples and the negative samples? If I understand correctly, the first is supposed to decrease and the second is supposed to increase. There is more chance to see a negative pair, therefore you observe that the norm increases.\n\nThe section 4.2.3 aims to test the model for the hard positive samples. I can see several problems with the proposed approach to test this. Firstly, the absolute distance is meaningless here. I propose to normalize both curves. Secondly and most importantly, the average metrics cannot test the performance for the hard positives. Such metrics would be dominated by the majority of \"easy positives\". Therefore, I request a more formal description of what is a \"hard positive\" and an experiment  that better tests the claim.\n\n# Clarity\n\nIn general, the paper is hard to read. The logical flow of the paper is hard to follow. Some important aspects are only referenced in other papers or skipped through. Many typos hinder the understanding sometimes.\n\nThe introduction seems to claim \"an improvement over a classical GRU\". In fact, the paper proposes an improvement to the *siamese* GRUs.\n\nDespite the fact that the proposed idea is quite simple, it was hard to follow the paper. Sections 3.1 and 3.2 are too general. This creates discrepancy between Sections 3.1-2 and 3.3. I don't see the point of introducing so general description of the synchronization. It would be clearer to define this concept for the specific case at hand.\n\nThe abuse of notation made Definition 1 look nearly incorrect. I recommend either carefully introduce the specifics here (like in the original paper by Brown & Kocarev) or stick to the common mathematical notation. More specifically:\n- Definitions for \"X\", \"Y\", and \"X (resp. Y)\"\n- Definition for g(x)\n\nIt is easy to loose a thread when reading the section 3.1. I would recommend to start with the siamese RNNs and then demonstrate the connection to the dynamical system, not other way around.\n\nThe loss used in the paper has to be explicitly spelled out (perhaps, in the Appendix).\n\n# Originality\n\nThe paper is sufficiently original.\n\n# Significance\n\nThe paper has a potential to be have high significance. Unfortunately, the experimentation is too limited. The claims made in the paper are not sufficiently tested. Then, the performance is tested only on one dataset against a weak baseline. The presentation needs to be improved too (as noted above).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe idea is interesting, but the experimentation is very weak.\n\nSpecific requests for improvement:\n\n- Experiments on more datasets\n- Compare to the published metric learning literature\n- Test the claim that the baseline is chaotic\n- Define hard positive samples and test the model on them\n- Improve Definition 1\n- Conduct ablation experiments\n\n# Some of typos\n\n- Fix \\citep vs \\citet\n- \"further lose temporal dependency\"\n- \"in term of synchronization\"\n- \"system theory, an important result being ...\"\n-  \"recent approach <...> studied\"\n- \"further introduce\"\n- \"h and g are the same as in Equation 1\" -- there are no h and g in Equation 1\n- \"RNN are dynamical systems\" -> \"RNN is..\"\n- \"RNN are known\" -> \"RNNs are\" or \"RNN is\"\n-  \"3 axis\" -> \"3 axes\"\n- \"size of 128\" -> \"length of 128\"\n- \"a initial learning rate\" -> \"an initial\"\n- \"a SGRU\" -> \"an SGRU\"\n\n# Update\n\nThank you for the rebuttal. The writing was improved and it is easier to read the paper. Nevertheless, the experimentation remains weak.

We added a detailed description of it in Section 2 of supplementary material.  \n\n**Reviewer 1:**\n\nThank you very much for your comments on our work.\n \n1. \u201cComparing against more recent work on the activity recognition such as Learning Discriminative Virtual Sequences for Time Series Classification\u201d\n\u201cwill also be good to expand on the virtual metric learning during training as passing each pair can increase the training complexity for large datasets\u201d\n\nThank you for the suggestion, we will take a look at this work and see where it fits compared to ours. Indeed we already started to investigate virtual metric learning as a solution to overcome the limitations imposed by mixing both sequences. However, preliminary experiments tell us that it requires lots of regularization and a careful construction of the virtual sequences due to the asymmetry created by passing a \u201ctrue\u201d sequence and a virtual one. Therefore, further work is required.\n\n2. \u201cusing more comprehensive evaluation (rather than a single data set)\u201d \n\nThank you for your suggestion of improvement of our experimental section. Indeed the paper would gain in strength with experiments on more datasets.\n\n**Reviewer 2:**\n\nThank you very much for your comments on our work.\n\n1. \u201cThe main claim of the paper seems to be that the baseline siamese GRU exhibits chaotic behavior while the proposed architecture does not. The former has to be tested experimentally. \u201c\n\nWe are sorry for the lack of clarity of the paper on that point but this is not our claim. This claim is made in [2] and observed experimentally for LSTM (page 4). We used this paper to clarify the behavior of the Siamese GRU regarding dynamical systems synchronization theory (uncoupled chaotic identical system) and therefore to support the idea of introducing coupling inside the architecture. We then adapt this idea of coupling coming from dynamical system theory to machine learning and a Siamese GRU architecture. This is the main contribution of our paper presented in section 3.3.\n\n2. \u201cSecondly, the proposed architecture intermixes two sequences. Therefore, it is not possible to learn embeddings.\u201d\n\nThis is correct and while it can be seen as a drawback, our approach also seeks to distance itself from representation learning strategies and to propose a new deep learning approach for sequence metric learning.\n\n3. \"The experimental section is very scarce. The only dataset used in the paper, UCI HAR, is very small. Furthermore, there are not enough benchmarks for the metric learning on this dataset. The results reported here are not comparable with the supervised methods (~90-95%). This work needs more experiments on datasets with several published results.\" \n\nThank you very much for your suggestions to strengthen our experimental section. Indeed our architecture would require to be tested on several datasets to fully prove (or not) that it is better than SGRU. We did not try to compare with supervised classification methods on this dataset which indeed achieve higher results. Our goal was rather to demonstrate that CGRU could achieve better accuracy than SGRU using the same hyperparameters. For this reason, we only provided comparison with metric learning approaches.\n\n4. \u201cThe section 4.2.1 seems to contain a logical error. The linear relation between the norm and the loss cannot show that the coupling helps or hurts the model. Instead, a model with coupling should be compared to a model without coupling.

There is more chance to see a negative pair, therefore you observe that the norm increases.\u201d\n\nIn section 4.2.1, we are dealing with the norm of the coupling weights (the model parameters), during training, not the distances between the samples. The weights are initialized very close to zero, in this situation, the architecture behaves nearly as a Siamese GRU (see Eq (10) and Eq (11)), we then observe that this norm (of the coupling parameters) increases during training following the validation accuracy which suggests that the couping parameters contribute to improve our classification accuracy on UCI dataset.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3022/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3022/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Sequence Metric Learning as Synchronization of Recurrent Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~Paul_Compagnon1", "gregoire.lefebvre@orange.com", "~Stefan_Duffner1", "~Christophe_Garcia1"], "authors": ["Paul Compagnon", "Gr\u00e9goire Lefebvre", "Stefan Duffner", "Christophe Garcia"], "keywords": ["Metric learning", "sequence processing", "siamese recurrent neural network", "dynamical systems"], "abstract": "Sequence metric learning is becoming a widely adopted approach for various applications dealing with sequential multi-variate data such as activity recognition or natural language processing and is most of the time tackled with sequence alignment approaches or representation learning. \nIn this paper, we propose to study this subject from the point of view of dynamical system theory by drawing the analogy between synchronized trajectories produced by dynamical systems and the distance between similar sequences processed by a siamese recurrent neural network. \nIndeed, a siamese recurrent network comprises two identical sub-networks, two identical dynamical systems which can theoretically achieve complete synchronization if a coupling is introduced between them. \nWe therefore propose a new neural network model that implements this coupling with a new gate integrated into the classical Gated Recurrent Unit architecture.

However, the metric that ends up being used in eq(5) is a metric function of two RNN end states, which is common and wouldn\u2019t help to highlight authors\u2019 contributions.\u201d\nand \u201cFirst, this is very far from the formal definition in eq(1) with a quite weak link; secondly, it is one of the most commonly used metrics in NLP/CV applications\u201d\n\nThank you for your suggestions to improve the clarity of the paper. In Definition 1 or Equation (3), we consider continuous time dynamical systems and infinite trajectories. Eq (5) is a discrete version for finite trajectories otherwise each element stated in definition 1 still holds: g is the coordinates (a property of the system), h the difference and a norm appears. We wanted to make the analogy between metric learning on sequences with recurrent neural networks and synchronization. This serves to justify the introduction of our main contribution in section 3.3. \nRegarding the simplicity of the final learned metric, more complex synchronization error equations could be use to produce more complex metrics (possibly on the whole output sequences). However, since this one works well with identical systems (in its continuous form) and is ubiquitous in metric learning (in the discrete form), we had no reasons to introduce something else much more elaborated at this level and this is not a main contribution of this paper. We tried to clarify this in the paper so to avoid confusion.\n\n\n2. \u201cGiven the architecture, the methods can only be applied to sequences that have the same number of timesteps, is that correct?\u201d\n\nThis is correct however this drawback can be mitigated with padding or/and resampling.\n\n3. \u201cWhy is there such a discrepancy between the results in the paper and state of the art results please\u201d\n\nThis paper was not focused on performances and especially beating the approaches you mention which are supervised classification approaches. Our goal was rather to demonstrate that CGRU could achieve better performances than SGRU with the exact same architecture, at least in this case. That is why we only provided comparison with metric learning approaches.\n\n4. \"In Definition 1, the function two subsystems are synchronized if there exists a time-independent g (instead of a time dependent g as written). In fact, one can always find a trivial time dependent g satisfying the equation (by the way, it is written correctly with time independence in Brown & Kocarev (2000))\"\n\nThank you for your remark, we have reworked definition 1 accordingly. \n\n5. \u201cModifying neural architecture to capture better similarity has numerous works, one notable example in NLP is for example: A Decomposable Attention Model for Natural Language Inference [Parikh et al. 2016]. I would recommend including similar references in the paper to better situate the paper\u2019s contribution.\u201d\n\nThank you very much for your suggestion, we will look into this literature and see where our work fits in it. We mentioned in the state of the art the approach of Varior et al. [3] which seems quite close in the realization although not for sequences.\n\n6. \"The loss function is missing in the paper, so leading some missing details for training. \"\n\nThank you very much for your remark, we added it in the supplementary material, Section 2.\n\n7. \"Finally, I want to detail my argument to change the paper\u2019s highlight on synchronization, which ends being a distance between two RNN end states. First, this is very far from the formal definition in eq(1) with a quite weak link; secondly, it is one of the most commonly used metrics in NLP/CV applications (and very probably other areas that I am much less familiar with). Given that an ICLR main paper is only about 8 pages, I strongly recommend authors to reconsider the paper structure to highlight its main contributions.\"\n\nThe main contribution of this paper is presented in Section 3.3. Section 3.1 justifies the analogy that can be made between synchronization and metric learning. Section 3.2 tries to justify the introduction of coupling which is done by modifying the Siamese GRU architecture in section 3.3. Following your suggestions, we tried to make this clearer in the paper.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3022/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3022/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Sequence Metric Learning as Synchronization of Recurrent Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~Paul_Compagnon1", "gregoire.lefebvre@orange.com", "~Stefan_Duffner1", "~Christophe_Garcia1"], "authors": ["Paul Compagnon", "Gr\u00e9goire Lefebvre", "Stefan Duffner", "Christophe Garcia"], "keywords": ["Metric learning", "sequence processing", "siamese recurrent neural network", "dynamical systems"], "abstract": "Sequence metric learning is becoming a widely adopted approach for various applications dealing with sequential multi-variate data such as activity recognition or natural language processing and is most of the time tackled with sequence alignment approaches or representation learning. \nIn this paper, we propose to study this subject from the point of view of dynamical system theory by drawing the analogy between synchronized trajectories produced by dynamical systems and the distance between similar sequences processed by a siamese recurrent neural network. \nIndeed, a siamese recurrent network comprises two identical sub-networks, two identical dynamical systems which can theoretically achieve complete synchronization if a coupling is introduced between them. \nWe therefore propose a new neural network model that implements this coupling with a new gate integrated into the classical Gated Recurrent Unit architecture.

I can see several problems with the proposed approach to test this. Firstly, the absolute distance is meaningless here. I propose to normalize both curves. Secondly and most importantly, the average metrics cannot test the performance for the hard positives. Such metrics would be dominated by the majority of \"easy positives\". Therefore, I request a more formal description of what is a \"hard positive\" and an experiment that better tests the claim..\u201d\n\nThank you very much for your remark on normalization, we will take it into account. From our point of view, hard samples are samples close to the decision boundary, factually (by the label so to say) belonging to one class but by the distance (at some moment during learning or testing) being closer to samples from another class. Depending on the sampling strategy, this hardness can be quantified by several means (triplets for those the distances between the anchor and the positive and negative samples are close can be considered hard). We actually agree with your comment, however as the standard deviation of noise increases, we can argue that there are only \u201chard samples\u201d since noise is applied on each sequence. This is notably attested by the fact that the average distances between the positive and negative samples are converging. Nevertheless, we will precise in the paper our definition for \u201chard samples\u201d.\n \n6. \"Despite the fact that the proposed idea is quite simple, it was hard to follow the paper. Sections 3.1 and 3.2 are too general. This creates discrepancy between Sections 3.1-2 and 3.3. I don't see the point of introducing so general description of the synchronization. It would be clearer to define this concept for the specific case at hand.\"\n\nThank you for all suggestions. In section 3.1 we wanted to show that a link could be made between synchronization and metric learning, we therefore needed to introduce synchronization and synchronization error. In section 3.2, we wanted to justify the introduction of coupling and we therefore also needed to introduce the complete synchronization case before presenting in 3.3, the core contribution of the paper.

Such a system has easiness to bring two instances arbitrarily close and authors have shown the superiority of the approach over an action recognition dataset; but the results seem to far from state of the art on the dataset (see questions section). The authors also recognize that currently such systems need to calculate each pairs (can't be cached due to coupling) at inference time, which is slow. \n\nThe main issue I found in this paper is its presentation. The authors claim to draw inspirations from dynamic systems (e.g. the important notion of  synchronized trajectories) in the abstract/introduction, cite related work and introduce a formal definition (with some errors, see section minor issues). However, the metric that ends up being used in eq(5) is a metric function of two RNN end states, which is common and wouldn\u2019t help to highlight authors\u2019 contributions.\n\nAnother concern is that the authors have tested on only one dataset where the claimed results are quite below state of the art on the dataset (see questions section). There are two baselines implemented (one very recent approach), however no simple baseline or other datasets to further support the approach.\n\n\nFinally, after reading the paper, I think the paper proposes a new neural architecture for similarity learning rather than focusing on metric learning. In this aspect, the paper misses references to papers in the area.\n\n\n#### Pros: \nDrawing inspiration from dynamic systems, the paper proposes a novel architecture that is not only dynamically involved with timesteps but is also coupled (between two instances), which has the capability of bringing two arbitrary sequences close. The authors have shown the superiority of the proposed approach over several metric learning baselines including the recently proposed RVSML (Su and Wu, 2019) over an action recognition dataset.\n\n#### Questions:\nClarification question: Given the architecture, the methods can only be applied to sequences that have the same number of timesteps, is that correct?\n\nThe approach seems to be far from the state of art: In Provable Defenses against Adversarial Examples via the Convex Outer Adversarial Polytope [Wong and Kolter, 2018], the baseline network investigated achieves 5% error rate; for papers more focused on performance, Human activity recognition with smartphone sensors using deep learning neural networks [Ronao and Cho 2016] archives accuracy 95.75%. Why is there such a discrepancy between the results in the paper and state of the art results please (as it is more convincing to build upon state of the art results when possible). \n\n#### Minor Issues:\nIn Definition 1, the function two subsystems are synchronized if there exists a time-independent g (instead of a time dependent g as written). In fact, one can always find a trivial time dependent g satisfying the equation (by the way, it is written correctly with time independence in Brown & Kocarev (2000))\n\n#### Minor suggestions:\n\nModifying neural architecture to capture better similarity has numerous works, one notable example in NLP is for example: A Decomposable Attention Model for Natural Language Inference [Parikh et al. 2016]. I would recommend including similar references in the paper to better situate the paper\u2019s contribution.\n\nThe loss function is missing in the paper, so leading some missing details for training. \n\nFinally, I want to detail my argument to change the paper\u2019s highlight on synchronization, which ends being a distance between two RNN end states. First, this is very far from the formal definition in eq(1) with a quite weak link; secondly, it is one of the most commonly used metrics in NLP/CV applications (and very probably other areas that I am much less familiar with). Given that an ICLR main paper is only about 8 pages, I strongly recommend authors to reconsider the paper structure to highlight its main contributions.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3022/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3022/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Sequence Metric Learning as Synchronization of Recurrent Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~Paul_Compagnon1", "gregoire.lefebvre@orange.com", "~Stefan_Duffner1", "~Christophe_Garcia1"], "authors": ["Paul Compagnon", "Gr\u00e9goire Lefebvre", "Stefan Duffner", "Christophe Garcia"], "keywords": ["Metric learning", "sequence processing", "siamese recurrent neural network", "dynamical systems"], "abstract": "Sequence metric learning is becoming a widely adopted approach for various applications dealing with sequential multi-variate data such as activity recognition or natural language processing and is most of the time tackled with sequence alignment approaches or representation learning. \nIn this paper, we propose to study this subject from the point of view of dynamical system theory by drawing the analogy between synchronized trajectories produced by dynamical systems and the distance between similar sequences processed by a siamese recurrent neural network. \nIndeed, a siamese recurrent network comprises two identical sub-networks, two identical dynamical systems which can theoretically achieve complete synchronization if a coupling is introduced between them. \nWe therefore propose a new neural network model that implements this coupling with a new gate integrated into the classical Gated Recurrent Unit architecture.

The authors propose modification the siamese recurrent network setting called classical Gated Recurrent Unit architecture (CGRU).

The authors describe how this model is able to simultaneously learn a similarity metric and the synchronization of unaligned multi-variate sequences in a weakly supervised way with the coupling demonstrating performance of the siamese Gated Recurrent Unit (SGRU) architecture on UCI activity recognition dataset (mobile data).\n\nThe increase in norm with the epochs shows overall generalization is improving with the increase of coupling strength and an almost linear relationship between the increase of the norm and the decrease of the loss suggesting again that the coupling is helpful. Computing accuracy, F1 score Macro averaged and Mean Average Precision (MAP),similarly to Su & Wu (2019) also shows improvement against SGRU and RVSML.
