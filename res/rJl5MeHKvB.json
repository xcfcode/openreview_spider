Most applications of multitask learning require additional \u2018external\u2019 labels, but our method is applicable even in situations where such labels aren\u2019t available, hence its novelty.\n\nAlthough [1] also proposes a limited self-supervised framework, their method is applicable only in the EHR setting, since it requires additional labels from diagnosis and treatment codes. Still, we agree this is related, and have updated Section 2 to include a discussion of it. The relative novelty of our work is to examine limited self-supervision on general time-series tasks with a variety of different auxiliary tasks. In particular, we examine the relative merits of different auxiliary tasks, propose a novel auxiliary task (PLAE), and show the importance of including multiple forms of auxiliary supervision.\n\n- Insufficient baselines:\nOur main goal was not to obtain state-of-the-art results on computational phenotyping tasks, but to investigate the utility of a limited self-supervision framework to sequence classification.

In response to your major concerns:\n\n1) We have uploaded a revised version of the paper where we provide more complete and concrete descriptions of our architecture.\n\n2) We believe self-supervision can be viewed as an unsupervised learning approach for representation learning. We focus on a setting, limited self-supervision, that does not assume access to additional unlabeled data. One of the major contributions of our work is that we demonstrate self-supervision is useful in such situations. \n\n3) BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. It pre-trains on two tasks: next-sentence prediction and hidden token identification, but these tasks are somewhat specific to NLP. We focus on tasks that are applicable to time-series. Moreover, our setup isn\u2019t a pre-training setup, in which one assumes a large amount of additional unlabeled data, but seeks to leverage the data at hand. \n\nBRITS aims to impute missing values while solving the sequence level task (e.g., predict in-hospital mortality). There are parallels between their work and ours, notably their RITS model is functionally equivalent to our Baseline+Forecasting model. However, our main goal was to improve the representation learned by a network on fully observed and supervised data. \n\n4) In our revised draft of the paper, we have attempted to better describe our experimental settings. Additionally, we have posted all of our code to an anonymous google drive account, we will upload this to the authors github account after the review process has concluded. Since all datasets we report results on are publicaly available and our source code is publicly available, we believe our results are reproducible.\n\n5) In Figure 2 we use all auxiliary tasks averaging across subsets. For example when # of auxiliary tasks =1 this corresponds to an average of the performance of all single-auxiliary task models. When # of auxiliary tasks=2 we consider all combinations of size 2 and average the resulting performance. This figure demonstrates that additional streams of self-supervision tends to help, as average performance increases with number of auxiliary tasks. To provide additional insight into the performance of all auxiliary task combinations, we have added the full results (not just the averages) in the supplement section A2.\n\n6) Our main goal was not to obtain state-of-the-art results on these sequence level classification tasks, but to investigate the utility of a limited self-supervision framework. To this end we compared to a fully supervised network (our baseline), and ran experiments investigating different types of auxiliary tasks.

It is just one application of multitask learning. Also very similar idea has been implemented by [1]. In [1], the authors learn multi-level embedding to make disease/risk prediction, where the embedding was jointly trained by performing auxiliary prediction tasks that rely on this inherent EHR structure. The authors need to state what is the novelty of the proposed method compared with [1].\n\nIn addition, the performance evaluation missed many baselines. Table 1 seems more like a ablation study rather than a performance comparison.

We call this approach limited self-supervision, as we limit ourselves to only the data at-hand. We demonstrate the utility of limited self-supervision on three sequence-level classification tasks, two pertaining to real clinical data and one using synthetic data. Within this framework, we introduce novel forms of self-supervision and demonstrate their utility in improving performance on the target task. Our results indicate that limited self-supervision leads to a consistent improvement over a supervised baseline, across a range of domains. In particular, for the task of identifying atrial fibrillation from small amounts of electrocardiogram data, we observe a nearly 13% improvement in the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC) relative to the baseline (AUC-ROC=0.55 vs. AUC-ROC=0.62). Limited self-supervision applied to sequential data can aid in learning intermediate representations, making it particularly applicable in settings where data collection is difficult.", "code": "https://bit.ly/2l2X4ax", "keywords": ["Sequential Representation Learning", "Self-Supervision", "Function Approximation"], "paperhash": "fox|learning_through_limited_selfsupervision_improving_timeseries_classification_without_additional_data_via_auxiliary_tasks", "original_pdf": "/attachment/8b26e96938d70fe9ae84f9d54f774e1ffff1fe83.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nfox2020learning,\ntitle={Learning Through Limited Self-Supervision: Improving Time-Series Classification Without Additional Data via Auxiliary Tasks},\nauthor={Ian Fox and Harry Rubin-Falcone and Jenna Wiens},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJl5MeHKvB}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
