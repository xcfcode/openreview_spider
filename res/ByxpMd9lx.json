Thanks!\nEvaluation not changed.\n\n###\n\nThis paper proposes a hierarchical framework of transfer learning for sequence tagging, which is expected to help the target task with the source task, by sharing as many levels of representation as possible. It is a general framework for various neural models. The paper has extensive and solid experiments, and the performance is competitive with the state of the art on multiple benchmark datasets. The framework is clear by itself, except that more details about training procedure, i.e. sec-3.3, need to be added. \n\nThe experimental results show that for some task pairs {s,t}, this framework can help low-resource target task t, and the improvement increases with more levels of representations can be shared. Firstly, I suggest that the terms *source* and *target* should be more precisely defined in the current framework, because, due to Sec-3.3, the s and t in each pair are sort of interchangeable. That is, either of them can be the *source* or *target* task, especially when p(X=s)=p(X=t)=0.5 is used in the task sampling. The difference is: one is low-resourced and the other is not. Thus it could be thought of as multi-tasking between tasks with imbalanced resource. So one question is: does this framework simultaneously help both tasks in the pair, by learning more generalizable representations for different domains/applications/languages? Or is it mostly likely to only help the low-resourced one? Does it come with sacrifice on the high-resourced side? \n\nSecondly, as the paper shows that the low-resourced tasks are improved for the selected task pairs, it would also be interesting and helpful to know how often this could happen. That is, when the tasks are randomly paired (one chosen from a low-resource pool and the other from a high resource pool), how often could this framework help the low-resourced one?\n\nMoreover, the choice of T-A/T-B/T-C lies intuitively in how many levels of representation *could* be shared as possible. This implicitly assumes share more, help more. Although I tend to believe so, it would be interesting to have some empirical comparison. For example, one could perhaps select some cross-domain pair, and see if T-A > T-B > T-C on such pairs, as mentioned in the author\u2019s answer to the pre-review question. \n\nIn general, I think this is a solid paper, and more exploration could be done in this direction. So I tend to accept this paper.

We would like to respond to several questions raised by the reviewer.\n\nQ1\nThe objective function is symmetric for both the source and target tasks, which can be viewed as a multi-task learning framework. However, the training process is not symmetric as we perform early-stopping on the low-resourced task. It usually does not improve the performance on the high-resourced task by much (as can be seen in Figure 2 with 1.0 labeling rates), because when sufficient (or possibly infinite) labels are given, it is difficult to use auxiliary data from another task to improve the performance because of shifted distribution (e.g., covariate shift and concept drift).\nQ2\nWe tried to address the question \u201cwhen does transfer learning help\u201d in the paper. As shown in Figure 2, Table 2, and analysis in Section 4.2, with task pairs systematically picked, we observe that the following factors are crucial for the performance of our transfer learning approach: a)  label abundance for the target task, b) relatedness between the source and target tasks, and c) the number of parameters that can be shared.\nOur study covered a wide range of task pairs. Transfer learning helps for those task pairs, and the extent to which it helps depends on the above factors.\nQ3\nWe have also updated the paper to include the results of the study (applying different models to the same task pair)."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Transfer Learning for Sequence Tagging with Hierarchical Recurrent Networks", "abstract": "Recent papers have shown that neural networks obtain state-of-the-art performance on several different sequence tagging tasks.

Regarding the training framework.\n\nThe s and t in Section 3.3 refer to the indices of the source and target tasks. At each iteration, we sample either s or t from a set {s, t} using a binomial distribution. For example, in most cases we have p(X=s)=0.5 and p(X=t)=0.5, where X is a binary random variable. If X=s, we sample a batch of instances from task s, and then do an update step. If X=t, we sample a batch of instances from task t, and then do an update step.\n\nRepresentation sharing follows the illustration in Figure 1, where different architectures share different sets of parameters.\n\nWe do early stopping on the development set of the target task. \n\nThe source and target tasks indeed might have different convergence rates. This can be alleviated by tuning the binomial distribution mentioned above. However, in most cases, we simply let p(X=s)=p(X=t)=0.5 and it works fine.\n\nSorry about the confusion, and we will clarify this in our later version.\n\n2.

Do you sample <s,t> out of a pool of {<s,t>} or sample s and t separately out of {s} and {t} and then pair them? Are the representations shared across the pairs, e.g., the char/word embeddings that are the same for different pairs <s_1,t_1> and <s_2,t_2>?\nWhat is the stop criterion? With many <s,t> pairs, certain pair <s_i,t_i> may converge earlier than others. So how this issue is dealt?\n2. \nAlthough the way of selecting T-A/T-B/T-C is reasonable, it will be interesting to show some results when one certain task which is best-suited for T-A is treated as T-B/T-C."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Transfer Learning for Sequence Tagging with Hierarchical Recurrent Networks", "abstract": "Recent papers have shown that neural networks obtain state-of-the-art performance on several different sequence tagging tasks.
