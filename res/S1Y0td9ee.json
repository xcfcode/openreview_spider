"review": "The paper contributes to recent work investigating how neural networks can be used on graph-structured data. As far as I can tell, the proposed approach is the following:\n\n  1. Construct a hierarchical set of \"objects\" within the graph. Each object consists of multiple \"parts\" from the set of objects in the level below. There are potentially different ways a part can be part of an object (the different \\pi labels), which I would maybe call \"membership types\". In the experiments, the objects at the bottom level are vertices. At the next level they are radius 0 (just a vertex?) and radius 1 neighborhoods around each vertex, and the membership types here are either \"root\", or \"element\" (depending on whether a vertex is the center of the neighborhood or a neighbor). At the top level there is one object consisting of all of these neighborhoods, with membership types of \"radius 0 neighborhood\" (isn't this still just a vertex?) or \"radius 1 neighborhood\".\n\n  2. Every object has a representation. Each vertex's representation is a one-hot encoding of its degree. To construct an object's representation at the next level, the following scheme is employed:\n\n    a. For each object, sum the representation of all of its parts having the same membership type.\n    b. Concatenate the sums obtained from different membership types.\n    c. Pass this vector through a multi-layer neural net.\n\nI've provided this summary mainly because the description in the paper itself is somewhat hard to follow, and relevant details are scattered throughout the text, so I'd like to verify that my understanding is correct.\n\nSome additional questions I have that weren't clear from the text: how many layers and hidden units were used? What are the dimensionalities of the representations used at each layer? How is final classification performed? What is the motivation for the chosen \"ego-graph\" representation? \n\nThe proposed approach is interesting and novel, the compression technique appears effective, and the results seem compelling. However, the clarity and structure of the writing is quite poor. It took me a while to figure out what was going on---the initial description is provided without any illustrative examples, and it required jumping around the paper to figure for example how the \\pi labels are actually used. Important details around network architecture aren't provided, and very little in the way of motivation is given for many of the choices made. Were other choices of decomposition/object-part structures investigated, given the generality of the shift-aggregate-extract formulation? What motivated the choice of \"ego-graphs\"? Why one-hot degrees for the initial attributes?\n\nOverall, I think the paper contains a useful contribution on a technical level, but the presentation needs to be significantly cleaned up before I can recommend acceptance.", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Shift Aggregate Extract Networks", "abstract": "The Shift Aggregate Extract Network SAEN is an architecture for learning representations on social network data.\nSAEN decomposes input graphs into hierarchies made of multiple strata of objects.\nVector representations of each object are learnt by applying 'shift', 'aggregate' and 'extract' operations on the vector representations of its parts.\nWe propose an algorithm for domain compression which takes advantage of symmetries in hierarchical decompositions to reduce the memory usage and obtain significant speedups.\nOur method is empirically evaluated on real world social network datasets, outperforming the current state of the art.", "pdf": "/pdf/02368a8b5d40f512adf2e3a15a5f33eab0b561c1.pdf", "TL;DR": "Shift Aggregate Extract Networks for learning on social network data", "paperhash": "orsini|shift_aggregate_extract_networks", "keywords": ["Supervised Learning"], "conflicts": ["cs.kuleuven.be", "dinfo.unifi.it"], "authors": ["Francesco Orsini", "Daniele Baracchi", "Paolo Frasconi"], "authorids": ["francesco.orsini@kuleuven.be", "daniele.baracchi@unifi.it", "paolo.frasconi@unifi.it"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "duedate": 1481932799000, "tmdate": 1483122139439, "id": "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper461/official/review", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper461/reviewers"], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper461/AnonReviewer3", "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper461/AnonReviewer2", "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper461/AnonReviewer1"], "reply": {"forum": "S1Y0td9ee", "replyto": "S1Y0td9ee", "writers": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper461/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper461/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "review": {"order": 2, "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,20000}"}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"]}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"]}}}, "nonreaders": [], "expdate": 1489708799000, "cdate": 1483122139439}}}, {"tddate": null, "tmdate": 1481925598908, "tcdate": 1481925598908, "number": 1, "id": "SJP14kfEx", "invitation": "ICLR.cc/2017/conference/-/paper461/official/review", "forum": "S1Y0td9ee", "replyto": "S1Y0td9ee", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper461/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2017/conference/paper461/AnonReviewer3"], "content": {"title": "Might be something good here, but key details are missing.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "review": "Some of the key details in this paper are very poorly explained or not even explained at all. The model sounds interesting and there may be something good here, but it should not be published in it's current form. \n\nSpecific comments:\n\nThe description of the R_l,pi convolutions in Section 2.1 was unclear. Specifically, I wasn't confident that I understood what the labels pi represented.\n\nThe description of the SAEN structure in section 2.2 was worded poorly. My understanding, based on Equation 1, is that the 'shift' operation is simply a summation of the representations of the member objects, and that the 'aggregate' operation simply concatenates the representations from multiple relations.  In the 'shift' step, it seems more appropriate to average over the object's member's representations h_j, rather than sum over them.\n\nThe compression technique presented in Section 2.3 requires that multiple objects at a level have the same representation. Why would this ever occur, given that the representations are real valued and high-dimensional? The text is unintelligible: \"two objects are equivalent if they are made by same sets of parts for all the pi-parameterizations of the R_l,pi decomposition relation.\" \n\nThe 'ego graph patterns' in Figure 1 and 'Ego Graph  Neural Network' used in the experiments are never explained in the text, and no references are given.

How generic is the ego-graph decomposition you propose?

Have you thought about extending this work to additional settings, and if so, what kind of decompositions would make sense?
