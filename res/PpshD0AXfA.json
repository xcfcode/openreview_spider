It shows that the Jacobian of the DFT is equal to 1, which means that DFT does not add too much overhead. The results on the real-world datasets are encouraging and expected because the predictive results mainly rely on the overall trend of the time series. By analysis in the frequency domain, we usually can capture the main trend accurately. The main concerns for the paper are the computational overhead on the proposed algorithm on non-periodic, long, and variable-length time series.\n\n\n\n### Feedback\n\n* The strongest point of the paper is when the authors show that the Jacobian of the DFT matrix is 1. Thus, taking DFT does not make the generative model much more complex.\n* The other advantage of FF can be in handling missing values. Unfortunately, the authors do not expand on this aspect.\n* The main issue with the FF is its computational complexity. The authors write: \"To guarantee a lossless recovery of the time-series x via inverse DFT, we ensure that $N\\geq T$.\" This means FF is impractical for long time series and quite inefficient in handling variable-length time series.\n* Moreover, Fourier transforms are mainly intended for periodic signals and do not provide concise representations of non-stationary signals. This inefficiency is why Wavelets and DWT have been invented. The synthetic data generation model gives an unfair advantage to FF because it uses periodic signals.\n* The authors' description for Eq. (8) is misleading. $\\mathbf{H}$ and $\\mathbf{h}$ are not fixed parameters, they are functions of the input. Thus, the model is a form of self-attention. I hope that the authors have done the training correctly. \n*The authors criticize GANs for memorization but never show that FFs do not memorize data points.\n* The choice of generating H using a BiRNN on only the $Im(X)$ is puzzling. Why didn't the authors use complex-valued RNNs to operate on both real and imaginary parts and not lose the phase information?\n* On page 2, the authors discuss a parametric model for T, but they never elaborate further on it.\n* \"where $x_-$ signifies the reversed version of $x$\": the authors should clarify that this is the reflection with respect to $x=0$ axis. Otherwise, we should add a time-shift operation too.\n\n----\n### Post-Response Update\nI don't think the authors have answered my second set of questions. While there are some doubts remaining in the paper, the idea looks fine. Although, I think a new paper with DWT will outperform this approach soon. I do not change my vote at this time.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1980/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1980/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Time-series Modeling with Fourier Flows", "authorids": ["~Ahmed_Alaa1", "~Alex_James_Chan1", "~Mihaela_van_der_Schaar2"], "authors": ["Ahmed Alaa", "Alex James Chan", "Mihaela van der Schaar"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Generating synthetic time-series data is crucial in various application domains, such as medical prognosis, wherein research is hamstrung by the lack of access to data due to concerns over privacy.

The time-series data are first converted to the Fourier domain. Instead of the affine coupling layer previously presented in literature, the authors have designed a frequency domain version of the same.\n\nPros:\n1. The paper is well-written and is largely easy to follow. \n2. Operating in the Fourier domain as well the affine coupling layer proposed in the paper are interesting novel contributions in the context of designing flow models for time-series.\n3. Based on the experiments presented, Fourier Flow is surprisingly effective when compared to RealNVP, and also slightly outperforms other methods like TimeGAN. \n\nCons:\n1. The authors should try to explain what it is about operating in the Fourier domain causes the improvements in prediction error. As the Fourier transform is invertible, I would imagine that the novel affine coupling layer has a larger role to play in this. This is also what the authors seem to suggest in Section 4.3. It would be great if the authors could add a baseline experiment operating in the time domain with the proposed affine layer (Equation (8)). \n2. In terms of the explanations in the paper, a lot of space has been devoted to explain the Fourier transform, its properties and how to compute it efficiently. While it is done well, I feel these are very well known facts. For the determinant of the Fourier matrix, we can just use the fact that it is unitary and we immediately have |det(W)| = 1. Instead, additional experiments analysing the experiments could be more useful, such as understanding the role of network depth etc. for this particular method, or additional t-SNE plots for the remaining datasets. \n3. As in all papers such as this one, it is not easy to see how the baseline approaches have been trained and how well the hyperparameters have been tuned. \n\nBased on the author response, I am willing to increase my rating for this paper. \n\nUPDATE AFTER AUTHOR RESPONSE:\n\nThe authors have addressed all my queries and made the changes that I requested.

We apologize for not incorporating your suggestions into the revised version as this comment was made visible later in time.\n\nBelow are our responses to your comments:\n\n- It is true that our flow passes the imaginary part of the time series as is to $Y$. However, the imaginary part is already encoded into the spectral filter itself, hence both the real and imaginary parts are affected by and represented in the transformation. (i.e., the concatenated vector $Y$ does not comprise \"real\" and \"imaginary\" parts, but rather a $2D$-dimensional real-valued vector that constitutes the new space. The first component in $Y$, $Y_1$, depends on both real and imaginary parts). The reason we keep the imaginary part unchanged is to ensure that the spectral layer's Jacobean is easy to compute (i.e. a diagonal matrix). This approach is equivalent to the time domain approach used in GLOW, which passes have the feature dimensions as is and filters the other half only. \n\nAlso please note that when cascading many flows, we alternate between applying the spectral filter to the real and imaginary parts. Since we never practically use 1 flow for the transformation, both real and imaginary components get used for spectral filtering every other cascaded flow. \n\n- You are right, $\\hat{X} = Re(\\hat{X}) + j Y_2$ because $Y_2 = Im(\\hat{X})$. The confusion happens because we should have made it clearer in the table that $Im(\\hat{X})$ is set to the $Y_2$ subset of the input $Y$ to the inverse function.\n\nEq. (8) is correct because, as explained in the previous point, $Y$ is $2D$-dimensional real valued vector that concatenates the values of the $D$-dimensional  real and imaginary components output from the spectral filtering layer. For instance, if the DFT is 1 scalar complex value 2+3j, then $Y$ is a 2-D vector [2*H(3), 3]. \n\nWe hope that this clarifies the transformation function and resolves the confusion.\n\n- Yes, we have also noticed that the result on the Energy data set is much better than other data sets. Also, it seems that both RealNVP and FF perform well on the data set, which may suggest a discrepancy between the evaluation of flow models and other baselines. We have used the exact same legacy code in (Yoon et al 2019) to evaluate our models, but since the evaluation metric itself involves training an LSTM model, it might be that the evaluation models trained in the runs involved in evaluating our model are drastically better. We will investigate this issue further and make sure the performance gap is explained, and will exclude this dataset should we remain unsure about the explanation.\n\nThanks a lot for your suggestions; all will be considered in the final version of the paper.\n\n- We will tone down this statement. (The same concern is echoed by reviewer 1.) \n- \"Independent\" may not be the best word to describe P(X, T), this statement will be replaced to reflect that T is considered as the parent node in the graphical model.\n- We use a normal distribution as the \"prior\", which is standard in almost all flow models. We will clarify this.\n- Both missing data and irregular sampling (which can be thought of as equivalent in time series) can be handled simply by assuming that the time domain signal is multiplied by a train of delta functions $\\sum_{k \\in K} \\delta(t - k)$, where $K$ is the set of time steps with non-missing data. We will add a note on this and show how missing data can be conceptualized as another form of spectral filtering, where the filter is the DFT of $\\sum_{k \\in K} \\delta(t - k)$ (which also happens to be another train of delta functions in the frequency domain).\n\nThanks again for your feedback.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1980/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1980/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Time-series Modeling with Fourier Flows", "authorids": ["~Ahmed_Alaa1", "~Alex_James_Chan1", "~Mihaela_van_der_Schaar2"], "authors": ["Ahmed Alaa", "Alex James Chan", "Mihaela van der Schaar"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Generating synthetic time-series data is crucial in various application domains, such as medical prognosis, wherein research is hamstrung by the lack of access to data due to concerns over privacy.

Does this mean that the odd part of the generated time series has fourier coefficients drawn from the prior without affected by the flow?  If this would be true, I don't understand why FF works for datasets that have non-trivial odd parts.  \n\n- I suppose in Table1, the last equation in the spectral filtering/inverse function cell should be $\\hat{X} = Re(\\hat{X}) + j Y_2$ because $Im(\\hat{X})$ is not defined.  Is the last equation in Eq.(8) correct?  Since y1 is the even part and y2 is the odd part, it should be y = y1+y2.  Actually I doubt that I misunderstand some of these parts, and came to the conclusion that the odd part is unchanged in the question above.  Perhaps what is unclear is how Y = concatenate(Y1, Y2) is passed to and treated in the next spectral filtering layer.  I understood that in the next layer, the first part of Y, i.e. Y1, is again treated as $Re(\\hat{X})$ and Y2 as $Im(\\hat{X})$.  Maybe I'm wrong, and the real and the imaginary parts are somehow mixed over multiple layers.  Please make it clear how the original latent variable Y drawn from the prior is transformed to the time-series in the output through multiple layers.\n \n- In Table 2, RealNVP and FF give much better results than the original on the \"Energy\" dataset.  Are those results right?  Can you explain why it can happen?  Is the evaluation appropriate?  \n\nMinor suggestions (not need to reply in the rebuttal)\n- FF also has also no privacy guarantee.  The observation that FF learns broad distribution doesn't mean it doesn't memorize particular data.  If the authors cannot show stronger evidence on the privacy issue, the statement should be weakened.\n- In p.2 \"we model the distribution p(T) independently following ...\"  Independently from what?  In Eq.(2), x and T are not necessarily (and shouldn't be) independent.\n- The data generation process should be explicitly written.  What prior for Y or ($Y^{(0)}$ for multilayer case) is used?\n- Related to one of the questions the reviewers raised.  Can you somehow use FF for missing value imputation?  It would be nice to show superresolution performance by using the current method.  Also, I'd like to hear your thoughts on how to make FF cope with irregular missing values, which should often happen in medical data.\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1980/Area_Chair1"], "readers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1980/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1980/Authors", "everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1980/Area_Chair1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Time-series Modeling with Fourier Flows", "authorids": ["~Ahmed_Alaa1", "~Alex_James_Chan1", "~Mihaela_van_der_Schaar2"], "authors": ["Ahmed Alaa", "Alex James Chan", "Mihaela van der Schaar"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Generating synthetic time-series data is crucial in various application domains, such as medical prognosis, wherein research is hamstrung by the lack of access to data due to concerns over privacy.

In the signal processing literature, these signals are known as energy signals. In fact, because all signals we deal with are of a finite-duration, none of these are periodic. The Fourier transform is not restricted to or intended for periodic signals only, neither does it fail to provide an invertible transform for any non-periodic signal **as long as it is integrable as all practical non-stationary signals are**. \n\nIt is true, however, that our flow will be significantly more efficient in representing periodic signals such as the sinusoidal signal involved in our synthetic data experiments, or the ECG data involved in our extra experiments (Please refer to our response to Reviewer 4 for more details on this). **While a more concise representation of periodic and quasi-periodic signals is one of the advantages of our model, it is neither the only advantage nor the key one** (please refer to our response to Reviewer 4 where we list 3 advantages for using DFT). While this advantage manifested in the synthetic data experiments, please note that FFs performed competitively on real world data sets as well, where the data was non-periodic and non-stationary. \n\nFinally, extending our work using other spectral transforms such as Wavelets and DWT as you suggest is an excellent idea. In fact, our approach is general enough to accommodate any unitary spectral transform that enjoys the convolution-muliplication duality. A generalized Fourier transform learnable with learnable frequency scales and phase shift is also another option that can capture non-stationarity. Importantly, all of these alternatives will hinge on the same concepts and architectures presented in our paper, hence we view them as extensions rather than alternatives. In the final version of the paper, we will add a brief discussion on these possible extensions.\n\n***References***\n\n[R1] Kirichenko, Polina, Pavel Izmailov, and Andrew Gordon Wilson. \"Why normalizing flows fail to detect out-of-distribution data.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 33 (2020).\n\n[R2] Grover, Aditya, Manik Dhar, and Stefano Ermon. \"Flow-gan: Bridging implicit and prescribed learning in generative models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.08868 1 (2017)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1980/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1980/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Time-series Modeling with Fourier Flows", "authorids": ["~Ahmed_Alaa1", "~Alex_James_Chan1", "~Mihaela_van_der_Schaar2"], "authors": ["Ahmed Alaa", "Alex James Chan", "Mihaela van der Schaar"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Generating synthetic time-series data is crucial in various application domains, such as medical prognosis, wherein research is hamstrung by the lack of access to data due to concerns over privacy.

To recapitulate the chief points pertaining to the computational efficiency of FFs, please recall the following:\n\n- With FFs, we can implement time domain convolution in linearithimic time $O(N log N)$, whereas implementing the same operation directly in the time domain without the DFT layer would be of an $O(N^2)$ complexity.\n\n- As we have shown in Sec 4, the DFT transform is unitary and hence its Jacobean matrix is trivial with an $O(1)$ complexity. Using another trainable transform that would provide the same representational complexity (achieved via time domain convolutions) as FF would cost a complexity of $O(N^3)$ for computing the Jacobean determinants.  \n\nWe understand that your concern pertains to the way we handle variable length: by ensuring that $N > T$ for lossless recovery, the cost of training would be unnecessarily high if the maximum length time series is much longer than the average length in the training data. However, we think that variable length time series can be very easily and efficiently handled in our model, and our flow construct is not in any way compromised by this issue for the following reasons:\n\n- First, note that the extra computational complexity of setting $N = T_{max}$ instead of $T_{avg}$ (where $T_{max}$ and $T_{avg}$ are the maximum and average lengths of the time series in the data) **only costs an extra linear complexity of $T_{max} - T_{avg}$**, which in most practical applications would be negligible. \n\n- More importantly, we note that because our spectral filtering layer uses and RNN, we do not have to fix the size of the FFT transform at all. **The flow can easily deal with variable length series simply by generating variable length $h$ and $H$ from the BiRNN layer for each training point.** This is in fact one key advantage of using an RNN instead of a feedfroward NN in the spectral filtering layer.\n\n- **The size of the FFT transform $N$ can also be varyed across different batches,** where in each batch we set $N$ to the maximum sequence length within each batch. This will minimze the extra computational cost associated with extremely variable lengths of sequences and a fixed FFT per training iteration.  \n\nIn the original submission, we adopted the naive solution of fixing $N > T$ because most data sets involved in our experiments do not have big variances in sequence lengths, and hence we opted to simplify the exposition of our model by making this simple modeling choice. However, this is not the only modeling choice one can make---**variable lengths sequences are not an impediment to our model as any of the three alternative modeling choices above can be used** to deal with large variability in sequence lengths more efficiently. **It is also important to note that this flexibility in modeling variable length sequences are only possible because of the usage of DFT (which is naturally capable of upsampling or downsampling time domain series), and the usage of BiRNN which is capable of generating variable length filters.**\n\nWhile we disagree that variable-length sequences hinder our model, we totally agree that the point you raised is important, hence we will clarify the alternative modeling choices stated above in the final version of the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1980/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1980/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Time-series Modeling with Fourier Flows", "authorids": ["~Ahmed_Alaa1", "~Alex_James_Chan1", "~Mihaela_van_der_Schaar2"], "authors": ["Ahmed Alaa", "Alex James Chan", "Mihaela van der Schaar"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Generating synthetic time-series data is crucial in various application domains, such as medical prognosis, wherein research is hamstrung by the lack of access to data due to concerns over privacy.

In what follows, we provide a point-by-point response to your comments, and explain the changes that will take place in the final version of the paper in order to reflect your suggestions. \n\n***Clarifications***\n\nFirst off, we would like to address some of your concerns by clarifying some points that may have not been clear in the original version of this submission. \n\n1) *Regarding equation (8) and the notation for $H$ and $h$*\n\nThank you for pointing out to this typo. As you mention, $H$ and $h$ are not fixed parameters, but they should rather be denoted as $H(x)$ and $h(x)$ to avoid confusion. Of course, we have done the training using the spectral filtering architecture in Sec 4.2 and Fig 1. \n\n2) *Do FFs memorize training data?*\n\nPlease note that our criticism of generative models that can potentially memorize data points was directed at the **implicit density modeling approach** in general, and not just GANs. This is one of the key motivations for developing an **explicit density model** instead. Fourier flows, unlike GANs, are explicit density models that specify a class of probability distributions as its hypothesis class, and then selects the best distribution within this class to maximize a tractable and exact likelihoods. Because of its reliance on a maximum likelihood approach instead of a discriminator-generator architecture, normalizing flows has been shown to be less prone to data memorization [R1], and some previous works have even combined Flows and GANs to help \"regularize\" GANs' training and suppress its potential for data memorization [R2]. \n\nWhile the theoretical generalization properties of GANs have been previously investigated (Nagarajan et al. (2018)), less work has been done in studying the theoretical generalization performance of flows. Proving that normalizing flows do not memorize data is beyond the scope of this paper as it would amount for a broader and more general result that does not just apply for Fourier flows or the time series setup. Please note though that we have shown (empirically) that FFs produce smoother distributions that do not concentrate probability mass on training points compared to TimeGANs (see Figure 2(a)). \n\nIn the final version of this paper, we will make it clear that rigorous comparisons of data memorization potential in both classes of models is an important topic for future work, and we will be careful with phrasing the claims related to data memorization in the introductory section.\n\n3) *Why BiRNN operates on $Im(X)$ only?*\n\nWe can think of the complex number $Re(X) + j Im(X)$ (for a $D$-dimensional $X$) as a new feature with $2D$ dimensions. The spectral filtering layer in our model uses the same architecture of the affine coupling layer in RealNVP and GLOW: it uses half of the dimensions (which in this case is $Im(X)$) to generate the data-dependent filter $H$, and then applies this filter to the remaining dimensions (which in this case is $Re(X)$). The advantage of this scheme is that inversion is easy as the Jacobean of this transformation is a triangular matrix.\n\n**Please note that this transformation does not throw away the phase information.** In fact, the phase information is conveyed in $angle(X)$, which is split between both the real and imaginary values of $X$. Moreover, both $Re(X)$ and $Im(X)$ are present in the computation of $Y_1$ as highlighted in Table 1. Finally, and most importantly, when we cascade multiple flows, we alternate between generating the filter using $Re(X)$ and $Im(X)$ (and applying it to $Im(X)$ and $Re(X)$, respectively), so the spectral filter is not generated exculsively using  $Im(X)$ in all of the cascaded flows. This point was not mentioned in the original submission but we will highlight it in the final version of the paper.   \n\n4) *Other issues*\n\n- The sequence length $T$ is modeled through a simple binomial distribution. This was mentioned in page 2 but we will highlight it more prominently in the final version of the paper.\n\n- We will clarify that $x_{-}$ is a reflection with respect to the $x=0$ axis. Thank you for pointing out to this issue.\n\n- It is true that another advantage of FF is that it can be in handling missing values. Because the competing baselines do not have any inherent mechanisms for handling missing data, we did not consider missing data in our experiments to enable a fair comparison. However, we will add a discussion on the advantages of FFs when dealing with missing variables or irregulary sampled time series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1980/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1980/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Time-series Modeling with Fourier Flows", "authorids": ["~Ahmed_Alaa1", "~Alex_James_Chan1", "~Mihaela_van_der_Schaar2"], "authors": ["Ahmed Alaa", "Alex James Chan", "Mihaela van der Schaar"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Generating synthetic time-series data is crucial in various application domains, such as medical prognosis, wherein research is hamstrung by the lack of access to data due to concerns over privacy.

Below is a description of the changes that we will apply to the final version of the paper in order to incorporate all your suggestions.\n\n***Additional experimental results***\n\nWe have added two data sets to the experimental setup in Section 5.2: (a) MIMIC-III, which is data set for intensive care unit (ICU) time-series data [R1], and (b) an electrocardiogram (ECG) data set from Kaggle [R2]. These two data sets cover two medical applications with different classes of time series data: ICU data comprises trends of biomarkers for severly ill patients over time, and ECG data comprises quasi-periodic heart's rhythm data. We hope that these additional data sets cover a wider range of applications as requested. We compared Fourier Flows with RealNVP and the most competitive baseline (TimeGAN)---results are provided below. In the final paper, we will add the performance results for all of the remaining baselines as well.   \n\n_______________________________________________________\n   **Predictive scores (95% confidence intervals)**\n_______________________________________________________\n **Model**     ----------    **MIMIC**     ----------    **ECG**       \n_______________________________________________________\nTimeGAN----------0.1501 $\\pm$ 0.04   ----------  0.1621 $\\pm$ 0.03\n\nRealNVP-----------0.1521 $\\pm$ 0.05   ----------  0.1602 $\\pm$ 0.03 \n\nFF--------------------0.1517 $\\pm$ 0.04   ----------  0.1567 $\\pm$ 0.02\n_______________________________________________________\n\nAs can be seen in the Table above, FF significantly outperforms the other models on the ECG data set---this is likely because of the quasi-period nature of this data, which makes Fourier transform a natural representation for samples in ECG. FF also performs competitvely on MIMIC-III. \n\n***Visualizing synthetic data samples***\n\nThank you for this important suggestion. Samples from the sinusodial data set (Sec 5.1), the stock data and the ECG data (Sec 5.2) can be viewed through this anonymized link: https://ibb.co/wMkM2GX .

Please recall that one of the main motivations behind using the Fourier transform in our flow is the computational efficiency of the FFT algorithm. As discussed in the paper, the Jacobian computation for the DFT is $O(1)$, whereas the computation of the DFT itself is linearithmetic, e.g. $O(N log N)$. This makes the computationally complexity of the overall procedure in the same order of the complexity for normalizing flows SOTA.\n\nTo demonstrate the runtime complexity of our model, we compared the runtime of FF, RealNVP (the normalizing flow SOTA) and TimeGAN on the synthetic sinusoisal data set in the Table below. As we can see, FF and RealNVP run in roughly the same amount of time, whereas both methods train much more faster than the TimeGAN baseline.

Below is a detailed response to your comments and a description of how we will incorporate all your suggestions in the final version of the paper.\n\n***Improvements in predictive performance***\n\nPlease note that the main goal of the paper was to develop a first explicit likelihood model for time series data that is trained via exact likelihood maximization. Thus, while it is true that the performance improvements (with respect to the predictive power of an RNN model trained on synthetic data) on most data sets were marginal, the key message of our paper is that it is possible to use explicit likelihood generative models that **perform competitively** with SOTA implicit likelihood models such as GANs. We believe that this is a significant result for three reasons:\n\n- To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generative model for time series data that can be optimized using the **exact** likelihood. This is an advancement on existing explicit likelihood models, such as HMMs (Beal et al. (2002)) or Deep state space models  (Krishnan et al. (2017)), which can only be optimized using variational lower bounds.\n\n- Unlike SOTA implicit likelihood models, such as GANs, our model's accuracy (goodness-of-fit) can be evaluated using the exact model likelihood.\n\n- Unlike SOTA implicit likelihood models, such as GANs, explicit likelihood models such as ours are less prone to data memorization, which is suitable for applications with strict privacy requirements. \n\n\n***Expanding the experimental results***\n\nFirst off, we would like to highlight that in our original submission, we **have considered three real-world data sets (Energy, Stocks and Lung cancer)** and not just one as indicated in your review. \n\nIn addition to these 3 data sets, we have also added two extra data sets to the experimental setup in Section 5.2: (a) MIMIC-III, which is data set for intensive care unit (ICU) time-series data [R1], and (b) an electrocardiogram (ECG) data set from Kaggle [R2]. These extra data sets cover two medical applications with different classes of time series data: ICU data comprises trends of biomarkers for severly ill patients over time, and ECG data comprises quasi-periodic heart's rhythm data. We hope that these extra data sets address your request for a strengthened empirical study and widened application fields. Performance comparison with the most competitive baseline (TimeGAN) is provided below. In the final paper, we will add the performance results for all of the remaining baselines as well.   \n\n_______________________________________________________\n   **Predictive scores (95% confidence intervals)**\n_______________________________________________________\n **Model**     ----------    **MIMIC**     ----------    **ECG**       \n_______________________________________________________\nTimeGAN----------0.1501 $\\pm$ 0.04   ----------  0.1621 $\\pm$ 0.03\n\nRealNVP-----------0.1521 $\\pm$ 0.05   ----------  0.1602 $\\pm$ 0.03 \n\nFF--------------------0.1517 $\\pm$ 0.04   ----------  0.1567 $\\pm$ 0.02\n_______________________________________________________\n\n\n***Description of the data set and evaluation metrics***\n\nPlease note that, as mentioned in the paper, we have replicated the experimental setup in (Yoon et al.

The combination of DFT + a subsequent transformation (even as simple as an affine transform) creates an overall complex transformation. **We are highlighting this point to stress that Fourier transofrm is not a redundant step, and that the spectral filtering layer by itself would reduce to a standard RealNVP model (with an RNN instead of an NN) without the DFT layer.**\n\nAs for the improvement in predictive accuracy, we believe that this comes from three sources, which we explain as follows:\n\n1) *DFT layer compresses temporal information into a low-dimensional spectral representation*\n\nThe first modeling advantage in a Fourier Flow is that the DFT layer compresses temporal patterns into lower-dimensional spectral patterns, enabling a more efficient distribution learning. Consider for instance the sinusoidal example in Sec 5.1. In this example the data $x$ is drawn from the following stochastic process:\n\n$x \\sim \\sin(2\\pi\\,f\\,t),$ where $f$ is a random frequency drawn from a predefined distribution.\n\nTo model length-$T$ time series drawn from such process using conventional methods, we would need to model a $T$-dimensional random variable. However, using the DFT transform, we would be modeling the spectral representation of $x$ given by:\n\n$X = \\frac{j}{2} [\\delta(v + f) - \\delta(v - f)],$\n\nwhere $\\delta$ is the Dirac-delta function. Thus, the spectral representation $X$ can be fully described with one piece of information, which is the location of the frequency component $f$. This means that modeling the distribution of $X$ simply reduces to modeling a 1-dimensional random variable, which is much more efficient than modeling a $T$-dimensional variable. This is the reason why our model significantly outeprforms RealNVP in the task of modeling random sine waves in Section 5.1. \n\nWhile the sinusoidal example (or periodic signals in general) is an extreme case wherein a single variable describes the entire time series, a spectral representation of a time series will in general be a low-dimensional compression of repetitive temporal patterns and trends. \n\n2) *Fourier flows enable constructing complex transformations at no extra cost for Jacobean computation*\n\nAs explained above, even without the novel spectral layer, a DFT layer followed by a simple transform (such as an affine transform) would amount for a complex overall transform without any extra complications associated with the Jacobean transformation. Also, because the DFT layer parameters are not learnable, the Fourier flow does not involve more parameters than an equivalent time-domain flow that uses the same filtering layer $h$.\n\n3) *The novel spectral filtering layer*\n\nAs you rightly point out, the novel spectral filtering layer used after the DFT step is another source of modeling improvement.\n\nWe will highlight the three points above in the final version of the paper.\n\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1980/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1980/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Time-series Modeling with Fourier Flows", "authorids": ["~Ahmed_Alaa1", "~Alex_James_Chan1", "~Mihaela_van_der_Schaar2"], "authors": ["Ahmed Alaa", "Alex James Chan", "Mihaela van der Schaar"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Generating synthetic time-series data is crucial in various application domains, such as medical prognosis, wherein research is hamstrung by the lack of access to data due to concerns over privacy.

Convolutions are performed by multiplication in the frequency domain through a spectral affine layer that transform the even or odd part of the signal using a data dependent filter. The resulting time-domain convolution has input dependent weights, an interesting and original approach clearly different from other convolutional flow such as [1]. \n\nRelevance:\nTime series generative modeling has a wide range of crucial applications in fields ranging from medicine to finance. The new method shows very promising performance and it has the potential to become a state-of-the-art method for time series generation.\n\nOriginality:\nThe use of the DFT and spectral affine layers is original in the context of normalizing flows. Importantly, the DFT is very suitable for flows since it is an isometry and has therefore a trivial Jacobin. The use of input dependent convolutions is very interesting even in the context of regular ConvNet architectures. \n\nScientific quality:\nThe method is clearly presented and well motivated. The experiment section cover a decently large set of experiments and performance are compared with a very large number of state-of-the-art baselines.\n\nPros:\n- Original new architecture well motivated for time series applications\n- Rigorous experiments with multiple relevant baselines\n- Very promising experimental results\n\nCons:\n- It would have been useful to see a wider range of real world applications\n\nMinor points:\n- I would like to have a figure with the time domain sampled generated by the FF and the other baselines.
