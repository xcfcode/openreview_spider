The reported results are not encouraging though. \n\nIt's an interesting new domain to apply representation learning techniques, but the technical contribution of the paper is very limited. The authors applied autoencoders out-of-box from some existing library, and reported numbers. Adding these latent representation did not bring any add-on value to the baseline suggests that it was probably not correctly applied. The paper is too short for readers to get much details on what have been tried, and what worked or didn't, and why.
