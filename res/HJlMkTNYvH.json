Since the overall error defined in (5) is a weighted summation of three objectives, it is not a real multi-objective optimization where multiple objectives are optimized simultaneously. \n\nAuthors define a hypergraph to jointly model documents and entities. However, there lacks the novelty on the objectives defined in this paper. The optimization using gradient descent is also trivial. \n\nIt is hard to understand why equations (2) and (3) share the same objectives but the two sets of samples have totally different meanings. Moreover, both objectives are summed uniformly as shown in the experimental setting. Please explain it in details.\n\nFor the quantitative evaluation, Table 1 shows the percentage of papers for each community per cluster. There are many numbers for a single clustering problem. It might be preferred to use a single measurement such as normalized mutual information or accuracy for clustering evaluation. In this way, it is easy to judge the compared methods.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper292/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper292/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "Many large text collections exhibit graph structures, either inherent to the content itself or encoded in the metadata of the individual documents.\nExample graphs extracted from document collections are co-author networks, citation networks, or named-entity-cooccurrence networks.\nFurthermore, social networks can be extracted from email corpora, tweets, or social media. \nWhen it comes to visualising these large corpora, either the textual content or the network graph are used.\n\nIn this paper, we propose to incorporate both, text and graph, to not only visualise the semantic information encoded in the documents' content but also the relationships expressed by the inherent network structure.\nTo this end, we introduce a novel algorithm based on multi-objective optimisation to jointly position embedded documents and graph nodes in a two-dimensional landscape.\nWe illustrate the effectiveness of our approach with real-world datasets and show that we can capture the semantics of large document collections better than other visualisations based on either the content or the network information.", "title": "MODiR: Multi-Objective Dimensionality Reduction for Joint Data Visualisation", "keywords": ["dimensionality reduction", "visualisation", "text visualisation", "network drawing"], "authors": ["Tim Repke", "Ralf Krestel"], "TL;DR": "Dimensionality reduction algorithm to visualise text with network information, for example an email corpus or co-authorships.", "authorids": ["tim.repke@hpi.uni-potsdam.de", "ralf.krestel@hpi.de"], "pdf": "/pdf/3d61cf503e9dd2bb8b536afe887b0f8e8ab6e70e.pdf", "paperhash": "repke|modir_multiobjective_dimensionality_reduction_for_joint_data_visualisation", "original_pdf": "/attachment/3d61cf503e9dd2bb8b536afe887b0f8e8ab6e70e.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nrepke2020modir,\ntitle={{\\{}MOD{\\}}iR: Multi-Objective Dimensionality Reduction for Joint Data Visualisation},\nauthor={Tim Repke and Ralf Krestel},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJlMkTNYvH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).

Authors report quantitative (metric: precision of k-means++ clustering & AtEdge-length) and qualitative analysis (visualization). \n\n[Comments]\nExperimental analysis could improve e.g. by including more baselines (e.g. other baselines the authors cite in the paper), or by providing more quantitative analysis - e.g. performance at varying degree of completeness / artificial perturbation of the graph. In the current manuscript, the quantitative analysis does not immediately show the benefit or the characteristics of the proposed approaches. In the main section of the manuscript, the analysis is limited to citation networks. \n\nWhile the idea of leveraging both semantic and structural information for the purpose of dimensionality reduction seems to be new and interesting, similar approaches have been explored for text classification tasks (e.g. via graph convolutional networks).
