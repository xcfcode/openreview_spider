I would not count this as much in terms of novelty.\n\nThe idea of dealing with heterogeneous noise in BO is interesting.\n\nThe related background in Gaussian process is standard and could be omitted. \n\nThe experimental section is weak. The experiments are demonstrated using low dimensional functions (1-2 dim).\n\nThe experiment needs to compare with Random baseline. Under the noise setting, the Random approach performs very competitive to BO. \nThe y-axis in the experiment, the paper has considered the objective function value + noise.

I would encourage the authors to check the source code before releasing.\nThe paper focuses on demonstrating the heteroscedasticity in the surrogate model using [1].

The use of a heteroscedastic GP when performing Bayesian Optimization, this is in contrast to the more common practice of assuming homoscedastic noise, even when this does not quite fit the data. They use the existing algorithm called most likely heteroscedastic GP, and quote previous work that performed BO using different heteroscedastic GP implementations.\n2. They introduce two new acquisition functions that incorporate the predicted observation noise, either making candidates more likely or less likely to be chosen when predicted noise is higher, depending on the requirements. This are fairly minor extensions/heuristics if taken on their own, as they do not provide a very strong motivation indicating why these acquisition functions are useful or better than existing ones, other than that they take heteroscedasticity into account.\n3. They run a set of experiments on the above settings. Unfortunately the experiments are very limited, and their method does not improve on the baselines in a statistically significant way. Two of the experiments are on simple synthetic settings, the third approximates a real world setting, although the approximation is quite rough and they don't convincingly argue for it being realistic, neither do they give convincing motivation of their objective which uses g +- standard deviation.\n4. They provide source code of their implementation.\n\nThe paper is easy to understand, and covers an interesting topic, so while I don't think it meets the bar of ICLR (due to lack of convincing and non-trivial contributions) I think it could perhaps be made into a workshop submission with some of the following changes:\n* A wider set of experimental settings, and more replication such that any differences become statistically significant. It would also be worthwhile comparing to random search.\n* A better justification of the objective used in the experiments, using g +- the standard deviation appears fairly arbitrary, and there is no strong enough reason to believe this is a good approximation of what the cost is in the case of real world problems.\n* Better theoretical justification of the acquisition function; one option is to introduce more principled acquisition function like, say, expected upper/lower bound.\n\n\nOther notes/comments:\nabstract: as well as a real-world -> as well as *on* a real-world...\nsection 1 \"As a case study\" -> not very clear what this means\nincumbent best is not well defined, is it the empirical value of f used or the mean predicted f on the evaluated candidates?\nsection 6.2 \"outperforms\" -> this is not clear if one looks at the confidence intervals in the results\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2488/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2488/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["rrg27@cam.ac.uk", "mg770@cam.ac.uk", "av495@cam.ac.uk", "aal44@cam.ac.uk"], "title": "Antifragile and Robust Heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimisation", "authors": ["Ryan Rhys-Griffiths", "Miguel Garcia-Ortegon", "Alexander A.

To tackle this problem, the authors replace the conventional homoscedastic GP model with a heteroscedastic GP model. In the case of robustness to aleatoric noise/uncertainty, the authors have modified EI by simply either scaling down [32] or subtracting from its value more when the aleatoric noise increases. In the case of antifragility to aleatoric noise/uncertainty, they do the opposite.\n\nThe modifications of EI to handle robustness and antifragility to aleatoric noise/uncertainty are simple and straightforward, one of which is similar to the augmented EI of [32].\n\nThere are some technical ambiguities, as detailed below. In particular, the choice of objective function (equation 9) for this problem needs to be justified and motivated by the practical applications described in Section 1.\n\nSince no convergence guarantee is given, a more extensive empirical analysis with real datasets needs to be provided to better understand the performance and behavior of the proposed BO algorithms. In particular, though the authors have motivated their problem using the compelling applications of materials and drug discovery, no experimental result for these applications has been provided to support the motivation of this work.\n\n\n\nDETAILED COMMENTS\n\nThe authors seem to motivate the significance of their problem of interest through the key applications of materials and drug discovery which I can appreciate. Unfortunately, experimental results in such applications were not available in this paper to \"close the loop\" in supporting the motivation of this work, begging the question whether their proposed BO algorithm indeed works for these key applications. For example, why is the FreeSolv hydration energy dataset not used for your experiments?\n\n\nFor Fig. 1, how exactly do you extract the error magnitudes from the FreeSolv hydration energy dataset? How do you exactly define the notion of calculated vs. experimental uncertainties? Fig. 1 shows that the noise peaks with a relatively high frequency at a single error magnitude value. Would the assumption of homoscedastic noise at this peaked value be detrimental to BO? A sensitivity analysis would be useful here.\n\n\nFor the soil phosphorus fraction dataset (Fig. 2), the skewed distribution of the measurements (few extremely large measurements and many small-valued measurements) may not be due to heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty. In fact, in the literature of earth/environmental science, such a dataset is often modeled using a log-Gaussian process (or log-normal kriging), that is, the log-measurements follow a GP:\n\nWebster, R., and Oliver, M. 2007. Geostatistics for Environmental Scientists. John Wiley & Sons, 2nd edition.\n\nCan the authors provide supporting evidence (in the form of references) that such a dataset is due to heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty?\n\n\n\nOn page 4, step 2 of the most likely heteroscedastic GP algorithm [28] cannot be understood: What is E[x]? Isn't G_1 a GP? Why is it able to accept x_i and D as inputs? How is z_i defined?\n\nThe authors say that \"A note on the form of this variance estimator is give in Appendix B.\" There is no Appendix B.\n\n\nCan the authors give a detailed discussion why is the expression of f(x) = g(x) + s(x) in equation 9 the right one to be minimized in practice (e.g., in the context of materials and drug discovery)? For example, do material scientists use such an objective function? Provide references. Furthermore, why is the same equation 9 being minimized for both the cases of robustness and antifragility to aleatoric uncertainty?\n\nCaption of Fig. 3: I can't understand the sentence: \"The combined objective, which when optimised maximises the sin wave subject to the minimisation of aleatoric noise\". This was repeated in Section 5.5: \"finds the first maximum as that which minimises aleatoric noise\". Isn't the minimum of the aleatoric noise at the origin (Fig. 3b)?\n\nCan the authors provide information on how much initial data was provided prior to running BO? How much data is used for learning the GP hyperparameters?\n\nThe performance advantage of heteroscedastic ANPEI over homoscedastic does not appear to be significant for Branin-Hoo function (Figs. 5b and 6b). Can the authors explain this?\n\n\n\nMinor issues\n\nThere are two different font types of x in bold.\n\nPage 5: fixed aleaotric\n\nWhich phrase is correct? \"is obtained by subtracting the noise function from the 1D sinusoid\" in the caption of Fig. 3 or \"The objective function in all cases is the principal objective g(x) minus one standard deviation of the ground truth noise function s(x)\"?\n\nFig. 5b: Shouldn't the vertical axis be labeled as ...+ Noise?\n\nFig. 6a: Shouldn't the vertical axis be labeled as ...- Noise?"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2488/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2488/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["rrg27@cam.ac.uk", "mg770@cam.ac.uk", "av495@cam.ac.uk", "aal44@cam.ac.uk"], "title": "Antifragile and Robust Heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimisation", "authors": ["Ryan Rhys-Griffiths", "Miguel Garcia-Ortegon", "Alexander A.
