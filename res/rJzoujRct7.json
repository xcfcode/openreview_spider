Is there a comparison between the same CNN with and without pooling in order to justify that translation invariance is a key benefit in this task?\n\n(4) So now we are saying that the model learns from the top players to beat the good ones. While it sounds a bit more possible, it is still quite mysterious as (I assume) there are many more bad players than top ones. Any reasonable machine learning model would then be \"biased\" to mimic the bad players than the top ones.

So the following comments are based on the trust-worthiness of the paper.\n\nWe will offer a online interface to public, it will return a action when you sent cards and game process. You can test the model as you wish. It will take a few days to prepare I think. And, I can offer the video of test match (all 10 games) and public email addresses of four top amateur players, you can check with them.\n\n(2)immature writing: The writing lacks formality and looks like a final project report. For instance, the super-short Section 2 is rather unprofessional---it is hard to believe that the related works can be described within two paragraphs anyway. Even as someone who understands the game of China Competitive Poker, I find it very hard to follow Section 3. There is a big room for improving the English writing.\n\nI am really sorry about it. I will continue to optimize the paper and improve English.\n\n(3)ill-illustrated specialty of the model: In particular, it is not clear why the model should be superior than other modeling choices. For instance, what role does the neighboring connections of CNNs play? What are the cons and pros of choosing CNNs? Are there strong motivations to design the model this way?\n\nThe following is the reason written in the paper:\n\nWe choose CNN to solve the problem in CCP due to the following reasons: First, CNN has achieved superhuman performance in perfect information games. Second, there is semi-translational invariance in CCP, e.g. there are two sets of cards in the same category but with different ranks (like \u201c34567\u201d and \u201c45678\u201d, see more information in section 3), if we add each card\u2019s rank, \u201c34567\u201d become \u201c45678\u201d, this is translational invariance. The player can play out \u201c45678\u201d after another one played out \u201c34567\u201d, but it is illegal if we swap the order, this is the reason for \u201csemi\u201d.\n\nBesides X-axis, I think there is translation invariance in Z-axis also. CNN can get good performance dealing with translation invariance.\n\n(4)many unanswered mysteries: why does the model trained with human records readily super-human? Note that this is controversial to common imitation learning where the typical performance is bound by the human-level performance. Even though authors claimed in the response that there are \"many professional records\"---but how many is many? Did the authors analyze the records and separate the professional versus amateur ones?\n\nFirst, many authors proved that the neural network can get the top amateur level in games just by supervised learning, like Chris J. Maddison\u2019s paper \u201cMOVE EVALUATION IN GO USING DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS\u201d showed: \u201cWe train a large 12-layer convolutional neural network by supervised learning from a database of human professional games. The network correctly predicts the expert move in 55% of positions, equalling the accuracy of a 6 dan human player.\u201d 6 dan is top level in amateur players. Deepmind got similar conclusion in their paper.\n\nSecond, compared to Go, there are seldom professional players in the strict sense in CCP. It is not a full time job for \"CCP professional players\", because players can not get enough money in CCP match. Maybe \"semi-professional player\" is more suitable, but they are really top players than others. As I said in previous reply, game records came from online platform. Players only need to offer a cellphone number or a tencent account to online platform. I think it is really very hard to distinguish just by them. many online platforms support for visitors to log in."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper386/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper386/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper386/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Solution to China Competitive Poker Using Deep Learning", "abstract": "Recently, deep neural networks have achieved superhuman performance in various games such as Go, chess and Shogi.

The system consists of  three modules - the bid module, which is rule based, and the policy and kicker networks, which are simple convolutional neural networks. The authors use a dataset of 8 million game records consisting of 80 million state action pairs, and train the network in a supervised fashion. The resulting model is able beat MicroWe, the current state of the art in playing CCP, and even are able to beat a few \"top amateur players\"\n\n- Why is the bid module also not learned? It seems like the feature set for the bid module is fairly simple, and a linear or MLP can do fairly well compared to a rule based module.\n- It's not clear that separating the policy and kicker networks would be more advantageous than combining them. Thousands of actions is not a too large number - language modeling work routinely deals with outputting many more classes than that.\n- Were the convolutions chosen 1D, 2D, or 3D? The figure seems to imply that the convolutions were over the XZ dimensions, with Y as the channel dimension. If so, this doesn't make too much sense to be, since the Z dimension is not uniform - the last index is all unseen cards, which is significantly more than the middle indices of \"what was played in this round\". There shouldn't be a lot of translational invariance in the Z dimension. I'm also not convinced that translational invariance is helpful in the X dimension.\n- There were no comparisons with baseline models or different model architectures.

Please provide some context on how far this system is from solving CCP.\n- Fig 3, 4 should just say #of games instead of \"iteration\"\n\nThis paper shows that one choice for a supervised learning system on a CCP game database can achieve amateur level human play.

The model uses CNN to predict the actions, and is trained from actual human game records. The model is shown to beat the current best AI and human amateur players.\n\nThe performance is certainly strong (if it were true). But given the double-blinded policy, there is literally no way to verify the correctness of the performance---in other words, the paper is currently not reproducible at all. So the following comments are based on the trust-worthiness of the paper.\n\n(1) immature writing: The writing lacks formality and looks like a final project report. For instance, the super-short Section 2 is rather unprofessional---it is hard to believe that the related works can be described within two paragraphs anyway. Even as someone who understands the game of China Competitive Poker, I find it very hard to follow Section 3. There is a big room for improving the English writing.\n\n(2) ill-illustrated specialty of the model: In particular, it is not clear why the model should be superior than other modeling choices. For instance, what role does the neighboring connections of CNNs play? What are the cons and pros of choosing CNNs? Are there strong motivations to design the model this way? \n\n(3) many unanswered mysteries: why does the model trained with human records readily super-human? Note that this is controversial to common imitation learning where the typical performance is bound by the human-level performance. Even though authors claimed in the response that there are \"many professional records\"---but how many is many? Did the authors analyze the records and separate the professional versus amateur ones?", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper386/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Solution to China Competitive Poker Using Deep Learning", "abstract": "Recently, deep neural networks have achieved superhuman performance in various games such as Go, chess and Shogi.

The model does not work well when a peasant is in active mode, and have to help the partner to be in active mode next round. I think the model learned coorperation from human record, because the up peasant is a important position (does action before landlord), many obviously samples were found in record which were different from normal actions. And the role information in input of the policy network made an important impact also.\n\nThe question about insufficiency, I only showed the first test match result in paper, by the way, the test match is offline.

(2) \"J\" had not been seen yet, he worried about Landlord had trio with pair, it is defense-based consideration. It is also hard even \"4KAAA22\" left, because Landlord may seperate the jokers. (3) \"4KAAA22\" and \"344KAAA22\" have advantages and disadvantages respectively. The former has less sets, while the latter is more flexible.\n\nThe following is author's reply:\nWe recorded the process with video. I found Guofeng Xie considered for a long time at that moment.
