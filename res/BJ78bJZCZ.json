While the RWA was an interesting idea with bad results (far worse than the standard GRU or LSTM with standard attention except for hand-picked tasks), the RDA brings it more on-par with the standard methods.\n\nOn the positive side, the paper is clearly written and adding discount to RWA, while a small change, is original. On the negative side, in almost all tasks the RDA is on par or worse than the standard GRU - except for MultiCopy where it trains faster, but not to better results and it looks like the difference is between few and very-few training steps anyway. The most interesting result is language modeling on Hutter Prize Wikipedia, where RDA very significantly improves upon RWA - but again, only matches a standard GRU or LSTM. So the results are not strongly convincing, and the paper lacks any mention of newer work on attention. This year strong improvements over state-of-the-art have been achieved using attention for translation (\"Attention is All You Need\") and image classification (e.g., Non-local Neural Networks, but also others in ImageNet competition).

But it is not clear to me why would that be an important contribution.\n-The writing needs more work.\n-The experiments are lacking and the results are not good enough.\n\nGeneral Comments:\n\nThis paper addresses an issue regarding to RWA which is not really widely adopted and well-known architecture, because it seems to have some have some issues that this paper is trying to address. I would still like to have a better justification on why should we care about RWA and fixing that model. \n\nThe writing of this paper seriously needs more work.  The Lemma 1 doesn't make sense to me, I think it has a typo in it, it should have been (-1)^t c instead of -1^t c.\n\nThe experiments are only on toyish and small scale tasks.
