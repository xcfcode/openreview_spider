Namely, the context data consists of a set of datapoints in arbitrary order.  The model should thus be permutation equivariant to their order.  At the same time, the data itself may have its own symmetries, e.g. rotation, which the network should likewise be equivariant to.  The authors follow a theory-driven approach, proving in Thm 2 that a function with these two types of symmetries may be factored and represented by a composition of functions reflecting each symmetry individually.  They then design a Neural Process (NP) model, EquivCNP, which reflects this result.  Other works have used permutation equivariance and translation equivariance in NPs, but this is the first to incorporate other symmetry groups. \n\nAs a weakness, the method description in Section 4 is often imprecise and unclear as noted in the specific points below.   The method is somewhat novel; it may be described as a combination of two existing methods: permutation-equivariant NPs (Garnelo 18) and LieConv (Finzi 20).  The experiments achieve good results, but could be much more convincing.  They concern fitting only functions on low-dimensional space, report only one metric, and have limited comparison to baselines.  In particular, it does not seem necessary to frame image reconstruction as a meta-learning task.  However, the strength of this paper is the theory-guided model design.  The theorem proved is wholly appropriate to the task and informs the model design very nicely.  In particular, it makes use of the realization that $D_C \\to C(X,Y)$ can be $G$-equivariant; that is, the symmetry transformation can be inferred from context and transferred onto the prediction function.  Thus I suggest acceptance (6).   \n\n**Specific Point and Questions** \n- Sec 2.1 \u201cWeiler & Cesa ... is costly\u201d I do not agree.  However cost is defined this method is on par or better than CNNs \n- Sec 2.1 \u201clearning the objective from the data.\u201d I do not follow.  Can you explain further how this applies to EquivCNP?\n- Sec 2.1 How do the symmetries in this paper compare to those considered in (Maron et al 2020, On Learning Sets of Symmetric Elements) which also considers permutation and Lie group equivariance together?\n- Defn 3, It seems here we are giving all the orbits the same weight? Should there be a measure on orbits?  Considering the $SO(2)$ action on the plane, should not the circular orbits be weighted by circumference?\n- Sec 4.2 \u201cLieConv \u2026 can handle Lie groups\u201d This is true, but many other architectures such as steerable CNN can as well. \n- Sec 4.2 \u201cwe define distance in the Lie group.\u201d Since we have lifted from the space $X$, is it important to consider differences between measuring distance on $X$ vs. $G$?\n- Sec 4.2 $\\| q_i - q_j \\|$, how do you define distance between orbits?\n- Sec 4.2 Since compact groups have a bi-invariant metric, why not use that instead of $d(u,v)$?\n- Page 5, first Eqn, According to which distribution are $(u_i,q_i)$ sampled? \n- Page 6, para 1, it is not clear exactly what precisely is meant by discrete or continuous data.\n- Page 6 \u201calthough we want to convolve $E(Z)$...\u201d I do not follow this sentence.  Can you clarify it?\n- Page 7 \u201cMNIST already contains diverse group equivariance\u201d If this is the case then the equivariant model should still have good performance, but perhaps with less improvement over the baseline, correct?\n- Page 8, Why not test SO(2)-equivariant model on test data which has only been rotated? Does not the success of $R \\times SO(2)$ over the other groups simply show that the others have misspecified (or perhaps underspecified) inductive biases? \n- Page 11, second equation, should be $\\psi(g^{-1} x, g^{-1} x')$ since it is a left-action.  This will not change the rest of the proof.\n- Page 11, proof of (II) implies (I) feels incomplete.  Can you define $\\rho, \\mathcal{H}$ here? \n\n**Minor Points**\n- Sec 3, first equation, $\\pi Z_n := \\ldots$, the subscripts should be $\\pi^{-1}(i)$, not $\\pi(i)$. One can see this in a simple example or from the fact $\\pi$ is a left-action. \n- Sec 3, by $mult(Z\u2019):=$ is sup over $Z_m$ but contains $Z_n$.\n- Sec 4.1, \u201clifting into $K$ elements\u201d How do we know the stabilizer is finite?\n- Sec 4.2, note that not all Lie groups are matrix groups as seems to be implied here. \n- Sec 4.2, Last Eqn on Page 4, the integral can be written over G since the support of $g_\\theta$ limits to the neighborhood of $u$\n- Bottom Page 4, footnote, triangle, not trigonometric \n- Page 5, first Eqn, sum should be over $(v_j, q_j\u2019)$.  \n- Since the support of $g_\\theta$ is limited to a neighborhood of 1, it may not be necessary to assume $exp$ is surjective since $exp$ is always surjective in a small neighborhood of 1.\n- Sec 4.3, first Eqn, the first line is a product of density functions, but the second is a product of distributions.  This is unclear.  \n- Sec 4.3 EquivDeepSet is not introduced\n- Sec 4.3 \u201ca single output per one input\u201d Is this backwards?\n- Page 6, line 3, $\\phi$ with $\\psi$\n- Sec 5 \u201ctwo questions\u201d should \u201cthree questions\u201d\n- Page 11, Proof switches between $X$ and $S$, make consistent\n- Page 11, What do the brackets mean? This notation should be defined. \n\n**Update Based on Author Feedback**\nI am grateful to the authors for their detailed replies to my questions. I understand some of the minor points better and am happy they have revised some unclear parts. Overall, I think this paper has some real strengths: theory-guided design, important problem, novel methods. I do feel (similar to R3) that the experiments and applications could have been far more convincing. Weighing these strengths and weakness, I still tilt slightly towards accept (6).", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1535/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1535/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Group Equivariant Conditional Neural Processes", "authorids": ["~Makoto_Kawano1", "~Wataru_Kumagai2", "~Akiyoshi_Sannai1", "~Yusuke_Iwasawa1", "~Yutaka_Matsuo1"], "authors": ["Makoto Kawano", "Wataru Kumagai", "Akiyoshi Sannai", "Yusuke Iwasawa", "Yutaka Matsuo"], "keywords": ["Neural Processes", "Conditional Neural Processes", "Stochastic Processes", "Regression", "Group Equivariance", "Symmetry"], "abstract": "We present the group equivariant conditional neural process (EquivCNP), a meta-learning method with permutation invariance in a data set as in conventional conditional neural processes (CNPs), and it also has transformation equivariance in data space.

For example, ConvCNP (Gordon et al., 2019) from last year\u2019s ICLR evaluated on the following datasets: a 1D synthetic dataset, PLastiCC dataset, MNIST, SVHN, CelebA32, CelebA64, ZSMM. On the other hand, this work conducted experiments on a 1D synthetic time series data, and a \u201cdigital clock dataset\u201d where the template is shared across train and test sets.\n\n- While it is important to see how effective our EquivCNP is in a realistic scenario, the purpose of the experiment in the paper is to verify that our EquivCNP which intends to have group equivariance introduced by the theoretical guide works properly. As an experimental result, we show that our EquivCNP has group equivariance properly and we will focus on exploiting EquivCNP for various applications in future work.\nFor example, if we want to exploit EquivCNP to meta-classification tasks, we need to explore another theory-guided design because the current EquivCNP architecture is not suitable for tackling meta-classification tasks; the output  dimension (i.e. the number of classes)  cannot be changed during the training and evaluating.\n\n> The author explained MNIST is \u201cnot suitable for evaluating EquivCNP with group equivariance: translation, scaling, and rotation\u201d. I am not convinced by this argument; I think the paper can be strengthened if there is anh experiment demonstrating that on a real dataset EquivCNP is beneficial.\n\n- We are sorry that we didn\u2019t explain reasonably.\nWe conducted the image completion task with rotated MNIST, but we could not find the difference between the translation-equivariant model (i.e ConvCNP) and other group equivariant models. \nIt is thought that (1) original MNIST contains various data symmetries including translation, scaling, and rotation, and (2) we cannot specify them precisely.\nWith actual original MNIST, we can confirm that yet we did not conduct any transformation, the images have been already rotated. \nMoreover, factors other than symmetry such as personal habit exist.\nWe revised the corresponding part and added some discussion, and the rotated MNIST results in Appendix E. \n\n> Furthermore, the image completion results do not compare to any prior benchmark. I don\u2019t see a reason for not comparing.\n\n- Following the result of the first experiment, the 1d regression task, EquivCNP with $T(2)$ is equivalent to the prior benchmark (i.e. ConvCNP). Therefore, we can regard the result of the T(2) model in the image completion task as the prior benchmark. To clear it, we modified Figure 4.\n\n> I think the organization makes the paper difficult to read at times. For example, on page 5, they mentioned \u03c1,\u03d5,\u03c8, which are defined back on page 2. Maybe re-organize such that the modeled conditional distribution, in Sec 4.3, is at the top of Sec 4; similar to Gordon et al., (2019)\u2019s paper organization.\n\n- We reconsidered the organization of our paper and moved part of Section 4.3 to the top of Section 4 following the reviewer 2's suggestion."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1535/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1535/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Group Equivariant Conditional Neural Processes", "authorids": ["~Makoto_Kawano1", "~Wataru_Kumagai2", "~Akiyoshi_Sannai1", "~Yusuke_Iwasawa1", "~Yutaka_Matsuo1"], "authors": ["Makoto Kawano", "Wataru Kumagai", "Akiyoshi Sannai", "Yusuke Iwasawa", "Yutaka Matsuo"], "keywords": ["Neural Processes", "Conditional Neural Processes", "Stochastic Processes", "Regression", "Group Equivariance", "Symmetry"], "abstract": "We present the group equivariant conditional neural process (EquivCNP), a meta-learning method with permutation invariance in a data set as in conventional conditional neural processes (CNPs), and it also has transformation equivariance in data space.

However cost is defined this method is on par or better than CNNs\n\n- As the reviewer mentioned, surely steerable CNN is on par or better than conventional CNNs, we trim the corresponding parts.\n\n> Sec 2.1 \u201clearning the objective from the data.\u201d I do not follow. Can you explain further how this applies to EquivCNP?\n\n- We are sorry that it was an unclear description. We revised the corresponding parts as \u201cWhile both these studies and EquivCNP can handle data symmetries,\u201d.\n\n> Sec 2.1 How do the symmetries in this paper compare to those considered in (Maron et al 2020, On Learning Sets of Symmetric Elements) which also considers permutation and Lie group equivariance together?\n\n- The paper of Maron et al. puts H in a finite group, which is different in aspect from our model dealing with Lie groups.\nFurthermore, even if Maron et al.\u2019s paper were to treat H in the Lie group, the symmetry we are dealing with is local, derived from the exponential map of the Lie group, and Maron et al. deal with the symmetry of the full group.\n\n> Defn 3, It seems here we are giving all the orbits the same weight? Should there be a measure on orbits? Considering the SO(2) action on the plane, should not the circular orbits be weighted by circumference?\n\n- In Definition 3,  $dq\u2019$ is an arbitrary measure on orbits, which is not restricted to a uniform measure. In addition, an appropriate weight can be learned by $g$.\n\n> Sec 4.2 \u201cLieConv \u2026 can handle Lie groups\u201d This is true, but many other architectures such as steerable CNN can as well.\n\n- Although other architectures including Steerable CNN can handle specific Lie groups such as translation and rotation, LieConv can treat a wider class of Lie groups in a unified way. That is why we used LieConv. \n\n>Sec 4.2 \u201cwe define distance in the Lie group.\u201d Since we have lifted from the space X, is it important to consider differences between measuring distance on X vs. G?\n\n - Equivariance of convolution is related to group action rather than the topology of $\\mathcal{X}$. Thus, we use the left-invariant (pseudo-)distance $d(u,v)$ on a Lie group, which is compatible with group action, although $\\mathcal{X}$ may have some distance.\n\n> Sec 4.2 |qi\u2212qj|, how do you define distance between orbits?\n\n- We should have denoted the distance between orbits by $d_{\\mathcal{O}}(q_i,q_j)$ instead of $\\|q_i - q_j\\|$.  $d_{\\mathcal{O}}(q_i,q_j)$ is defined by $\\inf_{x_i\\in q_i, x_j \\in q_j} d_{\\mathcal{X}}(x_i, x_j)$.\n\n> Sec 4.2 Since compact groups have a bi-invariant metric, why not use that instead of d(u,v)?\n\n- We may use any invariant metric for localization as long as the metric is computable. The reason why we used $d$ in Section 4.2 is it is numerically computable for matrix representation of groups in experiments.\n\n> Page 5, first Eqn, According to which distribution are (ui,qi) sampled?\n\n- $(u_i, q_i)$ is sampling from the measure $d\\mu \\times dq\u2019$.\n\n> Page 6, para 1, it is not clear exactly what precisely is meant by discrete or continuous data.\n\n- We do not have a precise definition of \u201cdiscrete\u201d and \u201ccontinuous\u201d data. However,  we suppose that \ndiscrete data are drawn from a probability distribution on a finite set or  a countable set with the discrete topology \nand that continuous data on a Euclidean space are drawn from a probability distribution which is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure on the Euclidean space.\n\n>Page 6 \u201calthough we want to convolve E(Z) ...\u201d I do not follow this sentence. Can you clarify it?\n\n- Although EquivCNP requires to compute the convolution of $E(Z)$, it cannot be computed in computers as it is since $E(Z)$ itself is a functional representation.\nHence,  we need to discretize $E(Z)$ so that we can compute in computers.\n\n> Page 7 \u201cMNIST already contains diverse group equivariance\u201d If this is the case then the equivariant model should still have good performance, but perhaps with less improvement over the baseline, correct?\n\n- We are sorry that our explanation confused you. \nAs the reviewer mentioned, we could not find a significant difference between the baseline and our model.\nWe modified the corresponding part of the explanation and added the experiment result of MNIST image completion to Appendix E.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1535/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1535/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Group Equivariant Conditional Neural Processes", "authorids": ["~Makoto_Kawano1", "~Wataru_Kumagai2", "~Akiyoshi_Sannai1", "~Yusuke_Iwasawa1", "~Yutaka_Matsuo1"], "authors": ["Makoto Kawano", "Wataru Kumagai", "Akiyoshi Sannai", "Yusuke Iwasawa", "Yutaka Matsuo"], "keywords": ["Neural Processes", "Conditional Neural Processes", "Stochastic Processes", "Regression", "Group Equivariance", "Symmetry"], "abstract": "We present the group equivariant conditional neural process (EquivCNP), a meta-learning method with permutation invariance in a data set as in conventional conditional neural processes (CNPs), and it also has transformation equivariance in data space.

Summary\nThis paper presents EquivCNP which extends Conditional Neural Processes (CNP) to incorporate symmetries of the data, e.g. rotation and scaling. The approach utilizes a combination of LieConv (Finzi et al., 2020)  and DeepSet (Zaheer et al., 2017) to achieve the equivariance in the data space and permutation invariance across the samples in a dataset. They provide empirical results on a 1D regression task with synthetic and 2D image completion tasks using digital clock digits dataset which they constructed.\n\n### 2. Decision\nI am recommending a weak reject for this paper. First, the experimental section does not sufficiently demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. Second, I find the organization of the paper hard to follow at times.\n### 3. Supporting arguments\n1. The paper\u2019s motivation is interesting and intuitive. Just as ConvCNP (Gordon et al., 2019) extended CNP with translation equivariance, this work proposes to extend CNP with group equivariance. It is generally difficult to build equivariance properties into deep-nets just in the data space alone, CNP requires the additional permutation invariance. Hence, I think the work is of interest to the community.\n\n2. The main weakness of this paper is the experimental section. For example, ConvCNP (Gordon et al., 2019) from last year\u2019s ICLR evaluated on the following datasets: a 1D synthetic dataset, PLastiCC dataset, MNIST, SVHN, CelebA32, CelebA64, ZSMM. On the other hand, this work conducted experiments on a 1D synthetic time series data, and a \u201cdigital clock dataset\u201d where the template is shared across train and test sets.\n\n3. The author explained MNIST is \u201cnot suitable for evaluating EquivCNP with group equivariance: translation, scaling, and rotation\u201d. I am not convinced by this argument; I think the paper can be strengthened if there is an experiment demonstrating that on a real dataset EquivCNP is beneficial.\n\n4. Furthermore, the image completion results do not compare to any prior benchmark. I don\u2019t see a reason for not comparing.\nI think the organization makes the paper difficult to read at times. For example, on page 5, they mentioned $\\rho,  \\phi, \\psi$, which are defined back on page 2. Maybe re-organize such that the modeled conditional distribution, in Sec 4.3,  is at the top of Sec 4; similar to Gordon et al., (2019)\u2019s paper organization.\n\n### 4.
