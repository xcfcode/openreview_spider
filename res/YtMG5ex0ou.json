More specifically, TAE takes a Bayesian approach to recover the posterior distribution of a clean image conditioned on an observed corrupted image and thus effectively modeling uncertainty in data recovery. The paper argues that a naive application of VAE is not effective due to the latent variable collapse, and proposes an alternative model where hierarchical latent variable models are used for both prior and variational posterior. Some tricks are introduced to facilitate the stochastic gradient variational inference. \n\nI think the paper is tackling an important problem and I advocate the use of a VAE-like model for uncertainty modeling. The paper is clearly written with helpful figures. The experimental results, at least compared to the baseline (MVAE), looks promising. I like the way the methods are compared using the downstream task.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure whether a new model should be developed besides the existing approaches. The authors state that the problem of a vanilla VAE with hierarchical latent structure (latent code $z$ - clean image $x$) is that it is prone to latent variable collapse.  This is true, but there are plenty of existing works (partially) resolving this problem. The most relevant approach I can think of is the semi-implicit variational inference [1] for which a hierarchical latent variable model is used for the variational distribution similar to the setting considered in this paper. [1] proposes a theoretically guaranteed solution to prevent a trivial case where the lower-level latent variable ($z$) completely collapses into a point mass, and I think this can directly be applied for the problem considered in this paper. Also, as [2] pointed out that one can consider using a more expressive prior distribution for latent code $z$ to combat latent variable collapse. For instance, flow-based models may be employed for both prior and variational posterior. The proposed design also makes sense, but I don't think they are more expressive than the models listed above. If that is the case, there should be a special factor making TAE specifically well-suited for the problem at hand - the recovery of corrupted images - but I failed to find such a thing. Is there any reason that the existing models other than the vanilla VAE cannot be considered?\n\nAlso, the baseline (MVAE) is not clearly described, so it is not clear how MVAE was actually implemented. I recommend giving a more detailed description of the baseline at least in the appendix.\n\nReferences\n[1] Yin and Zhou, Semi-implicit variational inference, ICML 2018.\n[2] Chen et al., Variational lossy autoencoder, ICLR 2016.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper871/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper871/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Tomographic Auto-Encoder: Unsupervised Bayesian Recovery of Corrupted Data", "authorids": ["~Francesco_Tonolini1", "~Andreas_Damianou1", "~Pablo_Garcia_Moreno1", "~Roderick_Murray-Smith1"], "authors": ["Francesco Tonolini", "Andreas Damianou", "Pablo Garcia Moreno", "Roderick Murray-Smith"], "keywords": ["Missing value imputation", "variational inference", "variational auto-encoders"], "abstract": "We propose a new probabilistic method for unsupervised recovery of corrupted data.

We have now added to the related work section 3.2.\n\nAs for the question about the expressiveness of TAE given the reduced entropy condition; in principle, expressiveness is not limited by the condition. Essentially, the reduced entropy condition imposes the conditional LVM to present a one-to-many mapping from latents z to clean data x. This simply prevents multiple z from contributing to the density in the same clean data point x, i.e. it promotes non-overlapping likelihoods. Since we avoid such degeneracies, we argue that the expressiveness of the model is improved, as we exploit all of the capacity to build expressive distributions.\nIn practice, we are only approximately imposing the condition through the constrained minimisation, so the effects on expressiveness are difficult to define analytically. What we can say is that experimentally training q(x|y) with the TAE method resulted in reconstruction models which were not any less expressive than identical ones trained with the MVAE in their mean inferences, as they gave similar average PSNR over a test set. Instead, the individual posteriors q(x|y_i) were found to be significantly more expressive with the TAE, as shown by the ELBO values and samples in figure 3.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper871/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper871/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Tomographic Auto-Encoder: Unsupervised Bayesian Recovery of Corrupted Data", "authorids": ["~Francesco_Tonolini1", "~Andreas_Damianou1", "~Pablo_Garcia_Moreno1", "~Roderick_Murray-Smith1"], "authors": ["Francesco Tonolini", "Andreas Damianou", "Pablo Garcia Moreno", "Roderick Murray-Smith"], "keywords": ["Missing value imputation", "variational inference", "variational auto-encoders"], "abstract": "We propose a new probabilistic method for unsupervised recovery of corrupted data.

We respond below to the main concern regarding the posterior collapse.\n\nWe do not state that the problem is collapse in the latent space (z). This is not any more of a problem in corrupt data recovery than it is in standard VAE settings. The problem is the collapse in clean data space (x). \n\nThe posteriors in z given by the MVAE are not critically collapsed [1,2], it is the reconstruction posteriors in x that are severely collapsed. This is because the recognition model encodes from partial information (the corrupted data y), but then we aim to reconstruct the complete information (the clean data x), differently from vanilla VAEs which encode from and reconstruct the same inputs. MVAEs and other models, which do not regularise in x space, are free to reconstruct a single answer x that explains an observation y, instead of exploring the full distribution. This occurs even though latent space posteriors are not collapsed. A more complex prior in z does not solve this problem. \n\nThere is an analogy between the posterior collapse encountered in latent spaces in variational inference (VI) and the collapse encountered in clean data space in our settings, but the two present critically different challenges. In practice, the difference is the dimensionality and complexity of the posteriors we need to model. Semi-implicit VI and other related works avoid the collapse by drawing several samples K from the posterior model and using them to encourage diversity in some way. For instance, semi-implicit VI computes a mixture of K Gaussians and maximises the KL of each individual component with the mixture. These methods rely on the discrete aggregate (the mixture) approximating well the true model, which for latent spaces, as demonstrated by these works, is achieved with a few samples (K~10), keeping the optimisation relatively efficient. This is not the case in the data recovery case we focus on, where the posteriors need to represent natural data distributions in high dimensions (several hundreds to several thousands of dimensions in our examples). The number of components K we would need to approximate well the true posterior scales with both the dimensionality and the complexity of the true posterior, which are both very high in our target scenarios. \n\nGiven the above, the corrupted data setting presents a unique challenge: how can we avoid the collapse without relying on the prohibitive sampling of multiple components of our LVM posterior to approximate the true distribution? This is what the reduced entropy condition method achieves. So in answer to the reviewer\u2019s question: \u201cIs there any reason that the existing models other than the vanilla VAE cannot be considered?\u201d - yes, the reason is that avoiding the posterior collapse in data space (x) rather than a latent space (z) requires being more efficient with respect to sampling components from the posterior LVM than existing collapse-avoiding methods.\n\nWe briefly state this difference before explaining the reduced entropy condition on page 4 and cite a more recent work related to the original semi-implicit VI [3]. We do appreciate that this discussion may deserve more depthening and thank the reviewer for their comment and references. We have added a subsection covering the relevant literature and explaining this difference in the supplementary (B.4).

This paper presents the tomographic auto-encoder (TVAE), which conducts inference over the data space $x$. Because the prior regularization acts over the data space, TVAE is enforced to generate diverse samples from the corrupted observations. Empirically, the paper demonstrates that TVAE can indeed generate diverse samples and can achieve superior test ELBO compared to the previous baselines.\n\nMissing data imputation is one important problem in machine learning, given the imperfection of the practical data. Specifically, TVAE focuses on two properties: 1) unsupervised learning, which resolves the intractability of labelling large datasets 2) diverse recoveries, which attempts to generate multiple possible samples instead of collapsing onto one possibility. Towards these two properties, TVAE proposes to conduct inference over the data space $x$, whose prior directly prevents from collapsing.  To resolve the intractability of the entropy $H(q(x|y))$, TVAE identifies the *reduced entropy condition* and transforms the intractable ELBO maximization into a constrained optimization problem. The resulting model demonstrates superior performances compared to baselines, in terms of generating diverse samples. I think this work makes an important contribution.\n\nThis paper is well written.\n\nConditional neural process (Garnelo et. al., 2018a) and neural process (Garnelo et. al., 2018b) are another stream of models for missing data imputation, which are missed by the paper.\n\nRegarding the reduced entropy condition, though it ensures that the entropy is decomposed into more tractable forms, will enforcing this condition limit the expressiveness of the encoder $q(x|  y)$ ?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper871/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper871/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Tomographic Auto-Encoder: Unsupervised Bayesian Recovery of Corrupted Data", "authorids": ["~Francesco_Tonolini1", "~Andreas_Damianou1", "~Pablo_Garcia_Moreno1", "~Roderick_Murray-Smith1"], "authors": ["Francesco Tonolini", "Andreas Damianou", "Pablo Garcia Moreno", "Roderick Murray-Smith"], "keywords": ["Missing value imputation", "variational inference", "variational auto-encoders"], "abstract": "We propose a new probabilistic method for unsupervised recovery of corrupted data.

The problem itself is important and the proposed method seems to offer good empirical performance for the task, outperforming a good selection of recent methods. The paper is well written with ample citations for relevant work, and provides sufficient technical details.\n\nReasons for score: A good paper with no obvious flaws; I do not have concrete improvement suggestions.\n\nAdditional comments: The key concept of empirical prior and its use for regularising the autoencoder is good and intuitive, and I could not spot any obvious theoretical or practical issues with the idea. In the end the theoretical development results in fairly simple modification for the standard VAE objective that can be directly trained using standard algorithms. This is both a strength (the approach is easy to implement and can be plugged into existing models) and a minor weakness in terms of technical depth. Nevertheless, the justification for the loss is well explained in the paper.\n\nThe empirical experiments are sufficiently comprehensive and show good empirical performance in a range of tasks, against reasonable comparison methods. As a minor comment, I would recommend using a more consistent style for the figures (e.g. Fig 3 and Fig 5 use very different visual style).", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper871/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper871/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Tomographic Auto-Encoder: Unsupervised Bayesian Recovery of Corrupted Data", "authorids": ["~Francesco_Tonolini1", "~Andreas_Damianou1", "~Pablo_Garcia_Moreno1", "~Roderick_Murray-Smith1"], "authors": ["Francesco Tonolini", "Andreas Damianou", "Pablo Garcia Moreno", "Roderick Murray-Smith"], "keywords": ["Missing value imputation", "variational inference", "variational auto-encoders"], "abstract": "We propose a new probabilistic method for unsupervised recovery of corrupted data.

The corrupted data considers both missing data and noisy samples. They derive a VAE model with a novel reduced entropy condition inference method that results in richer posteriors. This is a very challenging problem, since the model cannot use clean examples as part of their training procedure.\n\nQuestions/Comments:\n\n- It feels to me that the main focus of this paper is on missing data rather than in other types of corruption. I get this impression mainly from the experimental section and methods used for comparison, well known for handling missing data. Something I would have appreciated in this work is to observe the performance of the authors method in scenarios handling missing data and corrupted data separately. Nonetheless, it is interesting to see experiments with both effects combined, which is not so common in the literature.\n\n- Would it be possible to get results beyond maximizing the ELBO? The ELBO contains the reconstruction term of the images, but also many other terms. In the end, in a missing data imputation model, it is interesting to get an idea of how good the reconstruction of the images is. I can see from figures 3 and 4 that they should be good, but having a different metric might be helpful. I find it surprising that in Table 1 the ELBO of TAE is almost double of the other methods, while the average reconstruction of MVAE for example does not look that much different in figure 3 from the ground truth, and it is pretty similar to TAE.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe paper is well written and the idea is novel as far as I know. The notation is clear and the proofs in the appendix look sensible. The experimental section showcases several scenarios where they compare to unsupervised generative models to handle missing data. The analysis of corrupted data (outside of missing data) seems a bit lacking.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper871/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper871/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Tomographic Auto-Encoder: Unsupervised Bayesian Recovery of Corrupted Data", "authorids": ["~Francesco_Tonolini1", "~Andreas_Damianou1", "~Pablo_Garcia_Moreno1", "~Roderick_Murray-Smith1"], "authors": ["Francesco Tonolini", "Andreas Damianou", "Pablo Garcia Moreno", "Roderick Murray-Smith"], "keywords": ["Missing value imputation", "variational inference", "variational auto-encoders"], "abstract": "We propose a new probabilistic method for unsupervised recovery of corrupted data.
