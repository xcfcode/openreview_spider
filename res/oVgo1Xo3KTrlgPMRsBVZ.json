Embeddings and interpolation results are shown on the MNIST and Frey faces dataset.\n\nAlthough I may have misunderstood parts of the proposed approach due to the brevity of the submission (even in the short workshop format, I believe it possible to provide a bit more details), the novelty of the paper appears limited: it is a straightforward combination of prior work by Ozertem and Erdogmus and by Dollar et al. The paper presents no comparisons with prior work (neither experimental nor conceptual), which makes it difficult to gauge the contribution of the paper. In particular, it remains unclear what the goal of this line of work is. Is it to learn better feature representations from data? In that case, the study should present experiments aimed at evaluating the quality of the learned representation; the visualizations in Figure 1a, 2a, and 3a do not achieve this goal (in particular, since it is known that non-parametric techniques such as t-SNE can produce scatter-plot visualizations of much higher quality than PCA). Or is it to learn better models for image generation / interpolation? In that case, the study should develop methods to evaluate the quality of generated images, and perform comparisons with techniques that try to achieve the same (GPLVMs, mixtures of Bernoulli models, fields of experts, generative-adversarial networks, etc.).\n\nOverall, I believe this paper is of insufficient novelty and quality to be accepted at ICLR.\n\n\n\nMinor comment: \"As long as the embedding space is of higher dimension than the manifold a linear method causes no harm.\" -> If by the dimensionality of the manifold the authors mean its intrinsic dimensionality, then this statement is incorrect. For instance, consider a manifold that is one-dimensional space-filling curve living in a 10-dimensional space. The dimensionality of the manifold is one, but a linear method needs to preserve all 10 dimensions in the data to prevent distant parts of the manifold from collapsing.", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"CMT_id": "", "title": "Manifold traversal using density ridges", "abstract": "In this work we present two examples of how a manifold learning model can represent the complexity of shape variation in images.\nManifold learning techniques for image manifolds can be used to model data in sparse manifold regions. \nAdditionally, they can be used as generative models as they can often better represent or learn structure in the data. \nWe propose a method of estimating the underlying manifold using the ridges of a kernel density estimate as well as tangent space operations that allows interpolation between images along the manifold and offers a novel approach to analyzing the image manifold.", "pdf": "/pdf/oVgo1Xo3KTrlgPMRsBVZ.pdf", "paperhash": "myhre|manifold_traversal_using_density_ridges", "conflicts": ["uit.no"], "authors": ["Jonas Nordhaug Myhre", "Michael Kampffmeyer", "Robert Jenssen"], "authorids": ["jonas.n.myhre@uit.no", "michael.c.kampffmeyer@uit.no", "robert.jenssen@uit.no"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "tmdate": null, "cdate": 1456580184289, "ddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "duedate": 1460725200000, "tcdate": 1456580184289, "id": "ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/-/paper/192/review/11", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "reply": {"pdf": null, "forum": "oVgo1Xo3KTrlgPMRsBVZ", "replyto": "oVgo1Xo3KTrlgPMRsBVZ", "writers": {"values-regex": "(~.*)|ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/paper/[0-9]+/reviewer/[0-9]+)"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "(~.*)|ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/paper/[0-9]+/reviewer/[0-9]+)", "description": "Your displayed identity associated with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "review": {"order": 2, "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough -
