The paper is overall difficult to follow (at least for me) for different reasons. First, with 17 pages + references + appendix, the length of the paper is way above the \u00ab\u00a0strongly suggested limit of 8 pages\u00a0\u00bb. Second, there are a number of small typos and the citations are not well formatted (use \\citep instead of \\citet). Third, and more importantly, several concepts are only vaguely formulated (or wrong), and I must say I certainly misunderstood some parts of the manuscript.\nA few examples of things that should be clarified:\n- p4: \u00ab\u00a0per class c there exists an unknown nonlinear function [\u2026] that separates the data samples from different classes in the transformed domain\u00a0\u00bb. What does \u00ab\u00a0separate\u00a0\u00bb mean here? There exists as many functions as there are classes, do you mean that each function separates all classes? Or that when you apply each class function to the elements of its own class, you get a separation between the classes? (which would not be very useful)\n- p5: what do you mean exactly by \u00ab\u00a0non-linear thresholding function\u00a0\u00bb?\n- p5: \u00ab\u00a0The goal of learning a nonlinear transform (2) is to estimate\u2026\u00a0\u00bb: not sure what you mean by \u00ab\u00a0accurate approximation\u00a0\u00bb in this sentence.\n- p5 equation 3: if I understand correctly, you not only want to estimate a single vector of thresholds for all classes, but also want it to be constant. Is there a reason for the second constraint?\n- p5 After equation 4, you define different \u00ab\u00a0priors\u00a0\u00bb. The one on z_k seems to be Gaussian; however in equation 4, z_k seems to be the difference between the input and the output of the nonlinear threshold operator. If this is correct, then the nonlinear threshold operator is just the addition of a Gaussian random noise, which is really not a thresholding operator. I suppose I misunderstood something here, some clarification is probably needed.\n- p5 before equation 5, you define a conditional distribution of \\tau_c given y_{c,k} ; however if you define a prior on \\tau_c given each point (i.e., each $k$), how do you define the law of \\tau_c given all points?\n- p5 Equation 6: I dont understand what the word \u00ab\u00a0approximation\u00a0\u00bb refers to, and how equation 6 is derived. \n-p6 equation 7 : missing exponent in the Gaussian distribution\n- p6-7: to combine equations 7-8-9 and obtain 10, I suppose in equation 7 the distributions should be conditioned on A (at least the first one), and in equation 9 I suppose the second line should be removed and the third line should be conditioned on A; otherwise more explanations are needed.\n- Lemma 1 is just unreadable.

Specifically, the approach is based on the form: Y =~ AX, where X is the original data, A is a projection matrix, and Y is the resulting representation. Using some assumptions, and priors/regularizers on Y and A, a joint objective is derived (eq. 10), and an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed (eq. 11 and 14). Both objective and algorithm use approximations due to hardness of the problem. Theoretical and empirical results on the quality and properties of the representation are presented.\nDisclaimer: this is somewhat outside my area of expertise, so this is a rather high-level review. I have not thoroughly checked proofs and claims.\n\nComments:\n-I found the presentation quality to be rather poor, making it hard to fully understand and evaluate the approach. In particular, the motivation and approach are not clear (sec. 1.2), making it hard to understand the proposed method. There is no explicit formulation, instead there are references to other models (e.g., sparsifying transform model) and illustrative figures (fig. 1 and 2). Those are useful following a formal definition, but cannot replace it. The separation between positive and negative elements of the representation is not motivated and explained in a footnote although it seems central to the proposed approach.\n- The paper is 17 pages long (24 pages with the appendix), so I had to skim through some parts.

The concepts in section 1.2 paragraph one, the introduction of section 2 and section 2.1 will be simplified and better clarified. \n\nConsidering the typos, reformat of the citations and the clarification we will try definitively to enhance them accordingly.\n\nConsidering the length of the paper, we can integrate the comment of the reviewer and add the sensitivity analysis section in the appendix. However, since the results of the analysis are used to bound the proposed discrimination power measure we considered not to suspend and remove them. In addition they also give an information-geometric perspective, that to the best of our knowledge is the first analysis of this kind about a non-linear models and the similarity concentration measure without the need of a strict conditions for regularity, i.e., smoothness of the manifolds.\n\n\nConsidering the comment \"p4\" and the first 3 \"p5\" comments\n\nWe will clarify here and in the updated version that a non-linear transform models having one common ${\\bf A}$ and different thresholding parameter ${\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_c}$ per class $c$ are used only during the learning, whereas at the test time only a sparsifying transform model is used. In that sense we assumed that there are number of non-linear transforms as the number of classes and when we apply the non-linear transforms for the samples of the corresponding classes we have separation between the transform data samples from different classes. It is important to highlight that when the proposed similarity concentration is zero then the discriminative prior has no influence. Only then the non-linear transform model reduces to a sparsifying transform model and the single vector of thresholds is a constant.\n\nConsidering the comment \"p5 After equation 4 ...\"\n\nWe use a transform representation defined as ${\\bf y}_{c,k}=\\mathcal{T}^{\\mathcal{P}_c}({\\bf x}_{c,k})$ to impose a dicriminative constraint on the transform representation. As shown by equation (16) the estimation of the transform representation has a closed form solution considering a thresholding non-linear operation, therefore, it has\na non-linearity. Moreover, in this case ${\\bf A}{\\bf x}_{c,k}$ is only seen as a linear approximation to this non-linearity. Knowing something in advance about the difference between ${\\bf y}_{c,k}-{\\bf A}{\\bf x}_{c,k}$ can be used in our model. However, since in advance we do not have any prior we assume that it is Gausssian like distributed.\n\n\nConsidering the comment \"p5 before equation 5, you define ...\"\n\nWe assumed that we have a joint probability $p(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_1, \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_2,...,\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_C, {\\bf y}_{c,k})=p(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_1, \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_2,...,\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_C|{\\bf y}_{c,k})p({\\bf y}_{c,k}) \\propto exp(-\\frac{ min_{1 \\leq c \\leq C}( D({\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_c; {\\bf y}_{c,k}}) )\u00a0\u00a0 }{\u00a0 \\beta_2 })exp(-\\frac{ \\Vert {\\bf y}_{c,k}\u00a0 \\Vert_1\u00a0\u00a0 }{\u00a0 \\beta_0 })$. If we\n\nfurther assume that $p(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_1, \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_2, ..., \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_C)=\\prod_{c=1}^C p(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_c)$ and that the class label is know then we say that\n\n$p(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_c| {\\bf y}_{c,k})  \\propto exp(-\\frac{D({\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_c; {\\bf y}_{c,k}} )}{\\beta_2})$.\n\n\nConsidering the comment \"p5 Equation 6: I dont ...\" we note that there was a typo (a summation is missing). That is \n$D({\\bf y}_{c,k}; \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{c} ) $ is not equal to $D^\\mathcal{P}_{\\ell_1} ({\\bf X}) + S^\\mathcal{P}_{\\ell_2} ({\\bf X})$. Since a summation in front of $D({\\bf y}_{c,k}; \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{c} ) $ in equation (6) was missing the correct expression for the first line in equation (6) is:\n\n$\\sum_c D({\\bf y}_{c,k}; \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{c} ) =D^\\mathcal{P}_{\\ell_1} ({\\bf X}) + S^\\mathcal{P}_{\\ell_2} ({\\bf X})$\n\n\nConsidering the comments p6-7 and Lemma 1 and all the former about the clarification pointed by the reviewer will be taken into considerations, we are working on the improvements that will be added into the revised version.\n\nWe share the reviewers concern about the necessity to provide a public code to boost the impact of the work. However, while we emphasize that the provided pseudo-code in the paper is very clear and easily reproducible, our code will shortly be accessible to public short after the announcement of the official decision. We simply do not publish it now in order to maintain the anonymity of this review procedure.

Moreover, we will clarify, simplify and highlight here, and in the revised version,  that a non-linear transform model is addressed only during the learning, whereas at test time only a sparsifying transform model is used. This is  explained by the fact that if the proposed similarity concentration  (that approximates the used measure in the discriminative\nprior) is zero then the discriminative prior is non-informative. Meaning  that the non-linear transform model reduces to a sparsifying transform model and the prior has no influence on the estimation of the representation. This  can easily be seen from the closed form solution of the transform representation in equation 16, that is if $ {\\bf g}={\\bf 0}$, then the transform representation is only a sparse representation, i.e., a thresholded version of ${\\bf A}{\\bf x}_{c,k}$.\n\nYes, we agree that the motivation behind the approach is very important, therefore, in the current version we had\n\nsection 1.2\n\nBy the end of the first sentence in section 1.2 we meant that we do not address an inverse problem where if the dimensionality of the dictionary (transform matrix) or the data  is high then the solution of the inverse problem has a high computational complexity. Considering the estimation of the transform representation we radder address a direct problem that as pointed out in section 2.2 (before equation 15) represents a low complexity constrained projection problem and has a closed form solution (equation 16). By the end of the second sentence in section  1.2 in we reefer to the fact that the non-linear transform model allows more freedom in modeling and imposing constraints on the transform representation (in fact it allows other non-linearity to be modeled, i.e. very easily we can model a ReLu as a transform representation).\n\n\nConsidering the motivation about the proposed central prior and the used approximation on the measure defined in the prior, first we note that we have tried to the best of our knowledge in sec 1.1 to outlay the open issues and the disadvantages in the specifics of the used constraints in the state-of-the-art discrimnative dictionary learning methods. Upon that we have devoted the second paragraph of section 1.2 on the general advantages and the advantages w.r.t. the state-of-the-art. More precisely we had:\n\n\nsection 1.2 paragraph 2\n\n\nAdditionally, the advantages of using this prior w.r.t. the discriminative priors in the state-of-the-art methods was given in\n\n\nsection 2.1 last paragraph.\n\nWe will try to clarify, restructure and highlight these points in our revised version.\n\nConcerning all the rest comments and the typos we will correct them accordingly.\n\nConsidering the length of the paper, we note that there is a possibility the paper to be without the sensitivity analysis, moreover we can integrate the comment of the reviewer and add this section in the appendix. Nevertheless, we considered that the sensitivity analysis is beneficial since it is related to the notion about the quality of the representation, i.e., the results of the analysis are used to bound the proposed discrimination power measure. In addition they also give an information-geometric perspective, that also to the best of our knowledge is the first analysis of this kind about a non-linear models and the similarity concentration measure without the need of a strict conditions for regularity, i.e., smoothness of the manifolds.\n\nSince we target a representation learning we considered that ICLR is the best place to present  our work. We will try to reduce the paper length within the allowed limits of change w.r.t. the initial version and do our best to sharpen the quality of the presentation."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning non-linear transform with discriminative and minimum information loss priors", "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach for learning discriminative and sparse representations.
