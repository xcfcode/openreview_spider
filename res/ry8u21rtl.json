Validation set was used for confirming our selection of the EMA alpha hyperparameter (0.999 was the first value we tried and turned out to be close to optimal). For the comparability of results, we chose to reuse other hyperparameters from Temporal Ensembling paper. We did perform a hyperparameter search for these other hyperparameters as well, which confirmed that the choice of hyperparameters was reasonable, although not perfectly optimal. The validation set was also used to inspect the inner workings of the model, which affected our intuition and choice of experiments.\n\nWe will update the paper when we have the weight norm results.

This essentially extends the temporal ensembling method to work in an online fashion.\n\nThis is a simple and potentially powerful way to do semi-supervised learning.

Instead, the authors propose to smooth the model weights during training (exponential moving average) to yield a \"teacher network\" which can be used to generate new labeled data in an online way.\n\nThe approach is well motivated. The main advantage over temporal ensembling is that this method admits online training vs temporal ensembling which only yields new labels once per epoch. The experimental results seem believable, and indicate an improvement over temporal ensembling.\n\nOverall, it appears to be a simple and interesting twist on temporal ensembling which yields better results in the semi-supervised setting.
