In an extended version of this paper we will expand on the connections to the related literature, including the ones you mentioned. \n\nWe agree that it would be great to have a more formal definition of the leakage propagation. At the moment we can quantitatively measure the MSVE of the value function estimation, but we can not exactly pinpoint what fraction of that error comes from the leakage propagation, and what fraction comes from other factors (limited capacity of network, issues in the optimization process, etc.). The closest we got to that was to first train with MC and then continue training with TD.\nIt would also be great to understand under what exact conditions this leakage propagation happens, indeed. We were able to design environments where it is more likely to happen (continuous state spaces having sharp discontinuities in the value function), but it's not yet a very precise characterization.\nPerhaps we can make progress in those directions with future work.

If two states are nearby in the input representation, but are far according to the dynamics of the MDP (that is, it takes many steps to reach from one state to another), the paper then suggests that the embedding should map them to two afar points.\nThe paper considers three embeddings, one of them manually designed and two others learned by an unsupervised signal, and shows that they reduce the leakage propagation problem.\n\nThe paper addresses an important problem, but I believe this work requires more study and deliberation (understanding that this is a workshop paper). Currently I cannot be very enthusiastic about this paper. For example, some of the shortcomings of this work are:\n\n- The paper is not clear about the choices of embedding. What is the hand-crafted transformation, and what exactly is the rubber band loss? It is desirable to be more formal here.\n\n- Much of the intuition of this work is related to the porto-value functions and the eigenfunctions of Laplace-Beltrami operator, but the paper is only cursorily mention that (Mahadevan, 2005) did not use neural embedding to achieve so. Even so that is the case, the relation deserves much better comparison and acknowledgement.\n\n- It is stated in Section 1.1 that the detailed setup is given in Appendix A, but that appendix only has a figure.

Is it stochastic or deterministic?", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "TD Learning with Neural Networks - Study of the Leakage Propagation Problem", "abstract": "In On-Policy Evaluation, one estimates the value function of the data-generating policy with algorithms like Monte-Carlo regression (MC) or Temporal-Difference Learning (TD).
