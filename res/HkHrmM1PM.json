However we do not expect the convnet to do the job. Because of the type \"explanations\" we have observed so far, we think that the performance may not be hurt significantly by including obfuscated files (indeed we use fairly simple/imperfect detection of obfuscation and our dataset certainly contains a large portion of obfuscated files already). Tests on the whole collection will be hopefully ready soon.\nObfuscation is quite common for the current malware but majority can be reversed by manually crafted \"unpackers\", that is another option.\n\n3) We believe that we can force the deep nets to focus on the code itself is by inputting emulation/sandboxing output instead of the file.

The results are on par with a network that takes in hand-crafted features, and the hidden layers are shown to be complementary to the hand-crafted features.\n\nThe paper is well written and easy to follow. The descriptions of the experiments are complete. One minor thing missing is the learning rate of the Adam optimizer.\n\nI have a more fundamental question about the task. How much does the model learn to identify parts of the problematic source code? How much does the model learn to identify signs unrelated to the source code, such as things in the header? I assume that in many cases you can judge whether a piece of binary is malware just by looking at the cosmetics of the program, but these features might not generalize well in the long run. I assume it would be much more useful to identify certain sequence of instructions and memory addresses based on cpu architectures. It would be great to analyze the CNN to see what it is paying attention to.\n\nThe other fundamental question about the task is obfuscation. On the one hand, in theory there is no universal tool to overcome obfuscation (with the standard crypto assumptions). On the other hand, it's probably easy to detect trivial obfuscation, because the resulting program binaries would look significantly different from regular program binaries. How often are binaries obfuscated in general? How do these affect the model's performance? What are the characteristics of regular program binaries?\n\nPrograms as data are more stringent than natural images and words. The CNNs might require a lot of effort just learning the common idioms of programming, such as control flows, loops, from the binaries. I think the CNNs might benefit from these high-level constructs/templates when identifying malwares. Since CNNs or deep models in general are strong at coping with noise, it might be useful to look at how they behave on mutated malware.", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Convolutional Malware Classifiers Can Learn from Raw Executables and Labels Only", "abstract": " We propose and evaluate a simple convolutional deep neural network architecture detecting malicious \\emph{Portable Executables} (Windows executable files) by learning from their raw sequences of bytes and labels only, that is, without any domain-specific feature extraction nor preprocessing.
