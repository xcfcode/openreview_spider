In page 11, they have seamlessly replaced delta_{t} with delta_{t+1} under stationarity which implicitly assumes good estimates for delta_{t} and consequently for the VF estimate.

The idea is that you can collect human scoring data for some responses from a dialogue model, however such scores are expensive. Thus, it is natural to use off-policy learning \u2013 training a base policy on unsupervised data, deploying that policy to collect human scores, and then learning off-line from those scores.\n\nWhile the overall contribution is modest (extending off-policy actor-critic to the application of dialogue generation), the approach is well-motivated, and the paper is written clearly and is easy to understand. \n\nMy main concern is that the primary dataset used (restaurant recommendations) is very small (6000 conversations). In fact, it is several orders of magnitude smaller than other datasets used in the literature (e.g. Twitter, the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus) for dialogue generation. It is a bit surprising to me that RNN chatbots (with no additional structure) are able to generate reasonable utterances on such a small dataset. Wen et al. (2016) are able to do this on a similarly small restaurant dataset, but this is mostly because they map directly from dialogue states to surface form, rather than some embedding representation of the context. Thus, it remains to be seen if the approaches in this paper also result in improvements when much more unsupervised data is available.\n\nReferences:\n\nWen, Tsung-Hsien, Milica Gasic, Nikola Mrksic, Lina M.

Please see our responses below.\n1) Not quite. To convey the main intuitions, lets just assume the tabular setting. If you look at Algorithm 1 of Degris et al, you see that the reward gets factored into the updates due to the delta term. The first time their algorithm sees an episode, it only affects the update at time step T (where T is the length of the episode). The next time it sees the same episode, the updates at time T-1 and T are affected because the value function (VF) estimate is also updated. So for time t in an episode, the example has to be seen T-t times. A similar phenomenon occurs in the non-tabular setting where it takes at least a few passes through an episode before the rewards are factored into all time steps.\nThe more serious issue with the on-line version is that this relies on a reliable estimator for the value function - because, the expected rewards of the future states in a given episode are made known to the actor *only* via the VF estimate. While it is reasonable to expect a good estimator for the VF when you have large amounts of labeled data, this is not the case in settings like ours. For e.g. a simple constant estimator for the VF will not work here. We have explained this in the last paragraph of Sec 4.1 (first para of page 8).\nDegris et al show that the forward and backward view are equivalent, but the proof is in the asymptotic / large-sample regime when you have reached the limiting distribution and the VF estimate has \"converged\". The proof does not hold for finite sample and we have strong reasons to believe that it is not true, especially in limited data situations as in the paper.\n2) No, the updates are performed in mini-batches. See the sentence above the last paragraph in page 5 and line 6 of the last paragraph of page 6. We can clarify this more in the table for Algorithm 1.\n3) Yes.\n4) Yes, we do not claim any convergence properties for the proposed algorithm.\n5) Sorry, we should have been a bit more precise here. The assumption is that the state distributions s_t and s_{t+k} are the same for all k>0. This is true (once again) when you have reached the limiting distribution but not the case in ours.

However, Degris et al show that using eligibility traces, the lambda-return can exactly be computed in a backward view. Hence, it the updated to the parameters were computed over the entire dataset using the algorithm of Degris et al (without doing any actual parameter updated meanwhile), the result would be the same as of the proposed algorithm. Hence, as I understand it, the only difference between the two algorithms is when the parameters are updated. Is this correct?\n2) The algorithm outlined on p6 suggests that for each gradient step on the parameters, the entire dataset is touched. This seems quite inefficient. An mini-batched version of this algorithm on the other hand would resemble the version of Degris quite closely. \n3) In fig 2: Does the x-axis show number of passes through the entire dataset for all algorithms?\n4) The errata of Degris et al states that the guarantees for their off-policy algorithm only holds for the tabular setting. This would exclude the RNN-based state representation chosen by the authors here; is this correct?\n5) middle of p6: \u201cIn order to tackle this, previous research either [...], or make additional assumptions about the distribution of the states (Degris et al., 2012...\u201d Which assumptions in Degris et al do the authors refer to?"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Batch Policy Gradient  Methods for  Improving Neural Conversation Models", "abstract": "We study reinforcement learning of chat-bots with recurrent neural network\narchitectures when the rewards are noisy and expensive to\nobtain.

Therefore, a maximum likelihood (ML) trained bot can do well on the reproducing part of the reinforcement learning (RL) reward, r_r, but not on the forbidden part, r_f. The goal then is to use the rewards to see if we can improve on r_f (and r_r).\n\nThe reason we chose this set up was because it reflects naturally occurring practical scenarios for this work where the ML objective and the RL objective are partially but not completely aligned. For e.g., we may have large quantities of past conversations where the agents' responses are good, but perhaps not entirely suitable due to reasons explained in the paper. We can initialise a bot with ML on this dataset, and then use the limited labeled dataset to fine tune this bot via RL. We have mentioned this in the 2nd para of Section 4.1 but can elaborate more if necessary.\n\nYes, the reward is independent of the decoded word order.
