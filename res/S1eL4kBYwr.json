We therefore continued with the single-stream architecture, and focused on finding the most effective pretraining strategy, which is our main contribution. Note that both LXMERT and ViLBERT promoted two-stream models, yet we showed that single-stream model is sufficient to learn contextual representations across two modalities.\n\nFewer parameters could potentially be an advantage, e.g., we are able to stack deeper/larger transformer layers under the same memory constraint.\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Authors"], "readers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Reviewers/Submitted", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs", "everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "UNITER: Learning UNiversal Image-TExt Representations", "authors": ["Yen-Chun Chen", "Linjie Li", "Licheng Yu", "Ahmed El Kholy", "Faisal Ahmed", "Zhe Gan", "Yu Cheng", "Jingjing Liu"], "authorids": ["yen-chun.chen@microsoft.com", "lindsey.li@microsoft.com", "licheng.yu@microsoft.com", "ahmed.elkholy@microsoft.com", "fiahmed@microsoft.com", "zhe.gan@microsoft.com", "yu.cheng@microsoft.com", "jingjl@microsoft.com"], "keywords": ["Self-supervised Representation Learning", "Large-scale Pre-training", "Vision and Language"], "TL;DR": "We introduce UNITER, a UNiversal Image-TExt Representation, learned through large-scale pre-training over image-text datasets, achieves state-of-the-art results across six Vision-and-Language tasks over nine datasets.", "abstract": "Joint image-text embedding is the bedrock for most Vision-and-Language (V+L) tasks, where multimodality inputs are jointly processed for visual and textual understanding.

I agree this is well-motivated, but it has little novelty and a similar idea is there in VQA (See \u201cDynamic fusion with intra and inter-modality attention flow for visual question answering\u201d). MLM and MRM are not new training procedure either, they are basically extending the BERT\u2019s training procedure with the consideration of multiple modalities.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you for referring us a related work. After a thorough check of the paper, we agree with the reviewer this is also a relevant work. Nevertheless, Gao et al., (2019) may focus on novel model architecture, while we proposed a generic V+L representation via pretraining. We will cite the paper and discuss it in the related work.\nSecondly, we argue that UNITER is not trivially derived from BERT. Even for BERT, language modeling has been around for years (CBOW, Mikolov et al., 2013).\nIntuitively, mask-then-reconstruct is helpful for learning contextualization, but the key is what exact pretraining tasks are effective, especially for learning \u201calignment\u201d across vision and language in our case.\nThat\u2019s why we proposed ITM, MLM, MRM (3 variants), enumerate their combinations on large-scale pretraining, and then study a diverse set of V+L downstream tasks to derive the best pretraining strategy (Table 3).\nTo explain the superior performance of UNITER, we believe the conditioned MLM/MRM better learns the local alignment (token/region level) across modalities and ITM enhances the global alignment. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Authors"], "readers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Reviewers/Submitted", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs", "everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "UNITER: Learning UNiversal Image-TExt Representations", "authors": ["Yen-Chun Chen", "Linjie Li", "Licheng Yu", "Ahmed El Kholy", "Faisal Ahmed", "Zhe Gan", "Yu Cheng", "Jingjing Liu"], "authorids": ["yen-chun.chen@microsoft.com", "lindsey.li@microsoft.com", "licheng.yu@microsoft.com", "ahmed.elkholy@microsoft.com", "fiahmed@microsoft.com", "zhe.gan@microsoft.com", "yu.cheng@microsoft.com", "jingjl@microsoft.com"], "keywords": ["Self-supervised Representation Learning", "Large-scale Pre-training", "Vision and Language"], "TL;DR": "We introduce UNITER, a UNiversal Image-TExt Representation, learned through large-scale pre-training over image-text datasets, achieves state-of-the-art results across six Vision-and-Language tasks over nine datasets.", "abstract": "Joint image-text embedding is the bedrock for most Vision-and-Language (V+L) tasks, where multimodality inputs are jointly processed for visual and textual understanding.

Why this special token is needed? Why is not needed in the MLM and MRM? \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThank you for the questions, we will update the paper to make it clearer. \n\nFor ITM, the input is a sentence and a set of image regions and the output is a binary label (0 for negative match, and 1 for positive match). During training, we sample negative examples for each positive example by replacing the sentence/image. We extract the representation of [CLS] token as the joint representation of the input text and image, then fed into a fully connected layer to predict a score between 0 and 1. The ITM supervision is over the [CLS] token.\n\nIn practice, the [CLS] token is fed into the model for all other pretraining tasks and the downstream finetuning tasks as well. However, in MLM/MRM, the goal is to reconstruct the masked token/region. Therefore, the MLM/MRM supervision is over the representation of the masked token/region. \n\nThe supervision over the [CLS] token in pretraining also alleviates the input mismatch between pretraining tasks and downstream finetuning tasks, since most of the downstream tasks also regard the representation of [CLS] token as the joint representation.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Authors"], "readers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Reviewers/Submitted", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs", "everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "UNITER: Learning UNiversal Image-TExt Representations", "authors": ["Yen-Chun Chen", "Linjie Li", "Licheng Yu", "Ahmed El Kholy", "Faisal Ahmed", "Zhe Gan", "Yu Cheng", "Jingjing Liu"], "authorids": ["yen-chun.chen@microsoft.com", "lindsey.li@microsoft.com", "licheng.yu@microsoft.com", "ahmed.elkholy@microsoft.com", "fiahmed@microsoft.com", "zhe.gan@microsoft.com", "yu.cheng@microsoft.com", "jingjl@microsoft.com"], "keywords": ["Self-supervised Representation Learning", "Large-scale Pre-training", "Vision and Language"], "TL;DR": "We introduce UNITER, a UNiversal Image-TExt Representation, learned through large-scale pre-training over image-text datasets, achieves state-of-the-art results across six Vision-and-Language tasks over nine datasets.", "abstract": "Joint image-text embedding is the bedrock for most Vision-and-Language (V+L) tasks, where multimodality inputs are jointly processed for visual and textual understanding.

Novelty The novelty of the paper is quite limited since it is an extension of BERT to the visual domain. The authors propose an empirical analysis of different ways to mask the visual input, however this might not be a substantial extension of previous work. In fact, recently there are many other papers (ViLBERT, VisualBERT, LXBERT, ...) working on similar topic with small differences. What it is missing in this paper is an understanding and intuition on the reasons why the conditioned masking idea should be better than the other visual masking ideas proposed in previous work. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe think these peer works are concurrent to our UNITER. We did feel much pressure when our peer works went public, but we decided to complete all 9 downstream tasks with 13 settings (covering nearly all popular V+L tasks) to show UNITER\u2019s better generalization ability, rather than publishing a premature work. With such extensive experiments, our work is much more convincing.\n\nIt is true that all concurrent works used visual masking and language masking. However, it is not clear what the exact visual tasks are helpful for V+L self-supervised learning. First, until recently, no one knows whether MLM can be applied to image-conditioned text modeling. Second, we propose 3 variants of Masked Region Modeling (MRM) and suggest the community the most effective combination (Table 3). \n\n\nAs for why our conditional masking works better than others (joint masking), we hypothesize that UNITER learns better latent alignment of entities (regions and words) across two modalities. For example, given a sentence \u201cman with his dog on a couch\u201d and a corresponding image as in Figure 1. For our conditional masking, when the region of \u201cdog\u201d is masked, our model should be able to infer that region is \u201cdog\u201d based on the context of both the surrounding regions and the full sentence, and vice versa. For the joint masking implementation, it could happen when both the region of \u201cdog\u201d and the word of \u201cdog\u201d are masked, then the model has to predict blindly. Therefore, joint masking might lead to miss-alignment. We show in Table 3 (row 10&11) that our conditional masking performs better than joint masking.\n\nTo further demonstrate our idea, we are working on a more direct comparison with ViLBERT and other concurrent works which were trained on Conceptual Captions (CC) only. However, we would like to emphasize that large-scale data is essential for self-supervised learning. So far, only we have succeeded in pretraining on these 4 largest public datasets (10 days x 16 V100 GPUs). Also, we are working hard to resolve legal/license issue, and we will release our best pretrained model to help future V+L research.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Authors"], "readers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Reviewers/Submitted", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs", "everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "UNITER: Learning UNiversal Image-TExt Representations", "authors": ["Yen-Chun Chen", "Linjie Li", "Licheng Yu", "Ahmed El Kholy", "Faisal Ahmed", "Zhe Gan", "Yu Cheng", "Jingjing Liu"], "authorids": ["yen-chun.chen@microsoft.com", "lindsey.li@microsoft.com", "licheng.yu@microsoft.com", "ahmed.elkholy@microsoft.com", "fiahmed@microsoft.com", "zhe.gan@microsoft.com", "yu.cheng@microsoft.com", "jingjl@microsoft.com"], "keywords": ["Self-supervised Representation Learning", "Large-scale Pre-training", "Vision and Language"], "TL;DR": "We introduce UNITER, a UNiversal Image-TExt Representation, learned through large-scale pre-training over image-text datasets, achieves state-of-the-art results across six Vision-and-Language tasks over nine datasets.", "abstract": "Joint image-text embedding is the bedrock for most Vision-and-Language (V+L) tasks, where multimodality inputs are jointly processed for visual and textual understanding.

Our assumption is that UNITER learns contextualized joint representation of both modalities. In Section 3.1, we proposed conditional masking that allows the model to learn informative representation of one modality conditioned on the other. Note that the conditional masking happens in both modalities. Therefore, the representation is aware of both visual and textual information. The reconstruction of masked tokens/regions can be viewed as learning local alignment across modalities. Furthermore, when combined with ITM pretraining, the global alignment between both modalities is encouraged. We also show that every pretraining task contributes to the final performance gain.

Summary\nThe authors introduce a new pre-training procedure for image-text representations. The idea is to train the model on a huge collection of different image-text datasets and the use the model for downstream tasks. The difference between the proposal wrt the concurrent work is that conditioned masking is used: (i) Masked Language Modeling (MLM) conditioned on image; (ii) Masked Region Modeling (MRM) conditioned on text; and (iii) joint Image-Text Matching (ITM).\n\nI am on the fence for this paper given the balance between strengths and  weaknesses listed below. I am conservative here and decide for weak reject; but I am open for discussion, if the authors answer to my concerns detailed below. \n\nStrengths:\n* State-of-the-art results on several downstream vision-language tasks\n* Empirical work to investigate different ways to perform conditioned masking \n      \nWeaknesses:\n* Some parts of the method needs clarification (see point 2 below) to better understand the details and practical advantages of the method. \n* Limited novelty: the paper is an extension of BERT to the visual domain (see point 3 below)\n     \n      \n# 2. Clarity and Motivation\nThe paper reads quite well, although some points need to be improved:\n* \"Compared with LXMERT (Tan & Bansal, 2019) and ViLBERT (Lu et al., 2019) that use two streams (one Transformer for each modality), our UNITER model can learn joint contextualized ...\", why is this an advantage? Using two streams might also lead to learning context? Maybe an example can clarify my question.\n* End of Sec. 3.1 (and paragraph in Sec. 3.2): not clear how the model is training for ITM. What's the input and output? Why do you need a new symbol [CLS]?\n* Sec. 3.2 ITM: \"an additional special token [CLS] is fed into our model, which indicates the fused representation of both modalities\" - This is not clear. Why this special token is needed? Why is not needed in the MLM and MRM?\n* \"The scoring function is denoted as s\" -> please indicate in the main text what function you used\n* MRFM and MRC are clear, however the intuition of MRC-kl is missing. Why is this needed? What does it mean in practice to minimize such divergence (provide practical example)?\n* Combination of tasks (MLM + ITM + MRC-kl + MRFR) -> it is not clear how this is done in practice. Is the loss function composed (summed)? Within the mini-batch, the method randomly chooses which operation to do (e.g., MLM) for each sample? This should be clarified in the main text of the paper.\n  \n\n# 3. Novelty\nThe novelty of the paper is quite limited since it is an extension of BERT to the visual domain. The authors propose an empirical analysis of different ways to mask the visual input, however this might not be a substantial extension of previous work. In fact, recently there are many other papers (ViLBERT, VisualBERT, LXBERT, ...) working on similar topic with small differences. What it is missing in this paper is an understanding and intuition on the reasons why the conditioned masking idea should be better than the other visual masking ideas proposed in previous work.\n\n\n# 4. Experimentation\nThe main advantage of this paper relies on the extensive experimental analysis done on many challenging datasets reaching the state of the art on several downstream tasks.\nThe evaluation on both pre-training tasks and downstream tasks show that the method is working well in practice.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "UNITER: Learning UNiversal Image-TExt Representations", "authors": ["Yen-Chun Chen", "Linjie Li", "Licheng Yu", "Ahmed El Kholy", "Faisal Ahmed", "Zhe Gan", "Yu Cheng", "Jingjing Liu"], "authorids": ["yen-chun.chen@microsoft.com", "lindsey.li@microsoft.com", "licheng.yu@microsoft.com", "ahmed.elkholy@microsoft.com", "fiahmed@microsoft.com", "zhe.gan@microsoft.com", "yu.cheng@microsoft.com", "jingjl@microsoft.com"], "keywords": ["Self-supervised Representation Learning", "Large-scale Pre-training", "Vision and Language"], "TL;DR": "We introduce UNITER, a UNiversal Image-TExt Representation, learned through large-scale pre-training over image-text datasets, achieves state-of-the-art results across six Vision-and-Language tasks over nine datasets.", "abstract": "Joint image-text embedding is the bedrock for most Vision-and-Language (V+L) tasks, where multimodality inputs are jointly processed for visual and textual understanding.

The paper modifies an existing pre-training procedure by conditional masking (Section 2). I agree this is well-motivated but it has little novelty and a similar idea is there in VQA (See \u201cDynamic fusion with intra and inter-modality attention flow for visual question answering\u201d). MLM and MRM are not new training procedure either, they are basically extending the BERT\u2019s training procedure with the consideration of multiple modalities.\n\nI have some questions for the authors:\n(1) What are the advantages of using single-stream transformer over two-stream transformer (page 2). I guess it leads to fewer parameters but I don\u2019t think this is a big problem.\n(2) Some visualization of attention weights would be helpful. \nMinor\n\u2022\tIn \u201cm \\e N^M\u201d (equation 1), what is N and M? \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1655/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "UNITER: Learning UNiversal Image-TExt Representations", "authors": ["Yen-Chun Chen", "Linjie Li", "Licheng Yu", "Ahmed El Kholy", "Faisal Ahmed", "Zhe Gan", "Yu Cheng", "Jingjing Liu"], "authorids": ["yen-chun.chen@microsoft.com", "lindsey.li@microsoft.com", "licheng.yu@microsoft.com", "ahmed.elkholy@microsoft.com", "fiahmed@microsoft.com", "zhe.gan@microsoft.com", "yu.cheng@microsoft.com", "jingjl@microsoft.com"], "keywords": ["Self-supervised Representation Learning", "Large-scale Pre-training", "Vision and Language"], "TL;DR": "We introduce UNITER, a UNiversal Image-TExt Representation, learned through large-scale pre-training over image-text datasets, achieves state-of-the-art results across six Vision-and-Language tasks over nine datasets.", "abstract": "Joint image-text embedding is the bedrock for most Vision-and-Language (V+L) tasks, where multimodality inputs are jointly processed for visual and textual understanding.
