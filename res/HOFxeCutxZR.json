Specifically, this paper uses a pre-trained GAN to synthesize images, a pre-trained regressor to get the image attributes, and trains a network T to find meaningful latent-space directions. It then edits image attributes by modifying the input latent vector, described as z' = z + T(z)\u03b5. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than other selected methods to some degree.\n\nStrengths: \n1) The idea of controllable editing is intuitive and interesting.\n2) Quantitative results on face datasets (Tab. 1 and Tab. 2) show its superiority over other selected methods.\n3) Visualization results on both the natural scene and face datasets show its effectiveness on the parts to be edited (e.g. clouds for \u201cremove clouds\u201d and mouth for \u201cadd smile\u201d).\n\nWeaknesses: \n1) Visualization results on natural scene datasets show that its ability to maintain image identity needs to be improved. For example, the image identities in Fig. 3 are changed during the editing, like the mountains' shapes in row 1 and trees' shapes in row 3.\n2) The authors claim that their edits are disentangled, but the visualization results on face datasets don\u2019t support this point very well. For example, the baselines unexpectedly add \"glasses\" when aging the face in Fig. 4. However, the proposed method also adds glasses on the man's right eye (figure on the bottom right corner). \n3) Lack of comparisons of continuous image editing with other methods.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper315/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper315/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Enjoy Your Editing: Controllable GANs for Image Editing via Latent Space Navigation", "authorids": ["~Peiye_Zhuang2", "~Oluwasanmi_O_Koyejo1", "~Alex_Schwing1"], "authors": ["Peiye Zhuang", "Oluwasanmi O Koyejo", "Alex Schwing"], "keywords": ["Image manipulation", "GANs", "latent space of GANs"], "abstract": "Controllable semantic image editing enables a user to change entire image attributes with a few clicks, e.g., gradually making a summer scene look like it was taken in winter.

We trained R for 500 epochs and used the weights with the best val/test MSE on the datasets. \n\nTo be more specific, for example, on the scene dataset (Laffont et al. 2014), R has the minimum validation set MSE of 0.0139 at epoch 384. The MSE scores provided in the original paper (Laffont et al. 2014) are 0.018 (by SVR), 0.045 (by SVM), and 0.063 (by logistic regression).\n\n 2. **\"Details of \u2018Joint-distribution sampling and training\u2019 part in Section 3.2 would be needed.\"**\n\nThanks for suggesting, we\u2019ll add a description in the manuscript. We also summarize the sampling and training strategies in the following. Take a global transformation matrix $T$ as an example, the transformation equation for the latent vector is  $z\u2019 = z + T \\epsilon$.\n\n* $\\epsilon$ is an N-dimensional vector.\n* $T = [d_1, \u2026, d_N]$, where $d_i$ is a vector that has the same dimension as the latent vector $z$, and $i \\in \\{1,..., N\\}$.\n* The regressor R estimates all attribute values for image $G(z\u2019)$ during training. Let $\\hat{\\alpha}\u2019 = R(G(z\u2019))$, where $\\hat{\\alpha}\u2019$ is also an N-dimensional vector. \n\nGiven $d_i$ and the N-dimensional $\\epsilon$ and $\\hat{\\alpha}\u2019$, we are able to modify multiple directions at once using the training algorithm shown in APPENDIX-A. In contrast, prior state-of-the-art work (Shen et al. 2020) employs a scalar $\\epsilon$, and finds the directions one at a time, i.e., N times in total.\n\n3. **\"Does the accuracy of the inversion results affect the performance of the proposed method?\"**\n\nWe added experiments in the supplementary material to study how GAN inversion impacts results. In the supplementary material, Tab.4 and Fig.18 present quantitative and qualitative results on real face images, comparing different GAN inversion qualities. Tab.4 indicates that GAN inversion quality effects results to some degree, which isn\u2019t entirely surprising. Nonetheless, Fig.18 suggests that we can still edit the attributes well on inverted images with larger reconstruction loss.\n\n\n4. **\"An ablation study on the joint-distribution sampling would be needed to validate their effectiveness.\"**\n\nWe summarize the effectiveness of our joint-distribution sampling strategy into two points:\n\n* Our joint-distribution sampling and training strategy is primarily compared to the prior state-of-the-art work (Shen et al. 2020) that has to find one direction at a time without considering the other attributes. Therefore, one advantage of such a joint-distribution sampling and training is that we can obtain multiple directions within one training iteration. Moreover, our results in the paper suggest better results of our method compared to the prior state-of-the-art work (Shen et al. 2020) with respect to identity preservation and attribute manipulation. \n\n* In the supplementary material, we also added a comparison between joint-distribution sampling and a single-distribution training strategy of our approach on both face and scene data. Results in Fig.19 show that the model with the single-distribution training strategy may generate more unexpected changes as the manipulation degree is getting large, e.g., darker scene colors by the model trained on a single attribute.\n\n\n\n5. **\"Specify the sampling strategy of the epsilon vector as shown in Figure 2.\"**\n\nWe mentioned the sampling strategy of the epsilon on page 4, in the paragraph above the Object function paragraph. An epsilon is drawn from a distribution uniform in $[-1, 1]^N$ while considering the constraint that the sum of the attribute values and the epsilon is in the range [0,1].\n\n6. **\"Table 2 seems to measure the cosine similarity, while Table 1 evaluates the change of the attributes. How did you calculate the change of the attributes?\"**\n\nWe used a straightforward strategy to calculate the changes of the attributes: editing images on one attribute ideally shouldn\u2019t change the other irrelevant attributes. That is to say, the other attribute values of an image before and after editing,  predicted by R, should be unchanged. Hence, we calculated and averaged the absolute difference on each of the other attribute values, predicted by R, for an image before and after editing, to measure the attribute changes.\n\n\n7. **\"The results in Figure 8 (a) are based on the global transformation T with the proposed losses. Did you obtain these results using MLP direction functions or simple linear-layer direction functions?\"**\n\nThe global transformation in Figure 8 is a linear-layer direction independent of the inputs. We mention that such a global transformation setting is widely used in the prior work (Shen et al. 2020; Voynov et al. 2020).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper315/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper315/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Enjoy Your Editing: Controllable GANs for Image Editing via Latent Space Navigation", "authorids": ["~Peiye_Zhuang2", "~Oluwasanmi_O_Koyejo1", "~Alex_Schwing1"], "authors": ["Peiye Zhuang", "Oluwasanmi O Koyejo", "Alex Schwing"], "keywords": ["Image manipulation", "GANs", "latent space of GANs"], "abstract": "Controllable semantic image editing enables a user to change entire image attributes with a few clicks, e.g., gradually making a summer scene look like it was taken in winter.

However, it can be seen from Fig. 6 that some details are still lost by GAN inversion.\"**\n\nWe agree, there is a trade-off between editing within image space and editing in the latent space of a GAN. An advantage of image editing in the latent space of a GAN: discovered latent variable manipulations permit continuous semantic image edits for multiple pixels using a lower-dimensional space. However, current latent-space editing approaches surely depend on GAN inversion for real image editing.

For example, the image identities in Fig. 3 are changed during the editing, like the mountains' shapes in row 1 and trees' shapes in row 3.\"**\n\nWe agree that results could be improved in multiple ways, including better image identity preservation. Nonetheless, we\u2019d like to mention that prior related work (Shen et al. 2020, Voynov et al. 2020) didn\u2019t consider image identity preservation at all. In contrast, we provide a first attempt to explicitly maintain the identity which is according to our opinion successful to a reasonable degree. Supporting results are shown in the manuscript, including Fig. 1, 3-6, and Tab. 1-2.\n\n2. **\"The authors claim that their edits are disentangled, but the visualization results on face datasets don\u2019t support this point very well. For example, the baselines unexpectedly add \"glasses\" when aging the face in Fig. 4. However, the proposed method also adds glasses on the man's right eye (figure on the bottom right corner).\"**\n\nWe don\u2019t think our method adds glasses on the man\u2019s right eye in Figure 4. Instead, wrinkles on the face are increased. Beyond understanding bias from a variety of people, Figure 4 suggests that our approach outperforms the representative baseline approaches, for which results are provided in Figure 4 (a) and (b). \nWe also provided more supporting evidence for our disentanglement claim in Figure 1, Figure 6, and Table 1-2. For example, in Figure 6, we showcase better results than the state-of-the-art supervised method (Shen et al., 2020) for editing multiple (2~3) attributes simultaneously. This suggests that the method can achieve better disentanglement and image identity preservation. Similarly, Table 1-2 supports the claim quantitatively. \n\n3. **\"Lack of comparisons of continuous image editing with other methods.\"**\n\nIn the manuscript, we compared our method to a representative continuous image-to-image translation approach, RelGAN (Wu et al., 2019). For example, Figure 3 (c) and Figure 14 (c) present a comparison to this approach on the Scene dataset. Specifically, as shown in Figure 3, we notice that this baseline didn\u2019t perform well with regard to editing image details such as ``removing clouds\u2019\u2019.\n\n**References:**\n\nRelGAN: Multi-Domain Image-to-Image Translation via Relative Attributes, Po-Wei Wu et al., In ICCV 2019.  \nInterpreting the Latent Space of GANs for Semantic Face Editing, Yujun Shen et al., In CVPR 2020.  \nUnsupervised discovery of interpretable directions in the gan latent space, Andrey Voynov and Artem Babenko, In ICML, 2020.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper315/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper315/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Enjoy Your Editing: Controllable GANs for Image Editing via Latent Space Navigation", "authorids": ["~Peiye_Zhuang2", "~Oluwasanmi_O_Koyejo1", "~Alex_Schwing1"], "authors": ["Peiye Zhuang", "Oluwasanmi O Koyejo", "Alex Schwing"], "keywords": ["Image manipulation", "GANs", "latent space of GANs"], "abstract": "Controllable semantic image editing enables a user to change entire image attributes with a few clicks, e.g., gradually making a summer scene look like it was taken in winter.

The approach allows for the manipulation of single or multiple various image attributes, while preserving the identity of the original image in contrast to the baseline method of Shen et. al 2019. The method focuses on the manipulation of the latent space, in contrast to the popular image space editing methods. \n\nThe paper is easy to read and understand. The authors have presented their method and analysis which are clear and understandable, supported quite well with the provided examples and figures.\n\n#### Strengths:\nExperiments are conducted on various datasets and compared to various methods - supervised and unsupervised\nTheir method is able to consistently preserve the image content (in case of scenes) and identity (in case of faces) \nShowing inversion results along the transformation shows the robustness and tractable nature of their method.  \n\n#### Weakness:\nIt is not entirely clear how the local transformation are discovered for different z values independently, or rather what the difference is in discovering the global transformation vs discovering the local transformation\n\n\n#### Questions to the Authors:\n1. In comparison with the Voynov & Babenko model, how many of the directions that their model was able to find did you look at?\n2. What is the accuracy / results of the performance metric of the different used pre-trained regressors? Given that the perceptual losses were used while training, the regressors\u2019 performance values could shed some light in this direction.
