It is well understood that spectral initialization is better than random initialization in low-rank literatures. Moreover, the proposed Frobenius decay is simply a penalization on the squared norm of the whole factorization. That is, it replaces the weight-decay $\\|W\\|_F^2$ in deep nets by plugging in the low-rank formulation of $W$. The behaviors of these two components in the experiments are expected. These two components have not provided much new insight. \n\n~~~~~\nThis major concern is relieved after rebuttal. \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1021/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1021/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Initialization and Regularization of Factorized Neural Layers", "authorids": ["~Mikhail_Khodak1", "~Neil_A._Tenenholtz1", "~Lester_Mackey1", "~Nicolo_Fusi1"], "authors": ["Mikhail Khodak", "Neil A.

The result of Neyshabur et al. (2018) can itself be extended to the factorized setting to justify the methods we propose. Specifically, they bound the 0-1 test loss of a $d$-layer fully connected ReLU net with weights $W\\_1,\\dots,W\\_d$ by the empirical margin loss plus the following generalization error term with high probability (here $m$ is the number of samples):\n\n$$\\tilde O\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{d^2\\left(\\prod\\_{i=1}\\^d\\\\|W\\_i\\\\|\\_2\\^2\\right)\\sum\\_{i=1}\\^d\\frac{\\\\|W\\_i\\\\|\\_F\\^2}{\\\\|W\\_i\\\\|\\_2\\^2}}m}\\right)$$\n\nThis bound can be used to directly obtain bounds for our setting by directly replacing all weights matrices $W\\_i$ by their factorization $U\\_iV\\_i\\^T$. For example, to account for the Frobenius decay penalty term $\\frac12\\\\|U\\_iV\\_i\\^T\\\\|\\_F\\^2$ that we propose as a regularizer, the above bound is equivalent to\n\n$$\\tilde O\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{d^2\\sum\\_{i=1}\\^d\\\\|U\\_iV\\_i\\^T\\\\|\\_F\\^2\\prod\\_{j\\ne i}\\\\|U\\_jV\\_j\\^T\\\\|\\_2\\^2}m}\\right)$$\n\nThus controlling the magnitude of the squared Frobenius norm of each factorized layer can be interpreted as targeting a low generalization error. Alternatively, substituting the inequality $\\\\|W\\\\|\\_F\\^2/\\\\|W\\\\|\\_2\\^2\\le rank(W)$ into the first bound and assuming all factorizations have rank $r$ yields a generalization error bound of\n\n$$\\tilde O\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{d^3r\\prod\\_{i=1}\\^d\\\\|U\\_iV\\_i\\^T\\\\|\\_2\\^2}m}\\right)$$\n\nWe hope this latter point answers your original question about a theoretical explanation for how reducing the rank can improve the model learned.  \n\nAs with all theoretical results in deep learning, these bounds have limitations: they apply only to the margin loss, they do not account for batch-norm, and they are likely vacuous for practical sample sizes. However, we do not know of any work on generalization in deep learning that overcomes these limitations, and we believe such a result, if obtained, should be presented on its own as part of a paper on unfactorized deep nets, not as part of an analysis of the training routines of factorized models. For our purposes, we believe that these corollaries of Neyshabur et al. (2018) directly address your point that \u201c[i]t would make the paper stronger if the existing generalization error bounds such as Neyshabur et al. (2018) can be extended in the paper.\u201d  \n\nIn the most recent revision we have referenced these two bounds explicitly (using our paper\u2019s notation and assuming for simplicity a bound on the spectral norm of each layer) in the main text (Sections 2.1 and 3.2) and stated them formally as corollaries of Theorem 1 of Neyshabur et al.

We hope to address your questions below.  \n\n1. _\u201cIn the experiments in section 5 (knowledge distillation), default initialization is used instead of spectral initialization. I wonder if SI leads to a bad performance here. If that\u2019s the case, it requires more explanation of why SI fails in this setting.\u201d_  \nWe do not use SI in Section 5 because there is no obvious way to apply it to overcomplete factorizations (when the rank is higher than the original rank). For the full-rank case (the \u201cfull\u201d setting), the median performance is roughly the same with and without SI. Here are the results for ResNet56:  \n|       | CIFAR-10 | CIFAR-100 |\n|-------|----------|-----------|\n| WD    | 92.45    | 69.23     |\n| SI+WD | 92.49    | 70.42     |\n| FD    | 93.68    | 72.18     |\n| SI+FD | 93.48    | 72.19     |\n\n2.  \n   - _\u201cIn Figure 1, it seems FD is a stronger regularizer compared with default weight decay. It seems if the regularization coefficient is carefully tuned for each regularizer, the benefits of FD is actually not very significant.\u201d_  \nIn Figure 1 [note: in the revision the relevant plot is now in Figure 2], tuning weight-decay from the default value (1E-4) shows little to no improvement for both ResNet20 and ResNet44, while tuning FD does yield a noticeable improvement on ResNet20. We thus view this plot as showing that we cannot achieve FD performance by tuning weight-decay, and that tuning weight-decay does not yield significant improvements. The gap between their performances is 0.5-1%, which is not too small at this accuracy on CIFAR-10, and the gaps in the other experiments are more significant (usually 1-2% in Table 1, 0.5-1.5% in Table 2 at very high accuracies, and usually 1-2% in Table 3). While we did not extensively tune weight-decay in those settings, we believe that (1) the lack of need of tuning FD is a significant advantage in a setting where we aim for efficient training and (2) the figure suggests tuning weight-decay does not help much anyway.\n   - _\u201c[W]hat\u2019s \"no decay (normalized)\"?\u201d_  \n\u201cno decay (normalized)\u201d refers to the setting where we first train a network using FD and save the Frobenius norm of the (recomposed) weight matrix UV^T at each layer after each SGD step; we then re-initialize and train the network with zero weight-decay, but after each SGD step we normalize U and V at each so that their product UV^T has the same Frobenius norm as that of the same layer at the same time step of the previous optimization. This experiment is described in the last paragraph of Section 3.3; in the revision we have added a note about this in the caption.  \n\n3. _\u201cIn section 2, the definition of the factorized CNN is not very clear to me. It might be good to give more detailed definitions here.\u201d_  \nWe have added details about this in the revision (Section 2.2).  \n\n4. _\u201cSpectral initialization requires computing SVD of the weight matrix. If the matrix dimension is high, this step can be very time-consuming. I wonder if there is any more efficient way to construct the factorized matrices so that their product is still as i.i.d. Gaussian matrix. Because we don't need to compute the SVD for an arbitrary matrix, what we need is only to make sure that the product of the factorized matrixes is distributed as i.i.d. Gaussian.\u201d_  \nPlease see Point 2 of our general author response for a discussion of alternative initializations and the complexity of spectral initialization."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1021/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1021/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Initialization and Regularization of Factorized Neural Layers", "authorids": ["~Mikhail_Khodak1", "~Neil_A._Tenenholtz1", "~Lester_Mackey1", "~Nicolo_Fusi1"], "authors": ["Mikhail Khodak", "Neil A.

We first address two concerns and then summarize changes made in the revised draft. Note that in addition to the revision we have also uploaded code as supplementary material.\n\n### General author response:      \n1. _Novelty of the contributions_: while the two schemes we study are straightforward, to our knowledge they have not been clearly formalized, especially for training factorized networks from scratch. We believe their simplicity, the significant improvements we achieve on several tasks, and the theoretical foundations we provide will lead to more widespread study and use in future work. This is summarized in the following contributions of our paper:\n   - A formalization of factorized neural layers that covers not only known applications such as low-rank networks but also new settings such as self-taught knowledge distillation and multi-head attention. To our knowledge the latter two have not been previously considered as part of the same framework.\n   - The first mathematical and experimental study of spectral initialization and Frobenius decay, yielding an explanation for why they might improve upon standard approaches. This study also yields the new insight that regular weight-decay implicitly penalizes the nuclear norm of the product.\n   - The first extensive comparison of low-rank and sparsity-based methods for low-memory model training, showing the surprising result that the former is superior in certain settings.\n   - To our knowledge, the first application of these techniques to tensor-factorization approaches, demonstrating their usefulness.\n   - In our estimation, the most convincing existing results for self-taught knowledge distillation. Previous published work in this area (Arora et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2020) considers only networks with accuracies well below ResNet performance on CIFAR-10/100. The absolute improvements (+1% on CIFAR-10/+2% on CIFAR-100) are also much better on ResNet56 than the latest unpublished work (Cao et al., 2020), although direct comparison is difficult because it is unclear what architecture variant they used.\n   - An improved regularization scheme for multi-head attention and a demonstration of how to apply Frobenius decay to \u201cdecoupled weight-decay\u201d optimizers (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019).\n2. _Simpler, SVD-free alternatives to spectral initialization_: we agree that it would be interesting to study alternative initializations, with the caveat that in the low-rank case one cannot obtain a factorization whose product is i.i.d. Gaussian without sacrificing independence, since an i.i.d. Gaussian ensemble is full-rank with probability 1. We thus must find other reasonable criteria, such as the approximation guarantee of SVD. Furthermore, we believe that spectral initialization can itself be viewed as a simple approach, as it is hyperparameter-free and can be computed on a CPU. In our experiments the single SVD step is a negligible fraction of the total training time, including on fairly large models such as BERT-Large and WideResNet28-10.\n\n### Changes in the revision:\n1. Additional plots (Figure 1, right; Figure 2, center and right) to address experimental questions by AnonReviewer3 and AnonReviewer4.  \n2. Additional discussion in Section 2 to address clarity questions by AnonReviewer1 and AnonReviewer4.  \n3. Conclusion (Section 7) to discuss points raised by AnonReviewer3.  \n4. Changes to Table 2 numbers to correct the results for the unfactorized WideResNet28-10 baseline, originally computed without weight-decay.  \n5. Changes to Table 3 numbers to report final test accuracy rather than best test accuracy; differences between methods are largely preserved.\n6. Minor fixes and additional details added to the Appendix.

One immediate question would be why such a prior is a good assumption in general? [\u2026] 'If Gaussian prior is necessary for the parameters, SI+FD is the way for training.\"\u201d_  \nThank you for pointing this out. We agree that in general the Gaussian prior might not be a good assumption, and that its success in our experiments may be because it has been shown to be effective for training unfactorized models, thus making it reasonable to enforce it in the factorized case. However, if a different prior---implemented via some initialization distribution and some regularization term---is used in the unfactorized case, we believe our results suggest to (1) initialize using SVD on the full-rank matrix initialized with the same distribution and (2) applying the same regularization term on the recomposed matrix rather than the individual factors. So this would still be SI but the FD would be replaced by a different type of regularization. We have added a note about this in the revision (Section 7).  \n   - _\u201cFrom VGG experiment (Table 1), one can conclude that specific initialization is not an important factor in training.\u201d_  \nEven in the case of VGG, SI+FD improves upon FD alone on two of the three datasets. However, perhaps its more limited effect here does suggest that a different initialization could lead to further improvements.  \n   - _\u201cProbably, for other simpler initializations for U and V (e.g., U and random Rademacher and V random normal, or even one of them being some truncated identity matrix) the FD will work too.\u201d_  \nYes, we do not have strong evidence that FD always requires SI to work well; in fact FD works well without it for the self-taught distillation experiments. Please also see Point 2 of our general author response for a discussion of alternative initializations.  \n\n2. _\u201cFigure 1 shows the bound in equation (2) is tight for the compression. Is there any similar result for the distillation (i.e., r>max(m,n))?\u201d_  \nThank you asking about this \u2013 we checked and found that the bound is indeed tight for the distillation case as well, suggesting that weight-decay is penalizing the nuclear norm across all ranks. We have included this result in the revision (Figure 1, right).  \n\n3. _\u201cHow to extend SI [\u2026] for d>0?.\u201d_  \nFor deeper factorizations one can initialize the inner matrices M to be the identity (or a small perturbation). This keeps the distribution of the recomposed matrix the same. However, note that we only used d>0 in our self-taught distillation experiments, where we did not use SI since it is not clear how to apply it when the factorization is over-complete.  \n\n- _\u201cThere are a few minor points/typos that the paper can be improved on.\u201d_  \nThank you, both are fixed in the revision."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1021/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1021/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Initialization and Regularization of Factorized Neural Layers", "authorids": ["~Mikhail_Khodak1", "~Neil_A._Tenenholtz1", "~Lester_Mackey1", "~Nicolo_Fusi1"], "authors": ["Mikhail Khodak", "Neil A.

[\u2026] Can the authors add an experiment to show how different factorization with respect to ranks affects the performance?\u201d_  \nNote that the experiments where we report performance as a function of compression rate or parameter count (e.g. Tables 1 and 2) effectively demonstrate the effect of rank on performance since the compression/parameter count is directly determined by varying the rank of the weight-matrices. However, in the revision we have added a plot (Figure 2, center and right) demonstrating the performance of ResNet as a function of the rank, showing that FD improves upon regular weight-decay consistently in both the low-rank and over-complete case (note that SI does not apply in the latter case).  \n\n- _\u201c[T]here are no theoretical results shown that take the rank into consideration. [\u2026]  [Can the authors] give a theoretical result explaining how the rank relates to the improvement of the learning model?\u201d_  \nIn the low-rank case, standard learning theory suggests that reducing the size of the model class (e.g. by lowering the rank) can improve generalization error. There also exist modern generalization error bounds that improve with lower stable rank (and thus also rank since stable rank <= rank), c.f. Neyshabur et al.  (2018). Thus, since test error = training error + generalization error, the focus of our analysis is on improving the optimization of low-rank models in order the make the training error small, since these existing results already suggest that the generalization error will be small. We have slightly expanded upon this discussion in the revision (Section 2.1).

The authors proposed spectral initialization, that is to initialize the factorized matrices using the SVD of the un-factorized matrix. The authors also proposed Frobenius decay that is to regularize the Frobenius norm of the product of the factorized weight matrices. The motivation is to simulate the routines for non-decomposed counterparts. The authors empirically showed the effectiveness of spectral initialization and Frobenius decay in different applications: compressed model training, knowledge distillation, and multi-head self-training. \n\nI think it\u2019s important to study the initialization and regularization for factorized neural networks. A priori, it needs different initialization and regularization methods due to different architecture compared with its non-decomposed counter-part. This paper gave very simple and natural solutions and was able to show its effectiveness in experiments. \n\nI also have some questions as below:\n1. In the experiments in section 5 (knowledge distillation), default initialization is used instead of spectral initialization. I wonder if SI leads to a bad performance here. If that\u2019s the case, it requires more explanation of why SI fails in this setting.\n2. In Figure 1, it seems FD is a stronger regularizer compared with default weight decay. It seems if the regularization coefficient is carefully tuned for each regularizer, the benefits of FD is actually not very significant. Also, what\u2019s \"no decay (normalized)\"?\n3. In section 2, the definition of the factorized CNN is not very clear to me. It might be good to give more detailed definitions here. \n4. Spectral initialization requires computing SVD of the weight matrix. If the matrix dimension is high, this step can be very time-consuming. I wonder if there is any more efficient way to construct the factorized matrices so that their product is still as i.i.d. Gaussian matrix. Because we don't need to compute the SVD for an arbitrary matrix, what we need is only to make sure that the product of the factorized matrixes is distributed as i.i.d. Gaussian.

The experimental results are very encouraging since good improvements are shown with popular datasets. Also, the paper covers compression using ideas related to the state of the art tensor factorization methods.\n\nThe most important component in learning with factorization methods is specifying the appropriate rank of matrices and tensors. When using factorization methods problems such as matrix/tensor completion, the performance will strongly depend on the rank. It is not clear how the rank of weight matrices would affect the performance of the deep learning model. This paper does not address this issue. Furthermore, there are no theoretical results shown that take the rank into consideration. Can the authors add an experiment to show how different factorization with respect to ranks affects the performance?

It focused on the two known techniques, spectral initialization (SI) and Frobenius decay (FD) (i.e., regularize the weight $W$ rather than the factorized terms $U$, $V$, and $M_i$'s), to initialize and regularize such layers for training.\nFrom the technical point of view, the paper is not novel, however, its strength is motivating the need for SI & FD, and providing various empirical studies in different applications such as model compression and self-taught distillation.\nStrengths:\n1. The paper is generally well-written and clear. The majority of claims are either cited appropriately or shown via extensive simulations.\n2. Good motivations, supported by simulations (Figures 1, 2) and claim 3.1\n3. Extensive simulations for different tasks: compressed model training, knowledge distillation, and multi-head attention, in different areas computer vision, question-answering, transformer training, and BERT.\n\nWeaknesses:\nThe paper can be seen as merely applying known methods to different areas and observing its performance. It lefts many questions unanswered and raises some other concerns;\n1. SI initialization is reasonable when training a compressed model from a \"pre-trained\" model since the decomposition error is minimized $W\\approx UV^T$. However, when training from scratch, to my understanding, the method first generates a normal $W\\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 I)$, and uses SVD to find $U$ and $V$. SI + FD can be interpreted as assuming a Gaussian prior on $W$ and enforcing that prior on $W$ during training. One immediate question would be why such a prior is a good assumption in general? From VGG experiment (Table 1), one can conclude that specific initialization is not an important factor in training. Probably, for other simpler initializations for $U$ and $V$ (e.g., $U$ and random Rademacher and $V$ random normal, or even one of them being some truncated identity matrix) the FD will work too. The claims can be interpreted as 'If Gaussian prior is necessary for the parameters, SI+FD is the way for training.\"\n2. Figure 1 shows the bound in equation (2) is tight for the compression. Is there any similar result for the distillation (i.e., $r>max(m,n)$)?\n3. How to extend SI to have factorization $W=U(\\Pi_{i=1}^d M_i)V^T$ for $d>0$?\n\n\nThere are a few minor points/typos that the paper can be improved on:\n- The RHS equality in equation (2) is not trivial. It needs a proper reference or proof.\n- In Table 1, Dynamic Sparsity for CIFAR100 at compression 0.02 performs better than SI&FD. The bold text in the table incorrectly implies that SI&FD is better.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1021/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1021/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Initialization and Regularization of Factorized Neural Layers", "authorids": ["~Mikhail_Khodak1", "~Neil_A._Tenenholtz1", "~Lester_Mackey1", "~Nicolo_Fusi1"], "authors": ["Mikhail Khodak", "Neil A.
