In response to the comments raised in the reviews, we have modified Figures 3, 5, and 6 in the main text to more clearly convey their messages. We have also performed the following additional numerical experiments and added the results to the Appendix:\n\n1. We reran and timed all 42 experiments in Table 1 for 40 epochs with and without spectral normalization to clearly illustrate the difference in training time when using our proposed spectral normalization method (Appendix Table 2). We see that the training time with our proposed method is comparable, often being roughly the same and in the worst case taking 1.84 times as long.\n\n2. We provide an extensive comparison of our spectral normalization method for convolutional layers to that proposed by Miyato et al. (2018) in Appendix A.1. We provide numerical evidence that our method properly controls the spectral norm of convolution layers through figures and the estimated spectral norms of the layers post-training. The proposed normalization scheme also results in better generalization performance (Figure 10). We also compare the runtimes of architectures trained using our spectral normalization method versus Miyato et al.\u2019s spectral normalization method (Table 3) and observe that our method takes only slightly longer, as expected.\n\n3. We empirically compare spectral normalization to other common regularization techniques for deep neural nets (DNNs): batch normalization, weight decay, and dropout. We see that spectral normalization achieves the best generalization performance in adversarial training settings. The results are provided in Appendix A.2.\n\nWe have also made the appropriate modifications in the main text and cited relevant works raised by the reviewers.

Here is our point-to-point response to the comments and questions raised in the review:\n\n1. \u201cIt is unclear to me whether the \"efficient method for SN in convolutional nets\" is more efficient than the power iteration algorithm employed in previous work, such as Miyato et al. 2018, which also used SN in conv nets with different strides. There is no direct comparison of performance.\u201d\n\nWe do not claim that our method is more efficient than Miyato et al.\u2019s method, which uses the spectral norm of the convolution kernel matrix to approximate the spectral norm of the convolution operation. In fact, our proposed method is computationally more expensive than their approximate scheme because each power iteration in our method requires a conv/deconv operation rather than a simple division used by Miyato et al.\u2019s. \n\nWe introduce our new spectral normalization scheme for convolutional layers because there exist examples where the true spectral norm of a convolution operation can be arbitrarily larger than Miyato et al.\u2019s approximation. Therefore, Miyato et al.\u2019s normalization scheme is not guaranteed to control the spectral norm of convolutional layers which is critical for controlling a DNN\u2019s generalization performance (please see our generalization bounds in Section 3). To further support our argument, we performed additional experiments demonstrating how our proposed method better controls the spectral norm of convolution layers, resulting in better generalization and test performance. The results are presented in Appendix A.1. Furthermore, we run several experiments to show that our method is not significantly slower than Miyato et al.\u2019s method, and we report the results in Appendix A.1, Table 3. \n\n2. \u201cFig. 3 needs more explanation. The horizontal axes are unlabelled, and \"margin normalization\" is confusing\u201d\n\nWe relabel the axes and add a more thorough explanation in the caption. We note that the text explaining Figure 3 mentions how the margin normalization is performed (paragraph 3 in section 5.1): the margin normalization factor is exactly the capacity norm \\Phi described in Theorems 1-4. We clarify that we divide the obtained margins by the values of \\Phi estimated on the dataset.\n\n3. \u201cThe epsilons in Fig. 5 have very different scales (0 - 0.5 vs. 0 - 5). Are these relevant to the specific algorithms and why?\u201d \n\nYes, the epsilons are chosen to be different depending on whether we are looking at norm_inf attacks or norm_2 attacks. This is because the two norms can behave very differently in adversarial attack experiments. For example, a norm_inf attack of 0.5 implies that all pixels can be changed by 0.5. On the other hand, a norm_2 attack of 0.5 means the overall Euclidean norm of perturbation across all pixels is bounded by 0.5, resulting in a much less powerful attack. Based on this comment, we update the plots with the same attack-norm to have the same scale.\n\n4. \"Section 5.3 (Fig. 6) is the part most relevant to the generalisation problem. However, the results are unconvincing: only the results for epsilon = 0.1 are shown, and even so the advantage is marginal.\" \n\nWe redo the visualization in Figure 6 to make the gains provided by SN clearer. We see that using SN can improve the test performance by over 12% for some FGM, PGM, and WRM cases.\n\n5. \"The baseline models did not use other almost standard regularisation techniques (weight decay, dropout, batch-norm). It is thus unclear whether the advantage can be maintained after applying these standard regularisers.\"\n\nWe did not originally discuss weight decay, dropout, and batch normalization as none of these methods were motivated by the theory we introduced in section 3. However, due to the reviewers\u2019 concern in the updated draft we compare spectrally-normalized networks to networks with the same architecture except with weight decay, dropout, or batch norm in Appendix A.2. In our experiments, the SN-regularized network still performs better in terms of test accuracy.

Using spectral regularization to improve robustness is not new, but it's interesting to combine spectral regularization and adversarial training. Experimental results show significant improvement over vanilla adversarial training. \n\nThe paper is nicely written and the experimental results are quite strong and comprehensive. I really like the paper but I have two questions about the results: \n\n1. The numbers reported in Figure 5 do not match with the performance of adversarial training in previous paper. In PGM L_inf adversarial training/attack (column 3 of Figure 5), the prediction accuracy is roughly 50% under 0.1 infinity norm perturbation. However, previous papers (e.g., \"Obfuscated Gradients Give a False Sense of Security\") reported 55% accuracy under 0.031 infinity norm perturbation. I wonder why the numbers are so different. \n\nMaybe it's because of different scales? Previous works usually scale each pixel to [0,1] or [-1,1], maybe the authors use the [0, 255] scale? But 0.1/255 will be much smaller than 0.031. \n\nAnother factor might be the model structure. If Alexnet has much lower accuracy, it's probably worthwhile to conduct experiments on the same structure with previous works (Madry et al and Athalye et al) to make the conclusion more clear. \n\n2. What's the training time of the proposed method compared with vanilla adversarial training? \n\n3.

Regarding your comments:\n\n1) References [1] and [2] propose standard ERM training while regularizing the Lipschitz constant to improve robustness of the trained network against future adversarial attacks. On the other hand, the main concern of our work is the lack of generalizability in *adversarial* training settings, e.g. FGM and PGM training, which can be significantly worse than in the ERM case as demonstrated by Schmidt et al. (2018). This observation is further supported by the generalization bounds in Theorems 1-4, which motivate the regularization of spectral norms. While there exist multiple approaches for regularizing the Lipschitz constant, we specifically propose applying spectral normalization because this allows us to directly enforce our adversarial generalization bounds.\n\n2) Thank you for bringing the recent NIPS work [3] to our attention. We note that while the two iterative approaches for computing a convolution layer\u2019s spectral norm both yield the same result, the implementations are different. [3]\u2019s computation of spectral norm requires computing the gradient of the Euclidean norm of the convolution operation. Ours leverages the deconvolution operation, which circumvents needing to take the gradient.\n\n3) We observed in several experiments (e.g. for training Inception over CIFAR10) that batch normalization helps with training speed but does not offer a considerable improvement in adversarial test accuracy over the no-regularization case.

It backs to [1] and [2] showed enhanced performance on both clean and adversarial examples. The main difference seems you used normalization instead of regularization. So I would like authors to clarify the advantages to use normalization.\n\n2. The method to calculate the spectral norm of convolution is already proposed by a recent NIPS paper in a more generalized form [3].\n\n3. Removing standard regularization techniques such as dropout and batch-normalization may degrade the baseline performance. It will be helpful if experiments with dropout and batch-normalization are available.
