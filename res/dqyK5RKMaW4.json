I believe that the representation of the search space should be regarded as a central piece since it is a determining factor for the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm. However, I don't think it is sufficiently discussed in the current paper. I think a convincing discussion (through rigorous analysis or extensive experiments) of the representation and the connection to the optimization algorithm is needed to present a strong case for the proposed method. \n\n> A2\nSW layers are more flexible but only to certain degrees. For example, for a CNN used in image classification, the characteristics of an early layer vs. a late layer are very different. It is infeasible to assume that CNN layers can be arbitrarily adapted to fit hardware optimization. As a result, to show the method applies to the overall model, it is important to showcase the proposed method can optimize a wide range of layer configurations and show consistent improvement, and also show overall improvement on the model level.

Provided these parameters, constrained bayesian optimization is a good fit for the problem. RL here is perhaps less ideal, the hardware domain is not data-rich and RL is not generally considered to be sample efficient. Evolutionary algorithms also are an interesting direction. We do not mean to suggest that bayesian optimization is the only approach, and hope that future work will continue developing optimization algorithms.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper639/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper639/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "LEARNED HARDWARE/SOFTWARE CO-DESIGN OF NEURAL ACCELERATORS", "authorids": ["~Zhan_Shi3", "chirag.sakhuja@utexas.edu", "~Milad_Hashemi1", "~Kevin_Swersky1", "~Calvin_Lin1"], "authors": ["Zhan Shi", "Chirag Sakhuja", "Milad Hashemi", "Kevin Swersky", "Calvin Lin"], "keywords": ["deep learning accelerator", "Bayesian optimization", "design space exploration", "hardware-software co-design"], "abstract": "The use of deep learning has grown at an exponential rate, giving rise to numerous specialized hardware and software systems for deep learning.

Please see our responses below.\n\n**Q1**: Representation and distance in the search space\n\n**A1**: This is an extremely good question and key to allowing the model to effectively optimize over the design space. The representation that we used is not the only one that could but used, however it is the most effective that we\u2019ve found so far. We have tried a few other approaches to defining distance in this space. The challenge is that our constraints are highly nonlinear, which makes representations difficult. Initially, we applied log transformations to the tiling factor to transform the nonlinear constraints to linear. The log space works fine for numbers like 64 whose factors are all a power of a number, but fails for arbitrary numbers like 56. Taking a deeper look, we found that our GP suffers greatly from the transformed space where the distance is skewed. Our current representation sticks to the original values of the parameters, and we further enhance the GP with features that reveal high-level semantics, such as buffer and compute usage. To clarify the representation that we\u2019ve used, we added example vectors of hardware/software parameters to the appendix (Figures 16 & 17 respectively).\n\n**Q2**: Layer-wise and model-wise optimization\n\n**A2**: As software optimization is more flexible, we optimize the software for each layer but optimize the hardware for each model. Our evaluation shows model-level improvements. We will clarify this.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper639/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper639/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "LEARNED HARDWARE/SOFTWARE CO-DESIGN OF NEURAL ACCELERATORS", "authorids": ["~Zhan_Shi3", "chirag.sakhuja@utexas.edu", "~Milad_Hashemi1", "~Kevin_Swersky1", "~Calvin_Lin1"], "authors": ["Zhan Shi", "Chirag Sakhuja", "Milad Hashemi", "Kevin Swersky", "Calvin Lin"], "keywords": ["deep learning accelerator", "Bayesian optimization", "design space exploration", "hardware-software co-design"], "abstract": "The use of deep learning has grown at an exponential rate, giving rise to numerous specialized hardware and software systems for deep learning.

We viewed NAS as disjoint to our work originally, but will add citations and a discussion to clarify.\n\nThe second is software compiler optimizations (SCO) (like TVM [6]), which considers the optimal software mappings, such as loop permutations and tiling, to apply to a given neural network.\n\nThe third is hardware architecture search (HAS), which governs the optimal hardware to use provided a particular neural architecture and software optimization. Optimization parameters often include buffer sizes and PE layout.\n\nOriginally, each of these problems were studied independently, but as you\u2019ve pointed out, recent research has started to optimize pairs of categories jointly. For example, EDD [1] co-optimizes NAS and SCO on embedded systems, but doesn\u2019t consider HAS. The SCO parameters they consider are equivalent to our software evaluation.  [2,3,4,5] all co-optimize NAS and HAS and couple SCO with HAS. They either fix the compiler optimizations [2, 4, 5] or tie the compiler optimizations (e.g. dataflows) to the hardware search [3]. This unified space of NASAIC [3] simplifies the search problem, but the compiler optimizations cannot be customized to different workloads once the hardware is synthesized.\n\nIn our work, we propose jointly optimizing the system stack (HAS + SCO) for popular variants of neural networks.  Timeloop [7] shows that it is necessary to optimize the software mapping (SCO) for the hardware architecture to fully exploit the benefits of the hardware. Because hardware is much more costly to evaluate than compiler optimizations, we propose a novel nested search to decouple SCO from HAS, to 1) minimize expensive hardware generation, and 2) optimize hardware for the entire model but still optimize software mappings for each layer. \n\nWe will clarify the novelty claim to reflect this discussion.\n\n[6] Chen, Tianqi, et al. \"TVM: An automated end-to-end optimizing compiler for deep learning.\" 13th {USENIX} Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI) 2018. \u201cLearning to optimize tensor programs.\" In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2018\n[7] Parashar, Angshuman, et al. \"Timeloop: A systematic approach to dnn accelerator evaluation.\" International symposium on performance analysis of systems and software (ISPASS).

The method is based on a two-level Bayesian optimization (BO), with each BO optimizing the code mapping and hardware configuration, respectively. The design space of both code mapping and hardware configuration contains many complex constraints, some of which remains unknown until running expensive simulation. The obvious constraints are handled using rejection sampling and the unknown constraints are modeled by a Baysian classifier. This method is validated by experiments to optimize several network layers (ResNet, DQN, MLP, transformer) and achieves better performance than baselines.\n\nStrength of the paper: this paper aims at solving a meaningful problem: SW/HW co-design of code mapping and neural accelerators. It adopts a simple optimization method (BO), and according to the experiments, it achieves good performance gain compared with manual design and other baselines methods. \n\nWhat is unclear to me: I am not familiar with the literature around code-mapping and hardware configuration co-design, so I don't have enough context to judge if the proposed method is novel, compared with previous methods.\n\nWeaknesses of the paper: \n1/ this paper spends a lot of texts explaining the basics of BO, but what's missing to me is the representation of software design-points and hardware configurations. The usage of BO is based on the assumption that we have a good representation of the design space where the distance of each design point is clearly defined. For example, for two nested for-loop with different orders, how they are represented and what's the distance between the two representation? Is the representation canonical? What's the meaning of distance in the representation space? Without understanding these questions, it is difficult for me to see whether BO is the right optimization method for this. \n2/ In the experiment section, the method is only used to optimize one layer of a network, however, it is not clear how general this is as people usually care about the overall performance of a network or even a wide variety of networks. The experiments did not show if the proposed method is effective or general enough to optimize the overall performance. \n\nI hope authors can address the concerns.

Given a target NN model, it first generates hardware configuration candidates. Then for each hardware candidate, it generates corresponding mapping candidates of each NN layer. These candidates are generated with explicit constraints, i.e., it will randomly sample hardware/mapping until it obtains the desired number of feasible candidates. The evaluated EDP is fed into the Bayesian optimizer of mapping and hardware separately in sequential. The main contribution of this paper is a principled and systematic pipeline for co-searching the hardware parameters and mappings. Results are shown on the task of ResNet, DQN, MLP, and Transformer on Eyeriss architecture. It improves EDP by 16% to 40%.\n\n \nPros: \n\n+ The solution framework for co-searching hardware parameters and software mappings is neat. \n\n+ The results section is well structured.  It's nice to see the comparison between the proposed method and TVM; and the ablation study on whether to co-search hardware and software. \n\n\nConcerns: \n\n- The key concern about the paper is the lack of novelty.

Below are some questions and concerns:\n\n1:  the representation of software basically considers loop ordering, loop tiling, and computational parallelism, while the hardware representation is focused on available hardware resource and dataflow configuration. However, the biggest bottleneck of DNN processing actually comes from the main memory or large buffers.
