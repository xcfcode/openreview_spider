Using the gradients proposed by the model, the authors propose to add two additional terms in the loss function for critic training in DDPG, where these to terms corresponding to the prediction error of $\\nabla_{a} Q(s,a)$ and $\\nabla_b Q(s,a)$, respectively. However, my main concern is that the form of gradient given in equation (2) might contains an error.\n\n1. Equation (2). Note that in DDPG, the action is given by a deterministic policy. Thus, we have $a_t = \\pi(s_t)$ for all $t\\geq 0$. For critic estimation, it seems you are basing on the Bellman equation \n$ Q(s,a) = r(s,a) + Q(s', \\pi(s'))$, where $s'$ is the next state following $(s,a)$. Then, it seems that Equation (2) is obtained by taking gradient with respect to $(s,a)$. However, I cannot understand what $\\nabla_{\\pi} Q$ stands for. If it is $\\nabla_a Q(s_{i+1}, a_{i+1}) \\cdot \\nabla_s \\pi(s_{i+1}) $, then that makes sense. \n\n2. Based on the experiments, it seems that the proposed method does not always outperform MPC or DDPG, even in a small-scale control problem Mountaincar. Moreover, it seems that the performance is similar to that of the DDPG. \n\n3. Here the model-based gradient in equation (2) is defined by only unroll one-step forward by going from $s_i, a_i$ to $s_{i+1}$. It would be interesting to see how the number of unroll steps affect the algorithm, which is a gradient version of TD($\\lambda$).\n\n4.

We have implemented a variant of SAC and reported the results in five examples in Section A.2 of the updated manuscript. Our experiments showed that the proposed method helped improve the performance of the original SAC in three examples and obtained similar performance in the other two.\n\n== Q function approximation ==\nThe Q network does not fit the ground-truth closely because 1) The RL algorithm only explored and used a very small part of the whole domain of ($s$, $a$) for fitting. Specifically, since samples were extracted from perturbing $\\pi$, most of them clustered around the curve $(s, \\pi(s))$; 2) Due to the design of this problem, regions far away from the initial ($s=-0.5$) and final ($s=0$) positions of the mass point are rarely visited during training and not needed in the final solution. Due to these two reasons, the Q network attempted to fit the ground-truth Q well only in the banded region between $s=-0.5$ and $s=0$, and it can be observed that adding weighted loss on gradient differences helped the Q network converge to the ground-truth in this banded area faster.\n\n== Slower convergence when both weights are available ==\nDue to the empirical nature of our method, we are not able to justify this phenomenon on a theoretical basis. We suspect it might be related to the fact that the Q function in this example has different sensitivity to its two inputs $s$ and $a$. In particular, if we slice the ground-truth Q surface at a given $s$, the resulting $Q-a$ curve is very flat, so more gradient information about $\\partial Q/\\partial a$ might be unnecessary and not helpful for fitting it well.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2014/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2014/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["taodu@csail.mit.edu", "l-yf16@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn", "jiex@csail.mit.edu", "aespielberg@csail.mit.edu", "walker.kui.wu@gmail.com", "rus@csail.mit.edu", "wojciech@csail.mit.edu"], "title": "D3PG: Deep Differentiable Deterministic Policy Gradients", "authors": ["Tao Du", "Yunfei Li", "Jie Xu", "Andrew Spielberg", "Kui Wu", "Daniela Rus", "Wojciech Matusik"], "pdf": "/pdf/1d8ccb1fd018eb5c309dc33cdbe31a5e8d765508.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a novel method that leverages the gradients from differentiable simulators to improve the performance of RL for robotics control", "abstract": "Over the last decade, two competing control strategies have emerged for solving complex control tasks with high efficacy.

We agree that such an example would highlight the shortcomings of estimating only the Q function and the benefit of training with simulation gradients whenever they are available. We will consider including this argument in a stronger motivating example and adding a similar figure in the manuscript.\n\nWe agree comparing other norms is an interesting idea and norms like L1 and cosine would both be interesting to try.  For now, we have tested the cosine norm on all of our examples.  For some of our examples (the Acrobot and MountainCar), we found that the cosine norm dominates the L2 norm.  For the CartPoleSwingUp, the L2 norm still dominates.  For the remaining problems, both norms work approximately equally well. We will include these quantitative results in the revised manuscript. We stress that in all cases, both regularization variants achieve performance similar to or better than pure DDPG.  It is difficult to give a precise theoretical reason as to why one norm outperforms the other for certain problems, however, we can gladly report extensive empirical findings in a final version of the manuscript.\n\nSimulator gradients are unfortunately difficult to use to directly improve exploration since they always point in a greedy direction.  In the classic exploration/exploitation tradeoff, the gradient provides exploitation.  It is possible that one could devise an algorithm that may improve exploration by sampling updates which deviate from the deterministic gradient (e.g. a gradient-based variant of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.01905.pdf).

But for now, we just want to make a quick clarification on Equation (2) and justify our gradient computation:\n\nYou are correct that we base our computation on the Bellman equation. To be precise, we use $\\hat{Q}(s_i,a_i)=r(s_i,a_i,s_{i+1})+\\gamma Q'(s_{i+1},\\pi'(s_{i+1}))$. This is line 9 in Algorithm 1 in our paper, and it is also consistent with line 12 in Algorithm 1 in the original DDPG paper.\n\nFor brevity, in Equation (2) we use the neural network names to refer to its output value. So $\\pi'$ in Equation (2) stands for $\\pi'(s_{i+1})$ and $\\nabla_{\\pi'}Q'$ in Equation (2) stands for:\n$$\n\\nabla_aQ'(s,a)|_{s=s_{i+1},a=\\pi'(s_{i+1})}\n$$\nYou can also check the correctness of Equation (2) by comparing it to the computation graph in Figure 1, where the upper right $\\mu$ stands for $\\pi'(s_{i+1})$. In Figure 1, $\\nabla_{\\pi'}Q'$ corresponds to the gradient back-propagated along the arrow $\\mu\\rightarrow Q'$ (\"if we change $\\mu$, how much will $Q'$ change?\"). Similarly, the term $\\nabla_{s_{i+1}}\\pi'$ after $\\nabla_{\\pi'}Q'$ in Equation (2) corresponds to the arrow $s_{i+1}\\rightarrow\\mu$ (\"if we change $s_{i+1}$, how much will $\\mu$ change?\").\n\nPutting them together, the product $\\nabla_{\\pi'}Q'\\cdot \\nabla_{s_{i+1}}\\pi'$ in Equation (2) back-propagates the gradient along the path $s_{i+1}\\rightarrow\\mu\\rightarrow Q'$ in Figure 1. Similarly, the term $\\nabla_{s_{i+1}}Q'$ in Equation (2) corresponds to the arrow $s_{i+1}\\rightarrow Q'$ in Figure 1, and the sum $(\\nabla_{s_{i+1}}Q'+\\nabla_{\\pi'}Q'\\cdot \\nabla_{s_{i+1}}\\pi')$ computes the total derivative of $Q'$ with respect to $s_{i+1}$. The other terms in Equation (2) can be verified in the same way.\n\nWe hope this explanation can clear your concern with the correctness of Equation (2).

It is more widely applicable than traditional model-based approaches like MPC, since it doesn't require differentiable models of the dynamics. However, in many environments, dynamics are differentiable. This paper proposes a method for extending DDPG to exploit simulator gradients. In particular, the Bellman error objective (which is defined in terms of critic values) used for training the critic is augmented with additional terms defined in terms of gradients of the critic. This leads to faster convergence in practice on a range of benchmarks.\n\n==Overall Assessment==\n\nI recommend acceptance. The paper's contribution is well-motivated, works reasonably well, and is relatively easy to implement.\n\n==Comments==\n\nIt would be good to add an argument explaining to readers that accurately estimating Q using Q_\\phi does not mean that the gradients of Q_\\phi will be good approximations of the true gradients of Q. I found Fig 1 of arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07107.pdf informative.\n\nCan you justify the choice of euclidean norm in line 10? In terms of the critic helping teach the actor, the direction of the gradient may be more important than the norm. What if you used cosine sim?\n\nYou argue that DRL is better than MPC because DRL explores better. Could you use the simulator gradients somehow to improve exploration?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2014/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2014/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["taodu@csail.mit.edu", "l-yf16@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn", "jiex@csail.mit.edu", "aespielberg@csail.mit.edu", "walker.kui.wu@gmail.com", "rus@csail.mit.edu", "wojciech@csail.mit.edu"], "title": "D3PG: Deep Differentiable Deterministic Policy Gradients", "authors": ["Tao Du", "Yunfei Li", "Jie Xu", "Andrew Spielberg", "Kui Wu", "Daniela Rus", "Wojciech Matusik"], "pdf": "/pdf/1d8ccb1fd018eb5c309dc33cdbe31a5e8d765508.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a novel method that leverages the gradients from differentiable simulators to improve the performance of RL for robotics control", "abstract": "Over the last decade, two competing control strategies have emerged for solving complex control tasks with high efficacy.
