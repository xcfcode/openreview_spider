What is the memory size used in all the three tasks?\n\nWe used memory of half a million.\n\n2. For the synthetic task, what is the size of the training data?\n\nIt is 40K, so each from the 16K random examples is there 2 or 3 times.\n\n3. In the synthetic task, the big performance gap between baseline extended neural GPU with and without memory module is surprising. It would be interesting if authors can also report results on seq2seq+attention with and without memory module.\n\nWe trained a 2-layer 256-unit LSTM seq2seq with attention on this task. It overfits the data, memorizing the traning set but with < 1% accuracy on the test set. The same model with a memory module does much better, accuracy is > 30%. We will train a few more models to see how lower sizes affect the results. But from our experience with the Extended Neural GPU models on this task, we'd expect the small models to under-fit and not get good results. We'll report a more thorough model-size-vs-accuracy in the final version. In all cases, the models with memory module get better results.\n\n4. Last few lines in Translation section is not clear. What do you mean by providing the whole test context? Model sees all the test sentences and translations and then asked to translate the same?\n\nThis part was re-written to clarify. Yes - the model sees all test sentences, but cannot update its weights, only memory, and is then asked to translate the same. We use it only to assess the headroom that the memory can bring.\n\n5.
