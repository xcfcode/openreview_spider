The proposed method consists of (1) pseudo-labeled data selection based on prediction confidence for efficient training and (2) a data augmentation method named mixconf, which is a modification of mixup. \n\nOverall, the paper is well written, but i can't find much novelty of the proposed method. For the part (1), data selection for semi-supervised learning is a quite well-known idea. For the part (2),  It's just a very simple and obvious modification of the existing data augmentation method (which may lead to marginal performance improvement. it's effectiveness should be additionally demonstrated using other benchmark datasets).\n\nAlso I think the authors should perform more experimental investigations to support their idea. For example,\n1) The main assumption the authors made is \"the loss calculated with incorrect labels tends to sensitivey increase when the data is augmented\". I think they can give examples about that on the experimented datasets to show that their assumption is more likely. \n2) it seems the proposed method involves so many hyperparameters and it seems its outcome is sensitive to the settings of the hyperparameters, while how they tuned the hyperparameters is unclear, hidden at the back. Table 2 and Figure 4 (results on CIFAR-10 dataset) show that the performance of the proposed method is considerably affected by the hyperparameters. One thing they must do is to carry out ablation study on the SVHN dataset and if possible, other new datasets.\n3) For semi-supervised learning, there is no reason to prefer pseudo-labeling approach to others (e.g. semi-supervised VAE, ladder nets). Because the other methods have been very effective in semi-supervised learning, they can be additionally compared with the proposed one.\n4) One benefit of the proposed method the authors mentionedis its computational efficiency (by selecting highly confident pseudo-labeled data). This could be wrong if it involves more training iterations due to the other components of the proposed method (such as training configurations and data augmentation stuffs, etc.). To clearly demonstrate if the proposed method is actually computationally efficient, the authors should provide the comparison of the training time each method required.

This means that I would like some more justifications of why this is a sound method to select items to label. The results of the experiments are also a bit disappointing, as out of two data sets, the provided method seems to give better results on only one data set, albeit one of its advantage is to require less iterations (by a magnitude of 10) than other soft-label based methods to reach similar performances (albeit the practical advantage of such a speed up heavily depends on the time taken by an iteration). \n\nHere are some clarifications that could be helpful to better understand the paper:\n\n* In equations (2) and (3), I did not find the information (in the experimental setting) of how were fixed B_U and B_L, that in turns allow to select n_L and n_U data. A relation between B_U and B_L is given, but that still requires to settle one of the number for n_L (and n_U) to be well defined. \n\n* In equation (4), how is it that the loss is between an instance and a probability distribution over classes? Or is \\tilde{x}^L_{s[i]} the class? \n\n* Section 2: what theoretical argument have we that the proposed approach will provide well-calibrated outputs? The method actually produces a bunch of bi-modal distributions whose posterior density and input density are estimated by non-parametric kernels over two data. Also, it may well be that the average \\lambda_a x_0 + (1-\\lambda_a) x_1 is a non-observable point (in this case, image), hence that it has actually probability zero? The experiments seem to show that it works reasonably well on the three selected data sets (as did MixMatch), but do we have formal arguments indicating that this approach would provide well-calibrated outputs in general? \n\n* Figure 3 and calibration curves: beyond the baseline, all three methods seem to be on par regarding calibration problems, so it is unclear whether MixConf actually brings any water to the mill of semi-supervised learning, data augmentation or calibration? Also, how can we explain that more data actually degrade the calibration results, as one would expect calibration to improve with data? Would it be possible to show calibration curves? \n\n* Semi-supervised learning: basically, the proposed approach consists in two different bricks, the calibration/mixing approach, and the selection/labelling approach. In the comparison with MixMatch, both aspects are changed. What happens when we apply the same selection/labelling approach to MixMatch? It would probably give us the same speed up, but with a different mixing techniques. I guess what I would like to see is an ablation study between the present paper and the MixMatch approach, as right now the real added value of MixConf is unclear to me (both in Figure 3 and in Table 1).  \n\n* There are also some typos remaining (in a small amount), so a final read would probably be helpful. e.g.: \"not that during training\".", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2556/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2556/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Semi-supervised learning by selective training with pseudo labels via confidence estimation", "authorids": ["~Masato_Ishii1"], "authors": ["Masato Ishii"], "keywords": ["semi-supervised learning", "confidence estimation"], "abstract": "We propose a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) method that adopts selective training with pseudo labels.

As we know, the Gaussian kernel is very cost on both memory and time with the number of samples increasing. Hence, how about the overhead of the proposed method? The overhead of the proposed method analysis may be very important to further inspect the proposed method.\n[4] Whether the proposed method is still effective if the number of the labeled training data is very limited.
