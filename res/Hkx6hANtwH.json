The key technique is to construct a type dependency graph and infer the type on top of it. The type dependency graph contains edges specifying hard constraints derived from the static analysis, as well as soft relationships specified by humans. Experiments on type predictions for TypeScript have shown better performance than the previous methods, with or without user specified types. \n\nOverall this paper tackles a nice application of GNN, which is the type prediction problem that utilizes structural information of the code. Also the proposed type dependency graph seems interesting to me. Also the pointer mechanism used for predicting user specified types is a good strategy that advances the previous method. However, I have several concerns below:\n\nAbout formulation:\n1) I\u2019m not sure if the predicted types for individual variable would be very helpful in general. Since the work only cares about individual predictions while no global consistency is enforced, it is somewhat limited. For example, in order to (partially) compile a program, does it require all the variable types to be correct in that part? If so, then the predicted types here might not be that helpful. I\u2019m not sure about this, so any discussion would be appreciated. \n\n\nAbout type dependency graph:\n1) Comparing to previous work (e.g, Allamanis et.al, ICLR 18), it seems the construction of the task specific graph is the major contribution, where the novelty is a bit limited. \n2) The construction of the dependency graph is heuristic. For example, why the three contextual constraints are good? Would there be other good ones? Also why only include such limited set of logical constraints. For example, would expression like (x + y) induce some interesting relationships? Because such hand-crafted graph is lossy (unlike raw source code), all the questions here lead to the concern of such design choices. \n3) The usage of graph is somewhat straightforward to me. For example, although the hard-constraints are there, there\u2019s no such constraints reflected in the prediction. Adding the constraints on the predictions would be more interesting. \n\nAbout experiments:\n1) I think one ablation study I\u2019m most interested in is to simply run GNN on the AST (or simply use Allamanis et.al\u2019s method). This is to verify and support the usage of proposed type dependency graph. \n2) As the authors claimed in Introduction, \u2018plenty of training data is available\u2019. However in experiment only 300 projects are involved. Also it seems that these are not fully annotated, and the \u2018forward type inference functionality from TypeScript\u2019 is required to obtain labels. It would be good to explain such discrepancy. \n3) Continue with 2), as the experiment results shown in Table 2, TS compiler performs poorly. So how would it be possible to train with poor annotations, while generalize much better? Some explanations would be helpful here.\n4) I think only predicting non-polymorphic types is another limitation. Would it be possible to predict structured types? like nested list, or function types with arguments? \n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1373/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1373/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["jiayi@cs.utexas.edu", "maruth@utexas.edu", "gdurrett@cs.utexas.edu", "isil@cs.utexas.edu"], "title": "LambdaNet: Probabilistic Type Inference using Graph Neural Networks", "authors": ["Jiayi Wei", "Maruth Goyal", "Greg Durrett", "Isil Dillig"], "pdf": "/pdf/86657ef3180cce2cdbdc9e6f22aeef474f4d60de.pdf", "abstract": "As gradual typing becomes increasingly popular in languages like Python and TypeScript, there is a growing need to infer type annotations automatically.

By constructing a \"type dependency graph\" that encodes the relationships among variables and appropriately modifying GNNs to the hypergraph setting, the authors show that the good performance improvements can be made.\n\nOverall, this paper is well-written, the experiments are quite convincing and the methods are reasonable and interesting. I believe that there are a few things that need to be clarified within the evaluation, but I would argue that this paper should be accepted.\n\n* It is unclear to me what is the scope of the type dependency graph construction. Is it a whole file? Is it a single function/class? A whole project? \n\n* The DeepTyper paper seems to suggest that it predicts type annotations one function at a time. Does the comparison (in 5.1) use the same granularity as LambdaNet? If for example, LambdaNet looks at whole files, then the comparison is not exact. Could you please clarify? Performing the comparison on equal-sized samples would make sense.\n\n* If my reading of DeepTyper is correct, it processes all identifiers as a single unit. In contrast, this work (correctly, in my opinion), breaks the identifiers into \"word tokens\". This may be an important difference between the two methods. To test this, an ablation where LambdaNet does *not* split the identifiers, would provide a better comparison among the sequential representation of DeepTyper and the type constraint graph of LambdaNet.\n\n* Some comparison with JSNice is missing (Raychev et al. 2015). The DeepTyper paper suggests that the two approaches are somewhat complementary. It would be useful to know how LambdaNet compares to JSNice too.\n\n* There is some literature that suggests that code duplication exists in automatically scraped corpora and that it hurts the evaluation of machine learning models [a,b]. At the very least, the authors should report the percent of duplicates (if any) in their corpus. Another option would be to _not_ evaluate predictions in any duplicated file.\n\n## Secondary question:\n\n* I do not understand why a separate edge is needed for Subtype() and Assign(). Isn't Assign (a,b) == Subype(a,b)?\n\n* The authors correctly exclude the `any` annotations produced by the TypeScript compiler. Do they also exclude any other annotations? For example, functions that do not return a value (i.e. their return value is `void`) would also need to be excluded. What about `object`?\n\n* I would encourage the authors to make the dataset (source code and extracted graphs), and the LambdaNet code public upon acceptance.\n\n## Minor\n\n* Please capitalize GitHub, TypeScript, etc throughout the paper?\n\n* Sec 4: \"we first to compute\" -> \"we first compute\"\n\n\n\n[a] Lopes, Cristina V., et al. \"D\u00e9j\u00e0Vu: a map of code duplicates on GitHub.\" Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages 1.OOPSLA (2017): 84.\n[b] Allamanis, Miltiadis. \"The Adverse Effects of Code Duplication in Machine Learning Models of Code.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.06469 (2018).", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1373/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1373/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["jiayi@cs.utexas.edu", "maruth@utexas.edu", "gdurrett@cs.utexas.edu", "isil@cs.utexas.edu"], "title": "LambdaNet: Probabilistic Type Inference using Graph Neural Networks", "authors": ["Jiayi Wei", "Maruth Goyal", "Greg Durrett", "Isil Dillig"], "pdf": "/pdf/86657ef3180cce2cdbdc9e6f22aeef474f4d60de.pdf", "abstract": "As gradual typing becomes increasingly popular in languages like Python and TypeScript, there is a growing need to infer type annotations automatically.

We have run the suggested experiments and list the results below:\n\n=======\n\u201cA rudimentary comparison with JsNice: As someone with an interest in this area, I still don't know which method is state-of-the-art. I would imagine that the JsNice authors would insist that their method is the best, whereas you would insist that this is LambdaNet. Doing a small test (say 50-100 annotations) on JsNice (similar to DeepTyper) would be good enough for me.\u201d\n\nResults:\nSince JsNice cannot properly handle class definitions and user-defined types, for a meaningful comparison, we compared both tools\u2019 performance on top-level functions randomly sampled from our test set. We filtered out functions whose parameters are not library types and manually ensured that all all the dependency definitions are also included. In this way, we constructed a small benchmark suit consisting of 41 functions. Among the 107 function parameter and return type annotations, LambdaNet correctly predicted 77 of them, while JsNice only got 48 of them right. This rudimentary results suggest that our tool is better than JSNice, even when evaluated only on the places where JsNice is applicable.\n\n=======\n\u201cGiven than you don't filter human annotations, I would like to see a break-down of LambdaNet's performance on (a) Any/void (b) primitive types (c) user-defined types. I believe that this will be useful to understand the extent to which the attention mechanism helps (especially with [c]) and help us disregard Any/void annotations that are deterministically predictable. If possible, comparing these with DeepType's results would be nice (but I don't find it crucial)\u201d\n\nResults:\nThe table below shows a breakdown of LambdaNet\u2019s performance on the top-10 most frequent library types in our test set (the remaining types are omitted). As you can see from this graph, void only consists of a small fraction (< 9%) of all library type annotations, hence it has little effect on the overall library type accuracy. Also, as we mentioned in the evaluation section, we also ignore all \u2018any\u2019 annotations when computing the accuracies.

Due to length limit, we break our responses into two comments. Please see the parts about formulation and type dependency graph below:\n\n=======\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if the predicted types for individual variable would be very helpful in general. Since the work only cares about individual predictions while no global consistency is enforced, it is somewhat limited.\u201d\n\nResponse: We believe that predicted types would still be helpful because the user only needs to focus on parts of the codebase that do not type check (combined with techniques for localizing type checking errors). That said, we are definitely interested in using structured prediction techniques (e.g., structured SVM) to enforce that the predicted types pass the type checker at learning and inference time. However, this aspect is orthogonal to the techniques presented in our submission and brings several new research challenges. \n\n=======\n\u201cFor example, in order to (partially) compile a program, does it require all the variable types to be correct in that part? If so, then the predicted types here might not be that helpful. I\u2019m not sure about this, so any discussion would be appreciated.\u201d\n\nResponse: If the program does not type check, the TypeScript compiler will report a warning but still emit the Javascript program anyway. Thus, mistakes in type error prediction neither affect the compilation process nor cause any additional run-time errors.\n\n=======\n\"Comparing to previous work (e.g, Allamanis et.al, ICLR 18), it seems the construction of the task specific graph is the major contribution, where the novelty is a bit limited.\"\n\nResponse: Our architecture is only related to Allamanis et al. insofar as it is a graph neural network over source code. Most components of our model introduce substantial new elements. First, the type embedding scheme for user-defined types is entirely new, which we believe would also be useful for other tasks involving types (e.g. program language models, code repair, static analysis...). Second, the lack of static type information makes the problem fundamentally different and requires much more sophisticated attention mechanism (in the form of usage hyperedges) to help propagating information between syntactically distant but semantically relevant program elements.\n\n=======\n\u201cThe construction of the dependency graph is heuristic. For example, why the three contextual constraints are good? Would there be other good ones? Also why only include such limited set of logical constraints. For example, would expression like (x + y) induce some interesting relationships? Because such hand-crafted graph is lossy (unlike raw source code), all the questions here lead to the concern of such design choices. \u201d\n\nResponse: The set of logical constraints contains all the hard constraints that a rule-based type inference algorithm would use. But as our ablation studies show, adding extra statistical information via contextual edges can be very helpful. Our choices of contextual edges aim to preserve the statistical hints that are most relevant to make correct type prediction while exclude type-irrelevant aspects of code that are more likely leading to overfitting. In the case of the expression \u201cx+y\u201d, it would be translated into the Call relation \u201c$\\textrm{Call}(N_z,N_+,N_x,N_y)$\u201d asserting that $N_z=N_+(N_x,N_y)$, where $N_x$, $N_y$, and $N_+$ are the nodes corresponding to \u201cx\u201d, \u201cy\u201d, and the library function \u201c+\u201d. And $N_z$ is the node generated for the entire expression. Since $N_+$ is a library node whose embedding vector is fine-tuned during the training process, information can propagate from it into other three nodes via the Call edge and hint the GNN that they are all likely to be of type \u201cnumber\u201d.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1373/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1373/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["jiayi@cs.utexas.edu", "maruth@utexas.edu", "gdurrett@cs.utexas.edu", "isil@cs.utexas.edu"], "title": "LambdaNet: Probabilistic Type Inference using Graph Neural Networks", "authors": ["Jiayi Wei", "Maruth Goyal", "Greg Durrett", "Isil Dillig"], "pdf": "/pdf/86657ef3180cce2cdbdc9e6f22aeef474f4d60de.pdf", "abstract": "As gradual typing becomes increasingly popular in languages like Python and TypeScript, there is a growing need to infer type annotations automatically.

This is to verify and support the usage of proposed type dependency graph.\u201d\n\nResponse: It would be infeasible to apply Allamanis\u2019 architecture in our setting since they make heavy use of type information when constructing the semantic edges. (e.g., if they see \u201ca.f(x)\u201d, since they know the exact type of \u201ca\u201d, they know which method \u201cf\u201d \u201ca.f\u201d is referring to, hence they can directly connect the node for the parameter of the method \u201cf\u201d to the node for the argument \u201cx\u201d). We did not implement a GNN architecture directly runnable on program ASTs, but we did try removing part or all of our semantic edges in our ablation studies, which is as close as we can feasibly get to a direct comparison.\n\n=======\n\u201cAs the authors claimed in Introduction, \u2018plenty of training data is available\u2019. However in experiment only 300 projects are involved. Also it seems that these are not fully annotated, and the \u2018forward type inference functionality from TypeScript\u2019 is required to obtain labels. It would be good to explain such discrepancy.\u201d\n\nResponse: We note that 300 projects already contain 1.2 million lines of Typescript code and hundreds of thousands of labeled type variables to predict. Empirically, we found that the performance of our model was already saturating here; with orders of magnitude more data and a bigger architecture, higher accuracy could possibly be achieved, but this would require significantly more computational resources.\n\n=======\n\u201cas the experiment results shown in Table 2, TS compiler performs poorly. So how would it be possible to train with poor annotations, while generalize much better? Some explanations would be helpful here.\u201d\n\nResponse: Like in many modern programming languages with forward type inference (e.g., Scala, C#, Swift...), a Typescript programmer does not need to annotate every definition in order to fully specify the types of a program. Instead, they only need to annotate some \u201ckey places\u201d (e.g., function parameters and return types, class members) and let the forward inference algorithm to figure out the rest of the types. Therefore, in our training set, we can keep the user annotations on these key places and run the TS compiler to recover these implicitly specified types as additional labels. This is not strictly necessary but can help us get more training signal and accelerate the convergence of training. In our evaluation, the TS compiler no longer has access to the user annotations on those key places (because the goal here is to predict them), hence its forward inference algorithm performs poorly and can only predict \u2018any\u2019 for most places.  \n\n=======\n\u201cI think only predicting non-polymorphic types is another limitation. Would it be possible to predict structured types? like nested list, or function types with arguments?\u201d\n\nResponse: It is possible to modify our architecture to predict structured types like (List<Int>) by making a sequence of predictions over type production rules instead of concrete types. However, in general, predicting polymorphic types also involves dealing with quantified types like $\\forall T.\\ T \\rightarrow T$ (the type signature of the identity function) and bounded polymorphism like $\\forall T <: \\textrm{SomeType}.\\ T \\rightarrow \\textrm{String}$. Properly encoding and predicting such types is an open research problem in its own right, so we leave this extension to future work. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1373/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1373/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["jiayi@cs.utexas.edu", "maruth@utexas.edu", "gdurrett@cs.utexas.edu", "isil@cs.utexas.edu"], "title": "LambdaNet: Probabilistic Type Inference using Graph Neural Networks", "authors": ["Jiayi Wei", "Maruth Goyal", "Greg Durrett", "Isil Dillig"], "pdf": "/pdf/86657ef3180cce2cdbdc9e6f22aeef474f4d60de.pdf", "abstract": "As gradual typing becomes increasingly popular in languages like Python and TypeScript, there is a growing need to infer type annotations automatically.

Please see our responses below:\n\n=======\n\u201cIt is unclear to me what is the scope of the type dependency graph construction. Is it a whole file? Is it a single function/class? A whole project?\u201d\n\nResponse: Our approach takes an entire Typescript project as its input (see section 2.1 paragraph 1). We can make this clearer in the evaluation sections.\n\n=======\n\u201cThe DeepTyper paper seems to suggest that it predicts type annotations one function at a time. Does the comparison (in 5.1) use the same granularity as LambdaNet? If for example, LambdaNet looks at whole files, then the comparison is not exact. Could you please clarify? Performing the comparison on equal-sized samples would make sense.\u201d\n\nResponse: The original DeepTyper architecture takes a Typescript source file as its input and performs inter-file batching to reduce training and inference time, so we did the same in our evaluation. To compare on equal-sized inputs, we could theoretically concatenate all source files into one large file and run DeepTyper on top of it. However, this is extremely unlikely to make any difference due to the limited memory of the RNN.\n\n=======\n\u201cIf my reading of DeepTyper is correct, it processes all identifiers as a single unit. In contrast, this work (correctly, in my opinion), breaks the identifiers into \"word tokens\". This may be an important difference between the two methods. To test this, an ablation where LambdaNet does *not* split the identifiers, would provide a better comparison among the sequential representation of DeepTyper and the type constraint graph of LambdaNet.\u201d\n\nResponse: In our comparison, we made sure both DeepTyper and LambdaNet are using the same naming feature that splits words into tokens, through a modification to DeepTyper\u2019s architecture. We did this because we believe word tokens are clearly better, and our results demonstrate LambdaNet\u2019s advantage over DeepTyper even when DeepTyper is using better naming features.\n\n=======\n\u201cSome comparison with JSNice is missing (Raychev et al. 2015). The DeepTyper paper suggests that the two approaches are somewhat complementary. It would be useful to know how LambdaNet compares to JSNice too.\u201d\n\nResponse:  We found it very hard to do a comprehensive comparison with JSNice because their tool predicts over a different and very restricted set of types (mostly primitive Javascript types like number, string, etc), so we did not compare with it. DeepTyper\u2019s original experiment only manually compares with JSNice on 30 functions. We could perform a similar manual comparison against JSNice on randomly selected functions and include this comparison in our revision.\n\n=======\n\u201cThere is some literature that suggests that code duplication exists in automatically scraped corpora and that it hurts the evaluation of machine learning models [a,b]. At the very least, the authors should report the percent of duplicates (if any) in their corpus. Another option would be to _not_ evaluate predictions in any duplicated file.\u201d\n\nResponse: We investigated this question by running jscpd (a popular code duplication detection tool, https://github.com/kucherenko/jscpd ) on our entire data set and found that only 2.7% code is duplicated. Furthermore, most of these duplicates are intra-project. Thus, we believe that code duplication is not a severe problem in our dataset, and we will include more details about this result in any future revision.\n\n=======\n\u201cI do not understand why a separate edge is needed for Subtype() and Assign(). Isn't Assign (a,b) == Subype(a,b)?\u201d\n\nResponse: It is true that Assign is a special case of Subtype from a typing perspective. We differentiate them because these edges appear in different contexts in the graph and, thus, having uncoupled parameters for these two edge types is likely to be beneficial. Moreover, assignments constitute a substantial portion of subtyping constraints, so we have enough data to train an additional edge type. \n\n=======\n\u201cThe authors correctly exclude the `any` annotations produced by the TypeScript compiler. Do they also exclude any other annotations? For example, functions that do not return a value (i.e. their return value is `void`) would also need to be excluded. What about `object`?\u201d\n\nResponse: As we mentioned in the paper, we only evaluate on type annotations that the programmers have manually added. This means that types like \u201cvoid\u201d would only be evaluated if the programmer feels it is necessary to add them (which is quite rare but possible).\n\n=======\n\u201cI would encourage the authors to make the dataset (source code and extracted graphs), and the LambdaNet code public upon acceptance.\u201d\n\nResponse: Yes, we will.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1373/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1373/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["jiayi@cs.utexas.edu", "maruth@utexas.edu", "gdurrett@cs.utexas.edu", "isil@cs.utexas.edu"], "title": "LambdaNet: Probabilistic Type Inference using Graph Neural Networks", "authors": ["Jiayi Wei", "Maruth Goyal", "Greg Durrett", "Isil Dillig"], "pdf": "/pdf/86657ef3180cce2cdbdc9e6f22aeef474f4d60de.pdf", "abstract": "As gradual typing becomes increasingly popular in languages like Python and TypeScript, there is a growing need to infer type annotations automatically.

It consists of a translation of a program's type constraints and defined objects into a (hyper)graph, and a specialised neural message passing architecture to learn from the generated graphs. Experiments show that the method substantially outperforms sound typing in the TypeScript compiler, as well as a recent method based on deep neural networks.\n\n= Strong/Weak Points\n+ The graph representation of the problem is novel, and draws both on core ideas from Hindley-Milner typing (in the subtyping/assignment graph bits) as well as neural ideas (in name similiarity)\n+ The neural message passing architecture is adapted to the problem, handling features not present in the standard GNN literature (hyperedges, ...)\n+ Experiments compare with relevant baselines and consider interesting ablations, studying the effect of the GNN extensions in detail.\n- The hyperparameter selection regime (and the experiments used to find them) is not described\n\n= Recommendation\nThis is an application-driven paper with nice practical results. The fact that standard neural architectures are extended and adapted to the task, and the way domain knowledge is used to design the graph representation makes this interesting even to people outside the task-specific audience, and hence I strongly recommend acceptance.\n\n= Minor Comments\n- page 2: \"network's type to be class\" -> \"to be a class\"\n- Evaluation Datasets: Did you take duplication in the crawled datasets into account?
