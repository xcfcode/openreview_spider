This paper studies algebraic geometry (an area unfamiliar to most ICLR readers) of program synthesis, with the \"hope that algebraic geometry can assist in developing the next generation of synthesis machines.\" Unfortunately, this paper does not get far enough down that path, and its implications cannot realistically be appreciated by an ICLR audience. The reviewers indicate that their low confidence is due to their lack of understanding of algebraic geometry and not due to their lack of understanding of program synthesis. The featured implication of the paper is that synthesized programs are singularities of analytic functions, which is not very meaningful to the ICLR audience. Even if external reviewers verified the correctness of the math, the ICLR audience would still not understand the implications.

This work says that instead, it is easy to arrive at a point where the KL 0, but it might not be a realizable program.", "review": "- quality : good\n- clarity : very good. I was worried about reading this due to all the math symbols, but it turns out the big pictures are clearly explained.\n- originality : okay\n- significance : not sure\n\nI could not follow the more technical aspects as I'm not a theory person (although I did fail algebraic geometry at one point). The main claim of the paper is that when doing relaxations and attempt to view satisfying programs as the variety W0 of some mathematical function, W0 is typically larger than W0 \\intersect Wcode. This is important because one may easily find a point of solution in the variety W0, yet it cannot be realized as a working program in Wcode. I can confirm that this is indeed the case in some limited capacity when I tried to approximate deterministic functions via neural networks, and attempted to synthesize these functions by \"pulling back\" from the output to the space of programs, which resulted in a relaxed representation of program that has very low loss, yet do not correspond to actual programs. It is nice to see why this happened in a formal setting.\n\nAs I am confident that my expertise in this area is not high, I will not be providing an explicit pro/con list. I would instead ask a few questions to the authors and hope I can get a good response:\n\n- A natural thing to make program synthesis more amendable is by changing the set Wcode. For instance, if I were to represent the function that adds 3, I can either do that with x + 3, or with x+1+1+1. Now, which one of these representation would lead to a Wcode that has a better chance of intersecting better with W0? As DSL designers, we have fairly big freedom in designing what Wcode is, that is often the only thing we can control. Is there a rule of thumb that we can follow to ensure that gradient-based or sampling-based relaxation works well? i.e. W0 isn't such a horrible extended object?\n\n- Another \"knob\" that we can control easily in synthesis is the number of input output examples, and which examples to give. If I want to specify a polynomial of degree 2, I can choose either 3 points, or 30 points. Which is easier? Specifically, given a specific Wcode, given two dataset of input-output examples, D1 and D2. Let Sol(D,Wcode) denote the set of programs in Wcode that satisfies D completely, in a classical sense. The question is, if Sol(D1, Wcode) = Sol(D2, Wcode), how do we quantify if synthesis is easier over D1 or over D2 ? i.e. which set, Variety(D1) or Variety(D2) is the more horrible extended object of Wcode?\n\nfinal recommendation:\nI maintain my score. I think this is an interesting piece of work that can easily be used as citations whenever the discussion of \"why don't you just relax your program to be differentiable\" comes up, and I can cite this paper and say \"no that does not work theoretically\".", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2473/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2473/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Geometry of Program Synthesis", "authorids": ["~James_Clift1", "~Daniel_Murfet1", "~James_Wallbridge1"], "authors": ["James Clift", "Daniel Murfet", "James Wallbridge"], "keywords": ["Program Synthesis", "Singular Learning Theory", "Bayesian Inference", "MCMC"], "abstract": "We present a new perspective on program synthesis in which programs may be identified with singularities of analytic functions.

You raise several interesting questions.\n\nFirstly, since $W_0$ is higher dimensional than $W^{code} \\cap W_0$ it should be easier to find a point of the former than the latter (by either SGD or MCMC). Perhaps one insight that is gained from our point of view is that $W_0$ is an extended object, and while we don\u2019t see how to guarantee it currently in general, if you can find a point on $W_0$ you could reasonably hope to then find a path within $W_0$ to a point of $W^{code} \\cap W_0$. So it probably makes sense to divide synthesis into two phases (a) find a point of $W_0$ and (b) retract from $W_0$ to $W^{code} \\cap W_0$.\n\nRegarding the design of domain specific languages. In formulating a response to your question we came up with a new insight that now forms Section 4 of the paper. In fact there is a relationship between DSLs and how well the learning process works. I would guess that adding additional higher-level operations to a DSL would decrease the RLCT and thus make the optimisation process work better, but that would require some follow-up work. I think the problem with continuous program synthesis is not that $W_0$ is horrible and extended (for instance deep learning works very well and there the set of true parameters $W_0$ is even more horrible and more extended) but rather that the RLCT is too big ($W_0$ is not singular enough) and the number of training examples is generally too small. It could be hoped that a careful study of DSLs in the setting of singular learning theory might shed some light on this.\n\nRegarding the number of training examples. Again, this question prompted some of the discussion now in Section 4, which clarifies that generically you expect that the more examples you provide the less likely the optimisation process will get stuck in a local minimum of the free energy."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2473/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2473/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Geometry of Program Synthesis", "authorids": ["~James_Clift1", "~Daniel_Murfet1", "~James_Wallbridge1"], "authors": ["James Clift", "Daniel Murfet", "James Wallbridge"], "keywords": ["Program Synthesis", "Singular Learning Theory", "Bayesian Inference", "MCMC"], "abstract": "We present a new perspective on program synthesis in which programs may be identified with singularities of analytic functions.

We understand your concerns regarding the applicability of our approach. We have developed both a new method which can synthesise arbitrary programs, and the theoretical framework around which to understand the loss surface and model complexity of these programs. This involves considerable mathematical machinery, which is understandable since it is well known that the set of critical points of any loss function does not generically have a simple manifold structure. Without such precise mathematical language, one cannot hope to even talk about solutions (ie. critical points or singular points) to program synthesis tasks.\n\nThe first step in developing a new approach to a problem, be it program synthesis or otherwise, is to show in detail that it works on simple examples. Scaling to larger problems is a second step. Incidentally, the whole field of program synthesis is still grappling with small/toy problems which motivated this work. We have included a new Section 4 which gives some practical implications of our method. We have also provided various updates to help improve the clarity of the paper.\n\nWe would be happy to discuss any further concerns regarding our approach."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2473/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2473/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Geometry of Program Synthesis", "authorids": ["~James_Clift1", "~Daniel_Murfet1", "~James_Wallbridge1"], "authors": ["James Clift", "Daniel Murfet", "James Wallbridge"], "keywords": ["Program Synthesis", "Singular Learning Theory", "Bayesian Inference", "MCMC"], "abstract": "We present a new perspective on program synthesis in which programs may be identified with singularities of analytic functions.
