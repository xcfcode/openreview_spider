In the third task (concept drift), we actually employ a neural network, although, admittedly, a shallow one (see Section B.3).\n\nThat being said, we are highly interested in evaluating our approach (or variations thereof) also on harder tasks that require deep architectures. For this reason, in Section 5.4, we highlight one possible future application of our approach for discrete representation learning in the context of speech segmentation. We do not claim that the simple model presented there actually solves the speech segmentation problem, which is why we did not perform a formal evaluation against competitors from the speech recognition community.\n\n> There is a number of baseline techniques and datasets for segmentation that the authors could compare to. [...] OCR / Speech [...] action segmentation [...]\n\nIt is true that these problems are similar in nature, since they all require some form of segmentation. However, technically, they are quite different from the problem we consider. In the present work, we consider the problem of segmenting a single sequence of length $T$ into a fixed number of segments $K$ under a generic model for the data generating process (which is a hard problem). The problems you mention require segmentation of multiple sequences of different lengths into an unknown number of segments. In order to apply our segmented model to these problems we would have to come up with non-trivial extensions that would exceed the scope of the present work.\n\nAnother perspective on the difference is the following: With our approach, we learn the parameters of a segmentation function as a part of fitting a segmented model. In the problems you mention, a model is trained to predict a segmentation for an arbitrary input sequence. We believe that these problems can be unified in future work.\n\n> One other question is regarding section 5.3 and Fig. 6. It seems that increasing the number of segments up to 32 still produces improvements in accuracy, so I would be interested in seeing how the model behaves with even larger K. (I expect that starting at some value of K overfitting to small segments should start reducing the accuracy?)\n\nYes, the model will eventually start to overfit the data. However, we note that this is a streaming classification benchmark without a train/test split, and we fit our segmented model to the complete stream. In the case of extreme overfitting with $K=T$ (a saturated model), the segmented model will have a classification accuracy of 1, since it can adapt the bias term individually for every instance such that it is correctly classified. Therefore, we will not see the accuracy going down with $K \\longrightarrow T$. We still ran additional experiments with up to 128 segments and added the results to Figure 5 in the updated manuscript."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3185/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3185/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Differentiable Segmentation of Sequences", "authorids": ["~Erik_Scharw\u00e4chter1", "jlen@uni-bonn.de", "emmanuel.mueller@cs.tu-dortmund.de"], "authors": ["Erik Scharw\u00e4chter", "Jonathan Lennartz", "Emmanuel M\u00fcller"], "keywords": ["segmented models", "segmentation", "change point detection", "concept drift", "warping functions", "gradient descent"], "abstract": "Segmented models are widely used to describe non-stationary sequential data with discrete change points.

I didn't see why (4) should be very general form of relaxation. Why is it important to only interpolate consecutive two parameters? Is is possible to rewrite (4) into a weighted average $\\sum_k w_{k,t}\\theta_k$ and we hope so that $w_{k,t}$ depend on a continuous function, similar to $\\zeta_t$, and index $k$?\n\nYes, we could provide more general forms of relaxations. The weights $w_{k,t}$ that you mention implicitly yield a stochastic alignment matrix $W = (w_{k,t})_{k,t}$ that aligns time steps to segments. In the most general formulation of the model, the only constraint on the matrix $W$ is that $\\sum_k w_{k,t} = 1$ for all $t$. For example, with $K=4$ and a sequence of length $T=30$, this approach could yield the segmentation\n\n134422123341123344422123343324\n\nwith a large number of \"effective\" segments due to the lack of temporal smoothness/monotonicity in the alignment matrix. This may be useful for some applications, but requires learning a (more or less) unconstrained $K \\times T$ matrix. We want the alignment matrix to fulfil a monotonicity constraint: the segments should be visited monotonically from segment $1$ to segment $K$.

We could replace the linear interpolation in Equation (4) by quadratic, cubic, or higher-order interpolation and still obtain a monotonic segmentation. However, we chose linear interpolation because it is the simplest variant, worked well, and was used to learn differentiable warping functions before, e.g., in refs [1,2,3].\n\nWe made this aspect of the model more explicit in the updated manuscript.\n\n[1] Nicki Skafte Detlefsen, Oren Freifeld, and Soren Hauberg.

The authors show that their particular parametrization allows to control exactly the length, starting, and ending point of the interval, and the slope of change (Fig. 2). \nThe main result of the paper is the ability to pose segmentation and segment estimation problem jointly and differentiably without assumptions on the model that produced the segment data, which is an improvement over several recent works with could also pose the problem jointly, but made such assumptions, such as van den Burg & Williams, 2020, and Arlot et al., 2019. \n\nThe authors show results on several tasks: modelling of COVID-19, change point detection on synthetic dataset from Arlot et al, 2019, and concept drift dataset. The results on change point detection and concept drift dataset are convincing, showing better quality of segmentation than previous approaches. The results on COVID-19 are, though, rather qualitative and serve more as an ablation study as there aren't many different results on this datasets.\n\nMy biggest issue is the absence of proper evaluation on harder tasks, where the estimation problem is solved with the help of a neural network, as opposed to something else, as in the previous 3 datasets.\nAuthors show results on speech segmentation without any comparison to other approaches except for random segmentation (with a comment that \"random segmentation is worse in 9932 out of 10000 trials (99.32%)\") in the \"eval-timit colab\", which is hardly a fair comparison). There is a number of baseline techniques and datasets for segmentation that the authors could compare to. For example, one way of extracting segmentation in OCR / Speech is by looking at logits for \"empty class\" coming from the decoder and it would be interesting to compare such segmentation with a task of segmentation + character recognition formulated in this framework. Another group of approaches, identified by the authors themselves, uses discrete latent space representation for segmentation, in the domain of Speech. Finally, in the domain of action segmentation  there are similar in nature approaches also predicting a differentiable segmentation, but without explicit parametrization, such as in this work (eg. [Fast Weakly Supervised Action Segmentation Using Mutual Consistency])\n\nOne other question is regarding section 5.3 and Fig. 6. It seems that increasing the number of segments up to 32 still produces improvements in accuracy, so I would be interested in seeing how the model behaves with even larger K. (I expect that starting at some value of K overfitting to small segments should start reducing the accuracy?)\n\nI believe paper could be strengthened by evaluation on harder tasks and comparison with other types of methods.

The proposed method is based on two-sided power distributions (TSP) that are mathematically well-define and enable differentiability. The main goal of the method is to jointly optimize model parameters, including the segmentation function. The method is validated through experiments on modeling the spread of COVID-19 based on Poisson regression, change point detection, a classification model with concept drift (insect stream benchmark), and discrete representation learning (speech signal). \n\nOverall, I have the impression that this is in interesting paper that has most things going for it. Replacing a hard segmentation function with a soft differentiable warping function (two-sided power distributions) seems technically-sound and is an interesting novel solution to a difficult problem. The paper is mostly well-written and easy to follow. Furthermore, the experiments are well-defined and novel datasets (COVID, insect stream benchmark) were used to validate the effectiveness of the model. Therefore, I am leaning toward accepting this work to ICLR 2021. \n\nAdditional comments: \n\n- The abstract is somewhat difficult to comprehend and appears more cryptic than necessary. \n- In Section 3.2. it is not clear what is meant by levels 0 and 1. \n- Section 4: It is not clear what 'bogus mode' refers to.\n- To better understand the model in Figure 3 (and given the white space around the equations) it would be helpful to provide  labels for the introduced variables. \n- Please add details on whether the RKI data is publicly available. \n- Currently the paper does not discuss any limitations. To further understand the introduced model it would be helpful to highlight corner cases across the experiments in which the model does not perform well.
