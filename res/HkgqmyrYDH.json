The problem tackled is defined as \"word prediction\", which seems to be some form of language modeling.

Word sequence prediction is a challenging task for inflected languages (Gustavii &Pettersson, 2003; Seyyed & Assi, 2005). These kinds of languages are morphologically rich and have enormous word forms, which is a word can\nhave different forms. As Amharic language is morphologically rich it shares the problem (Tessema,\n2014).This problem makes word prediction system much more difficult and results poor performance.\nPrevious researches used dictionary approach with no consideration of context information. Due to this\nreason, storing all forms in a dictionary won\u2019t solve the problem as in English and other less inflected\nlanguages. Therefore, we introduced two models; tags and words and linear interpolation that use parts of\nspeech tag information in addition to word n-grams in order to maximize the likelihood of syntactic\nappropriateness of the suggestions. The statistics included in the systems varies from single word\nfrequencies to parts-of-speech tag n-grams. We described a combined statistical and lexical word prediction\nsystem and developed Amharic language models of bigram and trigram for the training purpose. The overall\nstudy followed Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM).\n", "pdf": "/pdf/f3681de5c0c62b9e82d0e2b7a63d0fb49e2fd293.pdf", "paperhash": "kifle|word_sequence_prediction_for_amharic_language", "original_pdf": "/attachment/f3681de5c0c62b9e82d0e2b7a63d0fb49e2fd293.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkifle2020word,\ntitle={{\\{}WORD{\\}} {\\{}SEQUENCE{\\}} {\\{}PREDICTION{\\}} {\\{}FOR{\\}} {\\{}AMHARIC{\\}} {\\{}LANGUAGE{\\}}},\nauthor={Nuniyat Kifle and Ermias Abebe},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkgqmyrYDH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
