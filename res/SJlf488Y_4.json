The discriminator needs to take in both the input being conditioned on, as well as the generator output. Traditionally, the input and generator output are concatenated before passing into the discriminator network, while in this work, the input/generator output get passed through CNNs (with identical parameters) separately, and the features get merged at various levels. The authors argued that 1) theoretically the signal of fusing afterward is stronger than passing beforehand under certain conditions, and 2) empirically this discriminator architecture works better by a large margin on image synthesis, semantic segmentation and depth estimation.\n\nPros:\n1. This paper is very clear and easy to follow.\n2. The results show that the proposal gets better performance than concatenation by a large margin.\n\nCons:\n1. As pointed out by this paper, a stronger signal does not necessarily mean better performance, hence I think the theoretical results do not make much sense here. Although the results seem promising, I am not sure if these results generalize to other tasks of varying dataset sizes and model architectures.\n2. The novelty of this approach seems to be limited, and it's not clear how this approach can generalize to tasks other than image-to-image.", "rating": "2: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/DeepGenStruct/Paper15/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/DeepGenStruct/Paper15/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Structured Prediction using cGANs with Fusion Discriminator", "authors": ["Faisal Mahmood", "Wenhao Xu", "Nicholas J.
