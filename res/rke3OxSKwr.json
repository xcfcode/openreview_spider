Is the proposed AR encoder uni-directional? If the AR encoder is uni-directional, then I would be surprised that the uni-directional encoder outperforms the bi-directional encoder in the original wait-k model. \"\n\nThe original wait-k paper [2] and the subsequent paper [1,3] use an \u2018incremental encoder\u2019. It is bidirectional for all tokens before a cursor g(t). Therefore at every decoding time-step t, with increased g(t) the encoder states have to be updated. It is interesting, indeed perhaps surprising, to see that in the context of online machine translation the unidirectional encoder outperforms the bidirectional one. All of our transformer model for online translation use uni-directional encoders (MT) and when evaluated without the  \u2018update\u2019, the decoders are equivalent to the ones in [2] which suggests that the uni-directional encoders are better suited for online translation.\n\nRegarding \"For the second bullet, I think the original wait-k also did the same thing(they mentioned this in the paper clearly). So there is nothing new about bullet 2. \"\n\nIndeed, there is nothing new about the masking in the encoder-decoder interaction but we wanted to explicitly define all the masks used in the architecture, and list the differences with respect to an offline transformer model.\n\nRegarding \"2) the idea mentioned in fig 1 is very similar to [1]. I suggest the authors compare with the aforementioned methods. \"\n\nWe will compare with the method in [1]. However In [1] the authors suggest optimizing the decoding along a set of paths sampled within an area of interest (similar to the gray area in our figure 2.) but ended up optimizing along the two boundary paths. What we suggest here is to optimize the decoding in \u2018all\u2019 the cells of the gray area. This is possible with the pervasive attention architecture where the cell state is independent from the path we followed to arrive there. With the transformer model, optimizing the full area is not evident, so we ended up selecting a few wait-k paths and thus using training strategy similar to the one in [1]. There is also the fact that [1] aims to learn dynamic read/write decision with a special token added to the vocabulary to represent the \u2018Read\u2019 action. Unfortunately, [1] only reports results for Chine-English (and reverse) translation, preventing direct comparison to  our results and those of [2,3].\n\nRegarding \"3) updating the hidden state of the decoder introduces more complexity during the inference time. I recommend the authors to perform some analysis about decoding time with CPU and GPU.\"\n\nWe will include decoding times on CPU and GPU for our models and compare them to the approach in [1].\n\nRegarding \"4) it is also interesting to show more comparison between different models' training time with the original STACL. \"\n\nDuring the training of our models on a given wait-k path we do not update the encoder states nor the previous decoder states. This makes our training time comparable to an offline transformer. With [1] however, given a target sequence y of length |y| there are |y| encoder forward passes to evaluate the states associated with each context size g(t).\n\nBetween our single k training and multiple k, the training time is higher if for each sentence pair we run a separate forwards pass for each value of k. Alternatively, for each batch of sentence pairs we can sample a value of k and only use the loss for the wait-k path for that value of k for that batch. This way we end up with a comparable training times.\n\n[1] Zheng et al. \"Simultaneous Translation with Flexible Policy via Restricted Imitation Learning\" ACL 2019\n[2] Ma et al. \u201cSTACL: Simultaneous Translation with Implicit Anticipation and Controllable Latency using Prefix-to-Prefix Framework.\" ACL 2019\n[3] Zheng et al. \u201cSimpler and faster learning of adaptive policies for simultaneous translation.\"  EMNLP 2019\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2412/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2412/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improved Training Techniques for Online Neural Machine Translation", "authors": ["Maha Elbayad", "Laurent Besacier", "Jakob Verbeek"], "authorids": ["maha.elbayad@inria.fr", "laurent.besacier@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr", "jakob.verbeek@inria.fr"], "keywords": ["Deep learning", "natural language processing", "Machine translation"], "TL;DR": "Improved training of wait-k decoders for online machine translation", "abstract": "Neural sequence-to-sequence models are at the basis of state-of-the-art solutions for sequential prediction problems such as machine translation and speech recognition.

The authors did some interesting experiments between caching and updating decoder.\n\nMy questions are as follows:\n\n1) in section 3.1.2, the authors mentioned two adaptations. Is the proposed AR encoder uni-directional? If the AR encoder is uni-directional, then I would be surprised that the uni-directional encoder outperforms the bi-directional encoder in the original wait-k model. For the second bullet, I think the original wait-k also did the same thing(they mentioned this in the paper clearly). So there is nothing new about bullet 2. \n\n2) the idea mentioned in fig 1 is very similar to [1]. I suggest the authors compare with the aforementioned methods. \n\n3) updating the hidden state of the decoder introduces more complexity during the inference time. I recommend the authors to perform some analysis about decoding time with CPU and GPU.\n\n4) it is also interesting to show more comparison between different models' training time with the original STACL. \n\n[1] Zheng et al. \"Simultaneous Translation with Flexible Policy via Restricted Imitation Learning\" ACL 2019"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2412/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2412/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improved Training Techniques for Online Neural Machine Translation", "authors": ["Maha Elbayad", "Laurent Besacier", "Jakob Verbeek"], "authorids": ["maha.elbayad@inria.fr", "laurent.besacier@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr", "jakob.verbeek@inria.fr"], "keywords": ["Deep learning", "natural language processing", "Machine translation"], "TL;DR": "Improved training of wait-k decoders for online machine translation", "abstract": "Neural sequence-to-sequence models are at the basis of state-of-the-art solutions for sequential prediction problems such as machine translation and speech recognition.
