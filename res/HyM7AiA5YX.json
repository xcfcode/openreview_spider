The authors describe this as \"maximizing the complement entropy.\" Rather than adding the cross-entropy objective and the (negative) complement entropy term (since the complement entropy should be maximized while the cross-entropy is minimized), this paper proposes an alternating optimization framework in which first a step is taken to reduce the cross-entropy, then a step is taken to maximize the complement entropy. Extensive experiments on image classification (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, Tiny Imagenet, and Imagenet), neural machine translation (IWSLT 2015 English-Vietnamese task), and small-vocabulary isolated-word recognition (Google Commands), show that the proposed two-objective approach outperforms training only to minimize cross-entropy. Experiments on CIFAR-10 also show that models trained in this framework have somewhat better resistance to single-step adversarial attacks. Concerns about the presentation of the adversarial attack experiments were raised by anonymous commenters and one of the reviewers, but these concerns were addressed in the revision and discussion. The primary remaining concern is a lack of any theoretical guarantees that the alternating optimization converges, but the strong empirical results compensate for this problem.", "confidence": "5: The area chair is absolutely certain", "recommendation": "Accept (Poster)", "title": "Novel training objective for deep learning with strong empirical results"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper880/Area_Chair1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper880/Area_Chair1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Complement Objective Training", "abstract": "Learning with a primary objective, such as softmax cross entropy for classification and sequence generation, has been the norm for training deep neural networks for years.

We understand that the adversarial attack techniques used here may not be state-of-the-art methods; however, we want to emphasize that the primary goal of this paper is to improve model's accuracy, although experimental results do show that robustness is also one of the benefits of the models trained by COT. \n\nWe agree with the reviewer that transfer adversarial attack is different from the classic settings of adversarial attacks. To verify our method under standard adversarial attacks, we have conducted additional experiments on white-box attack, and provided the results below; the experimental results confirmed that COT is indeed more robust to this type of attacks, and therefore we believe the main conclusion that COT is more robust (compared to baselines) to adversarial attack still holds. We will add these results of the white-box attack into the final version of the paper. Additionally, we will rename the current experiments to \u201ctransfer attacks\u201d to avoid confusions. The definition of the transfer attacks can be found in several recent publications [1, 2, 3].\n\nFor the white-box attacks, we conducted the experiments as also suggested by AnonReviewer3. The update is to set adversarial perturbations to be Epsilon * Sign (Primary gradient + Complement gradient). Results indicate that COT is more robust to this type of white-box attacks under standard settings.\n\nTest errors on Cifar10 under FGSM white-box adversarial attacks\n===========================================================\n\t\t\t\t              Baseline\t                        COT\nResNet-110 \t\t\t      62.23%                 \t\t52.72%\nPreAct ResNet-18               65.60%                 \t\t56.17%\nResNeXt-29 (2\u00d764d)           70.24%                 \t\t61.55%\nWideResNet-28-10\t       59.39%                 \t\t55.53%\nDenseNet-BC-121               65.97%                 \t\t55.99%\n===========================================================\n \nThe reviewer also suggested to try out several recent methods on white-box and black-box attacks. We do agree with the reviewer that it's a great idea. However, since the main focus of the current paper is to improve accuracy, and the manuscript is already close to the page limit, we feel it's better to study this problem in a separate paper.

Below we provide explanations for each of your comments or questions.  \n\n\n(Q1) End of page 1: \"the model behavior for classes other than the ground truth stays unharnessed and not well-defined\". The probabilities should still sum up to 1, so if the ground truth one is maximized,  the others are actually implicitly minimized. No?\n\n(A1) Your understanding is totally correct. We have changed the original text to a more clear statement:\n\n\u201cTherefore, for classes other than the ground truth, the model behavior is not explicitly optimized --- their predicted probabilities are indirectly minimized when \u0177_ig is maximized since the probabilities sum up to 1.\u201d\n\nWe want to thank the reviewer again for crystalizing the manuscript.\n\n\n(Q2) Page 3, sec 2.1: \"optimizing on the complement entropy drives \u0177_ij to 1/(K \u2212 1)\". I believe that it drives each term \u0177_ij /(1 \u2212 \u0177_ig ) to be equal to 1/(K-1). Therefore, it drives \u0177_ij to (1 \u2212 \u0177_ig)/(K-1) for j!=g.\n\nThis indeed flattens the \u0177_ij for j!=g, but the effect on \u0177_ig is not controlled. In particular this latter can decrease. Then in the next step of the algorithm, \u0177_ig will be maximized, but with no explicit control over the complementary probabilities. There are two objectives that are optimized over the same variable theta. So the question is, are we sure that this procedure will converge? What prevents situations where the probabilities will alternate between two values? \n\nFor example, with 4 classes, we look at the predicted probabilities of a given sample of class 1:\nSuppose after step 1 of Algo 1, the predicted probabilities are:  0.5 0.3 0.1 0.1 \nAfter step 2:  0.1 0.3 0.3 0.3\nThen step 1: 0.5 0.3 0.1 0.1\nThen step 2: 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.3\nAnd so on... Can this happen? Or why not? Did the algorithm have trouble converging in any of the experiments?\n\n(A2) Thanks for the detailed comment. As the reviewer pointed out, \u201cdrives \u0177_ij to 1/(K \u2212 1)\u201d was indeed a typo and should be corrected to \u201cdrive \u0177_ij /(1 \u2212 \u0177_ig) to 1/(K-1)\u201d. We have modified the manuscript correspondingly. Indeed, maximizing complement entropy in Eq(2) only drives \u201c\u0177_ij /(1 \u2212 \u0177_ig) to 1/(K-1)\u201d, and therefore in the example provided above, the predicted probabilities after step 2 can be \u201c0.1 0.3 0.3 0.3\u201d or \u201c0.5, (1 - 0.5)/3, (1 - 0.5)/3, (1 - 0.5)/3\u201d, or other values so long as the incorrect classes (\u0177_ij's) receive similar predicted probabilities. According to our observations from the experiments, the probabilities tend to converge to \u201c0.5, (1 - 0.5)/3, (1 - 0.5)/3, (1 - 0.5)/3\u201d. Experiments show that the algorithm does not have trouble converging; the algorithm converges smoothly in all the experiments we have conducted. Again, we thank the reviewer for the insightful comment; studying the theory of COT convergence is an intriguing topic and we leave it as a future work.\n\n\n(Q3) Sec 3.1: \"additional efforts for tuning hyper-parameters might be required for optimizers to achieve the best performance\": Which hyper-parameters are considered here? If it is the learning rate, why not use a different one, tuned for each objective?\n\n(A3) Hyper-parameters in this statement indeed refer to the learning rate, and we have modified the statement in the manuscript to avoid confusion; the modified statement is provided below:\n\n\u201ctherefore, additional efforts for tuning learning rates might be required for optimizers to achieve the best performance.\u201d\n\nRegarding the second question about tuning learning rates, we have conducted several experiments with different learning rates specifically tuned for each objective. The experimental results show that using the same learning rate for both primary and complement objectives leads to the best performance when Eq(3) is used as the complement objective.\n\n\n(Q4) Sec 3.2: The additional optimization makes each training iteration more costly. How much more? How do the total running times of COT compare to the ones of the baselines? I think this should be mentioned in the paper.\n\n(A4) Yes, one additional backpropagation is required in each iteration when applying COT. On average, the total training time is about 1.6 times longer compared to the baselines. Thanks for the suggestion, and we have included this in the latest manuscript (section 2.2)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper880/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper880/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper880/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Complement Objective Training", "abstract": "Learning with a primary objective, such as softmax cross entropy for classification and sequence generation, has been the norm for training deep neural networks for years.

Therefore I wonder about the  relevance of this section. Isn't there an easy way to adapt the attacks to the two objectives to be able to illustrate the conjectured robustness of COT? For example, naively having a two steps perturbation of the input: one based on the gradient of the primary objective and then perturb the result using the gradient of the complementary objective?\n\n(A5) Thanks for the comment. We should have made clear that \u201cblack box\u201d [1] (rather than \u201cwhite box\u201d) adversarial attacks are considered in the manuscript. Specifically, we follow the common practice of generating adversarial examples using both FGSM and I-FGSM methods with the gradients from a baseline model; this way, the model trained by COT is actually a \u201cblack box\u201d to these attacks. We have modified the manuscript to clarify this part. Also, thanks for the great suggestion of forming adversarial attacks using \u201cboth\u201d gradients (from both primary & complement objectives). We are designing and conducting experiments at the moment and will share results when ready.\n\n\nFor the part of secondary comments and typos, we appreciate your thorough reading again and have corrected all these typos according to your suggestions. Meanwhile, in the following, we also provided explanations to your secondary comments.\n\n\n(Q1) Page 3, sec 2.1: \"...the proposed COT also optimizes the complement objective for neutralizing the predicted probabilities...\", using maximizes instead of optimizes would be clearer.\n\n(A1) Thanks for the suggestion. We have reworded the manuscript to \u201cmaximizes.\u201d\n\n\n(Q2) In the definition of the complement entropy, equation (2), C takes as parameter only y^hat_Cbar but then in the formula, \u0177_ig appears. Shouldn't C take all \\hat_y as an argument in this case?\n\n(A2) Since the probabilities sum up to one, \u0177_ig can be inferred from y^hat_Cbar. Also, for us, it seems more direct and clear to show that complement entropy is calculated from y^hat_Cbar when C takes y^hat_Cbar as the only argument. Therefore, we incline to keep the orignal formulation. If the reviewer has strong preference, please kindly let us know and we are happy to make changes accordingly.\n\n\n(Q3) Algorithm 1 page 4: I find it confusing that the (artificial) variable that appears in the argmin (resp. argmax) is theta_{t-1}\n(resp. theta'_t) which is the previous parameter. Is there a reason for this choice?\n\n(A3) Thanks for the comment. Originally, we want to notify readers that there are two backprops within one iteration. We agree that those symbols are confusing and therefore we have modified the manuscript with those symbols removed.\n\n\n(Q4) Sec 3.2  Figure 4: why is the median reported and not the mean (as in Figure 3, Tables 2 and 3)?\n\n(A4) Thanks for pointing this out. This is a typo and we have already corrected it in the manuscript: median -> mean.\n\n\n(Q5) Sec 3.2, Table 3 and 4: why is it the validation error that is reported and not the test error?\n\n(A5) Thanks for the detailed comment. For a fair comparison, we report the error in the exact same way as the open-sourced repo from the ResNet authors:\nhttps://github.com/KaimingHe/deep-residual-networks.\n\n\n(Q6) Sec 3.3: \"Neural machine translation (NMT) has populated the use of neural sequence models\": populated has not the intended meaning.\n\n(A6) We thank the reviewer for pointing out this typo.

Below we provide the explanations for each question or comment raised by the reviewer:\n\n\n(Q1) How is this idea related to regularization? If we increase the regularization parameter, we can attain sparse parameter vectors. \n\n(A1) Conventionally, regularization techniques (e.g., Ridge or Lasso) are applied on the parameter space. We want to point out that all the results reported in the manuscript, for both baselines and models trained by COT, have already used L2-norm regularization on the parameter space, exactly as specified in the original papers  (e.g., ResNet [1], WideResNet [2], and DenseNet [3]). In other words, COT is applied on top of the existent of those regularization techniques.\n\nIf your questions haven\u2019t been addressed satisfactorily, please kindly let us know and we will be happy to discuss further.\n\n\n(Q2) Would this method also complement from overfitting?\n\n(A2) Thank you for the comment. We would like to further clarify what you meant by saying \u201ccomplement from overfitting.\u201d Our interpretation of the question is: whether COT could be used to fight against overfitting. Overfitting means a model fails to generalize, and in our paper we have reported the generalized performance of models trained by COT on the test data, which confirms models trained by COT generalize better. In addition, we also calculate the loss gap \"(testing loss - training loss)\" and report the results in the following table, where a smaller gap indicates that a model generalizes better. Experimental results confirm that models trained by COT seem to generalize better due to the smaller gap between training and testing loss.\n\n \"(Testing loss - training loss)\u201d from the state-of-the-art architectures on Cifar10 \n==================================================\n\t\t\t\t                Baseline\t        COT\nResNet-110 \t\t\t        0.36                 0.33\nPreAct ResNet-18                 0.28                 0.26\nResNeXt-29 (2\u00d764d)             0.20                 0.19\nWideResNet-28-10\t\t0.23                 0.21\nDenseNet-BC-121           \t0.22                 0.22\n=================================================\n\n\n(Q3) In the numerical experiments, the comparison is carried out against a \"baseline\" method. Do the authors use regularization with these baseline methods? I believe the comparison will be fair if the regularization option is turned on for the baseline methods.\n\n(A3) Yes, the regularization (e.g., L2 Norm) techniques are used in all of the baseline methods, as specified in their original papers (e.g., ResNet [1], WideResNet [2], and DenseNet [3]). We agree with the reviewer that \u201cthe comparison will be fair if the regularization option is turned on for the baseline methods,\u201d and that is exactly we did in our paper: all the hyper-parameters, regularization and other training techniques are configured in the same way as in the original papers.

Minimizing the cross-entropy means maximizing the predicted probabilities of the ground-truth classes (averaged over the samples). The authors introduce a \"complementary entropy\" loss with the goal of minimizing the predicted probabilities of the complementary (incorrect) classes. To do that, they use the average of sample-wise entropy over the complement classes. By maximizing this entropy, the predicted complementary probabilities are encouraged to be equal and therefore, the authors claim that it neutralizes them as the number of classes grows large. The proposed training procedure, named COT, consists of alternating between the optimization of the two losses.\n\nThe procedure is tested on image classification tasks with different datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Street View House Numbers, Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet), machine translation (training using IWSLT dataset, validation and test using TED tst2012/2013 datasets), and speech recognition (Gooogle Commands dataset). In the experiments, COT outperforms state-of-the-art models for each task/dataset.\n\nAdversarial attacks are also considered for the classification of images of CIFAR-10: using the Fast Gradient Sign and Basic Iterative Fast Gradient Sign methods on different models, adversarial examples specifically designed for each model, are generated. Then results of these models are compared to COT on these examples. The authors admit\nthat the results are biased since the adversarial attacks only target part of the COT objective, hence more accurate comparisons should be done in future work.\n\n===========================\n Main comments and questions\n===========================\n\nEnd of page 1: \"the model behavior for classes other than the ground  truth stays unharnessed and not well-defined\". The probabilities  should still sum up to 1, so if the ground truth one is maximized,  the others are actually implicitly minimized. No?\n\nPage 3, sec 2.1: \"optimizing on the complement entropy drives \u0177_ij to 1/(K \u2212 1)\". I believe that it drives each term \u0177_ij /(1 \u2212 \u0177_ig ) to be equal to 1/(K-1). Therefore, it drives \u0177_ij to (1 \u2212 \u0177_ig)/(K-1) for j!=g.\n\nThis indeed flattens the \u0177_ij for j!=g, but the effect on \u0177_ig is not controlled. In particular this latter can decrease. Then in the next step of the algorithm, \u0177_ig will be maximized, but with no explicit control over the complementary probabilities. There are two objectives that are optimized over the same variable theta. So the question is, are we sure that this procedure will converge? What prevents situations where the probabilities will alternate between two values? \n\nFor example, with 4 classes, we look at the predicted probabilities of a given sample of class 1:\nSuppose after step 1 of Algo 1, the predicted probabilities are:  0.5 0.3 0.1 0.1 \nAfter step 2:  0.1 0.3 0.3 0.3\nThen step 1: 0.5 0.3 0.1 0.1\nThen step 2: 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.3\nAnd so on... Can this happen? Or why not? Did the algorithm have trouble converging in any of the experiments?\n\nSec 3.1:\n\"additional efforts for tuning hyper-parameters might be required for optimizers to achieve the best performance\": Which hyper-parameters are considered here? If it is the learning rate, why not use a different one, tuned for each objective?\n\nSec 3.2:\nThe additional optimization makes each training iteration more costly. How much more? How do the total running times of COT compare to the ones of the baselines? I think this should be mentioned in the paper.\n\nSec 3.4:\nAs the authors mention, the results are biased and so the comparison is not fair here. Therefore I wonder about the  relevance of this section. Isn't there an easy way to adapt the attacks to the two objectives to be able to illustrate the conjectured robustness of COT? For example, naively having a two steps perturbation of the input: one based on the gradient of the primary objective and then perturb the result using the gradient of the complementary objective?\n\n===========================\nSecondary comments and typos\n===========================\n\nPage 3, sec 2.1: \"...the proposed COT also optimizes the complement objective for neutralizing the predicted probabilities...\", using maximizes instead of optimizes would be clearer.\n\nIn the definition of the complement entropy, equation (2), C takes as parameter only y^hat_Cbar but then in the formula, \u0177_ig appears. Shouldn't C take all \\hat_y as an argument in this case?\n\nAlgorithm 1 page 4: I find it confusing that the (artificial) variable that appears in the argmin (resp. argmax) is theta_{t-1}\n(resp. theta'_t) which is the previous parameter.
