Although deformations can also be characterized by the difference of the original and deformed image, it is qualitatively and quantitatively different as a small deformation can result in a large difference.\n\nOn the positive side, this paper proposes an interesting form of adversarial attack, whose success can give additional insights on the forms of existing adversarial attacks.  The experiments on MNIST and ImageNet are reasonably comprehensive and allow interesting interpretation of how the image deforms to allow the attack.  The paper is also praised for its clarity, and cleaner formulation compared to Xiao et al. (see below).  Additional experiments during rebuttal phase partially answered reviewer concerns, and provided more information e.g. about the effect of the smoothness of the deformation.\n\nThere were some concerns that the paper primarly presents one idea, and perhaps missed an opportunity for deeper analysis (R1).  R2 would have appreciated more analysis on how to defend against the attack.\n\nA controversial point is the relation /  novelty with respect to Xiao et al., ICLR 2018.  As e.g. pointed out by R1: \"The paper originates from a document provably written in late 2017, which is before the deposit on arXiv of another article (by different authors, early 2018) which was later accepted to ICLR 2018 [Xiao and al.]. This remark is important in that it changes my rating of the paper (being more indulgent with papers proposing new ideas, as otherwise the novelty is rather low compared to [Xiao and al.]).\"\n\nOn the balance, all three reviewers recommended acceptance of the paper.

We are happy to engage in further discussion, and your question is interesting indeed. Our method focuses on finding an exact solution to Equation (5). This equation has many solutions, and in Equation (7) we choose the one that minimizes the l^2 norm of the vector field. One could replace the vector field update in (7) with a vector field satisfying (5) with minimal T-norm. We have been able to produce smaller vector fields in this way, however, in our experience the resulting vector fields tend to be visually less satisfying. This has to do with the vector directions being determined only by the signs of the entries from Equation (6).\n\nIn this context, we would like to point out that it is not so clear when a deformation is too large, and thus it is difficult to decide on a box-constraint. We decided to reject vector fields of T-norm greater than 3 in order to have a credible, quantifiable measure of the success rate of ADef. In general, smooth deformations of size less than 3 should not change the semantic meaning of an MNIST image, but this condition can be relaxed immensely with higher dimension. Nevertheless, we chose to use the same criterion for ImageNet, simply because the vast majority of deformations fall below this very low threshold of 3. With this in mind, we think the entire distribution of the vector field norms are of interest, and hence we include Appendix A."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper461/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper461/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper461/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ADef: an Iterative Algorithm to Construct Adversarial Deformations", "abstract": "While deep neural networks have proven to be a powerful tool for many recognition and classification tasks, their stability properties are still not well understood.

", "review": "The paper introduces an iterative method to generate deformed images for adversarial attack. The core idea is to perturb the correctly classified image by iteratively applying small deformations, which are estimated based on a first-order approximation step, until the image is misclassified. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets (MNIST, ImageNet) and commonly used deep nets (CNN, ResNet, Inception) are reported to show the power of adversarial deformations. \n\nThe idea of gradually adding deformations based on gradient information is somewhat interesting, and novel as far as the reviewer knows about. The method is clearly presented and the results are mostly easy to access.  However, the intuition behind the proposal does not make strong sense to the reviewer: since the main focus of this work is on model attack, why not directly (iteratively or not) adding random image deformations to fool the system? Particularly, the first-order approximation strategy (as shown in Eq.4 and Eq.5) is quite confusing. On one side (see Eq.4), the deformation \\tau should be small enough in scale to make an accurate approximation. On the other side (see Eq. 5), \\tau is required to be sufficiently large in order to generate misclassification. Such seemingly conflicting rules for estimating the deformation makes the proposed method less rigorous in math. \nAs another downside, the related adversarial training procedure is not fully addressed. The authors briefly discussed this point in the experiment section and provided a few numerical results in Table 2. These results, as acknowledged by the authors, do not well support the effectiveness of deformation adversarial attack and defense. In the meanwhile, the mentioned adversarial training framework follows straightforwardly from PGD (Madry et al. 2018), and thus the novelty of this contribution is also weak. More importantly, it is not clear at all, both in theory and algorithm, whether the advocated gradual deformation attack and defense can be unified inside a joint min-max/max-min learning formulation, as what PGD is rooted from.\n\nPros: \n\n- The way of constructing deformation adversarial is interesting and novel\n- The paper is mostly clearly organized and presented.\n\nCons:\n\n- The motivation of approach is questionable. \n- The related adversarial training problem remains largely unaddressed.\n- Numerical study shows some promise in adversarial attack, but is not supportive to the related defense capability.

I found my main concerns reasonably clarified in this feedback, especially the concern on adversarial training. However, I am still a bit worried about solving Equation (5) in a way of unconstrained least-squares, which clearly does not guarantee to generate small deformation \\tau as required for accurate first-order approximation. It is good to know from the response that in most cases in practice very small vector fields can be found to approximately satisfy Equation (5). My question (for discussion) here is: if this is the case, then why not imposing a box-constraint on \\tau so as to explicitly enforce small deformation when solving (5)? I believe using such a box-constrained quadratic program could make the entire framework more rigorous in reasoning. Nevertheless, given that my major concerns are satisfactorily addressed and in view of the positive opinions from fellow reviewer, I will not be opposed to accepting the paper with further modifications. In the meanwhile, I also would like to hear from the author(s) about the above discussion point.

Its positive nature is much appreciated. In the following, we hope we can address each of your concern.\n\nWe believe that the idea of moving from perturbations to deformations is substantial. In addition, the derivation of ADef is much less straightforward than the derivation of algorithms for adversarial perturbations because of the nonlinearity of the problem, as is evident from the mathematical details included in Appendix C. To address your specific comments on the discussion in the paper:\n\n1. Your comment \u201cone can see on MNIST the parts of the numbers that the adversarial attack is trying to delete/create\u201d is an interesting observation. We would be happy to point this out in the text. It would most appropriately fit in Appendix B.1, with the images that show this effect. We will add to appendix B.1: \u201cObserve that in some cases, features resembling the target class have appeared in the deformed image. For example, the top part of the 4 in the fifth column of figure 8 has been curved slightly to more resemble a 9.\u201d\n\n2. Showing quantitative results for varying width of the Gaussian filter is certainly of interest. We are preparing a short section on this issue, to be included in the appendices. These changes will be implemented as soon as possible, and the anonymized document updated.\n\n3. One could come up with a variation of ADef to induce high confidence adversarial deformations. However, we consider targeted ADef to be the more important variant of our algorithm. In order not to complicate the presentation, we choose to discuss only the latter.\n\n4. It should be stated explicitly in the paper that we use bilinear interpolation in our implementation. We do not expect the choice of interpolation to be of much consequence for high dimensional images, and including a study of this choice runs the risk of obscuring the main purpose of the paper. We will change the MNIST and ImageNet paragraphs on page 5 as follows: \u201cIt performs smoothing by a Gaussian filter of standard deviation 1/2, uses bilinear interpolation to obtain intermediate pixel intensities, and it overshoots [...]\u201d and \u201cIt employs a Gaussian filter of standard deviation 1, bilinear interpolation, and an overshoot [...]\u201d.\n\n5. The question of convergence is interesting. However, we believe that the clear mathematical motivation and the effectiveness of ADef against existing models justifies the formulation of the algorithm sufficiently. Given the changes in the objective function you have noted, and potential nonlinearity in the update step we do not expect proof of convergence to be straightforward, and such an investigation might unnecessarily complicate the simple message of the paper: there exist small adversarial deformations, and an efficient way to find them.\n\n6. We agree that the overshoot factor (1+\\eta) is not very elegant, and that is why we only invoke it when ADef converges to a decision boundary. In practice, it works well to avoid ambiguous predictions. Likewise, in practice \\tau* = \\sum_i \\tau_i is a helpful proxy to quickly estimate the total vector field, and relies on the (observed) facts that the individual steps are small and that few iterations are needed.\n\n7. Thank you for pointing out the phrasing of the remark at the end of section 2.3. It should be understood as \"provided that \\nabla f is moderate\", and will be fixed in the revision.\n\n8. We do not have timing of the experiments, but it is indeed reasonable, and large scale experiments on high dimensional images are not prohibitive. We would like to point out that our code is available online, albeit not on an anonymous platform.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper461/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper461/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper461/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ADef: an Iterative Algorithm to Construct Adversarial Deformations", "abstract": "While deep neural networks have proven to be a powerful tool for many recognition and classification tasks, their stability properties are still not well understood.

We agree that quantitative experiments with different interpolation schemes would not have improved our contribution. However, experiments with different levels of smoothing may be of interest, and we will add them to the appendix soon (in addition to the example shown in Figure 2).\n\nTo clarify the interpretation of Table 1, we have now included in the caption a reference to Equation 3, which defines the T-norm of vector fields. In the case of Inception, an average deforming vector field displaces all pixels by less than 0.59 pixels. That is only 0.59/299 = 0.2% of the image width.\n\nWe agree that it is interesting that training with PGD provides better protection against ADef, than training with ADef. We find it quite remarkable that PGD training, which only considers small additive perturbations, can (to a degree) resist deformations, which in general correspond to large additive perturbations. However, we remark that it is unclear what the effect of ADef training is in terms of the geometry of the input space, while it is clear from Madry et al.

Your critique revolves around two issues, motivation of algorithm and adversarial training, both of which we believe can be addressed by the following clarification.\n\nMotivation of algorithm:\n1. Deforming images by small random vector fields does not in general induce misclassification. This mirrors the fact that adding a random noise mask to an image usually does not change the predicted label (see for example [3]). For an adversarial attack to be effective, the image transformation has to be selected carefully.\n2. Unless the derivative of the classifier in question is very small, Eq. 5 does not require the vector field \\tau to be large. On the contrary, the experiments show that in the overwhelming majority of cases we find very small vector fields that satisfy this condition. In the derivation of the algorithm, we do not guarantee the existence of adversarial deformations. We simply say that if there exists a suitably small vector field that satisfies Eq. 5, then (by Eq. 4) the corresponding deformed image will be misclassified. In Eq. 7, we give a formula for a vector field that satisfies Eq. 5, and turns out to be small most of the time. This is a common line of reasoning in the literature of adversarial attacks: moving iteratively in the direction of the classifier\u2019s gradient increases the chances of finding small adversarial transformations. We specifically point to the DeepFool attack for perturbations by Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. [2], which inspired our construction of deformations.\n\nAdversarial training:\n1. When evaluating the effectiveness of a new adversarial attack, one may wonder if models that are specifically designed to resist adversarial examples are also robust to the new attack. To our knowledge, the PGD adversarial training procedure of Madry et al. [1] is the best defense against adversarial examples on MNIST. We show that this defense method is not sufficient to achieve robustness to adversarial deformations. \n2. A natural question is whether this kind of adversarial training can be adapted to resist adversarial deformations. As a first step in that direction, we show that doing this in the most straightforward way, by replacing PGD with ADef in the training loop, does not yield better results. We do not propose this as a novel method for adversarial training. The current work focuses on introducing the new attack method, and it is beyond the scope of the paper to formulate rigorously a defense strategy to combat it.\n\n[1] A. Madry, A. Makelov, L.

This remark is important in that it changes my rating of the paper (being more indulgent with papers proposing new ideas, as otherwise the novelty is rather low compared to [Xiao and al.]).\n\nPros:\n- the paper is well written, very easy to read, well explained (and better formalized than [Xiao and al.]);\n- the idea of deforming images is new (if we forget about [Xiao and al.]) and simple;\n- experiments show what such a technique can achieve on MNIST and ImageNet. Interestingly, one can see on MNIST the parts of the numbers that the adversarial attack is trying to delete/create.\n\nCons:\n- the paper is a bit weak, in that it is not very dense, and in that there is not much more content than the initial idea;\n- for instance, more discussions about the results obtained could have been appreciated (such as my remark above about MNIST);\n- for instance, a study of the impact of the regularization would have been interesting (how does the sigma of the Gaussian smoothing affect the type of adversarial attacks obtained and their performance -- is it possible to fool the network with [very] smooth deformations?);\n- for instance, what about generating adversarial examples for which the network would be fully (wrongly) confident? (instead of just borderline unsure); etc.\n- The interpolation scheme (how is defined the intensity I(x,y) for a non-integer location (x,y) within the image I) is rather important (linear interpolation, etc.) and should be at least mentioned in the main paper, and at best studied (it might impact the gradient descent path and the results);\n- question: does the algorithm converge? could there be a proof of this? This is not obvious, as the objective potentially changes with time (selection of the current m best indices k of |F_k - F_l|). Also, the final overshoot factor (1+eta) is not very elegant, and not guaranteed to perform well if tau* starts being not small compared to the second derivative (i.e. g''.tau^2 not small) while I guess that for image intensities, spatial derivatives can be very high if no intensity smoothing scheme is used.\n- note: the approximation tau* = sum_i tau_i (section 2.3) does not stand in the case of non-small deformations.\n- still in section 2.3, I do not understand the statement \"given that \\nabla f is moderate\": where does this property come from? or is \"given\" meant to be understood as \"provided...\" (i.e. under the assumption that...)?\n- computational times could have been given (though I guess they are reasonable).\n\nOther remarks:\n- suggestion: I find the \"slight abuse of notation\" (of confusing the derivative with the gradient) a bit annoying and suggest to use a different symbol, such as \\nabla g. This could be useful in particular in the following perspective:\n- Mathematical side note: the \"gradient\" of a functional is not a uniquely-defined object in that it depends on the metric chosen in the tangent space. More clearly: the space of small deformations tau comes with an inner product (here L2, but one could choose another one), and the gradient \\nabla g obtained depends on this inner product choice M, even though the derivative Dg is the same (they are related by Dg(tau) = < \\nabla_M g | tau >_M for any tau). The choice of the metric can then be seen as a prior over desired gradient descent paths. In the paper, the deformation fields get smoothed by a Gaussian filter at some point (eq. 7), in order to be smoother: this can be interpreted as a prior (gradient descent paths should be made of smooth deformations) and as an associated inner product change (there do exist a metric M such that the gradient for that metric is \\nabla_M g = S \\nabla_L2 g). It is possible to favor other kind of deformations (not just smooth ones, but for instance rigid ones, etc. [and by the way this could make the link with \"Manitest: Are classifiers really invariant?\" by Fawzi and Frossard, BMVC 2015, who observe that a rigid motion can affect the classifier output]). If interested, you can check \"Generalized Gradients: Priors on Minimization Flows\" by Charpiat et al. for general inner products on deformations (in particular favoring rigid motion), and \"Sobolev active contours\" by Sundaramoorthi et al. for inner products more dedicated to smoothing (such as with the H1 norm).\n- Note: about the remark in section 3.2: deformation-induced transformations are a subset of all possible transformations of the image (which are all representable with intensity changes), so it is expected that a training against attacks on the intensity performs better than a training against attacks on spatial deformations.\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper461/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ADef: an Iterative Algorithm to Construct Adversarial Deformations", "abstract": "While deep neural networks have proven to be a powerful tool for many recognition and classification tasks, their stability properties are still not well understood.
