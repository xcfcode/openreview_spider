Model based is a family of methods. Some specific methods/implementations may suffer more from the model bias than the others. However, generalizing that Q-value function methods are more robust to the ones that are built on top of policy gradient is simply inaccurate and unfounded.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly possible that we can extract a parametric policy from the optimization that MPC performs but this is an indirect process. Indirect training may lead to loss of accuracy. Furthermore, training a parametric policy from an MPC policy can only be done after having a final MPC policy and hence doesn't alleviate the problem of having to do solve the hard optimization problem during the decision time.\n\nYour claim that \u201cThe MPC will transfer better to other tasks that have the same dynamics, since it is not task specific ...\u201d is not true and mischaracterizes our method. There are two ways to do task transfers: \nOne is the dynamics model. All model-based methods, including ours, support this concept. Dynamics model transfer has nothing to do with MPC.\nAnother is the policy transfer. Two similar tasks may induce two similar policies. Hence, it\u2019s worthwhile being able to transfer the policy. MPC is an implicit policy, by way of solving an optimization problem each time the agent has to make a decision, and therefore harder to do policy transfer. \n\n# Related work\nWe thought that we had covered all relevant related work. It\u2019s true that \u201crisk-sensitive\u201d and \u201coptimization in the face of uncertainty\u201d are not novel terminologies. Those are just ambiguous labels. According to our best knowledge, the way that we fully quantify the uncertainty of the value function estimate, via the uncertainty of the model, and the way that we combine return and risk in a unified objective function is unique in the literature of RL.\n\nWe would appreciate if you can highlight some relevant related work that we should add to our references.\n\n# Uncertainty-Aware Model-Based Policy Optimization\nWhile each component (risk-sensitive objective, bootstraps, rollout) of POUM is well studied, the primary contribution of this work is to combine rollouts techniques and bootstrap models to fully propagate uncertainty into value function V(\\pi)(s). Then V(\\pi)(s) is transformed into a deterministic utility function U(\\pi)(s) that reflects a subjective measure balancing the risk and return.\n \nNote that policy gradient is not a method. In the context of our paper, policy gradient denotes a class of policy optimization methods that rely on computing the gradient of the V as a function of \\pi. \n\nOur method of computing the policy gradient is entirely different from all prior policy gradient works (REINFORCE, TRPO, PPO, etc.). To our knowledge, no method has tried to compute the policy gradient by backprop through the chained models (dynamics model, policy model, and reward model).\n\nUsing a deterministic policy is not a key idea of the paper and we didn\u2019t claim that it's a novelty. In section 3.3.2: we only argued for this choice. While all estimations, including that of the dynamics model and of the  value function, need to be stochastic, i.e. uncertainty aware, the policy does not need to be. Deterministic policy simply means that the agent is consistent when taking an action, no matter how uncertain it may be about the world.\n\n===========\n#Experiment\n===========\nWe compare our algorithm to two model-based methods: MBPO and STEVE. There are also other works on MBRL including ME-TRPO [6],  PETS [7], MB-MPO [8]..., but their public implementations couldn\u2019t run on standard OpenAI gym environments that we rely on. For instance, several of them relied on the modified MuJoCo environments in RLLab, which makes it easier to train an agent on Half Cheetah. \n\nHence, we couldn\u2019t do a fair comparison against those methods. \n\nAs an aside, this paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02057v1] is another example of why benchmarking many model-based RL methods is not easy and has been published as a standalone paper.

It is indeed that the model details are important in practice. We chose to not highlight the model details to emphasize what we think more novel and more important: the policy optimization framework based on an uncertainty-aware model.\n\nFor our model, it is not very different from [PETS, MBPO] except that:\n- We use bootstrap learning instead of ensemble learning: we don\u2019t just learn models with different initializations but those models are also learned from different datasets.  In our work, we only maintained and grew different datasets corresponding to different models completely independently. \t\t\n- We don't model the aleatoric uncertainty. In fact, in the MuJoCo environments that we experiment, the true dynamics is fully deterministic and there's no aleatoric uncertainty.\n\n==========================\n#Dependence on random seeds:\n==========================\nIt also worries us that the variance of our method is quite high. It's the top priority that we would like to address in future work. So in this paper, we\u2019d rather highlight the fact that our novel and principled method can yield great results, although some implementation details still need to be polished.\n\n===========================\n#The best policy is risk *averse*:\n===========================\nThe risk-preference \u201cc\u201d being negative doesn't quite mean that the agent is not exploring. It just means that the agent still explores but is more conservative when exploring.\n\nSaid differently, our best agents, in our limited experimental studies, are the ones that do safe exploration.\n\n==================\n#Deterministic policy:\n==================\nMaking V(pi) easier was not the main point for treating \\pi deterministic.\n\nWe simply think that there's no good reason for treating \\pi stochastic. \\pi being deterministic simply means that the decision making, for each situation, is consistent. A rational agent should not make a decision that is dependent on coin tossing. Even a highly exploratory strategy should be deterministic and purely conditional on the current state.\n\n===============\n#Other questions:\n===============\nIn the algorithm, we update bootstrap model f^{b}_i on bootstrap dataset D_i, and update r_{\\phi} on the single replay buffer D.\n\nThe reward data is only used to learn the reward model, which in turn is used in the value function estimate (the policy update relies on computing the gradient of the V_{\\pi}(s) as a function of \\pi). In estimating V_{\\pi}(s), we generate trajectories using the dynamics model. However, the estimated rewards along those trajectories are needed to compute the value function.\n\nExplanation of Table 2:\nf_i means each bootstrap network for learning the dynamics model\nr_{\\phi} means reward network.\nPolicy \\pi_{\\theta}.\nExample for environment Reacher-v2: [13, 256, 128, 11] means:\nInput of network has size of 13.\nOutput of network has size of 11.\nNetwork contains two hidden layers with size of 256, 128 consequently.\n\n=========\n#Summary:\n=========\nTo the best of our literature research, this is the first MBRL work that formulates the objective, fully represented by the model and the policy, as a utility function (that balances return and risk).  The optimization is consistent with that objective function and the gradient is computed can be computed analytically (via backprop through the models). \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper871/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper871/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["longvt94@vnu.edu.vn", "hann1@andrew.cmu.edu", "htpham@cs.cmu.edu", "ktran@microsoft.com"], "title": "Policy Optimization In the Face of Uncertainty", "authors": ["Tung-Long Vuong", "Han Nguyen", "Hai Pham", "Kenneth Tran"], "pdf": "/pdf/6ed6f44745b6c760e5c7bb969760fcfd9ed521f1.pdf", "abstract": "Model-based reinforcement learning has the potential to be more sample efficient than model-free approaches.

Since each bootstrap model as an independent approximator of the dynamics function, by expanding the value function via these dynamics approximators, we obtain independent estimates of the value function. These separate and independent trajectories collect tively form an ensemble estimator of V(\\pi)(s). \nConsequently,  the uncertainty of models is propagated into the estimate of V(\\pi)(s).\n\n# How we estimate V(\\pi)(s) has no connection to MPC. \nOur overall method resolves the limitations of MPC by representing the optimal policy by a parametric policy (neural network). We optimize this policy using policy gradient computation. Unlike other traditional policy gradient methods, which are mostly model-free, our method computes the policy gradient by estimating V(\\pi) analytically and then use backpropagation for computing the gradient. Our method allows computing the gradient for an arbitrary point s in S since V(\\pi) is fully expressed via the models (dynamics model, policy model, and reward model).\n\n=======================\n# Equation 2 and Equation 5:\n=======================\nWe are sorry about the confusion.

However there remain significant issues with the paper that preclude me giving a good score. Firstly, there is almost no discussion of the environment model. Anyone who has worked on Model Based RL will tell you that the details here are crucial. This deserves a full discussion, and a comparison to other methods in the literature.\n\nNext, the experimental results really aren't convincing. The dependence on random seeds is worrying, and isn't as common in model free algorithms as you claim, which are mostly robust to seeds (the good ones at least). The fact that the best policy is risk *averse* is very strange, since these are estimates combining both the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty (which is somewhat unfortunate), which means being risk averse would lead the agent to not explore. That is very worrying and makes me think that something very strange is going on with the models. In fact since the policy is deterministic and the environment / rewards are practically speaking deterministic, the uncertainty here is actually mostly epistemic and so a c < 0 means the agent is disincentivized from exploring.\n\nThere should be more discussion about the fact that the policy is deterministic. Is this merely to make estimating V^pi easier?\n\n\"Next, we provide a convergence convergence analysis and show that maximizing this utility function\nU(\u03c0) is equivalent to maximizing the unknown value function V (\u03c0).\"\n\nWord convergence appears twice in a row, but more importantly this is totally missing! Where is the analysis?\n\nIn the algorithm you write:\n\"Update {fb} and r\u02c6\u03c6 using SGD\"\nBut on what data? Presumably sampled from D but this isn't mentioned.\n\nIs it the case that the policy is updated *only* using the model based rollouts? I.e., the reward signal is never used in the policy gradient but only used to train the models? If so, this seems quite fragile and I would like to see a comparison of different approaches here.\n\nTable 2 is unreadable and needs to be explained.\n\nIt would appear that you are missing a reference to the very relevant UBE paper, which also deals explicitly with the uncertainty of the value function estimates: https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05380\nIn fact I would be curious to see any way that these two approaches could be combined (though that would be follow up work).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper871/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper871/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["longvt94@vnu.edu.vn", "hann1@andrew.cmu.edu", "htpham@cs.cmu.edu", "ktran@microsoft.com"], "title": "Policy Optimization In the Face of Uncertainty", "authors": ["Tung-Long Vuong", "Han Nguyen", "Hai Pham", "Kenneth Tran"], "pdf": "/pdf/6ed6f44745b6c760e5c7bb969760fcfd9ed521f1.pdf", "abstract": "Model-based reinforcement learning has the potential to be more sample efficient than model-free approaches.

Hence, a proper characterization of the uncertainty is needed. However, the model-based methods that suffer the most of this problem are the ones that are build on top of policy gradients (since they need to predict the entire trajectory) (e.g., [6]). The methods that learn a Q-value function from the model do not suffer as much from this problem since they just predict shorter horizons. Current model-based RL methods that learn a Q or value-function take into account the uncertainty (i.e., STEVE, MBPO). Those methods are not \u201cless competitive in terms of asymptotic performance.\u201d \n\nThere has been work on learning a parametric policy from MPC. Therefore, you can extract a parametric policy from the optimization that MPC performs. The statement \u201cNot being able to explicitly represent the policy makes it hard to transfer the learned policy to other tasks or to initialize agents with an existing better-than-random policy\u201d is not true. The MPC will transfer better to other tasks that have the same dynamics, since it is not task specific. Given the learned dynamics model and the reward function you can act optimally in any new task as long as the learned dynamics are valid.\n\n# Related work\nMy main concern with the related work section is that there a lot of literature on risk sensitive and optimism in the face of uncertainty (which is a subset of your method when c>0) in control, bandits, and some on *reinforcement learning* that has been neglected. \n\n# Uncertainty-Aware Model-Based Policy Optimization\nAs said before, risk-sensitive in reinforcement learning has been done before and there\u2019s even more work on control and bandits. For instance in [1] (page 5, paragraph (b)) has the same equation and they discuss the effect of the constant being negative or positive. More recent work has also used similar formulations [2].\nThis section mostly contains previous work, e.g., bootstrap rollout, policy gradient, using a deterministic policy ([3, 4, 5]). One thing that it\u2019s still not clear from reading the paper, are you backpropagating the through the dynamics model, are you using a policy gradient method (REINFORCE, TRPO, PPO,\u2026 )?\n\n# Algorithm Summary\nOne of the novelties introduced is the fact that the data used in each model comes from sampling a Poisson variable. However, this is not ablated in the results sections. Is it necessary? [6] Claims that there\u2019s no need to use different data for the learned models.\n\n# Experiment\nThe experiment section lacks from more complex environments, in this case the most complex is half-cheetah. Furthermore, given that 3 of the tasks are short horizon tasks you should probably also compare against model-based methods that build on top of policy gradients (e.g., [6]). \n\nIt seems that some choices in the algorithm are not ablated: 1) use of poisson, 2) use of deterministic vs stochastic policy, 3) Is there a single risk that works across environments? Which environments are risk prone/adverse? 4) How about having c ~ N(0, 1), effectively modelling V as a gaussian?\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nOverall, the paper is not mature enough to be accepted: there is not enough novelty, and the results lack of novelty, enough delta in performance from prior work, and have high variance.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nMinor/Typos:\nFirst paragraph: \u201ctrying model the transition\u201d\nWhat does it mean that the accuracy is not satisfied?\nWhy the related work on deep model-based reinforcement learning is called Deep Neural Networks?\n3.2 third paragraph: \u201cNext we provide a convergence convergence \u2026\u201d\n3.3.2, first paragraph: \u201cno matter how uncertain it may know about the world\u201d\nWhy the axis in the results section mean different things?\n\n\n\n[1] Risk-sensitive Reinforcement Learning.

In addition to being theoretically sound, our approach shows promising results on challenging continuous control benchmarks with competitive asymptotic performance and sample complexity compared to state-of-the-art baselines.", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Model-based Reinforcement Learning"], "paperhash": "vuong|policy_optimization_in_the_face_of_uncertainty", "original_pdf": "/attachment/166b4ec42df15903574c2bc988f2dc73e7163472.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nvuong2020policy,\ntitle={Policy Optimization In the Face of Uncertainty},\nauthor={Tung-Long Vuong and Han Nguyen and Hai Pham and Kenneth Tran},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJg3Rp4FwH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
