For example, the class label description can be a sequence of words in many real-world tasks, but there is no mechanism in the proposed model to handle such class labels. \n\nGiven the above counter example, it seems to me that the proposed model could only be guaranteed to work well on tasks, where the class labels are similar to SEO tags. In that sense, the problem is more like a recommender system (with out-of-vocabulary items) instead of zero-shot learning. While the proposed method is quite standard in the field of recommender systems.\n\nAs a result, I think the \"train once, test anywhere\" in the title is over claiming so I suggest the authors change the title.
