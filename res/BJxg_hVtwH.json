We have revised our paper and please kindly check it.\n\n1. First of all, we wish to point out the fact that our proposed method shares the same o(n^3) complexity with many advanced graph pooling techniques, such as SortPool [1], DiffPool [2] and SAGPool [3]. The main reason is that all of these methods involve GCN computations in the pooling and the computational complexity for 1-layer GCN is o(n^3). Thus, any GCN based pooling method will have the o(n^3) computational complexity.  \nIn terms of computational complexity, adding our Structpool layer is similar to stacking GCN layers. We analyze the computational complexity in Section 3.4 and 4.4. For 500 graphs from large-scale dataset D&D, the averaging time cost to perform pooling for each graph for Diffpool is 0.042s while our method takes 0.049 seconds, 0.053 second and 0.058 second for different numbers of iterations in mean-field approximation (m= 1,3,5). Our computation time is slightly higher but given our superior performance, we believe our cost is reasonable and acceptable. Note that we also show that even with m=1, our method yields very good performance. \n\n2. Thanks for the suggestion. We conduct experiments to compare single pooling layer vs multiple pooling layers. Let\u2019s define that 1 block contains 2 GCNs and 1 pooling. Then we compare three different models: 1 block + classifier, 2 blocks + classifier, and 3 blocks + classifier. We evaluate these three models on a large-scale dataset D&D and a small dataset Proteins. The results are reported in Appendix A.3. For the dataset Proteins, we observe that the network with one block can obtain better performance than deeper networks. We believe the main reason is dataset Proteins is a small-scale dataset with an average number of nodes equal to 39.06. A relatively simpler network is powerful enough to learn its data distribution while stacking multiple GCN layers and pooling layers leads to a serious overfitting problem. For the dataset D\\&D, the network with 2 blocks performs better than the one with 1 block. Since D\\&D is relatively large scale, stacking 2 blocks increases the power of the network and hence increases the performance. However, going very deep, e.g., stacking 3 blocks, will cause the overfitting problem.\n\n3. We follow the DGCNN paper [1] to select the number of clusters $k$. Specifically, we use a pooling rate $(0<r<1)$ to control $k$. Then $k$ is set to an integer so that $r*100\\%$ of graphs have nodes less than this integer in the current dataset. As suggested in DGCNN, generally, $r=0.9$ is a proper choice for bioinformatics datasets and $r=0.6$ is good for social network datasets. In addition, we conduct experiments to show the performance w.r.t. different $k$ values. We set $r= 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9$ to evaluate the performance on a large-scale social network dataset D&D. The results are reported in Appendix A.4. We observe that the performance drops when $r, k$ is too large or small. In addition, we expect the model to have competitive performance when $r$ is set to a proper range, for example, $r\\in[0.3,0.7]$ for dataset D&D.\n\n[1].

Given a matrix X containing n examples and each has d dimensional features. We set $n=100$ and record the computational time for different values for $d$, i.e. $d= 100, 200, 300, 400, 500$. The results are reported as follow. For each $d$ value, we run 1000 times and report the average.\ndimension d   ---- 100      -----     200     -----300   -----400       ------500\nGaussian----------5.84e-4 --   6.62e-4  --6.74e-4   --8.40e-4    --9.57e-4\nAttention---------4.89e-5  --   5.15e-5  --5.59e-5   --7.98e-5    --8.68e-5\nOverall, employing attention could improve the computational cost significantly.\n\n2. The unary energy is directly computed using GCNs from node features, which means the connectivity of G is explicitly incorporated. In addition, the pairwise is obtained via attention from node features, where we also incorporate the $A^{\\ell}$ to consider ${\\ell}$-hop connectivity. From our experiments, the dense CRF version always leads to very promising performance. Hence, we believe, generally, increasing ${\\ell}$ can lead to better cluster assignments. \n\n3. We conduct experiments to study how different $k$ values affect the performance. We follow the DGCNN paper [1] to select the number of clusters $k$. Specifically, we use a pooling rate $(0<r<1)$ to control $k$. Then $k$ is set to an integer so that $r*100\\%$ of graphs have nodes less than this integer in the current dataset.

In addition, we expect the model to have competitive performance when $r$ is set to a proper range, for example, $r\\in[0.3,0.7]$ for dataset D&D.\n\n4. For the case of different graph features and different graph substructures, it depends on how the GNNs learn and make predictions. It is possible that nodes with different features are clustered in a different way. For example, for the concept network motifs, the nodes in a network motif can be different, but these nodes are combined together to determine the type of the whole graph. In MUTAG dataset, network motifs can be carbon rings, NH2, and NO2, and are highly related to the mutagenic property adn can determine graph label. If the GNNs are trained to make predictions based on network motifs, different nodes in a network motif can be clustered into one cluster. This is our intuitive thought and we believe GNN interpretation techniques are needed if we wish to fully understand the problem. \n\n5. For the case of repeating instances or repeating instances with different labels, it is related to the data quality. It is a general problem/challenge for all deep models, including our method. If repeating instances have the same label, it can be understood as the unbalanced data problem. \nWe can use data preprocessing, data augmentation, weighted loss, or dropout to train better models. If the repeating instances are with different labels and data preprocessing cannot solve it, we believe all GNN models will be affected. \n\n6. Thanks for the suggestion.

Recent work in pooling does not take advantage of important structural information of the relationship between different  nodes. Here, the authors formulate  graph pooling as a structured prediction problem, control clique set in the CRFs and use mean filed approximation to calculate assignments. \n\nA cluster assignment matrix assigns each node in the original graph to a cluster in the new graph. The assignment not only depends on the node features but also on the cluster assignment of the other nodes. The authors therefore draw connection with finding the optimal assignment to minimizing the Gibbs energy. The authors propose to learn clustering assignment via CRF conditioned on the global feature representation of the nodes.\n\nThe unary potentials of the cliques are computed used the GCN to measure energy of each node. The novelty in accommodating topology information is in using l hop connectivity based on adjacency A to define pairwise cliques thus building pairwise relationship between pairs of nodes thus allowing the Gibbs energy formulation of the cluster assignment thereby using GCN to also compute this pairwise energy. \n\nI have  a few questions as below:\nI think the authors can better elucidate the motivation for using  the attention matrix over Gaussian kernels to measure pairwise energy in section 3.3; an  empirical experiment for drawing comparison wrt to the computational time and number of feature dimensions on a toy problem seems important. \nHow is the computation  of the unary potential and pairwise energy influenced by the connectivity of the graph G for the datasets considered? It would be interesting to see how the pairwise energy, unary energy varies over different layers of GCNs. \nFurther, how is the cluster assignment affected by the l-hop connectivity? \nIs there a notion of the minimum value of \u2018k\u2019 in the context of convergence?\nWhat happens in case of very different graph features, or structural assumptions where the cliques are not enforced? \nIs there a notion of how the method performs on datasets with a high percentage of isomorphism bias: repeating instances or repeating instances with different labels?\nIt will be interesting to see a discussion on how the performance varies with respect to the depth of the overall architecture,  positioning of the structpool and some results on how effective they are on  hierarchical features and multiple pooling ops as in architectures such as Graph UNet.\nAvoid repetition in 2.2 Related work section and in other sections throughout.

Different from existing pooling methods, the proposed model explicitly captures high-order structural relationships between nodes via a CRF, and the pairwise energy in the CRF is defined by a $l$-hop connection instead of the original neighborhoods. The paper is written clearly, and the experimental results are good. The sensitivity analysis is also complete.\n\nIntegrating CRFs with GNNs for node classification is not new ([1][2][3]), but this paper extended energy definition to capture high-order connections and use it for a new subsequent task: graph pooling. It is interesting and novel, but maybe not very significant. (BTW, it is better to add the related works which combined CRF and GNNs, considering the close connection to this paper.)\n\nThe sensitivity analysis in the paper is very useful, but it lacks one important ablation study. To justify the usefulness of CRFs instead of other clustering methods for node assignment, I think there should be a baseline which removes the pairwise energy and just use the unary energy for node clustering. Moreover, the paper may also need to compare with a more recent state-of-the-art pooling model SAGPool [4].\n\n\n[1]Gao, H., Pei, J., & Huang, H. (2019).
