We address your concerns in detail below.\n\nReviewer 3: \u201cThe model employed Laplace approximation for posterior distribution. Not quite sure this is a good idea for the Bernoulli case since Laplace approximation is trying to use Gaussian distribution to approximate the region around the mode. \u201d\n\nIndeed, the Laplace approximation, VB and sampling-based methods are three most widely-used algorithms for resolving the probability density functions. Whereas, our work mainly focuses on the issue of parameter estimation, which aims to compute the value of co-occurrence probabilities and sentiment probabilities. For the approaches of parameter estimation, the probability density function does not have to obey the Gaussian distribution. Besides, for each target word, extracting its contexts and sentiment polarities can be regarded as independent random experiments.\n\nReviewer 3: \u201cHow will the MAP solution compare with a full Bayesian solution such as VB or sampling-based methods?\u201d\n\nIn this work, the primary issue to address is the parameter estimation instead of the probability density function. As such, the VB and sampling-based methods are not considered currently.\n\nReviewer 3: \u201cNormally prior information will be washed away as the training data grow. Not the case for the low frequency examples that the model performed well on. \u201d\n\nI don't particularly understand what you mean?\n\nReviewer 3: \u201cWould it possible that the improved performance on low frequency example is just a side effect of the biased introduced by the prior? \u201d\n\nThe introduction of the prior information can certainly cause the working performance improvement. In this work, the Bayesian estimating method is taken to extract the sentiment information of the low frequency words and proved to be effective.

We address your concerns in detail below.\n\nReviewer 2: \u201c...why we need Dirichlet prior for the sentiment variable.\u201d\n\nSince we mainly work on the sentiment information of the low-frequency words, the Bayesian estimation is taken to compute the sentiment probabilities and incorporate them into the loss function. By using the prior information, the small samples such as low frequency words with less information, are used to better converging to the true value [1].\n\nThe reason for using Dirichlet prior is that the Dirichlet distribution is a conjugate prior of multiple distributions in Bayesian probability theory. In the manuscript, we also mention the Dirichlet-Multinomial conjugate structure. In addition, the Beta prior corresponds to the Beta distribution, which is a conjugate prior to the binomial distribution.\n\nReviewer 2: \u201cWhile the claim is to learn better embeddings for rare words, the experiments show that the proposed methods have similar results to the previous work. The only gain we can observe is in the sentence-level experiments in which other factors could affect the performance. Thus, it is hard to draw a supportive conclusion.\n\u201d\n\nIn the experiments, we have to admit that the word-level sentiment analysis for low-frequency words has a similar outcome compared to the previous work in MPQA lexicons. However, for the NRC sentiment lexicons, the BESWE outperforms other baseline models. Further, in the testing of Sentence-level sentiment for low-frequency sentences and the Word similarity, our method is proved to be a comparable alternative. Therefore, the proposed model BESWE validates its effectiveness in computing the sentiment probabilities. Yet it is impossible to have a perfect experiment to cover all the properties of the proposed model. We just focus on the aspects we are interested in at this stage. More research is still ongoing to show its working performance and in turn optimize the current model.\n\nReviewer 2: \u201cI do not think eq 2 is a representative of how the paper train the model, nor attempt to compare with. \n\u201d\n\nEq 2 in this paper is to show how to convey the GloVe model by using the maximum likelihood estimation instead of representing the training model of our method. By integrating the parameter estimation principle and the word embedding model in previous work, the proposed method can be illustrated in a easier manner.\n\nReviewer 2: \u201c..., in section 3.2 and 3.3, the re-derivation is not particularly helpful. I think the paper should put more emphasis on the novelty of the work. \u201d\n\nThe co-occurrence probability derivation in Section 3.2 tend to better express the co-occurrence probabilities based on the principle of maximum likelihood estimation. This part is valuable for delivering our model but is not illustrated in GloVe. Other equations in Section 3.2 and 3.3 are for comprehensively deriving the loss function, incorporating the sentiment information to our model. Notably, the employment of the sentiment information is a novel process in our work. \n\nOnce again, thanks for your time and your attention. \n\nReferences\n[1] Phoong S Y, Ismail M T.

The proposed method extends from D-GloVe by adding the probability of positive sentiment to the loss function. The paper presents three experiments: word similarity, word-level sentiment analysis, and sentence-level sentiment analysis. The experiments show that the method performs comparably with other baseline methods and outperforms in the low-frequency sentence setting (i.e. sentence containing lower frequency words).\n\nI recommend rejecting this paper because (1) the writing is unclear and hard to follow, and (2) the experiment results are not convincing.\n\nFrom what I can understand in the model part, there are many clarifications needed, not to mention the writing style. I think the re-derivations of GloVe and D-GloVe are not helpful as they cloud the main contribution of the paper. The author should clearly highlight the differences between the main subjects of the experiment: MLESWE and BESWE. In addition, it is not clearly motivated why we need Dirichlet prior for the sentiment variable.\n\nWhile the claim is to learn better embeddings for rare words, the experiments show that the proposed methods have similar results to the previous work. The only gain we can observe is in the sentence-level experiments in which other factors could affect the performance. Thus, it is hard to draw a supportive conclusion.\n\nFinally, the writing quality must be improved. The paper contains a lot of unrelated and redundant texts (it could be that I could follow the paper). \n1. I do not think eq 2 is a representative of how the paper train the model, nor attempt to compare with. \n\n2. As mention earlier, in section 3.2 and 3.3, the re-derivation is not particularly helpful. I think the paper should put more emphasis on the novelty of the work. \n\n3. Plots in the experiment results are illegible. Tables should be more suitable for Figures 1, 2, and 3. \n\nI urged the authors to revise this paper and make sure it follows the formatting guideline, especially the citations. Finally, I'd recommend the authors have a professional writer (English) review the paper before submission.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper320/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper320/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A novel Bayesian estimation-based word embedding model for sentiment analysis", "authors": ["Jingyao Tang", "Yun Xue", "Ziwen Wang", "Haoliang Zhao"], "authorids": ["manderous@foxmail.com", "995438712@qq.com", "773473833@qq.com", "1044012786@qq.com"], "keywords": ["sentiment analysis", "sentiment word embeddings", "maximum likelihood estimation", "Bayesian estimation"], "TL;DR": "We use sentiment probabilities to incorporate the sentiment information of words into the word embeddings and use Bayesian estimation to derive sentiment probabilities.", "abstract": "The word embedding models have achieved state-of-the-art results in a variety of natural language processing tasks.

Improved experiment results on word similarity and low frequency embeddings are presented. Overall, the paper incorporates the sentiment information in a neat way. And my main concern is the around the Bayesian inference and the prior knowledge distilled into the model.  Detail comments are as following, \n\n1. The model employed Laplace approximation for posterior distribution. Not quite sure this is a good idea for the Bernoulli case since Laplace approximation is trying to use Gaussian distribution to approximate the region around the mode. How will the MAP solution compare with a full Bayesian solution such as VB or sampling-based methods?\n\n2. Another concern is the prior introduced into the model. Normally prior information will be washed away as the training data grow. Not the case for the low frequency examples that the model performed well on. Would it possible that the improved performance on low frequency example is just a side effect of the biased introduced by the prior? How sensitive will the embedding perform with respect to the prior selected?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper320/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper320/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A novel Bayesian estimation-based word embedding model for sentiment analysis", "authors": ["Jingyao Tang", "Yun Xue", "Ziwen Wang", "Haoliang Zhao"], "authorids": ["manderous@foxmail.com", "995438712@qq.com", "773473833@qq.com", "1044012786@qq.com"], "keywords": ["sentiment analysis", "sentiment word embeddings", "maximum likelihood estimation", "Bayesian estimation"], "TL;DR": "We use sentiment probabilities to incorporate the sentiment information of words into the word embeddings and use Bayesian estimation to derive sentiment probabilities.", "abstract": "The word embedding models have achieved state-of-the-art results in a variety of natural language processing tasks.
