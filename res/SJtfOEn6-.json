It is a reconfigurable binarization method for neural networks. It improves the convergence rate during training. \n\nI appreciate a lot that the authors were able to validate their idea by building a prototype of an actual hardware accelerator.\n\nI am wondering what are the values of \\gamma\u2019s in the residual binarization after learning? What is its advantage over having only one \\gamma, and then the rest are just 1/2*\\gamma, 1/4* \\gamma, \u2026 , etc.? The latter is an important baseline for residual binarization because that corresponds to the widely used fixed point format for real numbers. If you can show some results that residual encoding is better than having {\\gamma, 1/2*\\gamma, 1/4* \\gamma, \u2026, } (which contains only one \\gamma), it would validate the need of using this relatively complex binarization scheme. Otherwise, we can just use the l-bit fixed point multiplications, which is off-the-shelf and already highly optimized in many hardwares. \n\nFor the temperature adjustment, modifying the tanh() scale has already had a long history, for example, http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-89.pdf page 7, which is exactly the same form as in this paper. Adjusting the slope during training has also been explored in some straight-through estimator approaches, such as https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.01704.pdf. In addition, having this residual binarization and adjustable tanh(), is already adding extra computations for training. Could you provide some data for comparing the computations before and after adding residual binarization and temperature adjustment? \n\nThe authors claimed that ResBinNet converges faster during training, and in table 2 it shows that ResBinNet just needs 1/10 of the training epochs needed by BinaryNet. However, I don\u2019t find it very fair. Given that the accuracy RBN gets is much lower than Binary Net, the readers might suspect that maybe the other two models already reach ResBinNet\u2019s accuracy at an earlier training epochs (like epoch 50), and just take all the remaining epochs to reach a higher accuracy. On the other hand, this comparison is not fair for ResBinNet as well. The model size was much larger in BinaryNet than in ResBinNet. So it makes sense to train a BinaryNet or FINN, in the same size, and then compare the training curves. Lastly, in CIFAR-10 1-level case, it didn\u2019t outperform FINN, which has the same size. Given these experiments, I can\u2019t draw any convincing conclusion.\n\nApart from that, There is an error in Figure 7 (b), where the baseline has an accuracy of 80.1% but its corresponding bar is lower than RBN1, which has an accuracy of 76%.

Here are the responses to your questions:\n\nQuestion1: We will emphasize the differences in the updated paper. In summary, the differences between our approach and XNOR-net are the following:\n\n- In XNOR-net, each layer utilizes multiple scaling factors for the weights. For example, it uses a separate scaling factor for each column of the weight matrix in a fully connected layer. In our approach,  the whole parameter set in one layer has a single Gamma value. This is particularly important to devise efficient hardware accelerators for the corresponding binary CNN.\n\n- Regarding the scaling factors for the activations, XNOR-net again uses multiple values for a certain layer. In our approach, the number of Gamma values for each layer is limited to the number of residual levels which is less than 4 in our experiments.\n\n- In XNOR-net, the scaling factors for the activations are dynamically computed during the execution by taking the average of feature maps. Computing these scaling factors involves a lot of full-precision operations which is in contrast with the whole rational of network binarization. In our approach, the Gamma values are learned in the training phase and they are fixed during the inference. \n\nAll in all, the previous properties of XNOR-net help their design to achieve a higher accuracy, but prevents an efficient implementation of their binary network. To the best of our knowledge, no hardware accelerator has been proposed for XNOR-net. \n\nQuestion 2: The experiments in the paper aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. We have evaluated the method on Imagenet and will include the results in the revised version. For Imagenet, we can obtain a top-1 accuracy of 28.4%, 32.6%, and 33.6% for an Alexnet architecture with  1-3 levels of residual binarizations, while the Binarynet baseline achieves a top-1 accuracy of 27.9% with the same architecture.\n\nQuestion 3: The output of soft-binarization is actually full-precision; the point is that these full-precision values are so close to the binary values that the accuracy does not degrade significantly after hard-binarization. Note that we retrain the hard-binarized model for only 1 epoch. We will add the soft-binarized network accuracies in Table 2 as suggested.\n\nHope the responses above clarified your questions."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ResBinNet: Residual Binary Neural Network", "abstract": "Recent efforts on training light-weight binary neural networks offer promising execution/memory efficiency.
