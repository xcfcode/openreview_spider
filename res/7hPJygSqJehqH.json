This problem is usually tackled either via distant weak supervision from a knowledge base (providing structure and relational schemas) or in a totally unsupervised fashion (without any pre-defined schemas). The present approach aims at combining both trends with the introduction of universal schemas that can blend pre-defined ones from knowledge bases and uncertain ones extracted from free text.\r\n\r\nThis paper is very ambitious and interesting. The goal of bridging knowledges bases and text for information extraction is great, and this paper seems to go in the right direction. The experiments seem to show that mixing data sources is beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe idea of asymmetric implicature among relation is appealing but its implementation in the model remains unclear. How common is it that a tuple shares many relations? One can not tell anything for relations for which corresponding tuples are disjoint from the rest. \r\n\r\nThe main weakness of the system as it is presented here is that it relies on the fact that entities constituting tuples from the knowledge base (Freebase here) and tuples extracted from the text have been exactly matched beforehand. This is a huge limitation before any real application, because this involves solving a complex named entity recognition - word sense disambiguation - coreference resolution problem.\r\n\r\nIs there any parameter sharing between latent feature vectors of entities and tuples (=pairs of entities)? And between relation vectors and neighbors weights?\r\n\r\nMinor: the notation for the set of observed fact disappeared.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- great motivation and research direction\r\n- model and experiments are sound\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- lack of details\r\n- many unanswered questions remain to apply it on real-world data."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Latent Relation Representations for Universal Schemas", "decision": "conferencePoster-iclr2013-workshop", "abstract": "Traditional relation extraction predicts relations within some fixed and finite target schema.

The models exploit different types of embeddings  of entities and relations.\r\n\r\nThe topic of the paper is interesting and the contribution seems quite sufficient for a workshop paper. It should motivate an interesting discussion on how these models can be generalized to be applied to more complex datasets and semantic tasks (e.g.,  inferring these representation from natural language texts), and, in general,  on representation induction methods for semantic tasks. \r\n\r\nThe only concern I have about this paper is that it does not seem to properly cite much of the previous work on related subjects.  Though it mentions techniques for clustering semantically similar expressions, it seems to suggest that there has not been much work on inducing, e.g., subsumptions. However,  there has been a lot of  previous research on learning entailment (aka inference) rules (e.g.,  Chkolvsky and Pantel 2004; Berant et al, ACL 2011;  Nakashole et al, ACL 2012). Even more importantly, some of the very related work on embedding relations is not mentioned, e.g.,  Bordes et al (AAAI 2011), or, very closely related,  Jenatton et al (NIPS 2012).  However, these omissions may be understandable given the short format of the paper. \r\n\r\nPros:\r\n--  Interesting topics\r\n--  Fairly convincing experimental results\r\nCons:\r\n--  Previous work on embedding relations is not discussed."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Latent Relation Representations for Universal Schemas", "decision": "conferencePoster-iclr2013-workshop", "abstract": "Traditional relation extraction predicts relations within some fixed and finite target schema.
