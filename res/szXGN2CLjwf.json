Under Lipschitz continuous gradient, Hessian and bounded gradient assumptions, the complexity for finding a point with small gradient norm is $\\epsilon^{-3.5}$, which is a SOTA complexity. The practical performance of the algorithm is evaluated in a range of different tasks and the performance is shown to be consistently promising and comparable to SGD/Momentum SGD.\n\nStrengths:\n- I think the algorithm template, and the connection to variance reduction is interesting. In particular, I saw a similar algorithm in [1, Alg. 2]. Of course the algorithm in [1] is designed for a more general setting, so it has important differences. But in my opinion, the fact that a similar algorithm works in such a general setting as [1], shows the strength and potential of Adam+.\n\n- The authors consider a large variety of tasks in different domains (Table 2) which is important to judge the consistency of the method in practice.\n\n- The paper is clear and well-written, the comparison with previous work is fair and comprehensive, to my knowledge.\n\nWeaknesses and suggestions for improvement: I have several concerns about the potential impact of both theoretical and practical results. Mainly:\n\n- By referring to Wilson et al., 2017, the authors argue that diagonal step sizes in adaptive algorithms hurt generalization. First, I find this claim rather vague, as there has been many followups to Wilson et al., 2017, so I suggest the authors to be more precise and include more recent observations. Moreover, one can use non-diagonal versions of these algorithms. For example, see [2 and Adagrad-norm from Ward et al., 2019], it is easy to consider similar non-diagonal versions of Adam/AMSGrad/Adagrad with first order momentum (a.k.a. AdamNC or AdaFOM), then, are these algorithms also supposed to have good generalization? I think it is important to see how these non-diagonal adaptive methods behave in practice compared to SGD/Adam+ for generalization to support the authors' claim.\n\n- I think the algorithm seems more like an extension of momentum SGD, than Adam.\n\n- It is nice to improve \\eps^{-4} complexity with Lipschitz Hessian assumption, but what happens when this assumption fails? Does Adam+ get standard \\epsilon^{-4}?\n\n- From what I understand in remark after Lemma 1, the variance reduction is ensured by taking $\\beta$ to $0$. The authors use $1/T^{a}$ for some $a\\in(0,1)$. Here, I have several questions. First, how does such a small $\\beta$ work in practice? If in practice, a larger $\\beta$ works well and theory requires $\\beta\\to 0$ for working, it shows to me that theoretical analysis of the paper does not translate to the practical performance. When one uses $\\beta$ values that work well in practice, does the theory show convergence?\n\n- Related to the previous part, I am also not sure about \"adaptivity\" of the method. The authors need to use Lipschitz constants $L, L_H$ to set step sizes. Moreover $\\beta$ is also fixed in advance, depending on horizon $T$, which is the main reason to have variance reduction on $\\|z_t-\\nabla f(w_k)\\|$. So, I do not understand what is adaptive in the step size or in the variance reduction mechanism of the method. \n\n- For experiments, the authors say that Adam+ is comparable with \"tuned\" SGD. However, from the explanations in the experimental part, I understand that Adam+ is also tuned similar to SGD. Then, what is the advantage compared to SGD? If one needs the same amount of tuning for Adam+, and the performance is similar, I do not see much advantage compared to SGD. On this front, I \nsuggest the authors to show what happens when the step size parameter is varied, is Adam+ more robust to non-tuned step sizes compared to SGD? \n\nTo sum up, I vote for rejection since 1) the analysis and parameters require strict condition, 2) it is not clear if the analysis illustrates the practical performance (very small $\\beta$ is needed in theory), 3) practical merit is unclear since the algorithm needs to be tunes similar to SGD and the results are also similar to SGD.\n\n[1] Zhang, Lin, Jegelka, Jadbabaie, Sra, Complexity of Finding Stationary Points of Nonsmooth Nonconvex Functions, ICML 2020.\n[2] Levy, Online to Offline Conversions, Universality and Adaptive Minibatch Sizes, NIPS 2017.\n\n======== after discussion phase ==========\n\nI still think that the merit of the method is unclear due to reasons: 1) It is not clear how the method behaves without Lipschitz Hessian assumption. 2) The method only obtains the state-of-the-art complexity of $\\epsilon^{-3.5}$ with large mini-batch sizes and the complexity with small mini-batch sizes (section 2.1) is suboptimal (in fact drawbacks such as this needs to be presented explicitly, right now I do not see enough discussions about this.). 3) Adaptive variance reduction property claimed by the authors boils down to picking \"small enough\" $\\beta$ parameter, which in my opinion takes away the adaptivity claim and is for example not the case in adaptive methods such as AdaGrad. 4) The comparison with AdaGrad and Adam with scalar step sizes is not included (the authors promised to include it later, but I cannot make a decision about these without seeing results) and I am not sure if Adam+ will bring benefits over them. 5) Presentation of the paper needs major improvements. I recommend making the remarks after Lemma 1 and theorems clearer, by writing down exact expressions and the implications of these (for example remarks such as \"As the algorithm converges with $\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\nabla F(w_)\\|^2]$ and $\\beta$ decreases to zero, the variance of $z_t$ will also decrease\" can be made more rigorous and clearer, by writing down exactly the bound for the variance of $z_t$ by iterating the recursion written with $\\mathbb{E}\\delta_{t+1}$ and highlighting what each term does in the bound. This way will be much easier for readers to understand your paper).\n\nTherefore, I am keeping my score.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1851/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1851/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adam$^+$: A Stochastic Method with Adaptive Variance Reduction", "authorids": ["~Mingrui_Liu2", "~Wei_Zhang33", "~Francesco_Orabona1", "~Tianbao_Yang1"], "authors": ["Mingrui Liu", "Wei Zhang", "Francesco Orabona", "Tianbao Yang"], "keywords": ["Adaptive Gradient Methods", "Deep Learning", "Nonconvex Optimization"], "abstract": "Adam is a widely used stochastic optimization method for deep learning applications.

Please check our responses below.\n\nQ1: It is important to see how these non-diagonal adaptive methods behave in practice compared to SGD/Adam+ for generalization to support the authors\u2019 claim.\n\nA: Thank you for mentioning these papers. We have cited all of them in the updated version. We expect to include the comparison with these algorithms in the final version and make this point more clear. \n\n\nQ2: How does a small $\\beta$ work in practice?\n\nA: Indeed small $\\beta$ works in practice. Our $\\beta$ roughly corresponds to $1-\\beta$ in momentum SGD. Usually in momentum SGD, $1-\\beta$ is set to be 0.9 (for example, in the resnet paper (He et al. 2016)), and hence it corresponds to $\\beta=0.1$ in our case.\n\nQ3: I do not understand what is adaptive in the stepsize or in the variance reduction mechanism of the method?\n\nA: This paper is not adaptive in the stepsize as in (Ward et al. 2019) but shares the similar spirit of the original Adagrad paper (Duchi et al. 2011). In (Ward et al. 2019), Adagrad-Norm does not require any knowledge of smoothness constant but it also does not prove that the algorithm enjoys faster convergence by taking advantage of the geometry in the data (e.g., the presence of sparsity in stochastic gradients) as in (Duchi et al. 2011). For our Adam+, we show that it is adaptive to the geometry of the data which is $\\sum_{t=1}^T \\left\\|z_t\\right\\|$ as shown in Theorem 1 and Theorem 2. In Theorem 2, we show that the noise in the gradient estimator $z_t$ is vanishing in an ergodic sense, so this means that the Adam+\u2019s convergence benefits from the variance reduction property of the gradient estimator of $z_t$. If $\\sum_{t=1}^T \\left\\|z_t\\right\\|$ grows in a slow rate in practice (which we empirically verified in Figure 5), then Adam+ benefits from it and enjoys faster convergence. Please check the Remarks under Theorem 2.\n\n\nQ4: Adam+ is also tuned similar to SGD. \n\nA: Adam+ is *NOT* tuned similar to SGD, since we never tune the learning rate schedule of Adam+. We just simply choose the same learning rate schedule of Adam+ to be the same as in best-tuned SGD. If we fix the initial learning rate in Adam+ and do not employ any learning rate annealing (which is the same as the default setting described in Algorithm 1), the performance is still better than Adam and Adagrad. We include such an experiment in the Appendix G to illustrate this point. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1851/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1851/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adam$^+$: A Stochastic Method with Adaptive Variance Reduction", "authorids": ["~Mingrui_Liu2", "~Wei_Zhang33", "~Francesco_Orabona1", "~Tianbao_Yang1"], "authors": ["Mingrui Liu", "Wei Zhang", "Francesco Orabona", "Tianbao Yang"], "keywords": ["Adaptive Gradient Methods", "Deep Learning", "Nonconvex Optimization"], "abstract": "Adam is a widely used stochastic optimization method for deep learning applications.

We have updated our paper according to your suggestions.", "comment": "Thanks for your careful review for our papers. We will address your concerns below. All typos are fixed in the revised version.\n\n\nQ1: The requirement of large minibatch is not a very realistic setting.\n\nA: We agree. However, we want to highlight that our main contribution is section 2.1, which establishes adaptive convergence results and does not require large minibatch. In our experiment, we also implemented the algorithm in section 2.1. The purpose of section 2.2 is to introduce a general variant of our algorithm and show that it is able to match the complexity of NIGT in the worst case.\n\n\n\n\nQ2:  For both Theorem 1 and Theorem 3, an extra assumption assumption that $\\|\\nabla F(x)\\|\\leq G$ is imposed which is not required by NIGT.\n\n\nA: The proof of Theorem 3 does not need the bounded gradient assumption, please refer to the Appendix D for the proof. The proof of Theorem 1 only utilizes the bounded gradient assumption in the very last step for proving (inequality (10), page 13, Appendix B), which is to make the bound easier to understand. Without the bounded gradient assumption, we also have the adaptive convergence result, which is presented in the (inequality (9), page 13, Appendix B). Please check Appendix B for the proof. We will make it more clear in the final version.\n\n\n\nQ3: Adam+  with $p=2/3$ seems to be not scale-invariant.\n\nA:  If $\\beta$ is not scale-invariant, then Adam+ with $p=2/3$ is indeed not scale-invariant. However, if we allow $\\beta$ to depend on $L$, then it is easy to get a scale-invariant algorithm. For example, if we choose $\\beta^{3/4}=O(L^{1/6}\\epsilon^{1/2})$, then the algorithm is scale-invariant with $O(\\epsilon^{-3.5})$ complexity (please check the inequality (30) at Page 18 in Appendix D). Moreover, our Theorem 2 provides a scale-invariant guarantee for Adam$^+$ with $p=1/2$. Since $\\alpha\\leq 1/\\sqrt{L_H}$, so it scales as $C^{-1/2}$, and hence $\\eta_t$  in Algorithm 1 scales as $C^{-1}$, so $\\eta_t z_t$ is scale-invariant. In our experiment, we also use Algorithm 1 instead of the variant with $p=2/3$.\n\n\nQ4: $O(poly(1/\\epsilon))$ is too vague in Theorem 2.\n\nA: Thanks for the comments. The $O(\\epsilon^{-4.5})$ result holds under the case that $\\beta=T^{-2/3}$. We have changed the statement of Theorem 2 in the updated version.\n\n\nQ5: The sharp slope change in Figure 5 is unexpected. If the curve before the turning point is fitted by $T^\\alpha$, what is the value of $\\alpha$?\n\n\nA: The value of $\\alpha$ is roughly $0.8$ in this experiment before the turning point. The growth rate of the quantity should not scale linearly in $T$ in theory as well, since otherwise the algorithm would not converge and it would be contradictory to Theorem 2. More importantly, we also want to highlight that our algorithm Adam$^+$ is able to take advantage of the slow growth rate of $\\sum_{i=1}^{t}\\|z_i\\|$ for large $t$, since small $t$ at the turning point does not provide good classification performance so we need to continue the training process. We have included more details in Appendix H.\n\n\nQ6: The performance of Adam in CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, the results are very poor. NIGT substantially outperforms Adam but the gap is not as large as the presented one. Is it the best tuned results for Adam?\n\nA:  These results are the best tuned results for Adam. We tuned initial learning rates of Adam from $\\{0.1, 0.01, 0.001\\}$ in our experiment and the best one is $0.001$. We have reported the best parameter setting for every experiment in the updated version, please check our section 3. NIGT paper does not consider the same experimental settings as in our paper so it is hard to say why the gap is large in our experiments. We conjecture that it is due to the different learning rate scheduler. For learning rate, they use polynomial decay (i.e., $\\eta_t=\\eta_0 (1-t/T)$) while we use stagewise exponential decay. The latter one is used in the original AlexNet and ResNet paper, and there are also some theoretical papers justifying why the latter one is better ([ref1, ref2]).\n\n[ref1] Ge et al.

Please check our answers below.\n\nQ1: The right hand side of of (1) has $\\sum_t |z_t|$ which could scale linear in $T$.\n\nA: Thanks for this insightful question. Theorem 1 itself indeed seems not to be able to guarantee the convergence in the worst case. However, we have proved Theorem 2, which indicates that our algorithm always converges (the ergodic convergence of $\\left\\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{w}_t)\\right\\|^{3/2}$), and the variance gets smaller when $T$ gets larger (the ergodic convergence of $ \\delta_t^{3/2}$)). So it rules out the possibility of the linear growth of $\\sum_t |z_t|$, since otherwise the algorithm would not converge. Note that $E\\left\\[\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\left\\|z_t\\right\\|\\right]\\leq E\\left[\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\left(\\delta_t+\\left\\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{w}_t)\\right\\|\\right)\\right]$, and $\\delta_t$ is proved to have ergodic convergence to any small constant $\\epsilon$, so Adam+\u2019s convergence benefits from the variance reduction property of the gradient estimator $\\mathbf{z}_t$ and $\\sum_t |z_t|$ must grow sub-linearly in $T$ even in the worst case . Please check the Remarks below the Theorem 2. In addition, we have also did empirical studies in Figure 5 (page 8) to show that the growth rate of $\\sum_t \\|\\mathbf{z}_t\\|$ is indeed slow in practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ2: The empirical result does not cover Transformer like models, which achieve SOTA performance on language understanding and favor Adam optimizer.\n\nA: In the transformer paper ([ref1]), their Adam optimizer (section 5.3, formula (3)) uses a specifically designed learning rate, i.e., \n$lrate=d_{\\text{model}}^{-0.5}\\cdot\\min\\left(stepnum^{-0.5}, stepnum\\cdot warmupsteps^{-1.5}\\right)$.\nNote that this learning rate depends on the warmup steps, number of steps, with different exponents. This is very different from the original Adam optimizer. Our main focus of this paper is comparing our algorithm with the original Adam optimizer on various domains (CV, NLP, ASR). \n\n[ref1] Vaswani et al. Attention is all you need. NIPS 2017.\n\n\n\nQ3: The paper should also tune the hyperparameters of Adam at least its learning rate.\n\nA: We indeed tuned the learning rate of Adam for every experiment. We tuned the initial learning rate of Adam from $(0.1, 0.01, 0.001)$ in section 3.1, $(1.0, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001)$ in section 3.2, and $(0.1, 0.01, 0.001)$ in section 3.3, as we mentioned in the paper. We also reported the best parameter setting for every algorithm in the updated version.\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1851/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1851/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adam$^+$: A Stochastic Method with Adaptive Variance Reduction", "authorids": ["~Mingrui_Liu2", "~Wei_Zhang33", "~Francesco_Orabona1", "~Tianbao_Yang1"], "authors": ["Mingrui Liu", "Wei Zhang", "Francesco Orabona", "Tianbao Yang"], "keywords": ["Adaptive Gradient Methods", "Deep Learning", "Nonconvex Optimization"], "abstract": "Adam is a widely used stochastic optimization method for deep learning applications.

When $p = 2/3$, with appropriate hyperparameters, Adam+ achieves the state-of-the-art complexity $O(1/\\epsilon^{3.5})$ to obtain an approximate first-order stationary point for smooth objectives with smooth Hessians. The proof technique is similar to that for SCGD by Wang et al. (2017), which construct a Lyapunov function for algorithms of this kind. \n\nPros:\n(1) The idea of using fractional normalization is interesting.\n\n(2) The proof involves bounding the (4/3)-th moment of the average gradient norm, which is novel to me.\n\n(3) The algorithm performs well on the examples considered in the paper.\n\nConcerns:\n(1) The rate $O(1/\\epsilon^{3.5})$ requires the inner batch size to be $O(\\epsilon^{-1.5})$. The requirement of large batch sizes seem to be essential for the proof. But it is not a very realistic setting. By contrast, the NIGT algorithm (Cutkosky and Mehta, 2020) does not require large batches while achieves the same convergence rate. Moreover, for both Theorem 1 and 3, an extra assumption that $||\\nabla F(x)||\\le G$ is imposed, which is not required by NIGT. Is the analysis for Adam+ unnecessarily loose, given that Adam+ and NIGT are almost identical?\n\n(2) Adam+ seems to be not scale-invariant even if the term $\\epsilon_0$ is ignored in $\\eta_t$. When $f$ becomes $Cf$, $L$ becomes $CL$, and $\\nabla g$ becomes $C\\nabla g$. Since the scale of $w$ does not change, we should expect the sequence $w_{k}$ to be invariant to $C$. Equivalently, we want $\\eta_t z_t$ to be invariant. If Adam+ with $p = 2/3$ is scale-invariant, then $z_t$ becomes $C z_t$, in which case $\\eta_t z_t \\propto \\alpha C^{1/3}z_{t} / ||z_{t}||^{2/3}$. As a result, $\\alpha$ should scale as $C^{-1/3}$. However, in Theorem 3, $(CL)^2 \\alpha^4 = O(1)$, implying that $\\alpha$ scales as $C^{-1/2}$. This contradicts with the scale-invariance. Therefore, Adam+ is not scale-invariant. If my argument is correct, Adam+ seems to be problematic. Could you clarify how scale invariance can be achieved? Does $\\beta$ or other parameters implicitly depend on the smoothness parameter?\n\n(3) The $O(poly(1/\\epsilon))$ in Theorem 2 is $O(\\epsilon^{-4.5})$, right? If so, please clarify this rate since $O(poly(1/\\epsilon))$ is too vague.\n\n(4) The sharp slope change in Figure 5 is unexpected. Is this due to the decreased step size? If the curve before the turning point is fitted by $T\\rightarrow T^{\\alpha}$, what is estimate of $\\alpha$? I suspect that the estimated alpha is close to $1$. If so, the point made in Theorem 1 would be undermined. \n\n(5) For experiments on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, the performance of Adam seems to be very poor. For instance, NIGT substantially outperforms Adam, but even in Cutkosky and Mehta (2020) the gap is not as large as the presented one. Is the best tuned result presented for Adam?\n\nTypos:\n\n(1) In page 12 and 15, $\\zeta_{t}^{(k)}$ should be $\\zeta_{k}^{(t)}$, \n$w_{t} = \\sum_{k=0}^{t}\\zeta_{k}^{(t)}\\hat{w}_{t+1}$ should be $w_{t} = \\sum_{k=0}^{t}\\zeta_{k}^{(t)}\\hat{w}_{k+1}$, and $z_{t+1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{t}\\zeta_{k}^{(t)}\\nabla f(\\hat{w}_{t+1}; \\xi_{t+1})$ should be $z_{t+1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{t}\\zeta_{k}^{(t)}\\nabla f(\\hat{w}_{k+1}; \\xi_{k+1})$ (The equations fail to be displayed for no reason)\n\n(2) Page 12: $||z_{t} - \\nabla F(w_{t})||^2\\le (Lm_{t} + ||n_{t}||)^2$ should be $||z_{t} - \\nabla F(w_{t})||^2\\le (L_{H}m_{t} + ||n_{t}||)^2$.\n\n(3) Page 12-13, equation (5)-(6): $\\sigma^2$ should be $\\sigma_{m}^2$.\n\n(4) Page 13, the last equation: the first term should has a constant $8$.\n\n(5) Page 15, equation (15): $n_{k+1}$ and $n_{k}$ should be $n_{t+1}$ and $n_{t}$, respectively.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1851/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1851/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adam$^+$: A Stochastic Method with Adaptive Variance Reduction", "authorids": ["~Mingrui_Liu2", "~Wei_Zhang33", "~Francesco_Orabona1", "~Tianbao_Yang1"], "authors": ["Mingrui Liu", "Wei Zhang", "Francesco Orabona", "Tianbao Yang"], "keywords": ["Adaptive Gradient Methods", "Deep Learning", "Nonconvex Optimization"], "abstract": "Adam is a widely used stochastic optimization method for deep learning applications.

It saves the number of saved parameters (i.e., without using 2nd order momentum).\n2. This paper provide convergence analysis. The author is able to derive a data dependent convergence rate under mild conditions.\n3. The theoretical analysis and implication is very clear. The variance reduction property of the 1st order momentum provides a good characterization of the convergence of the algorithm.  \n4.

While practitioners prefer Adam because it requires less parameter tuning, its use is problematic from a theoretical point of view since it may not converge.  Variants of Adam have been proposed with provable convergence guarantee, but they tend not be competitive with Adam on the practical performance. In this paper, we propose a new method named Adam$^+$ (pronounced as Adam-plus). Adam$^+$ retains some of the key components of Adam but it also has several noticeable differences: (i) it does not maintain the moving average of second moment estimate but instead computes the moving average of first moment estimate at extrapolated points; (ii) its adaptive step size is formed not by dividing the square root of second moment estimate but instead by dividing the root of the norm of first moment estimate. As a result,  Adam$^+$ requires few parameter tuning, as Adam, but it enjoys a provable convergence guarantee. Our analysis further shows that Adam$^+$ enjoys adaptive variance reduction, i.e., the variance of the stochastic gradient estimator reduces as the algorithm converges, hence enjoying an adaptive convergence. We also propose a more general variant of Adam$^+$ with different adaptive step sizes and establish their fast convergence rate. Our empirical studies on various deep learning tasks, including image classification, language modeling, and automatic speech recognition, demonstrate that Adam$^+$ significantly outperforms Adam and achieves comparable performance with best-tuned SGD and momentum SGD.", "one-sentence_summary": "This paper introduces an algorithm called Adamplus, which empirically works better than Adam, requires less parameter tuning than Adam, and enjoys data-dependent adaptive convergence rate and fast rate.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "liu|adam^_a_stochastic_method_with_adaptive_variance_reduction", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/fcb9ab94f09492f6de1a7ff0fe4896f44416e5e0.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/d06fde484026b47c56472134fa221b813c267149.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=PtsRoRvf3K", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nliu2021adam,\ntitle={Adam{\\$}{\\textasciicircum}+{\\$}: A Stochastic Method with Adaptive Variance Reduction},\nauthor={Mingrui Liu and Wei Zhang and Francesco Orabona and Tianbao Yang},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=szXGN2CLjwf}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
