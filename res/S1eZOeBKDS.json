In response to your points:\n\n- We avoided extensive literature review and explanation on KiloSort mostly due to page limitations. In the future revised version of the paper, we\u2019ll try to provide more background information and also include a summary of KiloSort in the appendix.\n\n- We chose L4 over L2 largely due to ease of hyperparameter tuning purposes. EMG signal contains both action potentials and noise. Sparsity and reconstruction loss terms, by creating a trade-off, are tuned such that only the signal corresponding to action potentials are reconstructed. Here, we use the L4 norm because it differentiates between action potential signals from EMG noise more successfully and makes the hyperparameter tuning (see total loss equation) easier.\n\n- Parsimony loss is based on the L1-L2 norm. The L1-L2 norm (and more generally the L1-Lq norm) is used as a block sparsity inducing penalty in optimization algorithms (see [1]). The critical part in the parsimony loss function is the tensor partitioning G over which L1 norm (i.e. the sum operation) is performed. By applying the L1-L2 norm over different partitionings of a tensor, one can induce different patterns of block sparsity. Here, our partitioning is based on spatial neighborhoods (specified by the number of consecutive electrodes) for each individual motor unit. This loss then minimizes both the number of motor units and their spatial footprints. The reason why we apply this loss on the first time-derivative of the spatiotemporal waveforms tensor is to get the temporal smoothness effect as well. We\u2019ll try to complement our explanation with visualizations in the revised paper.\n\n- The uniqueness loss (and also refractory period loss) are optional terms we use to tackle particular problems we observed during our experiments. We\u2019ll move the experimentations with these terms to the experiments section and explain them in relation to the particular problems they\u2019re trying to address.\n\n[1] Francis Bach, Rodolphe Jenatton, Julien Mairal, Guillaume Obozinski, et al.

It is implemented by a deep autoencoder with biophysically motivated loss functions. The encoder is the main module which conducts the spike-sorting task while the decoder is only used for training the model in an end-to-end fashion. \n\nThis paper should be rejected due to the following arguments:\t\n- The paper lacks a section on literature survey, to let the reader know how/where the proposed method fills the gap in the current state-of-the-art. They do compare their results with the KiloSort (Pachitariu et al., 2016) algorithms, however, no discussion is provided on how it works and why their method outperforms it. \n- It is unclear why the reconstruction loss is chosen to be an L4 norm as opposed to L2.\n- The authors claim that the parsimony loss as defined in Eq. (7) forces \u201cthe network to be parsimonious with respect to the set of MUAP proposals it uses to explain a given sEMG signal.\u201d My understanding, however, is that the only functionality of the loss defined in Eq. (7) is to enforce temporal smoothness. More elaborate explanation is needed to support the authors claim.\n- I could not understand the functionality of the uniqueness loss. Specifically, why should \u201cthe joint occurrence of the temporal similarity between MU spike trains and the spatial similarity between their MUAP waveforms\u201d be penalized? Isn\u2019t that the case that same stimuli should result in similar response? It is unclear what this has to do with forcing to explain different phenomena.\n\nThings to improve the paper that did not impact the score:\n- The method (and the paper) is named deep spike \u201cdecoder\u201d (DSD) while in fact the \u201cencoder\u201d part of the learned deep autoencoder actually conducts the spike-sorting task.

The basic model is an autoencoder, where the bottleneck layer is designed to project the waveform inputs into \"spike\" representations. Specifically, there is a DSD (Deep Spike Decoder) encoder and decoder, where the encoder is implemented as either a DenseNet[1]-like or Tiramisu[2]-like architecture. The bottleneck seems to be implemented by a linear layer binarized with a Gumbel-Softmax activation. The decoder is a linear layer. Several losses are considered, including a L4-norm (!), a sparsity loss, a parsimony loss, a uniqueness loss, and a refractory period loss. The model is validated qualitatively on real EMGs, and quantitatively on synthetic data.\n\nThe strengths of the paper are the following:\n- Spiking models are very interesting class of models, which if attained would have a great impact on several other areas of machine learning. \n\n- I like the straightforward design that is fit to the purpose of generating spiking representations. A Gumbel-Softmax has proven its validity and is a logical fit to the problem setup.\n\n- I like the simpler setup the paper chooses.\n  -- First, the paper chooses not to take the route of trying to learn backpropagation through infinite time steps, as often happens in spiking methods. This is a beast on each own, which would be nice to set as an ultimate goal (in my opinion). For now, however, it's ok if we forego this requirement.\n  -- Second, the paper chooses not to assume that signals come asynchronously, which again makes things unnecessarily complex, given the state of the field.\n\nThe weaknesses of the paper:\n- While the problem setup is simple, perhaps it makes some assumptions that are too strong. In my opinion, the strongest one is that of batch-learning (for the lack of a better name). Often, spiking models are studied in an online setup where the data comes online (continuously), and then spikes are generated when sufficient changes in the inputs warrant a delta-difference (spike). When in batch mode, however, it should be quite much easier to obtain spikes that lead to good reconstructions, as there is no much need for a \"memory\" mechanism. While one could argue whether an online setup is necessary or not, in my opinion it is necessary and would make a spiking model challenging and interesting to learn. Otherwise, it looks like a conventional autoencoder, only with spikes instead of dense representations.\n\n- The model is unclear and writing vague.\n\n- First of all, after reading the abstract and the introduction I get the feeling that the model is probabilistic, as there is mention of priors and autoencoders. Also, later on a Gumbel-Softax is mentioned for binarization. Gumbel-Softmax is a continuous function and binarization makes sense when sampling, that is when assuming a generative process. However, the rest of the paper seems not to explain a probabilistic or generative model. There is no explicit prior discussed. There is no sampling procedure discussed. The losses are explained but not within a particular probabilistic or stochastic framework. If the model is not stochastic, one way or the other, how are the discrete spikes obtained and how is the system is trained?\n\n- All the loss functions, albeit logical when taken one by one, they do look ad hoc and appearing out of the blue. This perhaps relates to the previous point, where it is not clear if the model is stochastic or deterministic. If it is deterministic, it is ok to have all the loss functions appearing like that, but I would expect some more explanation on what purpose do they fill w.r.t. the spiking model. In the end, what does the deep spiker model try to achieve? Learn spikes as representations? Recover the original spikes? Be sparse? If yes, why and how sparse? Be energy-efficient?\n\n- Some design choices are quite unclear. Generally, it is fair to say that the experimental and design setups are rather simple: multiple 1-D waveforms and not much noise (from what I get). In that context, it is not clear why DenseNets, or even Tiramisu-Nets are used as an encoder; especially when the decoder is a simple linear model. \n\n- Also, phrases like \"what good combinations are useful ... the hyperparametres of DSD\" do not add to the clarity. There is no exploration of hyperparameters in the experiments and no individual examination of the contribution of each loss (unless I missed it somewhere).\n\n- Similarly, what does \"For the DSD ... between 10 minutes to an hour depending on ...\".  Such statements should be more precise, for instance plotting wall clock time vs training loss.\n\nAll in all, while I like the motivation and the original direction, I believe there exist a lot of questions  unanswered before acceptance."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2388/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2388/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Spike Decoder (DSD)", "authors": ["Emrah Adamey", "Tarin Ziyaee", "Nishanth Alapati", "Jun Ye"], "authorids": ["emrah@ctrl-labs.com", "tarin@ctrl-labs.com", "nishanth@ctrl-labs.com", "jun@ctrl-labs.com"], "keywords": ["self-supervised", "deep learning", "spike sorting", "EMG", "sEMG", "autoencoder", "inductive bias"], "TL;DR": "We built an unsupervised spike sorting algorithm using deep learning with biophysics baked in.", "abstract": "Spike-sorting is of central importance for neuroscience research.  We introducea novel spike-sorting method comprising a deep autoencoder trained end-to-endwith a biophysical generative model, biophysically motivated priors, and a self-supervised loss function to training a deep autoencoder.

We evaluate this approach inthe context of real and synthetic multi-channel surface electromyography (sEMG)data, a noisy superposition of motor unit action potentials (MUAPs).  Relative toan established spike-sorting method, this autoencoder-based approach shows su-perior recovery of source waveforms and event times.  Moreover, the biophysicalnature of the loss functions facilitates interpretability and hyperparameter tuning.Overall, these results demonstrate the efficacy and motivate further developmentof self-supervised spike sorting techniques.", "pdf": "/pdf/64b3442d50421b60fb6f419f36793ae0f930957f.pdf", "paperhash": "adamey|deep_spike_decoder_dsd", "original_pdf": "/attachment/64b3442d50421b60fb6f419f36793ae0f930957f.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nadamey2020deep,\ntitle={Deep Spike Decoder ({\\{}DSD{\\}})},\nauthor={Emrah Adamey and Tarin Ziyaee and Nishanth Alapati and Jun Ye},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1eZOeBKDS}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
