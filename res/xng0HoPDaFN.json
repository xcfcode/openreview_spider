The authors consider \u201clocal attacks\u201d \u2013 perturbing on a limited number of pixels while achieving high attack success rate. The main contribution of this work is to define the region to perturb using grad-cam based saliency maps to identify regions that have a greater impact on the classification decision. Having identified this region, the author use SGD to find the adversarial perturbations. The experimental results show that a high attack success rate can be achieved with this method. \n\nPros:\n1)\tThe idea is simple yet affective. Attack success rate seems to be high. \n2)\tPaper is well written and easy to read.\n3)\tThe experimental setup is reasonable.\n\nCons:\n1) My main concern with this paper is that it appears incremental to me. The idea builds upon Grad-cam and existing adversarial example generation approaches.  \n2)\tAlso, the idea is not new implying that there exist several related approaches achieving sparse adversarial examples (see [1,2]). \n3)\tI would encourage authors to perform a more detailed literature survey and compare their results with them in a fair manner.
