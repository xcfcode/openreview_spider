Concerning the compared performance on CalTech 101 and CalTech 256, we are currently redoing the experiments on Caltech 256 to understand the loss of performance. It looks like it is due to a choice of wavelets which were Haar wavelets along rotations, and seems to have impaired performances. \r\n\r\nUntil now, we observed that using a third layer with wavelet convolutions does not improve results relatively to two layers (but it does not degrade it either). We believe that beyound the second layer, we will need to learn the deep network filters, but this still needs to be fully checked.

The novelty of the paper is to show that to reach 67%  there is no need to learn the deep network weights which can be taken to be wavelets along spatial, rotation, and scaling variables. It is the first time that such results hold for a relatively complex image data basis. All filters are separable and thus have a fast implementation. Learning can then be applied to improve\r\nthese predefined filters or to add more layers to the network.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the processing of deep networks and how to simplify it is currently a very important challenge. It was a surprise for\r\nus to see that even complex image data bases such as CalTech can be tackled with predefined wavelet filters, and matching the\r\nperformance of the double layer ImageNet filters on CalTech is not an easy task. We believe that the results open the possibility to further important simplifications of these networks and their filters."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generic Deep Networks with Wavelet Scattering", "decision": "submitted, no decision", "abstract": "We introduce a two-layer wavelet scattering network, which involves no learning, for object classification.
