The motivation is recommender systems: it is often desirable to generate reviews that a user might be expected to write for a recommended item. For this task the authors propose to harness an architecture that they recently proposed in prior work: TransNets. The idea is to incorporate a latent layer that is meant to represent the review a user *would* write for a given item.\n\nMore concretely, TransNet uses an auto-encoder approach to train a \"teacher\" (or target) network learn to induce representations of reviews of an item B by user A, x_{AB}. A source network (\"student\") is then trained to estimate these vectors, given only user and item representations. This is a neat approach, although not novel to the present work.\n\nIt seems like a downside to TransNets is the need for a fairly large set of reviews written by any given user to train a reasonable auto-encoder (teacher network). That the authors constructed a \"150-core\" dataset, ie., a dataset in which all users have written about 150 items, and all items have reviews written by at least 150 items. This seems quite restrictive: what fraction of users have written this many reviews, one wonders?\n\nDespite this practical weakness, I think the idea is interesting and this may facilitate further discussion at the workshop. \n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "TransNets for Review Generation", "abstract": "In recommender systems, review generation is increasingly becoming an important task. \nPreviously proposed neural models concatenate the user and item information to each timestep of an RNN to steer it towards generating their specific review. \nIn this paper, we show how a student-teacher like architecture can be used to rapidly build a review generator with a low perplexity score.

The idea is to exploit the original architecture, based on two parallel networks, to build a relevant joint profile associated to both an item and a user. Then, the authors propose to learn a LSTM based decoder to generate a review (from this profile).\nThey demonstrate the interest of their approach wrt CF-GCN according to the perplexity measure.\n\nThe article is well written and the architecture interesting. This formulation is an elegant way to tackle the black-box phenomenon around recommender systems. For all those reasons, I think that this article should be presented in ICLR.\n\nHowever, I have a few more questions:\n- the author claim that their architecture is more efficient... But we would like to see how both models behave with more epochs... Given the slopes of the plots, we can imagine that all performances will converge quickly.\n- the discussion around teacher-student networks seems quite unfair: it is only a matter of supervision in this article. The architecture requires to perform the back-propagation from supervised data that are mapped into the latent space... Their is no direct link with teacher-student architectures which aim at approximating a compex process with a lighter network.\n- The task is very difficult to evaluate... It would be interesting to add basic baseline to provide a better understanding of the performance. For instance, we could add a random baseline (with words drawn from the general distribution of the item review) or a best-review baseline measuring the perplexity wrt the best existing review in the learning set (accroding to the target user).\nOne major issue is to demonstrate that the generated reviews are more interesting that reviews extracted from the dataset.\ncf Extended Recommendation Framework: Generating the Text of a User Review as a Personalized Summary, Poussevin et al.
