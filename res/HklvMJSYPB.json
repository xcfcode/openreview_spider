Below we address the raised concerns and answer reviewer questions:\n\n1a) Third person imitation learning (TPIL) Stadie et al. 2017 and our work both employed a gradient reversal layer (GRL). We explained the differences between Stadie et al. 2017 and our work in the related work section: 1) Third person imitation learning (TPIL) paper only considers two domains: a source domain where the demonstrations are collected and a target domain where the policy is evaluated, whereas, we consider learning an adaptive policy that is transferable to a class of domains with different dynamics. Compared to TPIL, this is a substantially more challenging setting, with relaxed assumptions and consequently greater potential for real robotic applications. 2) in addition, we employed a dynamics posterior to actively predict the latent dynamics parameters at each time step during evaluation making the policy agnostic to online dynamics perturbations, which is impossible with TPIL. \n\nWe would also like to do a comparative analysis with TPIL in the next version of the paper.\n\n\u201cIn particular, what is the new element in Figure 1. and complete Section 3.4?\u201d\n\nWe use Figure 1 to illustrate our discriminator architecture. In retrospect, we agree with R3 that the description of GRL might be redundant. We have shortened our description of domain adversarial loss in Section 3.4 in the updated version of the manuscript.\n\n1b) Conditioning the policy on a contextual variable is indeed a common idea that is shared in the literature. Our novelty, however, lies in considering a new problem formulation (which was not explored before), and unifying a number of technical solutions for solving the problem as highlighted by R1.\n\nThank you for making the connections with DIAYN (Eysenbach et al. 2018), and InfoGAIL (Li et al. 2017). However, we believe that DIAYN and InfoGAIL are solving different problems. We compare the problem formulations of DIAYN, and InfoGAIL with our work to further illustrate the argument:\n\nDiversity is all you need (DIAYN) Eysenbach et al. 2018 seeks to pretrain diversified skills without a given reward function by training a discriminator to discriminate different skills under the same dynamics. DIAYN uses maximum entropy policy to diversify the learned skills. The paper briefly mentioned learning from a few demonstrations of different skills in experiment section. Our method, however, learns an adaptive policy that is transferable under different dynamics.\n\nInfoGAIL Li et al. 2017 considered a setting where the dynamics does not change, and a mixture of demonstrations are collected from multiple experts that exhibit behavioral variations and/or try to achieve different goals. The InfoGAIL algorithm is not suitable for learning transferable policies under domain shifts. Our method, while sharing some architectural similarities to infoGAIL, on the other hand learns an adaptive policy that tries to achieve the same goal under different dynamics with demonstrations collected from a single source domain. \n\n\n2 \u201cThis is a severe requirement for real-word scenarios, ...\u201d\n\nWe respectfully disagree that sampling environments from a distribution is an unrealistic assumption. We believe the ability to configure environments with different dynamics is a necessity for learning transferable policies under a model-free RL setting. Previous methods that try to learn transferable policies (Tobin et al., 2017; Sadeghi & Levine, 2016; Mandlekar et al., 2017; Tanet al., 2018; Pinto et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2018; Chebotar et al., 2018; Rajeswaran et al., 2016) are also reliant on the assumption of sampling environments from a distribution or the ability to perturb the environment dynamics; these authors either instrument the environment or policy (e.g. torque applied, slope of ground for locomotion tasks, etc) in order to control environment parameters during policy training, or they model parameter variation explicitly.\n\nAs is standard in imitation learning, we do not assume that the parameterization of the optimal policy is known.

We also believe that this is an important problem formulation for imitation learning.\n\n\u201c... not convinced that explicitly modeling the dynamic changes is necessary\u201d\n\nAs shown experimentally, the dynamics posterior is particularly useful when there are large domain shifts. Figure 5 (a) illustrates this scenario, where the direction of the force is negated in some of the test domains. ADAIL is able to cover both the case of non-directional domain shift and directional domain shift. As a comparison, GAIL with dynamics randomization fails in this setting.\n\n\u201cSome existing imitation learning methods focus on a setting where the dynamics of the expert may differ from the agent, but the dynamics of agents do not change. ...\u201d\n\nOur problem formulation covers the suggested setting, where the dynamics in the target domain does not change at eval time. ADAIL is also effective under online dynamics perturbations. This makes it applicable to real-world robot learning.\n\n\u201c.. the last term should in my opinion not depend on theta.\u201d \u201cAccording to line 10 of the algorithm box only the current trajectory is used for updating the dynamics posterior. Why?\u201d\n\nSorry for the confusing notation. We will update this in the next paper version. By including theta we meant that the posterior training is on-policy, which makes it dependent on theta (since the environment samples it is trained on is dependent on theta). In practice the posterior could be trained off-policy with sampled rollouts, however, this might either require an additional reply buffer or requires additional rollouts after the policy training converges. Both amount to implementation complexity. We found on-policy posterior training effective in our test scenarios, hence the design decision. \n\n\u201cThe contrastive regularization loss needs to be better motivated\u201d\n\nThank you for bringing it to our attention and we will add additional clarifying text to the next paper revision. The motivation for the contrastive loss is to introduce additional supervision in order to improve the robustness of the latent posterior. We find that without it, the posterior value is prone to drifting during the course of a rollout (especially for frame transitions where the dynamics are difficult to infer). The addition of this contrastive term adds the simple prior that all transitions within a single rollout have the same posterior value. This matches the fact that we sample the environment dynamics parameters once during a single rollout, and then the parameters are constant throughout. Note that in a real-world robotics application, an extension of this simple loss term would be to ensure that adjacent posterior estimates are similar (rather than constant over an entire trajectory) as it is expected that real-world dynamics exhibit high temporal coherence.\n\n\u201cIf a similar regularizer has been used in prior work, such work should be referenced\u201d\n\nWe agree that metric loss is commonly used, and KL-like distance measure is also not unprecedented in metric learning ([1], [2]). We have added references to the papers in the updated draft. However, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use KL-based metric loss to learn dynamics embeddings, especially in the context of imitation learning. \n\n[1] Davis, Jason V., et al. \"Information-theoretic metric learning.\" 2007.\n[2] Hsu, and Kira. \"Neural network-based clustering using pairwise constraints.\" 2015\n\nRegarding the presentation/clarity, thank you for pointing out presentation related issues. We have fixed all the found typos. \n\n\u201cFigure 2 is confusing and adds little compared to the text description.\u201d\n\nWe believe Figure 2 helps better illustrate the system graphically to readers with limited background in this field. We have revised Figure 2 to make it more clear and illustrative in the updated draft. \n\n\u201c.. the structure could be improved. .. \u201d\n\nWe will make sure to further polish the structure and presentation of the paper in the next version.\n\n\u201cThe paper uses some techniques such as conditional VAEs [1] or contextual policy search [2]\nare used but not described / referenced.\u201d\n\nThank you for the relevant citations.

We found the summary in your comment accurate and reflective of the purpose and contributions of our work.\n\nWe address the questions below:\n\n\u201cIn \u2018dynamics learning\u2019, it seems that the inference network learns is mostly the context variable c, wonder if it is better to use terms like \"latent variable inference\" to avoid confusion.\u201d\n\nThank you for the suggestion, and have updated our text to reflect the new term.\n\n\u201cWhat does the standard deviation mean in Figure 6? It seems a lot of them are even larger than the mean.\u201d\n\nIt means the standard deviation (STD) across all domains evaluated, not the experimental variance of multiple seeds within a single domain. Some STDs are high because of the performance across some domains exhibit large expected variance, e.g., in Ant and HalfCheetah when friction is less than 0.5 (the robot is not expected to obtain high reward, even for an optimal policy, leading to high variance across all domains).\n\n\u201cThere is little explanation to the VAE-ADAIL experiments -- is it safe to assume most of the experiments require certain knowledge of the latent variable in order to be successful? Maybe some of the arguments about VAE can go to the appendix.\u201d\n\nThe effectiveness of ADAIL is demonstrated in the experiment section given that we are provided with informative dynamics parameters (either ground truth or predicted) at eval time. We presented an experiment of VAE-ADAIL as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the unsupervised method. We have added references to related works in our updated paper (Section 3.6), and will further clarify the motivation (and/or add new experimental results) in the next paper revision.\n\n\u201cWhy would in some cases UP-True performs much worse than ADAIL? In Ant it is even worse than PPO expert.\u201d\n\nIt is a meaningful observation. Figure 6f reflects a tendency of optimizing average performance across domains using UP-True, for which the true reward signals are provided. An interpretation of this result could be that PPO is trained only in one source domain so it is more \u201cfocused\u201d to obtain good performance in that domain, so it might be able to obtain better policy in that domain but (as shown empirically) fails to generalize to other domains. Another angle could be that in UP-True, the policy network is shared across domains so policy updates are done using rollouts from multiple domains. Therefore it is not able to \"overfit\" to a specific domain as the PPO expert does on the source domain. Hence the performance difference. \n\nSince ADAIL imitates demonstrations from the PPO expert (as opposed to learning from scratch), it is able to emulate the performance in the source domain. GRL in this case helps because it mitigates the problem of inconsistent reward signals from the discriminator across shifted domains.\n\n\u201cHow would you adapt to unseen environments in ADAIL-pred? I don't see explanations in the text about how this is done. Essentially, how are samples obtained from the environment in order to perform posterior inference?\u201d\n\nAs shown in Section 4.2, we demonstrate ADAIL performance to unseen environments (not seen during training). The experimental procedure is as follows:\n\nIn a new environment, the posterior performs online inference on each time step given the current (s, a, s\u2019) tuple. The predicted code is subsequently fed to the policy as the conditioned dynamics code. We have also tried moving average style filtering on the posterior predictions with minor performance gain. Thus we omitted multi-step posterior inference.\n\nComparison with related papers:\n\nThanks for pointing us to the related recent work!

It seems a lot of them are even larger than the mean.\n\nThere is little explanation to the VAE-ADAIL experiments -- is it safe to assume most of the experiments require certain knowledge of the latent variable in order to be successful? Maybe some of the arguments about VAE can go to the appendix.\n\nWhy would in some cases UP-True performs much worse than ADAIL? In Ant it is even worse than PPO expert.\n\nHow would you adapt to unseen environments in ADAIL-pred? I don't see explanations in the text about how this is done. Essentially, how are samples obtained from the environment in order to perform posterior inference?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1582/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1582/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adaptive Adversarial Imitation Learning", "authors": ["Yiren Lu", "Jonathan Tompson", "Sergey Levine"], "authorids": ["luyiren92@gmail.com", "tompson@google.com", "slevine@google.com"], "keywords": ["Imitation Learning", "Reinforcement Learning"], "abstract": "We present the ADaptive Adversarial Imitation Learning (ADAIL) algorithm for learning adaptive policies that can be transferred between environments of varying dynamics, by imitating a small number of demonstrations collected from a single source domain.

It is however assumed that the agent has access to a parameterized simulator that can simulate the expert dynamics. The parameters for the simulator are not known but are assumed to be drawn from a known distribution.\nThe proposed method is based on GAIL but uses several modifications:\n- A contextual policy is trained that also takes the dynamics-parameters as additional input. At each iteration, a new environment is sampled for performing the policy-rollout.\n- A \"posterior\" prediction network is trained to maximize the likelihood of the parameters that were used for the different roll-outs. This network is used for the test case, where the true dynamics of the agent are not known.\n- The discriminator might use features of the state-action input that correlate with the corresponding dynamics. Classifying based on such features may be undesirable because the discriminator might no longer produce useful rewards. In order to address this problem, an additional head is added to the discriminator that outputs a prediction of the dynamic parameters. The prediction error is trained by backpropagation, however by flipping the sign of the gradient at the last shared layer, the features of the discriminator are optimized to be unsuited for predicting the dynamic parameters (the technique is known as Gradient Reversal Layer).\n- A VAE-based method for learning latent dynamic parameters is proposed, by training a conditional VAE to reconstruct the next state, where the current state and action are provided as context to the encoder and decoder.\n\nContribution:\nOne of the strong-points of the submission is the fact that it features several different, orthogonal contributions. I also think that the considered problem setting is relatively interesting. However, also when considering real applications such as robotics, I am not convinced that explicitly modeling the dynamic changes is necessary. Some existing imitation learning methods focus on a setting where the dynamics of the expert may differ from the agent, but the dynamics of agents do not change. This setting does not require dynamic-contextual policies and seems to be applicable to typical robot applications.\n\nSoundness:\nThe different components of the proposed methods seem reasonable to me. They do not come with (and arguably do not require) new derivations but seem rather like pragmatic solutions for the encountered problem.\nThe optimization problem (Eq.2) seems to be formulated slightly inaccurate, because the last term should in my opinion not depend on theta. If I understand correctly, the policy should not maximize the likelihood of the dynamics posterior.\nThe contrastive regularization loss needs to be better motivated. A high KL in the first term may not necessary be bad, for example, if the confidence in the prediction of (s_0, a_0, s'_0) is lower compared to (s_1, a_1, s'_1). If a similar regularizer has been used in prior work, such work should be referenced. Otherwise, it needs to be motivated.\n\nPresentation/Clarity:\nThe presentation of the work is arguably the main weakness of the paper.\nThe submission does not seem polished. It contains a large amount of typos. Figure 2 is confusing and adds little compared to the text description. Also the structure could be improved. For example, the submission introduces the posterior loss and outlines the algorithm before describing the individual components.\nThe paper uses some techniques such as conditional VAEs [1] or contextual policy search [2]\nare used but not described / referenced.\n\nEvaluation:\nI like that the different aspects of the proposed method are also evaluated individually. The ablations with respect to the adaptability and GRL are crucial. The evaluation of the performance could be improved. PPO and UP-True use the true reward function, so the only real competitor is a naive GAIL-baseline that uses randomized dynamics during training. I'm not aware of prior work that considers the exact same setting as the manuscript. However, one of the main arguments for inverse reinforcement learning is the claimed generalizability of a reward function as opposed to a policy. I see that learning a new policy after each change in the dynamics may be too costly in some settings. However, comparisons to methods such as AIRL that aim to learn reward functions that are robust to changes in the dynamics would be highly interesting.\n\n[1] Sohn Kihyuk, Honglak Lee, and Xinchen Yan. \u201cLearning Structured Output Representation using Deep Conditional Generative Models.\u201d Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2015.\n[2] Marc Peter Deisenroth, Gerhard Neumann, and Jan Peters.

This is a severe requirement for real-word scenarios, and somewhat antithetic to the robotics learning motivation given by the authors in the introduction. Moreover, Figure 7 seems to imply that the method doesn\u2019t generalize well to unseen environments, if enough environments can\u2019t be sampled during training time.\n\n\nMinor comment:\n\nFigure 8.
