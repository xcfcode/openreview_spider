We initially left out a comparison to Parzen window estimates as we believed it was known to be a poor measure in high dimensions (Theis et al.), but due to its prevalence, you are right in saying it should be included.\n\nTo that end, we have updated our paper by running Parzen window estimates on the CIFAR-10 dataset which, by way of its high-dimensionality, most closely reflects real world data. Parzen windows did not track CIFAR-10 image quality. Moreover, we now show that it is not PCA compression that allows our method to work. We demonstrate this by embedding each sample with its the primary PCA components, and then we use Parzen window estimates on this compressed PCA coefficient embedding. Here Parzen windows estimation still fails as a measure of image quality.\n\nWe do not think that it is a trivial task to construct a metric that corresponds to image quality and correlates with diversity of samples, otherwise the measure would already exist and be used in GAN research.\n\nThank you again for reviewing our paper.

In the proposed approach, first a PCA is applied to the samples of real and generated images and then the distributions are approximated by GMMs on the principal components.

Given that Parzen window estimate is flawed in evaluating the likelihood of generative models (see Theis et al., 2015), I don't see why a simple linear transformation before GMM approximation would solve this problem.

They propose to build a gaussian mixture model approx. to the generators distribution and the empirical data distribution by fitting a single gaussian to each point of the respective distributions (and having equal mixing proportions). Rather than using each image as the gaussian mean, they use the vector of the first k principle components. To compare the generative and empirical distributions they compute the min KL distribution between each pair of gaussians and same the expectation over all mixture components. \n\nPros:\nThe main advantage I see of this approach over other nearest neighbor based approaches (namely parzen window estimates) is that by running PCA on the image and then computing distance between images in this reduced dimensional space, some of the issue of high dimensional spaces can be alleviated. \n\nCons:\nThis paper does not mention parzen window estimates, which have long been used as a measure of generative modeling quality (specifically an approximation to the likelihood of held out data under the generative models distribution). Parzen window estimates are also known to be very ineffective in high dimensional image spaces and the authors do not mention this at all. Potentially their approach is better because of the dimensionality reduction of PCA but the authors do no mention this. More generally, the authors don't compare their metric against anything else! Their only experiment show that their metric correlates with image quality on a couple datasets. This is not very interesting since one could construct a number of metrics based on nearest neighbor based approaches that correlate with image samples but that doesn't mean they are better than anything that exists. \n\nSummary:\nOverall, I think the idea is potentially useful, but the authors have not shown either empirically or theoretically that this metric is any better than existing approaches. Furthermore, they don't even mention related approaches, namely the closely related parzen window estimate method.
