Integrated with an iterative MCMC method, the authors develop an efficient algorithm and use both synthetic and real data set to demonstrate that their algorithms outperform many other state-of-art algorithms. \n\nMajor comments:\nIn the beginning of section 3, the authors assume that all the terms that characterize the change-points and anomaly points are normally distributed with mean zero and different variance. However, in classic formulation for change-point or anomaly detection, usually there is also a mean shift other than the variance change. For example, we might assume $r_t \\sim N(\\theta, \\sigma_r^2)$ for some $\\theta>0$ to demonstrate the positive mean shift. I believe that this kind of mean shift is more efficient to model the structure of change-point. \n\nMy main concern is with the novelty. The work does not seem to be very novel.\n\nMinor comments:\n\n1. In the end of the page 2, the last panel is the residual, not the spikes. \n\n2.

It develops algorithms for inference and forecasting. The performance is evaluated and compared against state-of-the-art methods on three data sets: 1) synthetic data obtained from the generative Bayesian model itself; 2) well-log data; 3) internet traffic data.\n\nOn the methodological side, this appears to be a solid and significant contribution, although I am not sure how well it is aligned with the scope of ICLR. The introduced model is elegant; the algorithms for inference are non-trivial.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, one cannot expect this contribution to be ground-breaking, since there has been more than 40 years of work on time series forecasting, change point and anomaly detection. In some situations the methodology proposed here will work better than previous approaches (particularly in the situation where the data comes from the Bayesian model itself - in that case, there clearly is no better approach), in other cases (which the paper might have put less emphasis on), previous approaches will work better. To position this kind of work, I think it is important the authors discuss the limitations of their approach. Some guidelines on when or when not to use it would be valuable. Clearly, these days one cannot introduce methodology in this area and expect it to outperform existing methods under all circumstances (and hence practitioners to always choose it over any other existing method).\n\nWhat is surprising is that relatively simple approaches like ETS or STL work pretty much equally well (in some cases even better in terms of MSE) than the proposed approach, while more recent approaches - like BSTS - dramatically fail. It would be good if the authors could comment on why this might be the case.\n\nSummary:\n+ Methodology appears to be a significant, solid contribution.\n- Experiments are not conclusive as to when or when not to choose this approach over existing methods\n- writing needs to be improved (large number of grammatical errors and typos, e.g. 'Mehtods')", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Bayesian Time Series Forecasting with Change Point and Anomaly Detection", "abstract": "Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in marketing, finance and many other quantitative fields.

We have made changes following your suggestions. Please see below for our response point by point. Thank you.\n\n\nThe paper introduces a Bayesian model for timeseries with anomaly and change points besides regular trend and seasonality. It develops algorithms for inference and forecasting. The performance is evaluated and compared against state-of-the-art methods on three data sets: 1) synthetic data obtained from the generative Bayesian model itself; 2) well-log data; 3) internet traffic data.\n\n>> Thanks for the appreciation of our work. \n\nFrom a practical perspective, one cannot expect this contribution to be ground-breaking, since there has been more than 40 years of work on time series forecasting, change point and anomaly detection. In some situations the methodology proposed here will work better than previous approaches (particularly in the situation where the data comes from the Bayesian model itself - in that case, there clearly is no better approach), in other cases (which the paper might have put less emphasis on), previous approaches will work better. To position this kind of work, I think it is important the authors discuss the limitations of their approach. \n\n>> As most (if not all) of the time series works, our method cannot work in every case. For example, when the time series does not have clear decomposition structure as modeled in Eqs.(1-3), the model may not correctly recover the hidden components and correspondingly perform forecasting.\n\nSome guidelines on when or when not to use it would be valuable. Clearly, these days one cannot introduce methodology in this area and expect it to outperform existing methods under all circumstances (and hence practitioners to always choose it over any other existing method).\n\nWhat is surprising is that relatively simple approaches like ETS or STL work pretty much equally well (in some cases even better in terms of MSE) than the proposed approach, while more recent approaches - like BSTS - dramatically fail. It would be good if the authors could comment on why this might be the case.\n\n>>  BSTS fails in some cases due to the mismatch between model assumptions and actual data distribution and generation process. Usually more complicated a model is, more likely it will fail when the data structure does not satisfy its underlying assumptions. In those cases, simple approaches may achieve better performance, which is not surprising. Nevertheless, our proposed method obtains the best result.\n\nSummary:\n+ Methodology appears to be a significant, solid contribution.\n- Experiments are not conclusive as to when or when not to choose this approach over existing methods\n- writing needs to be improved (large number of grammatical errors and typos, e.g. 'Methods')\n\n>> We will incorporate the discussions regarding model strength, application conditions, and the limitations in final version. \n>> We already fix the typos in updated version. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Bayesian Time Series Forecasting with Change Point and Anomaly Detection", "abstract": "Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in marketing, finance and many other quantitative fields.
