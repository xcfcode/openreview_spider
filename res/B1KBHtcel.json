Moreover, the task is not as standard and extensively studied in NLP; so strong results on the benchmark should not automatically warrant publication at ICLR (e.g., I would probably treat differently standard benchmarks in syntactic parsing of English or machine translation).

To summarize, the main contribution of our work is to propose a novel joint model based on pointer network architecture which achieves state-of-the-art results on argumentation mining task with a large gap.  \n\nThere are three main concerns raised by the reviewers. The first and the main concern is the novelty of the model.  We believe that in part this concern is due to a misunderstanding that occurred because we mislabeled our proposed joint model as \u201cPN\u201d in the results table (see our discussion below).  We think this led some of the reviewers to believe that the paper merely pointer network model to a specific task. \n\nThe second concern is about the overall contribution of the paper to representation learning.  We argue that it is precisely the joint representation learned by our model in the encoding phase, as well as the fact that our model supports separate source and target representations for a given text span, that allows us to substantially outperform standard recurrent models.  \n\nThe third question raised by the reviewers concerns the meaningful comparison to other methods for recovering relations, such as stack-based models for syntactic parsing.  We believe that this comparison is not appropriate in our case.  As a discourse parsing task, argumentation mining requires the flexibility of recovering relations that are quite distinct from syntactic parsing, in that they allow both projective and non-projective structures, multi-root parse fragments, and components with no incoming or no outgoing links. \n\nWe give more specific responses to reviewer comments below.\n\n\u201cPointer network has been proposed before.\u201d \n\nAs is evident in Table 1, a direct application of a pointer network (PN) does not achieve state-of-the-art on link prediction.  Neither is it suitable for AC type prediction.  In fact, a direct application of PN performs substantially worse on link prediction than the joint model, which achieves state-of-the-art on both tasks in the persuasive essay corpus, as well as on link prediction in the microtext corpus. \n\n\u201cI am concerned, though, that the paper doesn't make a substantial novel contribution to representation learning.\u201d \n\nWe argue that the better performance of the joint PN model is purely due to the representations of the components learned by the model.  When the representation learned in the encoding phase is shared between the two tasks, the model can factor in the information about the types of argument components that are more likely to be linked.  And indeed, our results shows that the information encoded for type prediction is also useful for link prediction, substantially boosting the performance of the joint model.\n\nFurthermore, we also show that the sequence-to-sequence model we propose does much better than standard recurrent models, e.g. Table 1 shows that a BLSTM model can match previous state-of-the-art, which the joint PN model surpasses substantially.  We argue that the better performance of our model is due to the separate representations learned during encoding/decoding. Effectively, our model allows an argument component to have separate representations in its role as a source or a target of a link.\n\n\u201cThe proposed multi-task learning method is interesting, but the authors only verified it on one task.\u201d \n\nAlthough we do focus on a single task, we test the model on two different datasets, each with its own characteristics. For example, the Microtext corpus has only 100 training examples, and our model is still able to achieve state-of-the-art on link prediction. Furthermore, compared to the Persuasive Essay corpus, the Microtext corpus is much more standardized; all examples are trees and there is exactly one claim in each example. Therefore, even though we focus on a single task, the datasets we test on have varying characteristics, which highlights the generalizability of the model.\n\n\u201c...the stack-based method can be used for forest prediction\u2026\u201d \n\nCompared to stack-based models, the PN-based framework is more flexible.  Specifically, this framework easily handles projective and non-projective structures, multi-root parse fragments, and components with no incoming or no outgoing links. For example, a stack-based model, such as the one proposed by Dyer et al. (2016), assumes a single-root, projective tree, which is an assumption commonly violated in discourse parsing tasks such as argumentation mining. \n\n\u201c...I found that the assumption that the boundaries of AC are given is a very strong constraint, and could potentially limit the usefulness of the proposed model.\u201d \n\nWe would like to point out that previous work on AC boundary detection, specifically, the work by the creators of the persuasive essay corpus (Stab & Gurevich 2016) has already achieved near human-level performance in identifying argument components; this is in stark contrast to the previous models for link and type prediction.\n\n\u201cthe experiments right now cannot reflect the advantages of pointer network models.\u201d \n\nWe believe this is incorrect.  Specifically, The ILP Joint model uses 18 different hand-engineered features, often requiring external tools such as POS tagging. Our model outperforms it with minimal feature extraction. The MP+p model assumes a single-tree structure explicitly for links (which is unique to the Microtext corpus). Our model outperforms it for link extraction without any explicit single-tree constraint."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Here's My Point: Argumentation Mining with Pointer Networks", "abstract": "One of the major goals in automated argumentation mining is to uncover the argument structure present in argumentative text.

The authors proposed a pointer network structure to recover the argument relations. They also propose modifications on pointer network to perform joint training on both type and link prediction tasks. Overall the model is reasonable, but I am not sure if ICLR is the best venue for this work.\n\nMy first concern of the paper is on the novelty of the model. Pointer network has been proposed before. The proposed multi-task learning method is interesting, but the authors only verified it on one task. This makes me feel that maybe the submission is more for a NLP conference rather than ICLR. \n\nThe authors stated that the pointer network is less restrictive compared to some of the existing tree predicting method. However, the datasets seem to only contain single trees or forests, and the stack-based method can be used for forest prediction by adding a virtual root node to each example (as done in the dependency parsing tasks). Therefore, I think the experiments right now cannot reflect the advantages of pointer network models unfortunately. \n\nMy second concern of the paper is on the target task. Given that the authors want to analyze the structures between sentences, is the argumentation mining the best dataset? For example, authors could verify their model by applying it to the other tasks that require tree structures such as dependency parsing. As for NLP applications, I found that the assumption that the boundaries of AC are given is a very strong constraint, and could potentially limit the usefulness of the proposed model. \n\nOverall, in terms of ML, I also feel that baseline methods the authors compared to are probably strong for the argument mining task, but not necessary strong enough for the general tree/forest prediction tasks (as there are other tree/forest prediction methods). In terms of NLP applications, I think the assumption of having AC boundaries is too restrictive, and maybe ICLR is not the best venture for this submission. \n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Here's My Point: Argumentation Mining with Pointer Networks", "abstract": "One of the major goals in automated argumentation mining is to uncover the argument structure present in argumentative text.

Below we have responded to specific points in the review.\n\n\u201cI am concerned, though, that the paper doesn't make a substantial novel contribution to representation learning.\u201d \nAlthough the problem may appear to be a straightforward application of a PN, the results of Table 1 show that a PN alone does not achieve high performance. We extend the PN through joint modeling, as well as adding a FC-layer for LSTM input. As we note in our discussion, these modifications are crucial for achieving state-of-the-art results. The argument for the joint model is that the representations learned in the encoding phase are able to be shared between the dual tasks. For example, certain component types are likelier to have incoming/outgoing links, therefore information encoded for type prediction can also be useful for link prediction. Also, we address the fact that this problem can be solved by a standard recurrent model, as opposed to a sequence-to-sequence model. However, as our results show, while a BLSTM model can match previous state-of-the-art, the PN model performs measurably better. We argue that the better performance of the PN model is due to the separate representations learned during encoding/decoding. This allows components to be modeled separately as incoming/outgoing components.\n\n\u201c...the paper does not make any substantial comparison with other possible ways of producing trees.\u201d \nWe would like to reiterate that only in the Microtext corpus are all the examples trees; in the persuasive essay corpus some examples are forests (we will work to clarify this in the paper). With this in mind, for the Microtext corpus, we compare against a model, MP+p, that uses a minimum spanning tree parser. We apologize for not disambiguating the abbreviation \u2018MSTParser\u2019.\n\n\u201cFigure 2 appears to have an error. You report that the decoder produces a distribution over input indices only, but you show an example of the network pointing to an output index in one case.\u201d \nWe chose to construct the figure in this way to illustrate that, by pointing to its own index, the model predicts no outgoing link for this components. By pointing to an input component in the Figure, this implies that the component has an outgoing link.
