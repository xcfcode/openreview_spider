The paper compares pre-trained language models to other potential alternative pre-training options, and concludes that while pre-trained language models are generally stronger than other alternatives, the robustness and generality of the currently available method is less than ideal, at least with respect to ELMO-based pretraining. \n\nPros:\nThe paper presents an extensive empirical study that offers new insights on pre-trained language models with respect to a variety of sentence-level tasks.   \n\nCons:\nThe primarily contributions of this paper is empirical and technical novelty is relatively weak. Also, the insights are based just on ELMO, which may have a relatively weak empirical impact. The reviews were generally positive but marginally positive, which reflect that insights are interesting but not overwhelmingly interesting. None of these is a deal-breaker per say, but the paper does not provide sufficiently strong novelty, whether based on insights or otherwise, relative to other papers being considered for acceptance.\n\nVerdict:\nLeaning toward reject due to relatively weak novelty and empirical impact.\n\nAdditional note on the final decision: \nThe insights provided by the paper are valuable, thus the paper was originally recommended for an accept. However, during the calibration process across all areas, it became evident that we cannot accept all valuable papers, each presenting different types of hard work and novel contributions. Consequently, some papers with mostly positive (but marginally positive) reviews could not be included in the final cut, despite their unique values, hard work, and novel contributions.

We agree with your overall assessment.

The tricky point here is that we follow the exact same training procedure here as in the other rows of that table, to make sure we\u2019re isolating the effect of the data and not the training procedure. In that procedure, we pretrain an encoder, freeze it, then initialize and train a new task-specific model, so we wind up training two different task-specific models: one (always without attention) that\u2019s used only during encoder pretraining, and another (always with attention) that\u2019s trained on the frozen encoder and then evaluated.\n\nThis is fairly complex, but it allows us to make the comparisons we want to make. The single-task baselines in the original GLUE paper are trained in a single pass with a single target-task model, so those runs aren\u2019t precisely comparable to ours.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1360/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1360/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1360/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Looking for ELMo's friends: Sentence-Level Pretraining Beyond Language Modeling", "abstract": "Work on the problem of contextualized word representation\u2014the development of reusable neural network components for sentence understanding\u2014has recently seen a  surge of progress centered on the unsupervised pretraining task of language modeling with methods like ELMo (Peters et al., 2018).

We agree that we have presented informative results on a few questions surrounding pretraining. We agree with some of your additional points, but we strongly disagree with your implication they make this paper not worth publishing.\n\nWe don\u2019t \u201cbelieve that ELMO is the best contextual language model\u201d, as you suggest. _Best_ is subjective, but we note on page 5 that Radford et al.\u2019s Transformer model outperforms ELMo on GLUE. \n\nWe focus on ELMo because it represented the state of the art as of spring, when we started building out the infrastructure for our experiments. Given the scale of this experiment, we would not have had time to conduct a similar analysis that follows the model and methods of Radford et al. (or BERT, which was released **after the ICLR deadline**), but we agree that a similar such analysis would be worthwhile.\n\nWe also think that research on ELMo-style models would be worthwhile even if these fine-tuning based systems had come out earlier. ELMo\u2019s pretrain-and-freeze approach to sentence representations is already being widely deployed (see Kitaev and Klein on parsing, or Gehrmann on summarization, for example), and it is likely the most practical approach if one wants to deploy a full NLP toolkit in a setting like a mobile phone where one cannot store a full separate fine-tuned 100MB-1GB encoder file for each task model that the toolkit provides. \n\nFurther, many of our experiments on supervised pretraining do not involve ELMo, and we argue that the paper still offers more than enough worthwhile results even if you do not accept that ELMo is in any way worth studying.\n\nZooming out a bit, though, we *strongly* disagree with the premise that it\u2019s not worth publishing a paper if the baseline system does not represent the state of the art as of *publication* time, or that such papers cannot have a substantial impact. That would rule out most experimental papers, and it would rule out _any_ time-consuming analysis on exactly those topics where analysis would be most useful.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1360/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1360/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1360/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Looking for ELMo's friends: Sentence-Level Pretraining Beyond Language Modeling", "abstract": "Work on the problem of contextualized word representation\u2014the development of reusable neural network components for sentence understanding\u2014has recently seen a  surge of progress centered on the unsupervised pretraining task of language modeling with methods like ELMo (Peters et al., 2018).

The main conclusion is that both single-task and LM-based pre-training helps in most situations, but the gain is often not large, and not consistent across all GLUE tasks.\n\nThis paper represents an impressive amount of experimentation. The study and the experimental results will be useful and interesting to the community. The result that some tasks' performance are negatively correlated with each other is surprising. The paper is clearly written. \n\nOne clarification question I have is about what the \"Single-task\" pre-training means. The paper seems to suggest that it consists of pre-training a model on the same task on which it is later evaluated. I'm confused by what this means, and how this is different from just training on that task.

This paper contributes the first large-scale systematic study comparing different pretraining tasks in this context, both as complements to language modeling and as potential alternatives. The primary results of the study support the use of language modeling as a pretraining task and set a new state of the art among comparable models using multitask learning with language models. However, a closer look at these results reveals worryingly strong baselines and strikingly varied results across target tasks, suggesting that the widely-used paradigm of pretraining and freezing sentence encoders may not be an ideal platform for further work.\n", "keywords": ["natural language processing", "transfer learning", "multitask learning"], "authorids": ["bowman@nyu.edu", "ellie_pavlick@brown.edu", "egrave@fb.com", "vandurme@cs.jhu.edu", "alexwang@nyu.edu", "jan.hula21@gmail.com", "paxia@jhu.edu", "raghu1991.p@gmail.com", "tom.mccoy@jhu.edu", "romapatel@brown.edu", "n.kim@jhu.edu", "iftenney@google.com", "huangyi@us.ibm.com", "yukatherin@fb.com", "jinxx596@d.umn.edu", "bchen6@swarthmore.edu"], "authors": ["Samuel R.
