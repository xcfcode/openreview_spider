Which parts are discrete, which parts are continuous. What would be the relation between dense(w), bottleneck(w) and c(s)? Show how does the training signal goes through these. What is the training objective function?

But we are not aware of any metric of this kind -- we'd be happy to add the results if the reviewer can suggest one.

We've performed a number of experiments with VAEs in the same setting. The reviewer writes \"How is the performance if c(s) is replaced with the representations achieved from autoencoder, variational autoencoder or simply the sentence vectors [...]\". We wanted to assess this, but it is hard in principle to calculate DSAE in this case, as the number of bits in the auto-encoded representation cannot be easily measured in the dense case. In principle it's  not clear at all how to measure it for plain autoencoders or sentence vectors as even a 1-d real number can contain an unlimited number of bits (if it's a 32-bit float, it's just 32, but that's still more than our discrete representation). For VAEs, one can use the KL divergence as measure, but this is an approximate notion even in theory. In practice, all dense autoencoders, even into 4-d or 6-d vectors, begin to perfectly autoencode the sequences. So while p' is very low, it's almost impossible later to sample from those dense distributions. We tried this for VAEs as well, but even with different annealing schemes for the KL term we never managed to obtain high-quality samples, nothing comparable to our discrete results. Notably, this experience with dense autoencoders for language has been replicated by others. So our discrete method is at present the only way we know of to make autoencoders work well for language models. We hope that the reviewer will take this into account and revise the score. We are also happy to include more evaluations and will be grateful for more concrete suggestions of metrics that could be used."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Discrete Autoencoders for Sequence Models", "abstract": "Recurrent models for sequences have been recently successful at many tasks, especially for language modeling\nand machine translation.
