The novel part of this approach is to use a normalized weight for the similarity between two relation embedding. This work can be viewed as a further extension of (Riedel et al., 2013). \n\nThere is one part in the experiment, which I think is confusing. In the column t of both MRR and HITS@10, why adding O_s to D+E actually hurts the performance comparing to D+E+O_u? Based on my understanding, Model O_s is expected to work better than Model O_u. Since utilizing embeddings is the claimed contribution of this paper, I think it definitely needs further investigation, other than simply said it is caused by overfitting.\n\nOverall, I think the contribution of this paper is incremental and the experiment is not fully convincing about the benefit of using relation embedding\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"CMT_id": "", "title": "Embedding Entity Pairs through Observed Relations for Knowledge Base Completion", "abstract": "In this work we present a novel approach for the utilization of observed \nrelations between entity pairs in the task of triple argument prediction. \nThe approach is based on representing observations in a shared, continuous \nvector space of structured relations and text.
