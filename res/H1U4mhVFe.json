The authors perform a human evaluation to show that, unlike the CNN dataset, there is room for models to improve on this larger dataset. \n\nWith that said, it is interesting that the human performance is actually below that of some of the models; I wonder what types of questions humans are answering incorrectly, especially since human performance on the questions incorrectly answered by ASReader is relatively high.  It would be great if the authors could add some discussion on this in future versions of the paper.

While CBT has ~200K examples, this dataset has ~14M examples. Authors also take the AS Reader model and show the performance gain on CBT test set when trained with BookTest training data. Additional human study shows that humans can answer more than 50% of the questions which the model fails to answer which means there is room for improvement.\n\nNovelty: \n\nAdding more training data helps. There is nothing novel in this. However, authors provide a bigger dataset to train machine comprehension model which I think is valuable.\n\nClarity: \n\nPaper is extremely well written (given the page constraints).\n\nSignificance: \n\nThis is a significant contribution since I believe that this data can be used to pre-train any machine comprehension model.\n\nPros:\n+ new dataset which is very large and useful\n+ well written paper\n\nCons:\n- authors could have benchmarked using more models (than just AS Reader)\n", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Embracing Data Abundance", "abstract": "There is a practically unlimited amount of natural language data available.
