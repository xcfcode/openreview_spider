Would it be worse than the robustness of Gaussian noise?\n\nA1:  Thanks for the interesting question and it\u2019s indeed reasonable to wonder if the classifier is robust against random colorization with the same level of corruption. As we know, classifiers are robust against small random corruptions, whereas large random corruptions might be able to change the classification results but not certainly.  Furthermore, large/unbounded random corruptions, such as random colorization as mentioned, cannot generate semantically aligned images. Therefore, they can be easily spotted by humans as adversarial/abnormal. Our methods are exactly trying to resolve these problems by hiding unbounded adversarial patterns in plain sight.\n\nIn particular, some classifiers are not robust towards large random colorizations as seen from the hue and saturation attack [3]. Given sufficiently large perturbation, it is not surprising to see the labels changing. However, hue and saturation attacks give unrealistic images and are not able to do targeted attacks (1.2% on ImageNet). cAdv, on the other hand, has high attack success rates for both targeted and untargeted attacks while staying perceptually realistic. We will clarify this in our revision.\n\n[3] Hosseini, Hossein, and Radha Poovendran. \"Semantic adversarial examples.\" Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops. 2018.\n\n\nQ2:  One of my concerns on tAdv is whether the texture added is indeed effective to reduce the accuracy, or it\u2019s just from the (yet small) beta term in the objective. Adding an ablation of beta=0 case in the result would much help the understanding of the method. \n\nA2: This is a really interesting and important question w.r.t tAdv. We conducted additional experiments suggested as below. We did an ablation with tAdv varying both beta-term and alpha-term in Table 4 of our Appendix. From our study, it can be inferred that increasing beta does not result in an increase in attack success rate; with a very small beta, the attack is highly successful. However, we did include a row when beta is zero in the submitted version. Here we include the numbers when beta = 0 for two cases when tadv is optimized using LBFGS for one iteration of 14 steps (small texture flow) and 3 iterations of 14 steps (large texture flow) as described in our paper. Note that making beta = 0 does not guarantee that we will be able to reach the target as it is difficult to control texture transfer and stop when the target is reached as small change in texture can make images classify to arbitrary classes. It is also to be noted that beta=0 would be a black box attack as the attack does not have any knowledge about the target classifier. \n\nOne iteration of LBFGS with 14 steps of texture transfer\n+--------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+--------------+\n|                                                  | a = 250 | a = 500 | a = 750 | a = 1000 |\n+--------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+--------------+\n| Untargeted Attack Success |   25%    |  24.5%  |   25%    |    24.5%   |\n+--------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+--------------+\n|   Target Attack Success        |   0.5%   |   0.5%   |   0.5%   |     0.5%    |\n+--------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+--------------+\n\nThree iterations of LBFGS with 14 steps of texture transfer (large texture flow transfer)\n+--------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-------------+\n|                                                  | a = 250 | a = 500 | a = 750 | a = 1000 |\n+--------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-------------+\n| Untargeted Attack Success |  37.5%  |  40.5%  | 41.5%   |   42.5%   |\n+--------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-------------+\n|   Target Attack Success        |   0.5%   |   0.0%   |   0.0%   |     0.0%    |\n+--------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-------------+\n\nBoth our Table 4 and the above analysis guarantees that tAdv is indeed effective in improving the attack success rate. We will include this analysis in our paper\u2019s supplementary.\n\n\nQ3: I think F should denote the classifier to attack, but the description tells it's the colorization network. As it seems to me that theta is nevertheless for the colorization network, I feel the notation should be refined for better understanding to the readers.\n\nA3: Yes, that\u2019s a typo and you are correct that F is indeed a classifier to attack. We have fixed this in the revision. Sorry about that and thanks for bringing this to our attention. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2403/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2403/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["bhattad2@illinois.edu", "mchong6@illinois.edu", "kl2@illinois.edu", "lbo@illinois.edu", "daf@illinois.edu"], "title": "Unrestricted Adversarial Examples via Semantic Manipulation", "authors": ["Anand Bhattad", "Min Jin Chong", "Kaizhao Liang", "Bo Li", "D.

What about a ResNet 50 trained on augmented datasets with color jittering? What about finetuned ResNet 50 with taking color channel as explicit input, since the attack uses this additional info.\n\nA1:  We conducted extra two sets of experiments as you described. First, we finetune a ResNet50 model for 35 epochs using:\n\na) data augmented with brightness, contrast, hue, and saturation jittering \nTop1 accuracy: 75.842%\nb)  LAB colorspace as input\nTop1 accuracy: 76.206\n\nWe then apply cAdv to both models. We randomly select 60 images for 3 different classes and use targeted cAdv to attack the two models to two random different classes. The final accuracies of the two models on the cAdv images is as follows\n\nTop1 accuracy for a): 0.000%\nTop1 accuracy for b): 0.000%\n\nEven when trained with data augmentation or taking in LAB colorspace, cAdv is able to easily attack the two models.\n\n\nQ2: As tAdv attack seems to manipulate the high-frequency texture of images, how about applying a Gaussian filter on the images and feed into the discriminator again? Is that attack still effective or not?\n\nA2: Thanks again for the interesting question, and on the suggested experiments regarding  tAdv: In Table 2, under Feature Squeezing, we reported scores for two types of Gaussian Filtering -- 2x2, 3x3. tAdv outperforms other baselines significantly and is a stronger attack on Gaussian Filtering. Our intuition for why tAdv is stronger despite having high-frequency perturbations is because of their structured pattern and are not local like most of the recent other attacks and are therefore able to pass through filtering operations. We will make this clear in our Table as well as the caption in our revision and sorry for the confusion. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2403/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2403/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["bhattad2@illinois.edu", "mchong6@illinois.edu", "kl2@illinois.edu", "lbo@illinois.edu", "daf@illinois.edu"], "title": "Unrestricted Adversarial Examples via Semantic Manipulation", "authors": ["Anand Bhattad", "Min Jin Chong", "Kaizhao Liang", "Bo Li", "D.

To these end, the paper employes another parametrized colorization techniques (and texture transfer method) and proposes optimization objectives for finding adversarial examples with respect to each semantic technique. Experimental results show that the proposed methods are more robust on existing defense methods and more transferrable accross models. The paper also performs a user study to show that the generated examples are fairly imperceptible like the C&W attack. \n\nIn overall, I agree that seeking a new way of attack is important, and the methods are clearly presented to claim a new message to the community: adversarial examples can be even found by exploiting semantic features that humans also utilize, since DNNs tend to overly-utilize them, e.g. colors. These claims are supported by the experiments showing that the generated examples are more transferrable across robust classifiers. Personally, I liked the idea of using another colorization method to design cAdv and the use of K-means clustering to control the imperceptibility. \n\n- Some readers may wonder how the \"averaged-case\" corruption robustness behave for both cAdv and sAdv, e.g. considering random colorization. Would it be worse than the robustness on Gaussian noise?\n- One of my concerns on tAdv is whether the texture added is indeed effective to reduce the accuracy, or its just from the (yet small) beta term in the objective. Adding an ablation of beta=0 case in the result would much help the understanding of the method. \n- Eq 1: I think F should denote the classifier to attack, but the description tells it's the colorization network. As it seems to me that theta is nevertheless for the colorization network, I feel the notation should be refined for better understanding to the readers."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2403/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2403/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["bhattad2@illinois.edu", "mchong6@illinois.edu", "kl2@illinois.edu", "lbo@illinois.edu", "daf@illinois.edu"], "title": "Unrestricted Adversarial Examples via Semantic Manipulation", "authors": ["Anand Bhattad", "Min Jin Chong", "Kaizhao Liang", "Bo Li", "D.
