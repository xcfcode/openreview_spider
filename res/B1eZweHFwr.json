We have addressed the individual reviewer comments below and now address common concerns here.\n\n> Impact of work\n\nAll reviewers have questioned the novelty of the presented work. We would like to address this by pointing out that the problem of these general perturbations is interesting to the research community [1 - 4]. Dealing with interpolation artifacts is a key challenge in achieving robustness to geometric perturbations of images in our and other works [3, 4]. We believe our approach is a suitable and non-straight-forward way to approach the problem.\n\n> Non-isotropic covariance matrices\n\nCohen et al.\u2019s [5] original approach requires only a single (co)variance that is the same for all dimensions. For the perturbations discussed in this work (specifically in section 4) a diagonal covariance matrix is required. Since Theorem 3.2 is the same of diagonal and full covariance matrices we stated it is such. However. for perturbations parameterized by multiple (non-noise) parameters the off-diagonal entries can be used to encode dependencies between the parameters, such as the translation in the x direction and the translation in the y direction. While the diagonal version can proof safety for L2-balls in the parameter space, the off-diagonal entries admits general ellipsoids. \n\n\n[1] Exploring the Landscape of Spatial Robustness, Engstrom et al., ICML 2019, https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02779\n[2] Geometric Robustness of Deep Networks: Analysis and Improvement, Kanbak et al., CVPR 2018, https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09115\n[3] Certifying Geometric Robustness of Neural Networks, Balunovic et al., to appear in NIPS 2019, https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/publications/balunovic2019geometric\n[4] Towards Practical Verification of Machine Learning: The Case of Computer Vision Systems, Pei et al., https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01785\n[5] Certified Adversarial Robustness via Randomized Smoothing, Cohen et al.

Below please find my comments:\n\nDifferent from change-pixel attack, the certification for rotation/brightness change in image classification, volume and pitch change in audio perturbations is much easier. The studied perturbation can be parameterized by a very low dimension vector (i.e. one dimension (angle and volume) for image rotation and volume change, 3 dimensions (brightness for each channel) for brightness perturbation). To certify this attack, given a base classifier, we can simply do, for example, grid search, on the low dimensional space to find the worst case with very good accuracy. And it should be able to give much better than the randomized smoothing method.\n\nOne contribution of this paper is in that: Theorem 3.2 is valid for random smoothing using gaussian with general covariance matrix.

In particular, the authors are interested in settings where the input vectors need not be robust simply to \\ell_2 perturbations, for which previous authors (e.g., Cohen et al.) have already introduced a \"randomized smoothing\" classifier which possesses the desired properties. Instead, motivated by the desire to certify robustness to other families of transformations, the authors propose to introduce a smoothing transform that operates in an additive way on the underlying parameter space (rather than on the raw input vectors, as in the case of \\ell_2 randomized smoothing). The authors provide details for a few examples from image and audio data processing, and then show experimental results on ImageNet data.\n\nComments:\n\nMy assessment of this paper is that the level of novelty is relatively low. On the technical side, I do not believe this paper makes any significant contributions. The authors themselves note that the proof of the main result, Theorem 3.2, closely parallels the proof of Cohen et al. Algorithmically, the proposals of the authors are also minor tweaks of the algorithms in Cohen et al., since the types of perturbations considered in this paper are essentially single-parameter problems. (As a question: The authors prove Theorem 3.2 where the randomized smoothing operation adds possible nonisotropic Gaussian noise in the parameter space. However, it seems that in the examples, the noise added is isotropic -- it is not clear how the authors are choosing \\sigma_i in relation to \\sigma_r for the interpolation example. Can the authors clarify this, and give examples where smoothing with nonisotropic noise would actually be useful?)\n\nThe only real tweak that the authors introduce when presenting their smoothing algorithm is to introduce a small correction term in order to deal with interpolation/rounding errors. However, I do not think that this change is particularly novel.\n\nAs a final comment, I think it would have been interesting for the authors to include some simulations with audio data as well, since this constitutes one of the main motivating applications discussed by the authors."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2349/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2349/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["marcfisc@student.ethz.ch", "mbaader@inf.ethz.ch", "martin.vechev@inf.ethz.ch"], "title": "Statistical Verification of General Perturbations by Gaussian Smoothing", "authors": ["Marc Fischer", "Maximilian Baader", "Martin Vechev"], "pdf": "/pdf/2e40c75db521acb822a80777100b08127c5b4b8a.pdf", "TL;DR": "We present a statistical certification method to certify robustness for rotations, translations and other transformations.", "abstract": "We present a novel statistical certification method that generalizes prior work based on smoothing to handle richer perturbations. Concretely, our method produces a provable classifier which can establish statistical robustness against geometric perturbations (e.g., rotations, translations) as well as volume changes and pitch shifts on audio data. The generalization is non-trivial and requires careful handling of operations such as interpolation. Our method is agnostic to the choice of classifier and scales to modern architectures such as ResNet-50 on ImageNet.", "keywords": ["adversarial robustness", "certified network", "randomised smoothing", "geometric perturbations"], "paperhash": "fischer|statistical_verification_of_general_perturbations_by_gaussian_smoothing", "original_pdf": "/attachment/519e118bcf635acd03a98fb4f4054ab2d95f9fba.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nfischer2020statistical,\ntitle={Statistical Verification of General Perturbations by Gaussian Smoothing},\nauthor={Marc Fischer and Maximilian Baader and Martin Vechev},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1eZweHFwr}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
