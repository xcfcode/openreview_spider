In comparison, for the vanilla feedforward network, although the mean of the gradient norm is preserved if  is properly initialized, the variance of the layer gradient norm increases over depths, which may explode or decay the gradient at deeper layers. \n\nThe result presented in the paper is interesting, and the theory and empirical verification have a good match. I  recommend the acceptance after the following points are well addressed.\n\n1. The mean and variance of layer activation norm and gradient norm have been studied in the mean field literatures for example [1] and the paper does not have a good comparison with them.\n2. The experiment of  CONCATENATIVE RELU is not convincing given the small tasks intertwined performance.\n\nMinor presentation flaws:\n1. The sentence in Abstract \"This depth invariant result is surprising in light of the literature results that state that the norm of the layer\u2019s activations grows exponentially with the specific layer\u2019s depth.\" is not clear itself because of no relevant reference.\n2. There are many typos such as \"weather\", \"for of\" in the paper. Please carefully correct them.\n3. The values on the y-axis of Figure 2 and Figure3 are not correctly shown.\n\n[1] Greg Yang and Samuel Schoenholz 2017. Mean Field Residual Networks: On the Edge of Chaos\n\n\n#####after rebuttal period, I found a fatal error in the paper#####\n\nIn (13), the network output $y_t^L$ is decomposed into two parts $y^{L,k}_t$ and $\\hat{y}^{L,k}_t$, where $y^{L,k}_t$ is composed of paths that go through weight matrix $W^k$ and $\\hat{y}^{L,k}_t$ is composed of paths that skip weight matrix $W^k$.\n\nIn (14), the paper derives $J^k:=\\frac{\\partial y_t^L}{\\partial W^k} = \\frac{\\partial y^{L,k}_t}{\\partial W^k}$. However, in fact the other part $\\hat{y}^{L,k}_t$ also has gradient with respect to  $W^k$ even if the path $\\gamma_t$ does not go through $W^k$ because the activation $z_{\\gamma_t}$ is a function of  $W^k$ .\n\nWith this error, all the following claims in the paper are wrong. Thus I vote to reject this paper.  \n\nOne can do experiment to verify  that \"Thm. 1 also reveals a surprising property of the gradients in general Relu networks. That is, when the weights are sampled from the same distribution in each layer, the gradient\u2019s magnitude for each layer are equal in expectation, and depend only on the output statistics.\" is wrong for ResNet.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper543/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper543/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Effect of Residual Architecture on the Per-Layer Gradient of Deep Networks", "authors": ["Etai Littwin", "Lior Wolf"], "authorids": ["etai.littwin@gmail.com", "wolf@fb.com"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "A critical part of the training process of neural networks takes place in the very first gradient steps post initialization.

Mean field approximations have been used extensively in past work to study activation statistics, both in the forward and backward pass of different architectures. Some mean field--based papers have been mentioned in the related work section of the submitted manuscript. However, following the reviews, we have added more references and further elaborate on the differences between our approach and past work (see also our answer to R3). \nIn general, the mean-field work differs from ours in the type of approximations, and the results that are obtained. Approximation wise, mean field results are obtained by applying the central limit theorem when taking the width to infinity. With this technique,  results studying the effect of  width for finite-sized networks cannot be obtained. It is also assumed that the weights of the forward and backward pass are independent (see Axiom 3.1 in [2]). \nIn addition, we would like to point out that work such as [2], study mean behaviour of expected quantities. That is, mean squared norms of forward and backward signals. The variance of these quantities, however, is effectively nulled by the infinite width approximation. Our work, in contrast, characterizes the effect of finite width, and provides a more complete characterization of the behaviour of forward and backward statistics in the small width regime. We have added further clarification in the related work section regarding this difference.\n\nWe could not completely parse the sentence \u201cThe experiment of  CONCATENATIVE RELU is not convincing given the small tasks intertwined performance\u201d. However, we understand that the reviewer is not convinced by the CR experiments. While we believe that the experiments are quite comprehensive, this is not the main focus of our work. Following the review and the remark of R3 on the relevancy of these results to our theoretical contribution, in the revised version we have moved the empirical support of CR to the supplementary.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out various flaws in the paper presentation. Following the reviewer\u2019s comment, we have removed the sentence \u201cthis depth invariant result\u2026.\u201d altogether from the abstract.

As pointed out by the reviewer, the missing references analyze properties of the input - output Jacobian of various network architectures at initialization at the regime of infinite width and depth. Specifically, the mean squared singular value, as well as the entire distribution of squared singular values of this Jacobian are analyzed in pursuit of dynamical isometry, a state in which the squared singular values of the input - output jacobian are concentrated around 1. Dynamical isometry is indeed a much stronger condition then the Jacobian norm, as it requires access to the entire spectrum. However, in previous work, this is done using various forms of infinite width approximations. \nInstead, our work focuses on finite depth corrections to the statistics of various quantities concerning the squared Frobenius norm of the full per-layer Jacobian (derivative of the output with respect to the weights). Our approach can, therefore, be seen as a complementary approach to analyzing the dynamics at the start of training. We emphasize that our results cannot be obtained using large width approximations, since we seek to characterize the effect of both depth and width on the Jacobian. \nWe have updated the manuscript with references to the relevant prior work, as well as added some discussion in order to better position our work in relation to it.\n\nIndeed supporting CR is only a minor goal of our work. However, since we demonstrated an advantage of CR layers over standard ReLU layers from the initialization perspective, we felt it would be beneficial to compare these empirically to other methods in settings in which multi pathway architectures are not yet dominant. Following the feedback from the reviewers, we have decided to move this empirical section to the appendix.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper543/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper543/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Effect of Residual Architecture on the Per-Layer Gradient of Deep Networks", "authors": ["Etai Littwin", "Lior Wolf"], "authorids": ["etai.littwin@gmail.com", "wolf@fb.com"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "A critical part of the training process of neural networks takes place in the very first gradient steps post initialization.

Whereas the variance of the gradient norm grows with depth for vanilla networks, it can be depth-independent for residual networks when using the proper initialization.\n\nThe main theoretical results stem from a norm propagation duality that allows computations of certain statistics using simplified architectures. As far as I know, this is a novel way of analyzing multi-pathway architectures, and the method and the implied results will be of interest to deep-learning theorists.\n\nThere are two types of empirical results, one to verify the theoretical predictions, and the other to see if those predictions translate into improved generalization performance on some real-world tasks. Figures 2 and 3 show good agreement with theory. I am less convinced by Fig 4. Unless I missed something, I thought the implication from the theoretical analysis was that multi-pathway models should behave better than single-pathway models at large depth, and for single-pathway models concatenated ReLU may have slightly better large-depth behavior than standard ReLU. Doesn't this suggest that for large depth DenseNet ~= ResNet > CR > ReLU? Is the good performance of CR supposed to be understood as supporting evidence for the theoretical analysis? Or is the point more like \"the theory suggests CR might be interesting, and indeed it performs well, but we leave the details of generalization performance to a future study\"? It would be important to specify the desired interpretation here.\n\nBut I think regardless of the interpretation, the empirical results are not strong enough to stand on their own as support for CR, especially since this type of architecture has been introduced and studied previously (c.f. also the looks-linear setup from [1]). Therefore my evaluation is mostly based on the theoretical contributions, which I think are themselves are probably sufficient for publication.\n\nOne main area for improvement is in the related work. A significant line of work is omitted that studies higher-order statistics of Jacobian matrices in the large-depth, infinite-width regime [2-8], and while this is at infinite width, it work for any non-linearity, so is an important point for comparison. Other kinds of initialization schemes are also relevant for comparison, e.g. [9-10].\n\n[1] Balduzzi, David, et al. \"The shattered gradients problem: If resnets are the answer, then what is the question?.\" Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning-Volume 70.
