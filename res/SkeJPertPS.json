Yes, for open set domain adaptation, we need to elaborate train models so that it does not simply minimize or adjust domain shifts. The source and target domains in the open set condition have a different set of classes, including unknown classes. Therefore, due to this condition of the open set domain adaptation, the overfitting problem should be suppressed. To do this, we take advantage of the good property of random forests [2], which rarely overfit to the training data since they form weak ensembles of multiple decision trees as studied in previous works [3][4]. Therefore, we argue that the proposed CoBRF is robust to the overfitting problem due to the unbalanced classes and the existence of the unknown class of the open set domain adaptation task.\n\n[2] Leo Breiman.

Taking advantage of the ImageNet dataset\nAll baseline methods in this paper use pretrained models from the ImageNet dataset.\nFor example, OSVM, ATI-\u03bb + OSVM and Saito et al. in Table 6 utilize AlexNet pretrained by the ImageNet dataset. JAN, ATI-semi, and CDA in Table 7 also select ResNet-50 that were pretrained with the ImageNet dataset as their backbone networks.\n\nWe also use AlexNet for Table 6 and ResNet-50 for the other tables where two backbone networks are pretrained by ImgaeNet.\n\nThus both the proposed CoBRF and state-of-the-art baseline works take advantage of the ImageNet dataset to train domain adaptation methods.\n\n\n2. End-to-end learning of neural networks\nPlease note that the main focus of CoBRF is to improve the last classification layer in the neural network assuming that the deap features are fixed.\n\nAlthough CoBRF does not update the neural network parameters, it outperforms the state-of-the-art works in various experiments. We argue that the pre-trained network provides generalized features for generic classification, which makes CoBRF work well for domain adaptation tasks. Also, most state-of-the-art works learn their models on the pretrained networks from ImageNet, which indicates that they also depend on the capabilities of pretraining on the large dataset.\n\n3. Training from scratch\nAlthough CoBRF is mainly for learning more robust and generic classifier, we can train a network with CoBRF from scratch by combining another domain adaptation method. We first train a deep neural network with another method from scratch, and then we can construct CoBRF on the feature set for the trained deep neural networks. In addition, we can train a deep neural network with triplet sampling from the split result of random forests proposed in [1]. Using this method, a deep neural network can be trained from scratch with random forests.\n[1] Under review.

Their method is based on a decision tree in which the data at each node are split into equal sizes while maximizing the\ninformation gain.  They also proposed a way to reduce domain alignment. Their method is tested on several noisy domain adaptation settings and performs better than other baseline methods. \n\nPros:\nTheir idea to utilize a decision tree for domain adaptation sounds novel. \nExperiments indicate the effectiveness of their method.\n\nCons:\nThis paper is not well-written and has many unclear parts. \n1, The presentation of the problem set is unclear throughout this paper. In the abstract, they mentioned that they tackle the situation where both source and target domains contain noisy examples. However, they did not define the exact problem setting in any section. I could not understand what kind of problem setting motivated their method, which makes it hard to understand their method. \n2, How they actually optimized the model is also unclear. From Eq 1~4, it is hard to grasp how they trained the model. \n3, In open-set domain adaptation, simply minimizing domain-distance can harm the performance. How does the method avoid this issue? It was also unclear. \n4, Experimental setting seems to be wrong and unclear. In Openset1, they say that \"The labels from 1 to 10 of both source and target domains are marked as the known class, and all data with label 11\u223c20 in the source domain and label 21\u223c31 in the\ntarget domain are used as one unknown class\". However, Saito et al. (2018) used 21-31 classes in the target domain as one unknown class. In addition, \"According to Saito et al. (2018) the target data of the unknown class is not used in training, \", they used the 21-31 classes for training in an unsupervised way. How is this method used to detect unknown class? Is there any threshold value set for it?\n5, The experimental setting is unclear. In 4.4, \", we use only 10% of training samples\", does it mean 10 % training source examples or target examples? This setting is also unclear. \n\nFrom the cons written above, this paper has too many unclear parts in the experiments and method section. I cannot say the result is reproducible given the content of the paper and the result is a reliable one. They need to present more carefully designed experiments. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2344/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2344/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["jongbin.ryu@gmail.com", "maybe@hanyang.ac.kr", "jlim@hanyang.ac.kr"], "title": "Collaborative Training of Balanced Random Forests for Open Set Domain Adaptation", "authors": ["Jongbin Ryu", "Jiun Bae", "Jongwoo Lim"], "pdf": "/pdf/0b9cfb123ef467704ea8381ee6539b391ba14028.pdf", "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a collaborative training algorithm of balanced random forests for domain adaptation tasks which can avoid the overfitting problem.

This term encourages\nalignment of the source and target domains in the leaves of trees in\nthe forest. Experimental results are given on a range of standard\nand open-set domain adaptation datasets.\n\nThe paper has a number of issues:\n\n1. There are some problems with clarity, and the English is somewhat rough\n   throughout. These problems are not terribly distracting, but the\n   manuscript could use more polish.\n2. I don't see a detailed discussion anywhere about the\n   hyperparameters used for fitting the random forests. How many trees\n   are used? What is the max depth? These parameters should be\n   discussed and included in the ablations in order to appreciate the\n   complexity/performance tradeoffs.\n\nThis paper has some interesting ideas in it, and the experimental\nresults are excellent. I would encourage the authors to move salient\nmaterial from the supplementary material to the main article and to\nprovide a more thorough discussion of the complexity of the models\n(the structural parameters of the trees/forests)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2344/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2344/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["jongbin.ryu@gmail.com", "maybe@hanyang.ac.kr", "jlim@hanyang.ac.kr"], "title": "Collaborative Training of Balanced Random Forests for Open Set Domain Adaptation", "authors": ["Jongbin Ryu", "Jiun Bae", "Jongwoo Lim"], "pdf": "/pdf/0b9cfb123ef467704ea8381ee6539b391ba14028.pdf", "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a collaborative training algorithm of balanced random forests for domain adaptation tasks which can avoid the overfitting problem. In real scenarios, most domain adaptation algorithms face the challenges from noisy, insufficient training data. Moreover in open set categorization, unknown or misaligned source and target categories adds difficulty. In such cases, conventional methods suffer from overfitting and fail to successfully transfer the knowledge of the source to the target domain. To address these issues, the following two techniques are proposed. First, we introduce the optimized decision tree construction method, in which the data at each node are split into equal sizes while maximizing the information gain. Compared to the conventional random forests, it generates larger and more balanced decision trees due to the even-split constraint, which contributes to enhanced discrimination power and reduced overfitting. Second, to tackle the domain misalignment problem, we propose the domain alignment loss which penalizes uneven splits of the source and target domain data. By collaboratively optimizing the information gain of the labeled source data as well as the entropy of unlabeled target data distributions, the proposed CoBRF algorithm achieves significantly better performance than the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm is extensively evaluated in various experimental setups in challenging domain adaptation tasks with noisy and small training data as well as open set domain adaptation problems, for two backbone networks of AlexNet and ResNet-50.", "keywords": [], "paperhash": "ryu|collaborative_training_of_balanced_random_forests_for_open_set_domain_adaptation", "original_pdf": "/attachment/57a24a05d496d13d390361fe27472bc5ef8fca7a.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nryu2020collaborative,\ntitle={Collaborative Training of Balanced Random Forests for Open Set Domain Adaptation},\nauthor={Jongbin Ryu and Jiun Bae and Jongwoo Lim},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkeJPertPS}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
