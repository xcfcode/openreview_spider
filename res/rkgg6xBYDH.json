Then what is the value of this contribution?\n\nThanks. Our bound has no explicit dependence on the size of networks. But the norm itself used in our bound may still relate to the network size implicitly as the reviewer might concern. This is why we claim \u201cexplicit\u201d in the paper. In fact, obtaining a generalization bound which is completely independent of the size of networks is an important future direction since such a result might answer a long standing question of why deep neural networks generalize so well in practice. Despite that it is still a long way to go, we already take a step further and give a bound without any explicit dependence on the network size by using a new proof technique in contrast to existing results which either have a factor of max{d,m,k} (Zhang et al., 2018) or the total number of parameters of the network (Chen et al., 2019) (see Comparison with existing results paragraph in Section 3.2). This new technique can potentially be applied to other neural networks architectures such as convolutional neural networks, which might be of independent interest. Besides, from our empirical results, the implicit dependency of norm on the network size might be much weaker than what we expect. For example, in our experiments, the matrix 1-norm of the weight matrix after training is around 2, which is much smaller than the size of matrix 128.\n\n> Why smaller eigenvalues usually contribute to high frequency components of the input signal and what the frequency components of the input signal is. What is the formulation of the high frequency components of the input signal?\n\nThanks. Formally, the frequency component of an input signal can be defined via Fourier transform as $X(w) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) \\cdot e^{-2 j \\pi w t}dt$ where w stands for the frequency, x(t) is original input signal in time domain and X denotes the signal in frequency domain, and a signal x(t) has a high frequency component if X(w) has a relatively large value at a high frequency w. We refer the reviewer to [1] for more details. \n\nFor eigenvalues, it corresponds to the variance explained by its eigenvectors. Not strictly speaking, the smaller eigenvalues contribute less to the energy in the data which usually correspond to the high frequency information, i.e., the details of an image. For example, in the application of Singular Value Decomposition to noise reduction in images, SVD can remove the noise and maintain most of the information in the original image by discarding those small singular values. Since most of the noise elements contribute to high frequency components of the image, we can think that the smaller eigenvalues correspond to the high frequency components and SVD acts like a low-pass filter. \n\nTheir relationship might also be understood from a perspective of basis transformation. In short, both the eigenvectors and the Fourier transform can be seen as a change of basis. If we consider the eigenbasis of the space formed by all eigenvectors, we can show that the eigenbasis vectors corresponding to smaller eigenvalue are more sensitive to small changes in the data, i.e., a large condition number (Section 4.4, [3]). The same applies to the Hilbert space basis vectors $e^{j t w}$ with a high frequency w under the Fourier transform (Chapter 4, [2]). In this sense, smaller eigenvalues correspond to high frequency. But we have to mention that the true relationship between them might be much more complicated than what we claim in the paper. Therefore, for precision, we have replaced the word \u201cusually\u201d with \u201cmay\u201d in the paper.

I read the paper carefully but I don\u2019t have sufficient expertise to determine whether all the proof steps are correct.\n\nThis paper builds on recent works giving generalization bounds on RNNs.\n\nThe primary contribution is that they are able to bound the generalization error for RNNs without a dependence on the network size parameters d and m.\n\nTheir proof is roughly as follows:\n1. They decompose the RNN + ReLU activation into the sum of a linear network and difference terms. This step is key because it lets you treat each term independently when estimating the Rademacher complexity.\n2. The linear network term can be bounded directly with their Fisher-Rao norm.\n3. They make a second decomposition: the difference term can be written as a sum of simpler terms\n4. For the simpler terms, their Rademacher complexity can be bounded independently using matrix-1 norm. Using the matrix-1 norm instead of the spectral norm means their bounds won\u2019t depend on the network size parameters.\n5. Then they combine these bounds to give the Rademacher complexity bounds for RNNs.\n6. Lastly, they combine the Rademacher complexity bound with Kuznetsov et al 2015\u2019s multiclass margin bound to give the generalization bound.\n\nThe downside to their generalization bound is that it requires the covariance matrix of the input data must be positive definitive, and it explodes when the smallest eigenvalue is close to zero.\n\nTheir second contribution attempts to address these downsides. They prove another generalization bound for RNNs when training with random noise, which has the effect of increasing the term containing the smallest eigenvalue of the input covariance matrix.\n\nThey remark on several empirical phenomena that are consistent with their results:\n- Correlation of features in the input data makes it harder for RNNs to generalize\n- Weight decay could help by decreasing the relevant gradient terms in their bounds\n- Gradient clipping could help when the smallest eigenvalue of the input covariance is very small\n\nTheir third contribution is a single experiment. This contribution is fairly weak and the practical value of their theoretical work would be much more convincing if they were to put more effort into this section.\n- They use IMDB data set (50k movie reviews + binary sentiment classification task)\n- They add Gaussian noise to the input data with four different values.\n- They plot the generalization error, which is the difference between the test error without noise and the training error with noise\n\nSpecific comments to improve their experiment section:\n- I\u2019m confused by the following sentence: \u201cgeneralization errors \u2026 for different combinations of L and \\sigma_epsilon are shown in Figure 1.\u201d However, in Figure 1 I only see different values of sigma. I don\u2019t see anything about using various values for L. This should be clarified.\n- Figure 1 draws linear interpolation between data points - there\u2019s no evidence for those interpolations. It should be reported as a scatter plot, preferably with error bars.\n- If space limitations prevent reporting the experiment results more rigorously, I would prefer to see the experiment results reported in an appendix, with a brief comment on their significance in the main paper."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2560/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2560/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["zhtu3055@uni.sydney.edu.au", "fengxiang.he@sydney.edu.au", "dacheng.tao@sydney.edu.au"], "title": "Understanding Generalization in Recurrent Neural Networks", "authors": ["Zhuozhuo Tu", "Fengxiang He", "Dacheng Tao"], "pdf": "/pdf/9d02fe4b684d11816e76d578c498b29a5ce71dfa.pdf", "abstract": "In this work, we develop the theory for analyzing the generalization performance of recurrent neural networks.

Compared with existing results, our generalization bounds have no explicit dependency on the size of networks. We also discover that Fisher-Rao norm for RNNs can be interpreted as a measure of gradient, and incorporating this gradient measure not only can tighten the bound, but allows us to build a relationship between generalization and trainability. Based on the bound, we theoretically analyze the effect of covariance of features on generalization of RNNs and discuss how weight decay and gradient clipping in the training can help improve generalization.
