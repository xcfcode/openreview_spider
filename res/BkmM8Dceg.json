The idea is practical and seems to work well. The paper is well written.\n\nI agree with reviewer 1 that the \u2018theorems\u2019 do not deserve to be labelled as such. Theorem 1 is equivalent to the second equation from this section of the wikipedia page on convolution: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution#Convolutions_on_groups. The existence of Haar measure (from which commutation of Lg and convolution follows immediately) is a well known and elementary theorem in harmonic analysis, which would be treated in the first few pages of any textbook on the subject. It also immediately clear that any commutative group has an additive parameterization (theorem 2). The fact that the paper does not present new deep mathematical results is not a significant weakness in my opinion, but the derivations should not be camouflaged as such.\n\nThe claim that previous methods that use group convolutions are slow and that the presented approach has better computational complexity is not supported by empirical evidence, and the theoretical analysis is still a bit misleading. For example, the authors write \u201cUnfortunately these approaches do not possess the same memory and speed benefits that CNNs enjoy. The reason is that, ultimately, they have to enumerate all possible transformations\u201d. The presented method also has to enumerate all transformations (in a limited range, on a discretized grid), and this is feasible only because the group is only 2 dimensional (and indeed this is also true for standard CNNs which enumerate translations). \n\nAs noted in my pre-review question, I believe the computational complexity analysis is not entirely correct, and assume the authors will correct this.\n\nEquation 4 is presented as a new invention, but this has been used in previous works and is well known in mathematics, so a citation should be added.\n\nThe main advantage of the presented method over several earlier methods is that it is very simple to implement, and can re-use highly optimized convolution routines. As I understand it, Dieleman et al. and Cohen & Welling also use standard convolutions (after a fixed filter / feature map warp), but these papers only consider discrete groups. So it seems like this paper occupies a unique place in the space of equivariant convolutional networks: non-commutative (-), low-dimensional (-), continuous (+) groups, simple (+) and efficient (+) algorithm. Given the proximity though, a more thorough and balanced appraisal of the merits and demerits, as well as the novelty, relative to each of the previous works would be useful. \n\nProvided that these issues are cleared up, I would recommend the paper for publication.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Warped Convolutions: Efficient Invariance to Spatial Transformations", "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are extremely efficient, since they exploit the inherent translation-invariance of natural images.

We do not claim that e.g. generalized convolution or its equivariance are new concepts; they are well-known, and in fact we used them in our previous works. We added the proper references to make this clear.\n\nLikewise, that any commutative group has additive parameterization is a known fact. Theorem 2 does not prove this: an additive parameterization is one of its conditions (so it applies to commutative groups). What Theorem 2 does, in fact, is to present a case of the general theory (see answer to R1) where calculations can be carried in a simple form which can be reduced to standard convolution operators and hence can be readily implemented numerically.\n\nFinally, we thank the reviewer for helping us place our algorithm w.r.t. the closest state-of-the-art proposals, and clarifying the complexity analysis. We maintain that there are two computational advantages of this approach. One is very practical, as reducing generalized convolution to a standard one allows to directly use highly optimized routine. The second one is a little deeper as this reduction allows to also use methods such as the Fast Fourier Transform, that have indeed a lower order of complexity and that would be much more challenging to implement in full generality.

In the suggested setting, one can turn rotations around a set of points into translations, by warping the neighborhoods with log-polar grids around different pivots. Another way to combine heterogeneous transformations (e.g. translation, scale, and rotation) by means of a cascade of warps was described in the answer above (item #4).\n\nIt is true that one can perform generalized convolution by accessing 4*n^2*s^2 elements with bilinear sampling, since 4 samples are interpolated. In the case of general sampling (e.g. with Lanczos filters), many more samples may be taken. The proposed warped convolutions access 4*n^2 elements (for the warp) + n^2*s^2 elements (for the standard convolution). So, although the asymptotic complexity is the same as naive generalized convolution, the trailing constant factor is lower (by a factor of 4 for bilinear sampling, more for general samplers). We agree with the reviewer that the current description is not entirely correct and will rephrase accordingly.\n\nAnother argument we make in the paper, and which may be more compelling, is that implementing generalized convolutions naively requires space-varying filters, performing a warp of the filter at every step. This is harder to implement, and much harder with high efficiency, when compared to standard convolutions, which have filters with constant support and predictable memory access.

We started with the term \"invariant\" since we thought it will be more familiar than \"equivariant\" to many readers. To be absolutely precise, when it is said informally that a CNN is invariant to translations, it is meant that the architecture is the *same* (does not vary) over translations. At the same time, its output is equivariant w.r.t. translations of the input. We avoided making this distinction for brevity, but will include a footnote to be unambiguous.\n\n2. It is indeed the case that Cohen & Welling project the filters; \"signal\" was meant to convey that either the filters or images can be projected. Our argument applies equally to both cases. Perhaps spelling it as \"filters or images\" will avoid any ambiguity.\n\n3. Yes, additivity is required. The group action is indeed transitive, which is an alternative way to express the condition on the pivot. We thank the reviewer for bringing up this connection; we will point it out in section 4.2.\n\nAbout the pivot points, the reason why they are not arbitrary is that they exist in the input domain Omega, not the parameter space R^2. The reviewer is correct that additivity implies any parameter in R^2 is valid. However, we cannot transport this property back to the input domain. As a specific counter-example, placing the pivot at the origin (x = 0) in the scale/rotation equation (section 5.2) yields t_u(0) = 0 for all u, breaking the bijectivity condition of t_u. Intuitively, this creates a degenerate warp grid (all its points are at 0). If Omega is restricted to R^2\\{0}, however, the condition is satisfied, and a non-degenerate warp grid is created.\n\n4. Handling multiple transformations simultaneously (>2D) is of great interest. We found it hard to do this without losing the most attractive features of the method, which are its simple implementation (bilinear sampling + 2D convolution) and speed (since it is a 2D -> 2D mapping). It is trivial to generalize Thm. 2 directly to a ND -> ND mapping, but less useful since the input dimensionality is the same as the number of transformation parameters.\n\nFor the more general cases (2D input with ND transformation), the work of Cohen & Welling seems to provide a good answer. We believe that it may be possible to embed subspaces of commutative transformations (like the ones we deal with) into larger spaces of non-commutative transformations (as they do), and exploit the same trick to gain efficiency, but doing so will require substantially more research.\n\nFrom a practical point of view, without modifying Thm. 2, one can simply use a cascade of alternating subnetworks, to handle >2D parameters. Each subnetwork can use Thm. 2 to gain equivariance w.r.t. 2 parameters, and the network as a whole progressively refines a pose registration. Our inclusion of an STN was meant to achieve the same effect.\n\n5. Yes, one could consider scaling of the sphere in the way that you describe. It is worth keeping in mind though that this adds one parameter (so the warp will be 3D -> 3D, instead of 2D). However, if one wants to deal with 3D data (e.g. voxels), then it is a great suggestion! That would enable equivariance to yaw, pitch and scale simultaneously, in 3D.\n\n6. We avoided overfitting by keeping the networks modest in size (3-4 layers, 20-50 filters). The downscaling on Google Earth and large filters on AFLW both increase the effective receptive fields, which compensates for the lack of depth + subsampled layers. The object scale on Google Earth is the diagonal length of the bounding box, and unrelated to the scale parameter mentioned earlier.\n\nAs for the learned features, they can be interpreted as radial filters, that will be sensitive for example to edges radiating outwards from the center, or to edges orthogonal to them (which would respond highly around the perimeter of circles of different sizes). Intuitively, such features must be equivariant to rotation and scale.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Warped Convolutions: Efficient Invariance to Spatial Transformations", "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are extremely efficient, since they exploit the inherent translation-invariance of natural images.

I have few questions.\n\nFirst I do not understand the difference between equivariance and invariance: in the introduction, you say you will introduce an invariant operator, and finally the networks are equivariant. Could you clarify?\n\nYou claim: \"Projecting a signal onto such a basis still has an asymptotic complexity higher than that of a simple convolution, and the basis itself requires more storage than a convolutional filter.\"\n\nI do not understand what it exactly means, for instance, in Cohen & Welling, it is tried \"to keep the number of parameters approximatively fixed\". Could you clarify? Also, in their case, they do not explicitly encode the p4/p4m group in the first layer, and they don't compute either the orbits of each images. They first apply 2D-convolutions(covariant with p4/p4m), and then, the convolution becomes 3 dimensional. So I do not understand why you write \"projecting a signal\", since they seem to project the filters, not the input.\n\nIs additivity a restriction for the 2 dimensional parametrizations via Lie groups? I understand the condition of fixed point as the fact that the action of the group is transitive, am I correct? If a pivot point exists, then isn't any point a pivot(in the additive case)? Can you give examples of parametrisation where there is no pivot point?\n\nBesides, you used only 2D structures, but could you use scales, pitches, .. all together? In your experiments, you removed the translation variabilities by choosing centered images. Do you have any ideas how to solve this problem if this was not the case? I guess the fact to stay in the 2D domain might be a limitation to keep the Theorem 2 true. Do you have any suggestions to overpass this property?\n\nIn section 5.3, you write that in order to maintain additivity, you did not consider the radius of a sphere. Do you think a mapping of the radius like exponential mapping could work or is there a limitation?\n\nIn the Google experiment, why did you downscale the images? Can you give more details about the training of the deep network: how did you avoid overfitting (maybe there wasn't?)? Do you have any intuitions on the nature of the learned features? Is the \"object scale\", the parameter \"s\" mentioned in the previous sections?\n\nIn the faces experiment, can you explain why you had to increase the support of the filters, from 5 to 9?\n\nThanks!\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Warped Convolutions: Efficient Invariance to Spatial Transformations", "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are extremely efficient, since they exploit the inherent translation-invariance of natural images.
