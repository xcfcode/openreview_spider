We are glad that you found our submission to be an \"interesting\" and \"pedagogical\" study of a \"fundamental question\". All of the reviews touched on a similar set of points, so we're addressing most of them in this top-level comment and will reply to individual reviews about more specific questions.  \n\nFirst off: we've re-worked the communication experiments in section 7 in response to reviewer feedback. A new paper draft containing these changes has been uploaded. Briefly, the experiment now features:\n\n- a more complicated set of referents (with real tree structures of the form <<obj1:attr1, obj1:attr2>, <obj2:attr1, obj2:attr2>>)\n- a more interesting composition function (which is learned, non-commutative and sensitive to string indices) \n- as suggested by R2, a more challenging task for the listener (which is now required to generate referents rather than simply recognize them)\n\nThe high-level experimental conclusions have remained essentially the same---the only real difference is that some of the correlations are stronger than observed in the initial experiments.\n\nWe really appreciate the suggestions that led to these changes, and believe the new experiments better exercise all the pieces of the TRE framework. We hope they also address the main points raised in all the reviews, namely:\n\n- Choice of composition and distance functions: as mentioned, the new version of Sec. 7 has a new (learned, non-commutative) composition function, and continues to use l1 distance for similarity. This means the four example applications in the paper now feature 3 kinds of composition function (addition, the learned linear operation of S.7, and the general class considered in S.6), and 3 kinds of distance function (cosine similarity, l1 distance, and the general class in S.6). Between this and the fact that experiments cover examples from computer vision, natural language processing, and multiagent reinforcement learning, we believe we have provided fairly comprehensive evidence for the generality of TRE.\n\n- Necessity of pre-selecting a specific composition function: First, we emphasize that this choice is also a feature of all previous work that has attempted to analyze compositionality---both in learned representations and in the natural language processing literature (in the latter case commiting to particular functional forms with some free parameters). Moreover, the point of our Remark 2 is that some pre-commitment to a restricted composition function is essentially inevitable: if we allow the evaluation procedure to select an arbitrary composition function, the result will be trivial.\n\n- Presentation of the approach: We are grateful for all the presentation suggestions. R2's summary of what they would like to be better stated is similar to the statement in the introduction that \"the core of our proposal is to treat a set of primitive meaning representations D0 as hidden, and optimize over them to find an explicitly compositional model that approximates the true model as well as possible\".

One could implement the specific model from B&Z in our framework (modulo some rank constraints) by taking the composition function to be bilinear with a particular choice of tensor.\n\n- Re section 4: the intuition is that there's lots of information in the input images that is not part of the compositional analysis and not relevant for the eventual classification (e.g. the saturation of the pixel in the top-left corner of the image).

Having *both* candidates to be unseen makes the problem significantly harder since the only way for the listener to get it right is to associate the message with the right candidate, rather than relying in some other strategy like whether the message is novel (thus it's the seen candidate) or new (thus it's the unseen candidate). As such, I don't think I can fully trust your conclusions due to this potential confounder. \n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe authors propose a measure of compositionality in representations. Given instances of data x annotated with semantic primitives, the authors learn a vector for each of the primitive such that the addition of the vectors of the primitives is very close (in terms of cosine) to the latent representation  z of the input x. The authors find that this measure correlates with the mutual information between the input x and z, approximates the human judges of compositionality on a language dataset and finally presents a study on the relation between the proposed measure and generalizalization performance, concluding that their measure correlates with generalization error as well as absolute test accuracy.\n\nThis in an interesting study and attacks a very fundamental question; tracking compositionality in representations could pave the way towards representations that facilitate transfer learning and better generalization. While the paper is very clear with respects to results, I found the presentation of the proposed measure overly confusing (and somewhat more exaggerated that what is really going on). \n\nThe authors start with a very clean example, that can potentially facilitate clarifying in a visual way the process of obtaining the measure. However, I feel that clarity is being traded-off for formality. It needs several reads to really distill the idea that essentially the authors are simply learning vectors of primitives that when added should resemble the representation of the input. Moreover, the name of the measure is a bit misleading and not justified by the experiments and the data. The authors do not deal with trees in any of the examples, but rather with a set of primitives (apparent in the use of addition as a composition function which being commutative does not allow for word-order and the like deep syntactic properties). \n\nNow, onto the measure. I like the idea of learning basis vectors from the representations and constraining to follow the primitive semantics. Of course, this constraints quite a bit the form of compositionality that the authors are searching for. \nThe idea of additive semantics has been explored in NLP, however it's mostly applicable for primitives with intersective semantics (e.g., a white towel is something that is both white and a towel). Do the authors think that this restricts their experiments (especially the natural languages ones)? What about other composition techniques found in the literature of compositional semantics (e.g., by Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010). \nThis is good to be clarified.  Moreover, given the simplicity of the datasets in the current study, wouldn't a reasonable baseline be to obtain the basis vector of blue by averaging all the latent representations of blue?  Similarly, how sensitive are conclusions with respect to different composition functions?\n\nSection 4 is potentially very interesting, but I don't seem to understand why it's good news that TRE correlates with I(x;\\theta). Low TRE indicates high-degree of compositionality. I suspect that low MI means that input and latent representation are somewhat independent but I don't see the connection to compositional components. Can the authors clarify?\n\nSection 5 is a nice addition. The authors mention that they learn word and phrase representations. Where are the word representations used? My understanding is that you derive basis word representations by using SGD and the phrase vectors and compute TRE with these. If this is the case, an interesting experiment would be to report how similar the induced basis vectors are (either some first-order or second-order similarity) to the pre-trained ones.\n\nSection 8 presents results on discrete representations. Since this is the experiment most similar to the recent work that uses topographic similarity (and since the authors already prime the reader at section 7 about relation between the 2 measures), it would be interesting to see the empirical relation between TRE and topographic and its relation to generalization and absolute performance. \n\nBaroni and Zamparelli (2010) Nouns are vectors, adjectives are matrices: Representing adjective-noun constructions in semantic space\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper581/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Measuring Compositionality in Representation Learning", "abstract": "Many machine learning algorithms represent input data with vector embeddings or discrete codes.

The paper demonstrates the use of this framework to assess the role of compositionality in a hypothetical compression phase of representation learning, compares the correspondence of TRE with human judgments of compositionality of bigrams, provides an explanation of the relationship of the metric to topographic similarity, and uses the framework to draw conclusions about the role of compositionality in model generalization.\n\nOverall I think this is a solid paper, with an interesting and reasonable approach to quantifying compositionality, and a fairly compelling set of results. The reported experiments cover reasonable ground in terms of questions relevant to compositionality (relationship to representation compression, generalization), and I appreciate the comparison to human judgments, which lends credibility to applicability of the framework. The results are generally intuitive and reasonable enough to be credible as indicators of how compositionality relates to aspects of learning, while providing some potential insight. The paper is clearly written, and to my knowledge the approach is novel.\n\nI would say the main limitation to the conclusions that can be drawn from these experiments lies in the necessity of committing to a particular composition operator, of which the authors have selected very simple ones without comparing to others. There is nothing obviously unreasonable about the choices of composition operator, but it seems that the conclusions drawn cannot be construed to apply to compositionality as a general concept, but rather to compositionality when defined by these particular operators. Similar limitations apply to the fact that the tests have been run on very specific tasks - it is not clear how these conclusions would generalize to other tasks.\n\nDespite this limitation, I'm inclined to say that the introduction of the framework is a solid contribution, and the results presented are interesting. I think this is a reasonable paper to accept for publication.\n\nMinor comment:\np8 typo: \"training and accuracies\"\n\n------\n\nReviewer 2 makes a good point that the presentation of the framework could be much clearer, currently obscuring the central role of learning the primitive representations.

(2015) is a relevant reference here, as it similarly learns primitive (word) representations to be compatible with a chosen composition function. \n\nBeyond issues of presentation, it seems that we are all in agreement that the paper's takeaways would also benefit from an increase in the scope of the experiments.
