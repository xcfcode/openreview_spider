This is applied to the relatively simple domain of Atari games video input (compared to natural images). The paper is completely inadequate in respect to related work; it re-invents known techniques like non-maximum suppression and matching for tracking; fails to learn convincing objects according to visual inspection; and fails to compare with earlier methods for these tasks. (The comment above about re-invention is the most charitable intepretation -- the worst case would be using these ideas without citation.)\n\n\n1) The related work section is outrageous, containing no references before 2016.  Do the authors think researchers never tried to do this task before then? This is the bad side of the recent deep nets hype, and ICLR is particularly susceptible to this.

There is a literature which follows on from the F&J paper.  The methods used in Frey & Jojic are different from what is proposed in the paper, but there needs to be comparisons.\n\nThe AIR paper also contains references to relevant previous work.\n\n2) p 3 center -- this seems to be reinventing non-maximum suppression\n\n3) p 4 eq 3 and sec 3.2 -- please justify *why* it makes sense to use\nthe concrete transform.  Can you explain better (e.g. in the supp mat)\nthe effect of this for different values of q_i?\n\n4) Sec 3.5 Matching objects in successive frames using the Hungarian \nalgorithm is also well known, e.g. it is in the matlab function\nassignDetectionsToTracks .\n\n5) Overall: in this paper the authors come up with a method for learning objects from Atari games video input. This is a greatly restricted setting compared to real images. The objects learned as shown in Appendix A are quite unconvincing, e.g. on p 9. For example for Boxing why are the black and white objects broken up into 3 pieces, and why do they appear coloured in col 4?\n\nAlso the paper lacks comparisons to other methods (including ones from before 2016) which have tackled this problem.\n\nIt may be that the methods in this paper can outperform previous ones -- that would be interesting, but it would need a lot of work to address the issues raised above.\n\nText corrections:\n\np 2 \"we are more precise\" -> \"we give more details\"\n\np 3 and p 2 -- local maximum (not maxima) for a single maximum.

Very preliminary work. Previous work on computer vision is completely ignored ", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "review": "The paper proposes a method  for learning object representations from pixels and then use such representations for doing reinforcement learning.  This method is based on convnets that map raw pixels to a mask and feature map. The mask contains information about the presence/absence of objects in different pixel locations and the feature map contains information about object appearance. \n\nI believe that the current method can only learn and track simple objects in a constant background, a problem which is  well-solved in computer vision. Specifically, a simple method such as \"background subtraction\" can easily infer the mask (the outlying pixels which correspond to moving objects)  while simple tracking methods (see a huge literature over decades on computer vision) can allow to track these objects across frames.  The authors completely ignore all this previous work and their \"related work\" section  starts citing papers from 2016 and onwards!  Is it any benefit of learning objects with the current (very expensive) method compared to simple methods such as  \"background subtraction\"? \n\nFurthermore, the paper is very badly written since it keeps postponing the actual explanations to later sections (while these  sections eventually refer to the appendices).  This makes reading the paper very hard. For example, during the early sections you  keep referring to a loss function which will allow for learning the objects, but you never really give the form of this loss (which you should as soon as  you mentioning it) and the reader needs to search into the appendices to find out what is happening.  \n\nAlso, experimental results are very preliminary and not properly analyzed.
