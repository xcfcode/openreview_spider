The main concern, however, was about the fact that one has to store information about all previous data points which is not feasible in lifelong learning.

An engineering solution\nContinual learning is an important problem with a large number of practical use-cases in the industry across various domains.

From the insight gained from reviews, we have accordingly modified the paper, along with a note of changes in our  comment, \"Major points revisited / concerns addressed\" on this forum.\n\nAs a couple of reviewers had similar concerns,  we have addressed  these through a general comment about managing increasing memory and compute. We argue that our method's memory and compute requirement, owing to storage of only a fraction of historical lower dimensional features and requiring the use of additional compute only optional, is practically feasible and of value to the community.\n\nSome of the specific concerns which are addressed are:\n\ni. Redundancy of equation 2 by 7.\nWe have structured our paper to first paper to first present a broad overview without being cluttered with design choices. Our paper's design was motivated to ensure we first convey the broad idea followed by a specific embodiment which was implemented.\n\nii. Errors in Equation 5\nAs the reviewer pointed out, this equation represents the construction of training data for the feature transformer at time t, in the form of example-label pairs. Though not explicitly mentioned, it should be understood from the context that indeed the correspondence between examples (in the form of features) and labels are maintained due to the order of the union operation. If it adds value to make this point explicit, we would be happy to include this clarification in the next version of the paper.\n\niii. Increasing memory/compute\nBoth these concerns are addressed through the general comment, \"Major points revisited / concerns addressed\".\n\niv. Add experimental details to ensure paper is stand-alone\nWe have incorporated the comments by reviewers to ensure that all definitions and experimental settings  are fully contained in the paper and can be understood unambiguously.\n\nv. Memory gains by storing features\nWhile we agree with the reviewers that memory gains by storing features are limited when working with a toy dataset like MNIST(28x28), as pointed out in the general comment, these gains are substantial when working with real-world datasets, and become extremely pronounced in volumetric datasets like medical imaging (3D Datasets).\n\nvi.

Before we make rebuttals to specific concerns, we highlight a few important facets of the work, which may have been overlooked.\n\n1) Privacy-preserving lifelong learners : A key constraint that we operate is that we cannot store data in original form. This is a very pertinent point in data-sensitive domains like Healthcare, where images of subjects cannot be shipped/stored for anonymity/regulatory constraints, which is a point often overlooked. The fundamental question that we address is : \"Can we protect privacy while also ensuring competent lifelong learning?\" To that end, we demonstrate that, by merely storing low-dimensional features, we can achieve a practical lifelong learner without compromising security. \n\n2) Single-framework for lifelong learning:  The work addresses all variants of continuous learning together, which has not been addressed yet in the current literature to the best our knowledge. E.g. a method that addresses new-task learning cannot handle incremental learning of same task (LwF) or a method that achieves domain adaptation  may not handle new-task learning or incremental learning. Our framework is capable of handling a variety of situations without retraining the entire network, and we have shown the ability of our method to handle real-life type situations, where we simulate complex sequences of these situations. \n\n3) Significance of results: The reviewers have not appreciated the exemplary results on three different datasets. We would like to point out that even with the luxury of having all the low dimensional features from previous episodes, obtaining state-of-the art results is non-trivial. This is achieved by seeking newer representations that continue to be separable, and cannot be attributed only to increasing capacity. \n\nWe proceed to address the two major concerns of the reviewers - Memory and Computation\n\n1) Memory: We do not think storing all features is a stumbling block for realizing the potential of our method as discussed here. \n\n\ta) Storing all features is not necessary \n\t\n\tAs demonstrated in Section 4.4, by storing only one-fifth of past history, we observe a drop in performance of only ~3% from baseline. To our knowledge, such a performance is extremely compelling and difficult to achieve. We have included an additional experiment on Pneumothorax classification, where we achieve significant performance by retaining only 20% of previous data at every episode. We have captured these ablation experiments in graphical format in the revised version along with size-on-disk computation. \n\t\n\tb) Storing all features is not prohibitive\n\t\n\tAdditionally, calculations of size-on-disk suggests that storing features of the entire history is not prohibitive. A typical natural/medical image is 256*256*3 integers or more, whereas our representation is only 4096 floats (16kb). Even the largest available medical image repository of 100k X-ray images takes 1.6GB which is not huge. These are conservative estimates. A standard medical image can be of much larger size (1024*1024) and in 3-D (minimum >10 slices). Any exemplar-based method (iCARL) will have severe storage limitations than our method. Additionally, storing ~50 low-dimensional features occupies same memory as storing one exemplar image.  This directly leads to storing more history compactly while addressing catastrophic forgetting and privacy. \n\t\n2) Computation: We highlight that incremental computational requirements are not unrealistic as suggested. \n\n\ta) Additional compute not prohibitive :\n\t\n\t\tAs time progresses, only new layers have to be learnt and it is not entirely true that the training overhead is costly. In our experiments, we have shown that the feature transformer layers are typically two layer deep and hence learning them is not expensive. Further, we have added results where we trained with only one additional fc layer, which did not give any drop in performance. This coupled with storing a fraction of historical data, makes training and inference light. \n\t\t\n\tb) Additional compute may not be needed :\n\t\n\t\tThe intuition behind adding more capacity is to account for cases where existing representations might be insufficient to achieve separation. There is no compulsion  to add capacity at each episode (Sec 3.1). We have added the experiment (Sec 4.5) where we do not add additional capacity after 5th episode. We simply transform the previous episode's feature transformer to achieve separable representation. However, we wanted to present a generic framework that can account for the need to seek richer representations for complex lifelong problems. \n\t\t\n\tc) Model Compaction : \n\t\t\n\t\tAnother idea that has already been mentioned in the paper is model compaction. Distillation based approaches have demonstrated \tshrinking of huge networks without loss of performance, which can be employed in this work. \n\t\n\t\t"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper902/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper902/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper902/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Feature Transformers: A Unified Representation Learning Framework for Lifelong Learning", "abstract": "Despite the recent advances in representation learning, lifelong learning continues\nto be one of the most challenging and unconquered problems.

", "review": "Summary:\n a method is presented for on-going adaptation to changes in data, task or domain distribution. The method is based on adding, at each timed step, an additional network module transforming the features from the previous to the new representation. Training for the new task/data at time t relies on re-training with all previous data, stored as intermediate features. The method is shown to provide better accuracy than na\u00efve fine tuning, and slightly inferior to plain re-training with all the data.\nWhile the method is presented as a solution for life long learning, I think it severely violates at least two demands from a feasible solution: using finite memory and using finite computational capacity (i.e. a life-long learning cannot let memory or computation demands to rise linearly with time). Contrary to this, the method presented induces networks which grow linearly in time (in number of layers, hence computation requirements and inference time), and which use a training set growing indefinitely, keeping (representations of) all the examples ever seen so far. If no restrictions on memory and computation time are given, full retraining can be employed, and indeed it provides better results that the suggested method. In the bottom line, I hence do not see the justification for using this method, either as a life-long learner or in another setting.\n\nPros:\n+ the method shows that for continuous adaptation certain representations can be kept instead of the original examples \nCons:\n- The method claims to present a life long learning strategy, yet it is not scalable to long time horizon (memory and inference costs rise linearly with time)\n- Some experiments are not presented well enough to be understood.\n\nMore detailed comments:\nPage 3:\n-\tEq. 2 is not clear. It contains a term \u2018classification loss\u2019 and \u2018feature_loss\u2019 which are not defined or explained. While the former is fairly standard, leaving the latter without definition makes this equation incomprehensible. \no\tI later see that eq. 7 includes the details. Therefore eq.2 is redundant. \nPage 4:\n-\tEq. 5 seems to be flawed, though I think I can understand what it wants to say. Specifically, it states two sets: one of examples (represented by the previous feature extractor) and one of labels (of all the examples seen so far). The two sets are stated without correspondence between examples and labels \u2013 which is useless for learning (which requires example-label correspondence). I think the intention was for a set of (example, label) pairs, where the examples are represented using feature extractor of time t-1.\n-\tAlgorithm 1 seems to be a brute force approach in which the features of all examples from all problems encountered so far are kept (with their corresponding labels). This means keeping an ever growing set of examples, and training repeatedly at each iteration on this set. These are not realistic assumptions for a life-long learner with finite capacity of memory and computation.\no\tFor example, for the experiment reported at page 6, including 25 episodes on MNist, each feature transformer is adding 2 additional FC layers to the network. This leads to a network with >50 FC layers at time step 25 \u2013 not a reasonable and scalable network for life ling learning\nPage 6:\n-\tThe results show that the feature transformer method achieve accuracy close to cumulative re-training, but this is not too surprising, since feature transformer indeed does cumulative re-training: at each time step, it re-trains the classifier (a 2 stage MLP) using all the data at all times steps (i.e. cumulative retraining). The difference from pure cumulative re-training, if I understand correctly, is that the cumulative re-training is done not with the original image representations, but with the intermediate features of time t-1. What do we earn and what do we loose from this? If I understand correctly, we earn that the re-training is faster since only a 2-layer MLP is re-trained instead of the full network. We loose in the respect that the model gorws larger with time, and hence inference becomes prohibitively costly (as the network grows deeper by two layers each time step). Again, I do not think this is a practical or conceptual solution for life long learning.\n-\tThe experiment reported in figure 3 is not understandable without reading Lopez-Paz et al., 2017 (which I didn\u2019t). the experiment setting, the task, the performance measurements \u2013 all these are not explained, leaving this result meaningless for a stand-alone read of this paper.\n-\tPage 8: it is stated that \u201cwe only store low dimensional features\u201d. However, it is not reported in all experiment exactly what is the dimension of the features stored and if they are of considerably lower dimension than the original images. Specifically for the MNIst experiments it seems that feature stored are of dimension 256, while the original image is of dimension 784 \u2013 this is lower, but no by an order of magnitude (X10).\n-\tThe paper is longer than 8 pages.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper902/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Feature Transformers: A Unified Representation Learning Framework for Lifelong Learning", "abstract": "Despite the recent advances in representation learning, lifelong learning continues\nto be one of the most challenging and unconquered problems.
