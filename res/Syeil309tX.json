The paper proposed modifications to a gated fusion network specifically: 1) Grouping sets of sensors and concatenating them before further processing, and 2) Performing multi-level fusion where early sensor data representations are concatenated to produce weightings additional to the those obtained from features concatenated at a later stage. Experimental results show that these architectures achieve performance gains from 2-6%, especially when sensors are noisy or missing. \n\nStrengths\n\n + The architectures encourage fusion at multiple levels (especially the second one), which is a concept that has been successful across the deep learning literature\n \n + The paper looks at an interesting topic, especially related to looking at the effects of noise and missing sensors on the gating mechanisms. \n\n + The results show some positive performance gains, although see caveats below. \n\nWeaknesses\n \n - The related work paragraph is extremely sparse. Fusion is an enormous field (see survey cited in this paper as well [1]), and I find the small choice of fusion results with a YouBot to be strange. A strong set of related work is necessary, focusing on those that are similar to the work. As an example spatiotemporal fusion (slow fusion [2]) bears some resemblence to this work but there are many others (e.g. [3,4] as a few examples).\n \n   [1] Ramachandram, Dhanesh, and Graham W.

Robust Deep Multi-modal Learning Based on Gated Information Fusion Network. arXiv preprint arXiv:1807.06233.\n\n - The paper claims to provide a \"deep understanding of the relationships between sensory inputs, fusion weights, network architecture, and resulting performance\". I don't think it really achieves   \n    this with the small examples of weights for some simple situations.\n\n - It is very unclear whether the architectures have more or less parameters. At one point it is stated that the original architecture overfits and the new architecture has less parameters (Sec 2.2 and 3). But then it is stated for fairness the number of neurons is equalized (5.2), and later in that section that the new architectures have additional neurons. Which of these is accurate?\n\n - Related to the previous point, and possibly the biggest weakness, the experimental methodology makes it hard to tell if performance is actually improved. For example, it is not clear to me that the performance gains are not just a result of less overfitting (for whatever reason) of baselines and that the fixed number of epochs therefore results in stopping at a better performance. Please show training and validation curves so that we can see whether the epochs chosen for the baselines are not just chosen after overfitting (in which case early stopping will improve the performance). As another example, there are no variances shown in the bar graphs. \n\n - The examples with noise and failures are limited. For example, it is also not clear why an increase of noise in the RPM feature (Table 5) actually increases the weight of that group in the two-stage architecture. What does that mean? In general there isn't any principled method proposed for analyzing these situations. \n\nSome minor comments/clarifications:\n  - What is the difference between these gated networks and attentional mechanisms, e.g. alpha attention (see \"Attention is all you need\" paper)?\n  - What is a principled method to decide on the groupings?\n  - There are several typos throughout the paper\n    * \"in the presence of snesor\" => \"in the presence of sensor\"\n    * Throughout the paper: \"Predication\" => \"Prediction\"\n    * \"Likelihood of stucking the training\"\n  - Tensorflow is not a simulation environment\n\nOverall, the paper proposes architectural changes to an existing method for fusion, and while positive results are demonstrated there are several issues in the experimental methodology that make it unclear where the benefits come from. Further, the paper lacks novelty as multi-level fusion has been explored significantly and the changes are rather minor. There is no principled method or concepts that drive the architectural changes, and while the authors claim a deeper investigation into the networks' effectiveness under noise and failures the actual analysis is too shallow.

The authors show improvements in driving mode prediction and human activity recognition in settings where all modalities are observed as well as settings where there are noisy or missing modalities.\n\nStrengths:\n1. The model seems interesting and tackles the difficult problem of multisensor fusion under both normal and noisy settings.\n2. Good results obtained on standard benchmarks with improvements in settings where all modalities are observed as well as settings where there are noisy or missing modalities.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. I am worried about the novelty of the proposed approach. The main idea for the fusion-group gated fusion architecture is to perform additional early fusion of sensory inputs within each group which reduces the number of group-level fusion weights and therefore the number of parameters to tune. The two-stage gated fusion architecture simply combines the baseline model and the proposed fusion-group model. Both these ideas seem relatively incremental.\n2. Doesn't the final two-stage gated fusion architecture further increase the number of parameters as compared to the baseline model? I believe there are several additional FC-NN blocks in Figure 3 and more attention gating weights. I find this counterintuitive since section 2.2 motivated \"Potential Over-fitting\" as one drawback of the baseline Netgated architecture. How does the increase in parameters for the final model affect the running time and convergence? \n\nQuestions to authors:\n1. I don't understand Tables 4,5,6. Why are the results for Group-level Fusion Weight in the middle of several columns? Which features are being used in which groups? Please make this clear using vertical separators.\n2. For the proposed two-stage gated fusion architecture, do the 2 branches learn different things (i.e focus on different portions of the multimodal inputs)? I would have liked to see more visualizations and analysis instead of just qualitative results.\n\nPresentation improvements, typos, edits, style, missing references:\n1. General poor presentation of experimental results. Tables are not clear and bar graphs are not professionally drawn. The paper extends to 9 pages when a lot of space could be saved by making the presentation of experimental results more compact.

Using driving mode prediction and human activity recogni- tion datasets, we demonstrate the significant performance improvements brought by the proposed gated architectures and also their robustness in the presence of sensor noise and failures.\n", "keywords": ["deep learning", "convolutional neural network", "sensor fusion", "activity recognition"], "authorids": ["mrshim1101@tamu.edu", "pli@tamu.edu"], "authors": ["Myung Seok Shim", "Peng Li"], "TL;DR": "Optimized gated deep learning architectures for sensor fusion is proposed.", "pdf": "/pdf/81dec7e6b7a567cbb7cd27f10bfa56c813204143.pdf", "paperhash": "shim|optimized_gated_deep_learning_architectures_for_sensor_fusion", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nshim2019optimized,\ntitle={Optimized Gated Deep Learning Architectures for Sensor Fusion},\nauthor={Myung Seok Shim and Peng Li},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syeil309tX},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1108/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234304341, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "Syeil309tX", "replyto": "Syeil309tX", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1108/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335874336, "tmdate": 1552335874336, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1108/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 5}
