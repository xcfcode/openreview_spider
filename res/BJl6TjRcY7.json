I am still not convinced that the paper makes a strong contribution. Here are my comments:\n\n- The revised version of the paper still has LPFC as a major portion of the paper. In particular, the real estate in terms of pages devoted to explaining LPFC is more than that devoted to neural probabilistic motor primitives (which the authors claim is the main contribution of the paper). The conclusion of the paper also highlights LPFC (including its limitations). I do not think that the revised version of the paper adequately de-emphasizes LPFC.\n\n- The results from the simulation experiments showcasing neural probabilistic motor primitives (NPMP) presented in the paper are not particularly compelling. In particular, Figure 4 (which presents the relative performance of NPMP as compared to the expert) suggests that NPMP is not really doing a good job at capturing the expert's behavior. In particular, for both training and test data, the relative performance is around 0.5, which doesn't seem particularly good. Moreover, as noted by AnonReviewer2, the target following example is not particularly compelling, since it has previously been demonstrated by many other papers. I would thus have liked to have seen a thorough comparison of NPMP with other methods on this example. Moreover, as noted in my previous review, the results for LPFC are also quite weak.\n\nBased on this, I retain my original rating for the paper.\n\nSmall comments:\n- For clarity, I would recommend using \\eqref{} when referencing equations. For example, on pg. 6, \"Objective 5\" should be \"Objective (5)\"."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper843/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper843/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper843/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Probabilistic Motor Primitives for Humanoid Control", "abstract": "We focus on the problem of learning a single motor module that can flexibly express a range of behaviors for the control of high-dimensional physically simulated humanoids.

However, as pointed out in the introductory remarks this is only one aspect of the paper and we would also like to encourage the reviewer to include our main result, the neural probabilistic motor primitive module in their assessment.\n\nAddressing the concerns about LFPC in turn:\nC1: For single-behavior experts, indeed we intended Fig 3 to indicate (perhaps surprisingly) that linear-feedback policies perform well, and that LFPC can transfer that level of performance into a new neural network (from a single rollout of behavior).  For a single behavior, this is merely a validation that the new neural network can be as robust as even the linear feedback policy. Our real aim is to be able to distill many experts into a single network as we demonstrate subsequently.\n\nC2: Both LFPC and the behavioral cloning baseline were able to train the NPMP and permit skill reuse, but in our specific one-shot imitation comparisons the behavior-cloning approach performed better.  Behavioral cloning from arbitrary amounts of data is an arbitrarily strong baseline.  The two considerations that motivate LFPC are that we can store fewer data from experts and that we can query fewer trajectories from the expert system (in settings where rollouts are costly, such as real platforms).\n\nC3, C4:  The general setting for our approach is that we assume the existence of experts that perform single behaviors -- as of late, this is a reasonable assumption, enabled by previous research (e.g. Liu et al. 2010, 2015, 2018, Merel et al. 2017, Peng et al. 2018).  What has not been done prior to this work is to exhibit single policies capable of flexibly generating a wide range of skills, and this is the problem we are focusing on.  For our purposes, it is not critical how experts are obtained, and this paper does not advocate any particular way of generating expert policies.  That being said, neural network experts have been successfully trained in some recent work, so we expected it would work, and a priori, it was not obvious that directly training a linear feedback policy might suffice.  Moreover, in preliminary experiments done when beginning this work (not reported here), we found that it can be quite data inefficient to directly train a time-indexed linear feedback policy for tracking motion capture using RL, we believe due to lack of parameter sharing across timesteps, so we did not pursue this further.    \n\nNevertheless our single-behavior expert transfer experiments demonstrated empirically that linear feedback policies extracted from the expert neural networks were essentially as performant as RL-trained neural network experts in terms of robust tracking of single behaviors (Fig. 3).  That linear feedback policies work as well here is a statement about the dynamics of the environment and the complexity of the behaviors (i.e. that the behaviors here are sufficiently unimodal).  It seems, for a wide range of stereotyped behaviors, the policies required to execute the behaviors might be \u201csurprisingly simple\u201d, depending on your initial preconceptions.  \n\nC5: In contemporary neural network languages, it is straightforward to compute the Jacobian of the actions w/ respect to observation inputs.  As described in eqn 2, this directly provides the linearization of the policy when evaluated at the nominal trajectory.  In section 3.1, we use the same network architecture for cloning from noisy rollouts and from the linear feedback policy (MLP with two hidden layers: 1024, 512; we can add this detail to the text).\n\n\nReferences:\nLiu, L., Yin, K., van de Panne, M., Shao, T. and Xu, W., 2010.

However, we disagree with the reviewer about the level of similarity between this work and previous work.  We have discussed a number of relationships between this work and existing approaches in the robotics, ML, and graphics communities. As far as we are aware, no existing work learns a rich embedding space for physics-based control.  For kinematic sequence modeling, there is abundant work in computer graphics that learns to blend/reuse/compose movement trajectories (e.g. Holden et al. 2017).  To our knowledge, for the much more challenging problem of flexible physics-based control, there is no prior work which results in a robustly reusable skill space that is as comprehensive in scope as what was demonstrated here.  We would sincerely appreciate references of any previous papers that the reviewer thinks overlap in terms of successfully demonstrating the learning of a skill space which is reusable for physics-based control, especially for humanoids.\n\nOne-shot imitation has been demonstrated by a few groups in the past couple years for mounted robotic arms. But we are aware of considerably less work (primarily Wang et al. 2017; discussed in the paper) in which humanoids perform one-shot behaviors.  The reason this is difficult in the physics-based case is that the humanoid must balance and remain upright in addition to imitating the demonstration.  Moreover, while one-shot imitation is the core systematic test of the model, since the architecture was trained for this setting, we emphasize that the demonstration of reuse is considerably more interesting to us.  After producing this module, a fresh HL policy can learn to set the \u201cintention\u201d of the LL controller and produces fairly human-like behaviors by reusing the learned skill space.  We selected the go-to-target task because we wanted to heavily tax the LL movement space by demanding sudden, jerky changes of movement and what resulted were strikingly human-like movement changes, with only a very simple reward (reward = 0 everywhere except when target is reached) and no additional constraints on the human-likeness of the behavior.  While simpler bodies can solve this problem from scratch, for a complex humanoid, the movements produced by learning from scratch are most definitely very non-human-like in general.\n\nSimultaneously reusing the upper body for manipulation while having lower body locomote is indeed a great challenge problem for future work. We have already included imitation of arm movements in our evaluation but our training distribution does not contain any manipulation demonstrations. We are optimistic that this approach can scale to this setting, but it is beyond the scope of the present paper.  We do believe, that what we have demonstrated here advances the state of the art for reusable physics-based locomotion behaviors. \n\nReferences: \nHolden, Daniel, Taku Komura, and Jun Saito. \"Phase-functioned neural networks for character control.\" ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG) 36, no. 4 (2017): 42.\n\nZiyu Wang, Josh S Merel, Scott E Reed, Nando de Freitas, Gregory Wayne, and Nicolas Heess.

The term linear-feedback-stabilized policy, refers to the linear feedback policy in equation 2, which is stabilized with linear feedback (relative to the naive open-loop policy that simply executes a fixed sequence of actions). \n\nWe consider it clear from our results that time-indexed linear feedback policies suffice to capture the behavior of experts around nominal trajectories in our setting. Correspondingly, LFPC is capable of transferring expert functionality. We would like to point out that in our scenario there is no need to estimate J -- it is simply the Jacobian of a neural network with respect to the inputs which is readily available in standard neural network languages (see eqn 2). \n\nThere seems to be some confusion about delta s -- it has very little to do with the \u201cvarious optimal controllers\u201d and indeed we state in the paper (page 4) that the approach is fairly insensitive to precise selection of this distribution. One possible reason for this is that the distribution does not matter much as long as it covers the states visited by the linear feedback policy which appears to stay pretty close to the nominal trajectory.\n\nFinally, the reviewer expresses concerns with respect to the applicability of our approach to the real robot setting. Our paper primarily targets the control of simulated physical humanoids and we do not make any further claims.  However recent approaches in a similar imitation learning setting have been shown to be effective for real robots (e.g. Laskey et al. 2017), so we do believe, as we speculate in the discussion that this is a plausible direction for future work.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for spotting a typo in equation 5 which we will correct.\n\nReferences:\nLaskey, M., Lee, J., Fox, R., Dragan, A. and Goldberg, K., 2017.

To this end, the paper proposes two approaches: (1) an approach for policy cloning that learns to mimic the (local) linear feedback behavior of an expert (where the expert takes the form of a neural network), and (2) an approach that learns to compress a large number of experts via a latent space model. The approaches are applied to the problem of one-shot imitation from motion capture data (using the CMU motion capture database). The paper also considers an extension of the proposed approach to the problem of high-level planning; this is done by treating the learned latent space as a new action space and training a high-level policy that operates in this space. \n\nStrengths:\nS1. The supplementary video was clear and helpful in understanding the setup.\nS2. The paper is written in a generally readable fashion.\nS3. The related work section does a thorough job of describing the context of the work.  \n\nHowever, I have some significant concerns with the paper. These are described below. \n\nSignificant concerns:\nC1. My biggest concern is that the paper does not make a strong case for the benefits of LPFC over simpler strategies. The results in Figure 3 demonstrate that a linear feedback policy computed along the expert's nominal trajectory performs as well as (and occasionally even better than) LPFC. This is quite concerning.\nC2. Moreover, as the authors themselves admit, \"while LPFC did not work quite as well in the full-scale model as cloning from noisy rollouts, we believe it holds promise insofar as it may be useful in rollout-limited settings...\". However, the paper does not present any theoretical/experimental evidence that would suggest this.\nC3. Another concern has to do with the two-step procedure for LPFC (Section 2.2), where the first step is to learn an expert policy (in the form of a neural network) and the second step is to perform behavior cloning by finding a policy that tries to match the local behavior of the expert (i.e., finding a policy that attempts to produce similar actions as the expert policy linearized about the nominal trajectory). This two-step procedure seems unnecessary; the paper does not make a case for why the expert policies are not chosen as linear feedback controllers (along nominal trajectories) in the first place.\nC4. The linearization of the expert policy produced in (1) may not lead to a stabilizing feedback controller and could easily destabilize the system. It is easy to imagine cases where the expert neural network policy maintains trajectories of the system in a tube around the nominal trajectory, but whose linearization does not lead to a stabilizing feedback controller. Do you see this in practice? If not, is there any intuition for why this doesn't occur? If this doesn't occur in practice, this would suggest that the expert policies are not highly nonlinear in the neighborhood of states under consideration (in which case, why learn neural network experts in the first place instead of directly learning a linear feedback controller as the expert policy as suggested in C3?)\nC5. I would have liked to have seen more implementation details in Section 3. In particular, how exactly was the linear feedback policy along the expert's nominal trajectory computed? Is this the same as (2)? Or did you estimate a linear dynamical model (along the expert's nominal trajectory) and then compute an LQR controller? More details on the architecture used for the behavioral cloning baseline would also have been helpful (was this a MLP? How many layers?)\n\nMinor comments:\n- There are some periods missing at the end of equations (eqs.

To do this, we propose a motor architecture that has the general structure of an inverse model with a latent-variable bottleneck. We show that it is possible to train this model entirely offline to compress thousands of expert policies and learn a motor primitive embedding space. The trained neural probabilistic motor primitive system can perform one-shot imitation of whole-body humanoid behaviors, robustly mimicking unseen trajectories. Additionally, we demonstrate that it is also straightforward to train controllers to reuse the learned motor primitive space to solve tasks, and the resulting movements are relatively naturalistic. To support the training of our model, we compare two approaches for offline policy cloning, including an experience efficient method which we call linear feedback policy cloning.
