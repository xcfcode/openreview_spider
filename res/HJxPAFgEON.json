The proposed method is shown to improve the state of the art on the WikiTable Question Answering task [Liang et al, 2018]. \n\nAlthough the results are interesting, it is not clear to what extent the improvements are explained by the use of RL-inspired techniques or the fact that the forward-cost estimator accesses additional sources of knowledge. These additional sources of knowledge need to be available at training/decoding time, so the approach amounts to a simple re-ranking of hypotheses surfaced via typical beam search \u2013 as a consequence, the approach may help re-rank search results that are already encoded in the beam, but not search results that fell off the beam.\n\nThe paper has some interesting ideas, but the writing is very poor. A substantial rewriting of the submission that goes beyond documenting the authors\u2019 train of thought would help readers understand better the main claims and limitations of the approach.\n", "rating": "2: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/drlStructPred/Paper8/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/drlStructPred/Paper8/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Program Planner for Structured Predictions", "authors": ["Jacob Biloki", "Chen Liang", "Ni Lao"], "authorids": ["bilokij@mosaix.ai", "crazydonkey@google.com", "ni.lao@mosaix.ai"], "keywords": ["Neural Networks", "Planning", "Reinforcement Learning", "Structured Prediction", "WikiTableQuestions"], "TL;DR": "A model-based planning component improves RL-based semantic parsing on WikiTableQuestions.", "abstract": "We consider the problem of weakly supervised structured prediction (SP) with reinforcement learning (RL) \u2013 for example, given a database table and a question, perform a sequence of computation actions on the table, which generates a response and  receives  a  binary  success-failure  reward.
