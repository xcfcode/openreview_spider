However, we wanted to make it clear that the search is on the cascade. \r\n\r\nRegarding the Q_i. You are correct, we do not define it clearly, and like you inferred, it is just a priority queue. s_i and v_i are the same thing. We will change this such that they are a single variable.\r\n\r\nThe 55.6% figure is on the ICDAR dataset. Using a language model and a lexicon does not improve the results beyond a language model. The reason for that is because the language model biases the results of the beam search heavily. When the minimal edit distance is reached for more than one word, we broke ties lexicographically. I think a small interesting area would be to investigate how other kinds of edit distance would help in correcting misspelled words, as this particular point seems to be able to lift test accuracy 2-3% points.\r\n\r\nCould you please clarify the last comment?

Contrarily to previous methods that often focus on a single aspect, this work addresses all simpler sub-problems and incorporates classifiers into different sub-modules of the whole system. The resulting method achieves impressive results and seems computationally efficient. The paper is very well written, comprehensive and does a good job at condensing a lot of information into 9 pages.\r\n\r\nA minor weakness concerns the novelty aspect: the paper mostly reuses existing algorithms, such as convolutional maxout networks, hybrid HMMs, beam search, MSER. What the authors call 'Cascade Beam Search' is in fact ordinary beam search. However, the pipeline is novel and produces good results and insightful discussion, especially about the trade-offs involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Section 5.3 (especially Algorithm 1): I found the notation confusing. Can you define Q_i in words? are those implemented with priority queues?\r\nWhat is the difference between intervals s_i and v_i?\r\n\r\n- Section 5.4: The 55.6% figure is obtained for which dataset? Why not use both a lexicon and a language model?\r\nWhat happens when the minimal edit distance is reached for more than one word?\r\n\r\n- The authors' main movitation for a language model is to achieve 'constant time in lexicon size per query', while the edit distance technique is slower but apparently has a better accuracy.
