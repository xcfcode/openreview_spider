Given that, I am going to raise my rating by one point for the following reason:\n- The manuscript presents a novel solution to a general problem and it is a valid solution. However, the solution is somewhat obvious, which is not necessarily a bad thing, which is why I am raising my rating by a point. However, an easy solution like the one proposed in the manuscript means that OBFS considered in this manuscript is not as general as the authors let on -- there is an implicit assumption that f(x_i, q) is close to f(x_j, q) if x_i is close to x_j.\n- While the authors answered a lot of my clarification questions, the manuscript seems still a little hard to parse and can be significantly improved for easier reading and understanding.\n\n=========================================\nPros\n-------\n[Originality/Significance] The manuscript focuses on a very general and important problem and proposes a scheme to solve this general problem. The authors present some theoretical and empirical results to demonstrate the utility of the proposed scheme.\n\nLimitations\n----------------\n[Clarity] While the problem being addressing is extremely important, and the proposed solution seems reasonable, the manuscript is really hard to follow. For example, Definition 3 and Theorem 1 are extremely hard to understand. \n\n[Clarity/Significance] Moreover, I feel that the authors should be more precise in pointing out why current graph based search algorithms are just not trivially applicable to OBFS. The nature of the approximate Delaunay graph is that it can be built for any given similarity function (the level of approximation obviously depends on the similarity function, but that is an existing issue with graph-based methods). Given the graph, I do not understand why the basic search algorithm on this similarity graph would not be an approximate solution to OBFS. Hence I believe the authors need to clarify why the existing graph based algorithms do not directly translate. \n\n[Significance] While Definition 1 considers topological spaces, SL2G is assuming that X and (maybe) Y are in R^d (for different values of d). So does that mean that SL2G does not solve the general OBFS?\n\n[Significance/Correctness/Clarity] The assumptions in Theorem 2 (as well as the supporting Proposition 1 in Appendix B) seems quite unreasonable. In moderately high dimensional X, doesn't the curse of dimensionality imply that this condition will not hold in most case? In there any reason why/how this would be circumvented? Moreover, in Proposition 1 (in Appendix B), the quantity C_r needs to be precisely defined since it could in general be exponential in the number of dimensions. Also, the assumption in Proposition 1 where \\lambda^* > 0 is fairly strong in high dimensional data since data gets really sparse in high dimensions. Finally, the last step in Proposition 1 (where the failure probability obtained from the union bound is connected to condition (b) in Theorem 2) is not clear at all -- it is not apparent how E and F related to S and how p relates to every ball containing a point in S. This is a very important step and needs better exposition. \n\n[Clarity/Significance] I am unable to understand the baseline HNSW-SBFG (or the motivation for it) in the empirical section. It would be good to clarify this. \n\n\nGeneral comments\n---------------------------\n[Significance] Finally, I believe that it would be good to see a connection between the success of SL2G to relationship between |f(x1, q) - f(x2, q)| and ||x1 - x2 ||_2 since the author emphasize that the proposed scheme can be seen as \"gradient descent in Euclidean space\" (although the authors would need to also precisely explain what they mean by that statement).\n\n[Originality] Some related work that the authors should position their proposed problem/solution against:\n- There is some work on \"max-kernel search\" which can perform similarity search with general notions of similarity (than just Euclidean metrics).\n- There is some work on search with Bregman divergences which handle asymmetric similarity functions and also incorporate notions of gradient descent over convex sets.\n\nMinor comments/typos\n---------------------------------\n- The authors should present the precise SL2G algorithm given the graph in the manuscript.\n- l^2 --> \\ell_2\n- gradient decent --> gradient descent\n- Table 1, f(q, x) --> f(x, q)", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper830/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Fast Binary Functional Search on Graph", "abstract": "The large-scale search is an essential task in modern information systems.

It has been very helpful for me to better understand the proposed solution and its utility. \n\nWhat I meant with \"basic search algorithm\" was that for any functional f(x_i, q), a graph would be built on S on some distance (or inverse similarity) function d(x_i, x_j) such that small d(x_i, x_j) implies small |f(x_i, q) - f(x_j, q)| and large d(x_i, x_j) implies large |f(x_i, q) - f(x_j, q)|. Then the search would just proceed with f for any query q. But now I see that this is exactly your proposed SL2G where you fix your d(x_i, x_j) to be the \\ell_2 distance. So essentially the guarantee for accuracy is dependent on the Lipschitz constant of the function f(\\cdot, q) = f_q(\\cdot) for a fixed q. \n\nOBFS is definitely more general definition than Bregman search and Max-kernel search but it is just a definition. This paper provides a solution SL2G to OBFS (defined on Euclidean spaces) but SL2G has no concrete correctness guarantees to the best of my understanding, especially since it is very very hard to build exact Delaunay graph (even for incomplete \"local\" ones) and the guarantees in this manuscript do not account for this approximation. On the other hand, Bregman search and max-kernel search provide correctness guarantees (using the structure of the problem). But that may be a shortcoming of graph-based search algorithms in general, not SL2G in particular."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper830/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper830/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper830/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Fast Binary Functional Search on Graph", "abstract": "The large-scale search is an essential task in modern information systems.

[Significance] While Definition 1 considers topological spaces, SL2G is assuming that X and (maybe) Y are in $R^d$ (for different values of d). So does that mean that SL2G does not solve the general OBFS?\n\n[Response] Thanks for pointing this out. The answer is \u201cno\u201d, it only solves OBFS when X and Y are subsets of Euclidean spaces. Actually, we are usually interested in Euclidean spaces or its subsets in real applications, as mentioned below Definition 1.\n\n4. [Significance/Correctness/Clarity] The assumptions in Theorem 2 (as well as the supporting Proposition 1 in Appendix B) seems quite unreasonable. In moderately high dimensional X, doesn't the curse of dimensionality imply that this condition will not hold in most case? \u2026\n\n[Response]Thank you for reading the proposition and theorem very carefully. \nWe consider an asymptotic setting that the number of data points growing to infinity and the dimension of X is fixed. When the region E is fixed, \\lambda^* is proportional to the number of data points, so it goes to infinity. \nOf course, one can consider a high dimensional setting when n and d increase simultaneously. However, C_r is still not critical since it is not in the exponent. In the failing probability formula, the volume of r/2 ball depends on d and plays a much more important role than C_r when d increases. If we hope the failing probability still goes to 0, then we should require log \\lambda^* is much greater than d log d.\nAbout the implication from Proposition 1 to condition (b) in Theorem 2, it is a simple geometry property. We recall that F is a set of centers of open r/2-balls whose union covers E. For a fixed open r-ball, say B, its center is covered by at least one open r/2-ball with the center in F. This open r/2-ball is contained in B by triangle inequality. The open r/2-ball contains at least one data point, which also belongs to B. This implies every open r-ball contains a data point, which is the assumption (b) in Theorem 2. We believe our proof is mathematically correct and clear.\nWe believe this is a nontrivial result. As the number of data points increases, we have more \u201cbad\u201d data points. Here, \u201cbad\u201d data point means it is far away from the local optimum of $f$, but it is a local optimum in greedy search on the graph. The theorem and proposition show that even if we have more bad data points, the failure probability of the greedy search still goes to 0.\n\n5. [Clarity/Significance] I am unable to understand the baseline HNSW-SBFG (or the motivation for it) in the empirical section. It would be good to clarify this. \n\n[Answer] HNSW-SBFG is quite similar to the original HNSW. We just replace the metric measure in HNSW, such as l2 or cosine, with the focusing search binary functional f. Beyond that, the graph construction and greedy search approaches of HNSW-SBFG are same as the original HNSW. Note that, to let HNSW-SBFG be applicable, we set X and Y in the same space (both 64-dimensional). In this way, f(x_i,x_j) will output a value no matter f is symmetrical (e.g., MLP-Em-Sum) or asymmetrical (e.g., MLP-Concate). If f is asymmetrical, f(x_i,x_j) is problematic actually. That why HNSW-SBFG works even worse on MLP-Concate datasets. If X and Y have different dimensions, HNSW-SBFG will be not applicable.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper830/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper830/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper830/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Fast Binary Functional Search on Graph", "abstract": "The large-scale search is an essential task in modern information systems.

While the problem being addressing is extremely important, and the proposed solution seems reasonable, the manuscript is really hard to follow. For example, Definition 3 and Theorem 1 are extremely hard to understand. \n\n[Response] Thanks for your comments. We will add more explanations for the theory part and make it easier to access. Specifically, although the problem is in an asymmetric setting, readers can still assume f(x,y) = -|x-y| as a typical example to understand the definitions and theorem. For example, assuming f is the negative l2-norm, then definition 3 means we will connect two data points in the Delaunay graph if the Voronoi cell is \u201cadjacent\u201d to each other. Here, adjacency means their boundary has nonempty intersection. Theorem 1 means that, for an arbitrary query, a greedy search on Delaunay graph with any initial point can find the nearest neighbor of the query.\n\n2. [Clarity/Significance] Moreover, I feel that the authors should be more precise in pointing out why the current graph-based search algorithms are just not trivially applicable to OBFS. \u2026\n\n[Response] Thank you for this comment. We are going to assume \"basic search algorithm on similarity graph\" indicates the previous search on graph methods, such as HNSW or Bregman ball tree (you mention in a later comment). These algorithms require f(x,y) defined on the product of two identical spaces. OBFS is much more general and does not have such an assumption. \n\nSuppose we still assume x and y are from the same space and plug in f as a \"similarity function\" in HNSW, which is exactly the baseline, HNSW-SBFG, we used in experiments. Particularly, in the recommendation-system scenario, we embed users and items in the same Euclidean space. As shown in the experimental results on page 8, the performance of HNSW-SBFG is much poorer than HNSW-SL2G. We believe original HNSW or any other existing similarity graph based algorithms require f performs like a similarity function. A well behaved f in recommendation system should not measure the similarity between user and item.\n\nIt is also worth to mention that, although we provide guarantees for SBFG, but most of general f's, e.g., neural networks, does not satisfy the condition in Theorem 1.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper830/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper830/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper830/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Fast Binary Functional Search on Graph", "abstract": "The large-scale search is an essential task in modern information systems.

Instead of search with a \"separable\" similarity measure, the authors propose Optimal Binary Functional Search (OBFS), where the scoring function f() is in general non-separable. The exact construction of the Binary Function Graph wrt f() and X is computationally expensive. The specific approximate algorithm of OBFS proposed in the paper is to:\n1) First construct an L2 Delaunay graph for based on the dataset X only and;\n2) Perform greedy search with the L2 Delaunay graph.\n\nThe authors also discuss various conditions under which, the approximation method can achieve close to optimal value.\n\nSome of the concerns I have with this work:\n\n1) The authors do not demonstrate sufficient value of performing approximation in this specific fashion. For instance, in  Theorem 2, the authors start with the concavity assumption of the scoring function f(). Then it is natural to apply a gradient ascent method on the neighborhood graph. And the authors did not quantitatively or qualitatively justify their specific approach.\n\n2) Lately, numerous publications have shown that distilled models can achieve very high quality and render scoring function separable. The authors should at least compare their method against distillation and Maximum Inner Product Search based approaches.\n\nOverall, this research direction is interesting, but this specific work falls short for a publication at ICLR.\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper830/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Fast Binary Functional Search on Graph", "abstract": "The large-scale search is an essential task in modern information systems.
