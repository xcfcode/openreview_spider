The most complicated setting is VAE on MNIST, and in this case the proposed methods are not performing better than standard IWAE. Maybe surprisingly, estimators with trainable parameters such as q_{COVD} do not appear to perform better on MNIST?\n\nIf one could easily and computationally cheaply reduce the variability of IS estimates, that would indeed be fantastic.
