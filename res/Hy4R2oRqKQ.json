Then, we derive an equality (Eq.6) that presents the connection between the expectation of marginal log-likelihood, the CMI and the expected reconstruction error. Based on this equation, we derive a surrogate objective (Eq.7) that can implicitly achieve the proposed minimum CMI criteria. With this objective, the explicit data distribution assumptions are avoided.\n \nThe ICCA framework:\nAs the $p(z|x, y)$ in Eq.7 is unknown for practical problems, approximate inference methods can be adopted to solve the optimization problem. \nSpecifically, If variational inference method is adopted, the ELBO derivation are as follows:\n**********\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y} \\sim p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})}\\log p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}) \n&=& \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y} \\sim p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})} [\\log p(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})\\int_{\\mathbf{z}}q_{\\mathbf{\\phi}}(\\mathbf{z}) d\\mathbf{z}] \\\\ \n&=& \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y} \\sim p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})} [ \\int_{\\mathbf{z}}q_{\\mathbf{\\phi}}(\\mathbf{z})\\log [\\frac{q_{\\mathbf{\\phi}}(\\mathbf{z})}{{p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{z}|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})}} \\cdot \\frac{{p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{z})}}{ p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{z}) p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{z})} \\cdot p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{z}) \\cdot p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{z}) \\cdot \\frac{{p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{z})}}{q_{\\mathbf{\\phi}}(\\mathbf{z})}] d\\mathbf{z}] \\\\ \n&=& \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y} \\sim p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})} D_{KL}(q_{\\mathbf{\\phi}}(\\mathbf{z})\\parallel p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{z}|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})) \\\\  \n& & + \\ \\textcolor{blue}{\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y} \\sim p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})} [\\mathbb{E}_{q_{\\mathbf{\\phi}}(\\mathbf{z})} \\textcolor{red}{\\log p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{z})} -  D_{KL}{(q_{\\mathbf{\\phi}}(\\mathbf{z})\\parallel p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{z}))}] \\Rightarrow  \\mathcal{L}_{1}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y};\\mathbf{\\theta},\\mathbf{\\phi})} \\\\ \n&=& \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y} \\sim p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})} D_{KL}(q_{\\mathbf{\\phi}}(\\mathbf{z})\\parallel p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{z}|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})) \\\\ \n& & + \\iint \\ [\\int_{\\mathbf{z}}p(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}){q_{\\phi}(\\mathbf{z}|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})} \\log {\\frac{p(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{z})}{p(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{z})p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{z})}} d\\mathbf{z}] d\\mathbf{x}d\\mathbf{y}, \\\\ \n& &+ \\ \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y} \\sim p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})} [\\mathbb{E}_{q_{\\mathbf{\\phi}}(\\mathbf{z})} \\log [p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{z}) +  \\log {p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{z})}] -  D_{KL}{(q_{\\mathbf{\\phi}}(\\mathbf{z})\\parallel p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{z}))}]\n\\end{eqnarray}\n**********\nFor the last equation, we can see that based on the KL-divergence that constrains the approximation of $p(z|x, y)$ and $q(z)$, The second RHS term can be regarded as the approximation of CMI. Consequently, adopting variational inference for the approximation, our objective (substituting $p(z|x,y)$ with $q(z)$) can implicitly achieve the minimum CMI criteria proposed for CCA. \n\nFurthermore, considering the difference between the last equation and $ \\mathcal{L}_{1}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y};\\mathbf{\\theta},\\mathbf{\\phi})} $, it is verified that with the adopted CMI criteria, the conditional independent assumption is avoided.\n\nThe ACCA instantiation:\nConsidering the limitation of misaligned encoding of VCCA, we design ACCA with adversarial learning technique based on Eq.11.\nSpecifically,  apart from the first two terms that are naturally required by the objective of CCA, We further introduce $q(z|x, y)$ to provide holistic information for the joint data distribution $p(x, y)$. Then, considering the difficulty in modeling these approximations individually, we constrain all these three encodings, $q(z|x)$ $q(z|y)$ and $q(z|x, y)$, to be similar to the prior p(z). In this way, the approximation of these encodings is implicitly satisfied.\n\nBased on the aforementioned analysis, proposed ACCA is formulated with Eq. 12, which conforms with both our formulation of ICCA in Eq.7 and the network design in Figure 2. \n\nIn the end, thanks again for all the reviewers\u2019 valuable comments and constructive suggestions on our work. we will strive to make this work a better one.

But this does not influence the soundness of our motivation.\n\nFor your second concern, we do not claim that Appendix 7 presents the ELBO. Actually, we simply analogize the derivation of the ELBO in [1], and derive an equality that presents the connection between the expectation of marginal log-likelihood, the CMI and the expected reconstruction error. Based on the derived equality, we obtained a surrogate objective that implicitly leads to the  CMI criteria.\n\nAs stated in \u201c ICCA as a framework \u201d, since the $p(z|x, y)$ is hard to infer for practical problems, approximate inference methods are to be adopted to instantiate practical models.

As $D_{KL}\\geq 0$, the rest two terms composes an ELBO of the marginal log-likelihood. The second RHS term can be regarded as the approximation of CMI.  And the third term is our derived objective in Eq.7.\n\nWe can see that, if the $D_{KL}=0$ is satisfied, the second term would be CMI, which is guaranteed to be non-negative. This makes our objective an ELBO for the problem. This also indicates that CMI is the criteria that is behind this variational formulation. \n\nThe derivation also coincides with our formulation of ACCA, in which we incorporate three $q$ functions to approximate $p(z|x, y)$ through GAN structure.

However, in practical, these three terms are complicated and difficult to be modeled individually.\nInspired by the variational inference, which can drive the approximation of $q(z)~p(z)$, We further adopt specially-designed GAN structure, to drive $q_{x}(z)$, $q_{y}(z)$ and $q_{xy}(z)$ to approximate the same prior $p(z)$ simultaneously. In this way, the approximation of $q_{x}(z)$, $ q_{y}(z)$ and $q_{xy}(z)$ required by CCA, is implicitly satisfied.\n\nFor additional experiments, the log-likelihood obtained without the constraint of \"q(z|x,y) \\approx p(z)\" for ACCA(GM) is $94.912$ (comparable with that of ACCA(G)).

But there seems to be some misunderstanding on our work and some important details may also be overlooked. We detailedly answered your concerns with the following response. ", "comment": "Thank you for the constructive comments and suggestions on our work.  We answer your concerns on the proposed ACCA in the following aspects:\n1).  Our proposed ICCA studies multi-view learning from the generative perspective. (A1)\n2). The CMI is a theoretically sound criteria to satisfy the requirement for CCA, based on our intention to capture nonlinear dependency with implicit distributions. (A1, A3)\n3). The feasibility of ICCA and ACCA can be supported by representative works on Deep Generative Models, e.g. VAEs and AAEs. ( A2, A3, A4, A5)\n\nBelow, we answer each of your questions detailedly. \n\nA--1). Your concerns on our metric can be answered with two key points of our motivation:  (1). We aim to interpret nonlinear CCA models from the generative perspective; (2). We aim to relax the explicit distribution assumptions on the data for these CCA modeling. \n\nFrom what we understand here, you interpret the main objective of CCA from the discriminative perspective, which is deviating from our motivations. From the generative perspective, the objective of CCA can be interpreted as learning a compact set of the shared latent variables z that represent a distribution over the observed two-view data x and y (as depicted in Figure1). For this generative model, the latent variable z is to be inferred, instead of \u201cgiven\u201d as in your understanding. \n\nActually, $I(f(X), g(Y))$ has been adopted as a metric to capture non-linear dependency (CIA in Table 1). However, explicit distributions are required for f(X) and g(Y), which are intractable to be estimated in these complex expressive nonlinear CCA models. This restricts the model to capture nonlinear dependency (Page 3, Line 1-4) .  \n\nConsequently, we present $I(X;Y|Z)$ as the metric, which achieves the following benefits simultaneously: 1). It suits the generative interpretation for multi-view learning problem;  2). It can capture nonlinear dependency implicitly based on the proposed formulation. (Notes: To be detailedly explained with Q2 and Q3). \n\nNote that, although $I(X;Y|Z)$ is the criteria of the proposed ACCA model, the transformations, $f(X)$ and $G(Y)$, are already implicitly implemented in our network (Figure2). \n\nTherefore, the proposed $I(X;Y|Z)$ can be a sound criteria for generative interpretation of nonlinear CCA models.\n\n\nA--2). As we aim to conduct CCA with implicit distributions, following the derivation of ELBO, we derive a surrogate for the proposed $I(X;Y|Z)$ criteria, to eliminate the explicit distribution requirement (Page 3, Line 1-4) for its estimation. As described in Section3.3, we prove that the optimization of Eq. (7) (refer to Eq. (6) in the original version) implicitly leads to $min I(X;Y|Z)$, through the derivation shown in the appendix. The presented derivation can be supported by the ELBO derivation in the variational inference [1].  \n\nA--3). Although differential entropy can be negative, the conditional mutual information is always nonnegative based on the Jensen's inequality [2]. Consequently, $ I(X;Y|Z) = 0$ will be the optimal value of the generative CCA problem. Therefore, we do not need to consider the *absolute value* here. \n\nA--4). As explained in Q2, in our paper, Eq.(6) and Eq.(7) (refer to Eq.(5) and Eq.(6) in the original version) are presented to show that connection between the presented $I(X;Y|Z)$ criteria and deduced surrogate objective of the proposed ICCA. (The proof is presented in the appendix)  Practical models are instantiated with different approximate inference methods within the ICCA framework. In these instantiations, the model parameters are what we learn. (Eq.4, Eq.8 and Eq.9).\n\n\nA--5).  As stated in section 4.1, our proposed problem is challenging in two aspects: 1). we study CCA with implicit distributions; 2) we intend to handle task which requires high precision of alignment. Existing methods fail in these two cases.   \n\nAs illustrated in [3], adversarial training criterion can regularize the aggregated posterior distribution of the latent representation of the autoencoder to arbitrary prior distributions. This kind of approximate inference technique achieves two properties. (1). It allows $q(z|x)$ to act as a deterministic function of x, without explicit assumptions on the posterior distributions.  (2). As the technique drives the approximation of the aggregated posterior to the prior, it achieves a compact latent space in which samples generated from any part of the latent space would be meaningful.\n\nConsequently, in the proposed ACCA, we adopt the adversarial training criterion on the multi-view encodings and adopt a shared discriminator to drive the approximation of these encodings simultaneously. This design enables ACCA to be superior to VCCA in two aspects. (1). ACCA can handle CCA problem with implicit distributions. (2). As ACCA drives the approximation of the three aggregated posteriors to the prior distribution (Eq. 11), it overcomes the misaligned encoding problem in Bi-VCCA (Section 4.2)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper761/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper761/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper761/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Canonical Correlation Analysis with Implicit Distributions", "abstract": "Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a ubiquitous technique that shows promising performance in multi-view learning problems.

We have added the reference in the adapted version. \nThe paper provides an in-depth probabilistic discussion on linear CCA based on Gaussian assumptions, which greatly deepens the understanding CCA. The restrictions of this work (the bullet points in Page 2) inspired us to re-decide the criteria to deepen the understanding of complex nonlinear CCA models and relax the assumptions. \n\nA--2). In this paper, nonlinear dependency indicates high-order dependency in the statistical sense. For classic CCA, it adopts linear correlation metric to estimate the linear dependency (second-order statistics) between the variables. However, this metric is insufficient to analyze complex practical data which contains higher-order dependency. This is because linear correlation is only an ideal criteria for CCA with Gaussian assumption on the data distributions, which do not hold in general. Consequently, in this work, to capture nonlinear dependency in CCA, we adopt mutual information as the metric, which is a generalized correlation measurement that can handle nonlinear dependency between two random variables. \n\nThe non-linearity of the proposed ACCA stems from our motivation to capture nonlinear dependency. Instantiated within ICCA, ACCA also implicitly achieves the $min I(X;Y|Z)$ criteria. For pointwise mutual information for Gaussian distributed data, the proposed criteria is related to linear correlation with the following equation. $ I{(\\mathbf{X};\\mathbf{Y}|\\mathbf{Z})} = \\log \\frac{1}{1-r^{2}}$, where $r$ denotes the linear correlation between $q(z|x)$ and $q(z|y)$. \n\nHowever, as we deal with multi-view learning with implicit distributions in ACCA, its connection to the linear independence is inconclusive.\n\n\nA--3). We use \u201clinear correlation criterion \u201d to indicate correlation measurement which can only estimate the linear dependency between the variables. As it is presented in section 3.1 of the revised version, for CCA and PCCA, the criterion is defined as follows. $\\rho = \\max\\limits_{W_{x},W_{y}} \\frac{W_{x}^{'}{\\Sigma}_{xy}W_{y}} {\\sqrt{W_{x}^{'}{\\Sigma}_{xx}W_{x}{W_{y}^{'}{\\Sigma}_{yy}W_{y}}}}$, where {\\Sigma}_{xx} and {\\Sigma}_{yy} denote the covariance of X and Y respectively, and {\\Sigma}_{xy} denotes the cross-covariance of X and Y. \n\nA--4).

Below, we answer your questions detailedly.\n\nA--1). In ACCA_NoCV, we use Gaussian prior- the same prior as Bi-VCCA. Although it does not use the complementary view, it can outperform Bi-VCCA because the adversarial learning scheme can still provide a consistent marginalization for the two inference models, which alleviates the misaligned encoding problem in Bi-VCCA. Specifically, different from the KL divergence which matches the conditional distribution of z with individual points in each view, adversarial learning drives the approximation of the marginalized distributions of z for the two views (as illustrated with Eq. 10 and Eq. 11). As the variable in each view is marginalized out, this approximation is more robust and can achieve consistent encoding for the two views. \n\nAs is presented with section 7.2 in the Appendix, Figure 5 obviously shows that $z_{y}$ of Bi-VCCA fails to show good clustering results. The comparison between that of $z_{x}$ indicates that Bi-VCCA suffers from a misalignment encoding for the incorporated two views. While for ACCA_NoCV in Figure 6,  the clustering result presents better alignment for the two views compared with that of Bi-VCCA, which indicates that the adopted adversarial learning scheme benefits the consistent encoding for the two views.\n\n\nA--2). In the reported experiments, the prior distributions are all set to be Gaussian Mixture and the parameters of the prior are specified in advance. The intention of this setting is to initially verify that better performance would be obtained in generative CCA models when given the suitable prior distribution (In table 4, higher correlation is captured with non\u2010Gaussian prior). This verifies that ACCA achieves superiority for handling implicit distributions compared with VCCA. \n\nA--3). For the same setting on the nHSIC computation, the average negative log-likelihood achieved with each encoding on the test set of  Bi-VCCA, ACCA_NoCV, ACCA (G), ACCA (GM) are 112.75, 107.26, 94.41 and 103.10 respectively. Consequently, regarding the log-likelihood, ACCA (G) achieves the best result, while Bi-VCCA achieves the worst.  \n\nA--4). $q(z|x)$ and $q(z|y)$ are the two principle encodings of CCA. Without them, analysis on the multi-views of CCA, such as correlation analysis and cross-view generation, cannot be conducted.\n\nActually, the model with the single encoding of $q(z|x,y)$ can be adopted to learn a common embedding for multi-view data, the variant model is worth to be further studied for multi-view embedding task. \n\n\nA--5). The introduction of adversarial training indeed increases the training time of ACCA (1503s vs 2806s), but the increase is tolerable considering its superiority on the result."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper761/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper761/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper761/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Canonical Correlation Analysis with Implicit Distributions", "abstract": "Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a ubiquitous technique that shows promising performance in multi-view learning problems.

The proposed approach, called adversarial canonical correlation analysis (ACCA), is essentially the application of adversarial autoencoder to multiple data views. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including the MNIST left right halved dataset, MNIST noisy dataset, and Wisconsin X-ray microbeam database, show the proposed ACCA result in higher dependence (measured by the normalized HSIC) between two data views compared to Bi-VCCA. \n\nThis paper is well motivated.

In particular:\n\n1) The main motivation is the minimization of the conditional mutual information I(X;Y|Z), where X and Y correspond to the two views and Z is latent. First of all, what uncertainty does this expression has when X and Y are observations and Z is given? My understanding is that the main objective of any CCA problem should be to find some transformations, say f(X) and g(Y), with some (to be defined) desirable properties. For example, these would correspond to linear transformations, say Ax and By, for classical CCA. Therefore, should not one be interested in minimizing something like I(f(X);g(Y)|Z)?\n\n2) Assuming that the minimization of the conditional mutual information I(X;Y|Z) would be the goal, I don't quite see why the formulation in equation (6) would actually be equivalent (or be some reasonable approximation)? \n\n3) It is well known that differential entropy can be negative (e.g., Cover and Thomas, 2006). Why would the conditional mutual information in equation (4) be non-negative? Alternatively, what would negative values of I(X;Y|Z) mean in the CCA context? My understanding is that one should be interested in minimizing I(X;Y|Z), or its variants with transformations, in *absolute value* to ensure some closeness to conditional independence.\n\n4) Expressions in equation (5)-(6) are general and hold with no assumptions whatsoever for any random variables X, Y, Z (given the expectations/integrals exist). It is therefore not clear what are the variables of this minimization problem? (parameters? but what is the parametric model?)\n\n5) Assuming solving (6) is the goal, this formulation as mentioned by the authors is actually is quite a challenging problem involving latent variables. Some form of this approach explanation would \n\nI can not quite see how the proposed adversarial version would correct or supplement any of these questions.\n\nOther comments:\n\n1) It would be appropriate to cite the probabilistic CCA paper by Bach and Jordan (2005); a better citation for classical CCA would be Hotelling (1936).\n\n2) I find the multiple mentioning of the *non-linear* (in-)dependence confusing. Is this in statistical sense? And how exactly is this related to CCA? Does it have anything to do with the fact that the third and higher order cumulants are zero only for independent variables unless they are Gaussian? Moreover, does this linear independence have any connection with the non-linearity of the proposed CCA approach?\n\n3) What exactly is the *linear correlation criterion* and how does it enter the classical CCA or PCCA formulation (Introduction; bullet point 2)?\n\n4) It would be helpful to introduce the original CCA problem emphasizing that each view, X and Y, are *different* linear transformation of *the same* latent codes z. Moreover, the full description of the models (classical CCA/ PCCA) wouldn't take more than one-two paragraphs and would help the readers to avoid any misunderstanding.\n\n5) Are any assumptions necessary to ensure existence?\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper761/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Canonical Correlation Analysis with Implicit Distributions", "abstract": "Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a ubiquitous technique that shows promising performance in multi-view learning problems.
