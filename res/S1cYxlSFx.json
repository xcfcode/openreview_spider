The proposed method of splitting categories into confused and not super classes isn't robust as a given class c can end up in multiple super classes. Furthermore the decision of creating super classes is done locally (per row) without regard of the global structure of the problem. Employing sprectral graph theory to reason about the structure of the confusion matrix, its affinity counterpart actually, is much more principled.\n\nThe application of the ensemble of specialists to detecting adversarial examples is novel. However it is not very different from just adding a \"unknown\" class to a regular CNN model with multiple specialists.\n\nI recommend the authors to pursue this area of research and find provably optimal specialist selection criteria. Furthermore, the proposed approach, leads to significant redundancy of computation as the lower layers across specialists and generalist are likely very similar if not identical.

Firstly, I agree that your approach is novel and apologize if my initial review was taken to imply otherwise. Moreover, as I said in the review, I think this is an interesting direction for work and encourage you to develop it further.\n\nI set the paper at 'marginally below acceptance threshold' primarily because I do not feel a convincing argument has been made for the proposed method within the short-abstract, i.e. ignoring the supplementary material and judging the submission purely on the merits of the first 3 of 9 pages. Some thoughts about the manuscript under this view:\n   +  The introduction and algorithm explanation were sufficiently detailed and could be followed well.\n   +  The discussion of model confidence and the accompanying Figure 2 were interesting and point to the approach working well; however, the confidence distribution is not put into the context of the baseline models so it is difficult to really evaluate the approach.\n   -   Despite spending a large chunk of the paper defining the evaluation criteria, no numerical results were presented for E_A or E_D in the main paper. They are referenced but only with respect to relative performance so it is hard to evaluate how well your method is doing and what the trade-offs are between avoiding adversarial examples and getting 'regular' images correct. \n\nOf course, many of these problems are resolved in the additional details and figures in the supplementary material but the role of a supplement is not to fill gaps in the core argument of the main submission.\n\nI hope you find this feedback useful.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Robustness to Adversarial Examples through an Ensemble of Specialists", "abstract": "We are proposing to use an ensemble of diverse specialists, where speciality is defined according to the confusion matrix.
