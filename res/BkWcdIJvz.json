A convolutional network is used to learn input representations and the sequences generated by the model are evaluated by composers.\n\nDespite the limited space, the abstract was relatively easy to follow and clear. This is impressive considering the relative complexity of the described model.\n\nAs the text points out, VAE-based recurrent models have been  around since 2014 and the approach is not new except perhaps for the use of convolutional input transformations. However, such convolutional transformations have been combined with RNN models before as well (again, the authors acknowledge this, so this is no complaint about credit assignment). This lack of novelty could be offset by impressive results or scaling the models up to challenging data sets but the data sets used in the paper are very small and no quantitative results are reported. The composer quotations are hard to interpret because the paper doesn't specify how many composers were involved and there is no baseline system to compare with. The samples on soundcloud sound nice, but it is unfortunate that it is not clear whether they are generated from noise or reconstructed from input sequences.\n\nPros: Clear presentation, good sounding samples\n\nCons: Lack of novelty, limited evaluation, small data set", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Capturing Musical Structure Using Convolutional Recurrent Latent Variable Model", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a model for learning musical features and generating novel sequences of music.
