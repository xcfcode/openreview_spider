The idea is a good one, but the paper is a bit terse.  Its not really clear what we are looking at in Figure 1b - the different quadrants and so forth - but I would guess the red blobs are the learned pooling regions.  Its kind of what you expect, so it also begs the question of whether this teaches us anything new. But still it seems like a sensible approach and worth reporting.   I suppose one can view it as a validation of the pooling envelope that is typically assumed."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Gradient Driven Learning for Pooling in Visual Pipeline Feature Extraction Models", "decision": "conferencePoster-iclr2013-workshop", "abstract": "Hyper-parameter selection remains a daunting task when building a pattern recognition architecture which performs well, particularly in recently constructed visual pipeline models for feature extraction.

The key contribution is to formulate the pooling operation in the spatial pyramid as a weighted sum over inputs which enables learning of the pooling receptive fields via back-propagation.\r\n\r\nPros: The paper addresses an important problem in the field of computer vision. Spatial pyramids are currently quite popular in the computer vision community and optimizing the many free parameters which are normally tuned by hand is a key problem.\r\n\r\nCons: The contribution of the present work remains very limited both in terms of the actual problem formulation and the empirical evaluation (no comparison to alternative approaches such as the recent work by Jia et al [ref 5] is shown). The overall 0.5% improvement in accuracy over non-optimized hyper-parameters is quite disappointing. In future work, the authors should compare their approach with alternative approaches in addition to suggesting significant improvement over non-optimized/standard parameters.\r\n\r\nAdditional comments: Additional references that could be added, discussed and/or used for benchmark.
