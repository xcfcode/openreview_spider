First, CCKL is NOT meant to be a proposed loss function. We NEVER claimed in any way in our paper that CCKL could track accuracy more faithfully than cross entropy loss. This objective is NEVER meant to be optimized. We're merely justifying that the decrease of the standard cross entropy loss directly result in the rise of CCKL, which lays the foundation for our following derivations on the relation between adversarial robustness and standard performance. Throughout the whole work, CCKL serves as a auxiliary role to develop our main theory. For more explanation on the \"auxiliary role\", please refer to our reply to R2.\n\nIn addition, our major contribution is about revealing the relation between the standard performance and adversarial robustness. Based on the proposed CCKL, we further theoretically show that the rise of CCKL could be result from both rise of non-robust component as well as rise of robust component. If the model relies on the non-robust component to boost performance, it will has the side-effect of adversarial vulnerability. If the model doesn't rely heavily on the non-robust component, it will suffer greatly in standard performance. Also, we conducted various experiments to prove our point, such as showing non-robust component will rise drastically during standard training, showing adversarial training will effectively regularize the non-robust component. What's more, based on our theory, we point out the possible direction of achieving simultaneous adversarial robust and decent standard performance, which is enabling the model to rely more on robust component to distinguish data from different categories.

Unfortunately, we have to point out your misunderstanding in our work. The main idea of our work is NOT focused on the relation between Fisher's eigen value and robustness. This relation is simply one bedrock for our conclusion.\n\nOur main purpose of this work is to reveal the relation between standard performance and adversarial robustness. It has been observed that an adversarial robust DNNs usually don't have a comparable standard performance with standard DNNs. However, there is no previous work rigorously showing the underlying reason behind this phenomenon. In our work, we theoretically reveal this little understood relation by disentangling the non-robust and robust component in a proposed performance metric. We show that the model could rely on both the non-robust component as well as robust component to boost performance. And if the model relies heavily on the non-robust component to distinguish data from different categories, it will enjoy a high standard performance, but will also be adversarial vulnerable at the same time.\n\nIn addition, we conducted various experiments to prove our point, such as showing non-robust component will rise drastically during standard training, showing adversarial training will effectively regularize the non-robust component.

We hope our following response could help resolve your concerns. \n\nFirst of all, we never meant to optimize our model based on CCKL. CCKL only need to serves as an indicator of the performance. The overall flow of our idea goes like this:\n\ndecrease of cross-entropy loss ==> rise of CCKL ==> rise of non-robust component ==> causing adversarial behavior.\n\nTherefore, as long as it's a byproduct and good indicator of the optimization of cross entropy loss, it would be enough to lay the foundation for our following derivations. We only need \"rise of CCKL\" to be the necessary condition of \"the decrease of cross-entropy loss\". As for whether it's a good indicator on the performance, we've already provided a theoretic bound and several experiments in the main text and appendix to justify its role as a good performance indicator to cross-entropy loss.\n\nIn addition, as far as we are concerned, we've provided enough experimental evidence in the paper to support our theoretical findings. Our previous theories show that the overall performance metric could be disentangled into a non-robust and a robust component. Next, we show that the non-robust component will rise drastically with the standard accuracy, which shall cause serious adversarial behavior. Also, to prove our point from another direction, we show that adding adversarial training will also greatly impede the rise of the non-robust component. In this way, we also present some strong empirical evidence on the disentanglement in addition to the theoretical derivations. If you think more ablation should be added, please be more specific about it.\n\nWe would like to thank you for acknowledging our contribution on explaining the effectiveness of capacity in achieving simultaneous decent performance and adversarial robustness. However, we have to restate here that previous efforts only provide some empirical results and intuitions on this phenomenon, however, we're the first to provide a theoretic justification and understanding on the effectiveness of capacity/non-linearity in achieving simultaneous adversarially robust and decent standard performance. Also, to the best of  our knowledge, our experiments on the non-linearity (Linear VGG/Half-Linear VGG/Standard VGG) is not included in any previous work.\n\nAlso, we think although the final step is simply a Taylor expansion, all the previous steps (such as justification on using CCKL as performance metric, justification on connection between Fisher information and adversarial non-robustness) are necessary to rigorously develop the whole idea. As for the information geometry part, since all our previous derivations are based on the log-likelihood landscape, it is natural to introduce an overall explanation on the difference between the formation of the log-likelihood landscape of standard model and robust model. This part was indeed meant to serve as a high level intuition over the whole work and the previous parts are rigorous derivations. However, we only used a small subsection on this part and it doesn't affect the overall flow of the development of our idea."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper581/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper581/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["shiyujun1016@gmail.com", "bliao@tencent.com", "gycchen@tencent.com", "nk12csly@mail.nankai.edu.cn", "cmm@nankai.edu.cn", "elefjia@nus.edu.sg"], "title": "Towards Disentangling Non-Robust and Robust Components in Performance Metric", "authors": ["Yujun Shi", "Benben Liao", "Guangyong Chen", "Yun Liu", "Ming-ming Cheng", "Jiashi Feng"], "pdf": "/pdf/b3b82f5276e1b8a4cd60c431e65cfc4c565e5fc9.pdf", "TL;DR": "We show the relation between standard performance and adversarial robustness by disentangling the non-robust and robust components in a proposed performance metric.", "abstract": "The vulnerability to slight input perturbations is a worrying yet intriguing property of deep neural networks (DNNs).

At a high level the goal of this objective is to ensure that the classifier is confidently separating samples from different classes. They decompose this objective into its Taylor expansion terms and argue that, since adversarial vulnerability is a local property, it only depends on the first of these terms. They finally propose training models of higher capacity as a way of relying more on higher-order terms of the objective and hence improving adversarial robustness.\n\nI found the core idea potentially interesting. It is an attempt at rigorously studying the tension between local stability (necessary for robustness) and the fact that different classes should be confidently separated. However, I have several concerns regarding the theoretical derivation and experimental evaluation.\n\nFirst of all, I did not find the proposed CCKL objective well motivated. Theorem 3.1 only shows that standard training improves a _lower bound_ on the proposed objective. However, this only implies that this objective is being optimized as a byproduct of standard cross-entropy optimization. It is unclear for instance if this is a good performance indicator or whether training with this objective will even lead to a good classifier (for instance the classifier could learn a permutation of the labels instead). Therefore, I do not find the theoretical and experimental evidence in favor of studying this proposed objective convincing.\n\nMoreover, the experimental evidence presented is quite weak. While the authors compare various quantities related to standard and robust models, they do not perform the ablations necessary to understand whether these properties are causally related to robustness of simply a byproduct of the specific training scheme.\n\nFinally, the conclusion that larger capacity can improve both model accuracy and robustness has already been made in prior work (Kurakin et al. 2016, Madry et al. 2017). The intuition that added capacity helps by allowing the model to leverage higher order terms of the loss is interesting but a rather incremental contribution.\n\nOverall, while the ideas presented in the paper could be of interest, they are not rigorously established and rather serve as high-level intuition at this moment. Moreover, the writing of the paper could be significantly improved. It took me quite some time to distill the above intuition despite the fact that it is a rather elementary consequence of the Taylor expansion (I am not sure what the discussion about information geometry adds to this work). I would thus encourage the authors to continue working on these ideas and their presentation. However, for now, I will have to recommend rejection."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper581/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper581/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["shiyujun1016@gmail.com", "bliao@tencent.com", "gycchen@tencent.com", "nk12csly@mail.nankai.edu.cn", "cmm@nankai.edu.cn", "elefjia@nus.edu.sg"], "title": "Towards Disentangling Non-Robust and Robust Components in Performance Metric", "authors": ["Yujun Shi", "Benben Liao", "Guangyong Chen", "Yun Liu", "Ming-ming Cheng", "Jiashi Feng"], "pdf": "/pdf/b3b82f5276e1b8a4cd60c431e65cfc4c565e5fc9.pdf", "TL;DR": "We show the relation between standard performance and adversarial robustness by disentangling the non-robust and robust components in a proposed performance metric.", "abstract": "The vulnerability to slight input perturbations is a worrying yet intriguing property of deep neural networks (DNNs).

Though some efforts have been devoted to investigating the reason behind such adversarial behavior, the relation between standard accuracy and adversarial behavior of DNNs is still little understood. In this work, we reveal such relation by first introducing a metric characterizing the standard performance of DNNs. Then we theoretically show this metric can be disentangled into an information-theoretic non-robust component that is related to adversarial behavior, and a robust component. Then, we show by experiments that DNNs under standard training rely heavily on optimizing the non-robust component in achieving decent performance. We also demonstrate current state-of-the-art adversarial training algorithms indeed try to robustify DNNs by preventing them from using the non-robust component to distinguish samples from different categories. Based on our findings, we take a step forward and point out the possible direction of simultaneously achieving decent standard generalization and adversarial robustness.
