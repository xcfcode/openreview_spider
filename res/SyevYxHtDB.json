This should be clarified better in Sec. 3.  It is important to highlight that the defender has no access to F_A, thus problem (4) is a black-box optimization problem for defense. Also, it is better to have a table to summarize the notations. \n\nAdditional questions on problem formulation:\na) Problem (4) only relies on the transfer set, where $x \\sim P_A(x)$, right? \nb) For evaluation metrics, utility and non-replicability, do they have the same D^{test}? How to determine them, in particularly for F_A? \nc) One utility constraint is missing in problem (4). I noticed that it was mentioned in MAD-argmax, however, I suggest to add it to the formulation (4).\n\n2)  The details of heuristic solver are unclear. Although the authors pointed out the pseudocode in the appendix, it lacks detailed analysis. \n\n3) In Estimating G, how to select the surrogate model? Moreover, in the experiment, the authors mentioned that defense performances are unaffected by choice of architectures, and hence use the victim architecture for the stolen model. If possible, could the author provide results on different architecture choices for the stolen model as well as the surrogate model?\n\n############## Post-feedback ################\nI am satisfied with the authors' response. Thus, I would like to keep my positive comments on this paper. Although the paper is between 6 and 8, I finally decide to increase my score to 8 due to its novelty in formulation and extensive experiments.

We are also pleased reviewers find the paper \u201cwell-written\u201d and \u201cvery readable\u201d.\n\nWe now address individual concerns of AnonReviewer4.\n\n<< (1a) MAD is comparable to random-noise on CIFAR100 \u2026 Defense performance gap reduces as the dataset becomes more difficult >>\n- In terms of the two utility metrics we use to evaluate defense performance:\n  (i) *utility = defender\u2019s accuracy* (y-axis of Fig. 4 - bottom; blue and green lines): the performance gap is nonetheless significant e.g., CIFAR100 MAD defender accuracy is 5% higher than random-noise at attacker accuracy (x-axis) = 44%; and\n  (ii) *utility = perturbation amount* (y-axis of Fig. 4 - top): we consistently find MAD significantly outperforms random-noise defense, even for difficult datasets e.g., CIFAR100 MAD defender introduces 1/3$\\times$ lesser perturbation than random-noise at attacker accuracy = 44%.\n- [Revisions] We introduced magnification insets of dense regions in Fig. 4 of the revised manuscript to better convey the gaps.\n\n\n<< (1b) Overall skeptical of the threat model: (i) requires large number of queries \u2026 (ii) attacker does not achieve great results >>\n- We believe the skepticism is unjustified, because:\n  (i) *Querying is cheap*: The bottleneck for stealing models is the *cost* of executing queries (e.g., money, latency) rather than the *number* of queries. The cost for querying in practise is cheap: 0.0015 USD per prediction on Google cloud prediction API for instance. \n  (ii) *Attack performance/results extracted per dollar is substantial*: Yes, the accuracy of attacker\u2019s stolen models are imperfect (0.72-1.0$\\times$ victim\u2019s accuracy, Table 1). However, the dollars spent per accuracy point (\u201cAP\u201d) [1, 2, 3] for the attacker is a fraction of the victim\u2019s. Consider Caltech256 for instance: (a) Victim = 11 USD per AP (22K images x 0.35 USD / 80 accuracy; 0.35 USD using Google\u2019s data labeling platform) ignoring costs to collect and curate data, engineer the model, etc.; and (b) Attacker = 1 USD per AP (50K images x 0.0015 USD / 74.6 accuracy) by stealing. \n- Consequently, we argue that model stealing attacks pose a severe threat when viewing the problem as information extracted by the attacker per dollar.\n\n\n<< (1c) Attack and defense results on ImageNet would be nice >>\n- While Imagenet evaluation would be interesting, the focus of our paper is defending existing attack models and on datasets that the attacks have proven to be effective. Unfortunately we are not aware of any existing model stealing attack on ImageNet, apart from a very recent arXiv paper [2] (Jagielski et al., Sep. 2019).\n\n\n<< (2) How long does this optimization procedure take? \u2026 unreasonable if it significantly lengthens the time to return outputs of queries >>\n- We find all our optimization procedures take under a second. Specifically: 6ms (MNIST), 7ms (FashionMNIST), 9ms (CIFAR10), 69ms (CIFAR100), 0.4s (CUB200), 0.8s (Caltech256). \n- [Revisions] We added a discussion on run-times in Appendix E.2.\n\n\n<< (3a) Would be nice if attacks were explained a bit more. Specifically, how are attacks tested? >>\n- Thanks for the suggestion. The attacks are evaluated on a common held-out victim test set. For a fair head-to-head comparison, the test set during evaluation is common to both the victim\u2019s model and attacker\u2019s stolen model.\n- [Revisions] Attacks are further clarified in the revised manuscript by (i) a visualization of attacker, defender and evaluation metrics in Appendix Figure A1; and (ii) extending our existing discussion on attack model details in Appendix D.\n\n\n<< (3b) Does the attacker have knowledge about the class-label space of the victim? >>\n- All attackers are aware of the *number* of output classes of the victim model. As for the *semantics* of output class labels: (i) {knockoff}: does not require this knowledge; and (ii) {jbda, jb-self, jb-top3}: has the knowledge.\n- [Revisions] We clarified this in our existing discussion on attack models in Appendix E.\n\n\n<< (3c) If the attacker is trained with some synthetic data/other dataset, do you then freeze the feature extractor and train a linear layer to validate on the victim\u2019s test set? >>\n- No. We evaluate the attacker\u2019s stolen model as-is on the victim\u2019s test set. To further elaborate, we: (a) construct a transfer dataset (image-posterior pairs, where image = synthetic/other) using the attack strategies; (b) train the attack model $F_A$ using the transfer set; and (c) evaluate $F_A$ on the victim\u2019s test set. Note that (a) and (b) are intertwined for some attacks.\n- [Revisions] We updated our manuscript to clarify this in Sec. 5 \u201cEffectiveness of Attacks\u201d and provided additional details in Appendix D \u201cEvaluating attacks.''"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2438/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2438/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["orekondy@mpi-inf.mpg.de", "schiele@mpi-inf.mpg.de", "fritz@cispa.saarland"], "title": "Prediction Poisoning: Towards Defenses Against DNN Model Stealing Attacks", "authors": ["Tribhuvanesh Orekondy", "Bernt Schiele", "Mario Fritz"], "pdf": "/pdf/54a327e15441fc15cf63a461ce8a9da3b5e51713.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose the first approach that can resist DNN model stealing/extraction attacks", "abstract": "High-performance Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed in many real-world applications e.g., cloud prediction APIs.

I\u2019m concerned that this may indicate that the attackers are generally weak and this threat model may not be very serious. Overall, I\u2019m skeptical of this threat model - the attackers require a very large number of queries, and don\u2019t achieve great results on difficult datasets. Including results on a dataset like ImageNet would be nice. \n2) How long does this optimization procedure take? It seems possibly unreasonable for the victim to implement this defense if it significantly lengthens the time to return outputs of queries. \n3) Although this is a defense paper, it would be nice if the attacks were explained a bit more. Specifically, how are these attacks tested? You use the validation set, but does the attacker have knowledge about the class-label space of the victim? If the attacker trained with some synthetic data/other dataset, do you then freeze the feature extractor and train a linear layer to validate on the victim\u2019s test set? It seems like this is discussed in the context of the victim in the \u201cAttack Models\u201d subsection, but it\u2019s unclear what\u2019s happening with the attacker. \n4) It would be nice to see an angular histogram plot for a model where the perturbed labels were not crafted with knowledge of this model\u2019s parameters - i.e. transfer the proposed defense to a blackbox attacker and produce this same plot. This would motivate the defense more. \n\n\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2438/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2438/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["orekondy@mpi-inf.mpg.de", "schiele@mpi-inf.mpg.de", "fritz@cispa.saarland"], "title": "Prediction Poisoning: Towards Defenses Against DNN Model Stealing Attacks", "authors": ["Tribhuvanesh Orekondy", "Bernt Schiele", "Mario Fritz"], "pdf": "/pdf/54a327e15441fc15cf63a461ce8a9da3b5e51713.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose the first approach that can resist DNN model stealing/extraction attacks", "abstract": "High-performance Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed in many real-world applications e.g., cloud prediction APIs.
