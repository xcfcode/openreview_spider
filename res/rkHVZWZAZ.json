Experiments on Atari games show a significant improvement over prioritized dueling networks in particular, and competitive performance compared to Rainbow, at a fraction of the training time.\n\nThere are definitely several interesting and meaningful contributions in this submission, and I like the motivations behind them. They are not groundbreaking (essentially extending existing techniques) but are still very relevant to current RL research.\n\nUnfortunately I also see it as a step back in terms of comparison to other algorithms. The recent Rainbow paper finally established a long overdue clear benchmark on Atari. We have seen with the \u00ab Deep Reinforcement Learning that Matters \u00bb paper how important (and difficult) it is to properly compare algorithms on deep RL problems. I assume that this submission was mostly written before Rainbow came out, and that comparisons to Rainbow were hastily added just before the ICLR deadline: this would explain why they are quite limited, but in my opinion it remains a major issue, which is the main reason why I am advocating for rejection.\n\nMore precisely, focusing on the comparison to Rainbow which is the main competitor here, my concerns are the following:\n- There is almost no discussion on the differences between Reactor and Rainbow (actually the paper lacks a \u00ab related work \u00bb section). In particular Rainbow also uses a version of distributional multi-step, which as far as I can tell may not be as well motivated (from a mathematical point of view) as the one in this submission (since it does not correct for the \u00ab off-policyness \u00bb of the replay data), but still seems to work well on Atari.\n- Rainbow is not distributed. This was a deliberate choice by its authors to focus on algorithmic comparisons. However, it seems to me that it could benefit from a parallel training scheme like Reactor\u2019s. I believe a comparison between Reactor and Rainbow needs to either have them both parallelized or none of them (especially for a comparison on time efficiency like in Fig. 2)\n- Rainbow uses the traditional feedforward DQN architecture while Reactor uses a recurrent network. It is not clear to which extent this has an impact on the results.\n- Rainbow was stopped at 200M steps, at which point it seems to be overall superior to Reactor at 200M steps. The results as presented here emphasize the superiority of Reactor at 500M steps, but a proper comparison would require Rainbow results at 500M steps as well.\n\nIn addition, although I found most of the paper to be clear enough, some parts were confusing to me, in particular:\n- \u00ab multi-step distributional Bellman operator \u00bb in 3.2: not clear exactly what the target distribution is. If I understand correctly this is the same as the Rainbow extension, but this link is not mentioned.\n- 3.4.1 (network architecture): a simple diagram in the appendix would make it much easier to understand (Table 3 is still hard to read because it is not clear which layers are connected together)\n- 3.3 (prioritized sequence replay): again a visual illustration of the partitioning scheme would in my opinion help clarify the approach\n\nA few minor points to conclude:\n- In eq. 6, 7 and the rest of this section, A does not depend (directly) on theta so it should probably be removed to avoid confusion. Note also that using the letter A may not be best since A is used to denote an action in 3.1.\n- In 3.1: \u00ab Let us assume that for the chosen action A we have access to an estimate R(A) of Q\u03c0(A) \u00bb => \u00ab unbiased estimate \u00bb\n- In last equation of p.5 it is not clear what q_i^n is\n- There is a lambda missing on p.6 in the equation showing that alphas are non-negative on average, just before the min\n- In the equation above eq. 12 there is a sum over \u00ab i=1 \u00bb\n- That same equation ends with some h_z_i that are not defined\n- In Fig. 2 (left) for Reactor we see one worker using large batches and another one using many threads. This is confusing.\n- 3.3 mentions sequences of length 32 but 3.4 says length 33.\n- 3.3 says tree operations are in O(n ln(n)) but it should be O(ln(n))\n- At very end of 3.3 it is not clear what \u00ab total variation \u00bb is.\n- In 3.4 please specify the frequency at which the learner thread downloads shared parameters and uploads updates\n- Caption of Fig. 3 talks about \u00ab changing the number of workers \u00bb for the left plot while it is in the right plot\n- The explanation on what the variants of Reactor (ND and 500M) mean comes after results are shown in Fig. 2.\n- Section 4 starts with Fig. 3 without explaining what the task is, how performance is measured, etc. It also claims that Distributional Retrace helps while this is not the case in Fig. 3 (I realize it is explained afterwards, but it is confusing when reading the sentence \u00ab We can also see... \u00bb). Finally it says priorization is the most important component while the beta-LOO ablation seems to perform just the same.\n- Footnote 3 should say it is 200M observations except for Reactor 500M\n- End of 4.1: \u00ab The algorithms that we compare Reactor against are \u00bb => missing ACER, A3C and Rainbow\n- There are two references for \u00ab Sample efficient actor-critic with experience replay \u00bb\n- I do not see the added benefit of the Elo computation. It seems to convey essentially the same information as average rank.\n\nAnd a few typos:\n- Just above 2.1.3: \u00ab increasing \u00bb => increasingly\n- In 3.1: \u00ab where V is a baseline that depend \u00bb => depends\n- p.7: \u00ab hight \u00bb => high, and \u00ab to all other sequences \u00bb => of all other sequences\n- Double parentheses in Bellemare citation at beginning of section 4\n- Several typos in appendix (too many to list)\n\nNote: I did not have time to carefully read Appendix 6.3 (contextual priority tree)\n\nEdit after revision: bumped score from 5 to 7 because (1) authors did many improvements to the paper, and (2) their explanations shed light on some of my concerns", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "The Reactor: A fast and sample-efficient Actor-Critic agent for  Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "In this work we present a new agent architecture, called Reactor, which combines multiple algorithmic and architectural contributions to produce an agent with higher sample-efficiency than Prioritized Dueling DQN (Wang et al., 2016) and Categorical DQN (Bellemare et al., 2017), while giving better run-time performance than A3C (Mnih et al., 2016).

The different modules are integrated\nwell and the empirical results are very promising. The experiments (though limited to Atari) are well carried out and\nthe evaluation is performed on both sample efficiency and training time.\n\nPros:\n1. Nice integration of several recent improvements in deep RL, along with a few novel tricks to improve training.\n2. The empirical results on 57 Atari games are impressive, in terms of final scores as well as real-time training speed.\n\nCons:\n1. Reactor is still less sample-efficient than Rainbow, with significantly lower scores after 200M frames. While the\nreactor trains much faster, it does use more parallel compute, so the comparison with Rainbow on wall clock time is\n not entirely fair.

Please note that Rainbow was put on Arxiv only three weeks before the ICLR submission deadline. However we have already included experimental comparisons with Rainbow, both in the form of presenting the learning curves and final evaluations. We will add a more in-depth comparison with Rainbow and discussion of related work in the appendix.\n\n>> I believe a comparison between Reactor and Rainbow needs to either have them both parallelized or none of them.\n\nRainbow works on GPUs, Reactor works on CPUs. A single GPU is not equivalent to a single CPU. Parallelizing Rainbow is out of the scope of this work. First, because this was not the focus of our work. Second, because it would be a non-trivial task potentially worth publication on its own. More generally, the same parallelization argument would also apply to comparisons between A3C and DQN.\n\n>> Rainbow uses the traditional feedforward DQN architecture while Reactor uses a recurrent network. It is not clear to which extent this has an impact on the results.\n\n\nThere are many differences between Rainbow and Reactor: 1) LSTM vs frame stacking, 2) actor-critic vs value-based algorithm 3) beta-LOO vs Q-learning, 4) Retrace vs n-step learning, 5) sequence prioritization vs transition prioritization, 6) entropy bonus vs noisy networks. Reactor is not an incremental improvement of Rainbow and is a completely different algorithm. This makes it impractical to compare on a component-by-component basis. For the most important contributions we performed an ablation study within Reactor\u2019s framework, but naturally we can not ablate every architectural choice that we have made.\n\n>> Rainbow was stopped at 200M steps, at which point it seems to be overall superior to Reactor at 200M steps.\n\nThis is not correct. In the human-starts evaluation Reactor significantly outperforms Rainbow at 200M steps. In the no-op-starts evaluation Rainbow significantly outperforms Reactor at 200M steps. Both Reactor and Rainbow were trained with 30 random no-op-starts. Their evaluation with 30 random human starts shows how well each algorithm generalizes to new initial conditions. We would argue that the issues of generalization here are similar to those seen between training and testing error in supervised learning. We thus show that Reactor generalizes better to these unseen starting states.\n\n>> (network architecture): a simple diagram in the appendix would make it much easier to understand\n\nWe will add the diagram to the supplementary material.\n\n>> again a visual illustration of the partitioning scheme would in my opinion help clarify the approach\n\nWe will add an illustration to the supplementary material. We will also correct all other typos mentioned in the review.

We make no claim that Reactor uses overall less computational operations to train an agent. Nevertheless, we believe that having a fast algorithm in terms of wall time is important because of the potential to shorten experimentation time.
