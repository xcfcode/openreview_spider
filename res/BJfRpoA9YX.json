Since the encoder also predicts \\hat{y} it can be used for classification and the paper shows competitive results on this task, apart from the attribute manipulation task. Reviewers had raised points about model complexity and connections to prior works which the authors have addressed and the paper is on the borderline based on the scores. \n\nThough none of the reviewers explicitly pointed out the similarity of the paper with Fader networks (Lample et al., 2017), the adversarial setup for getting attribute invariant 'z' is exactly same as in Fader networks, as also pointed out in an anonymous comment. The only difference is that encoder in the current paper also predicts the attribute itself (\\hat{y}), which is not the case in Fader n/w, and hence the encoder can be used as a classifier as well (authors have also mentioned and discussed this difference in their response). However, the core idea of the paper as outlined in the title of the paper, ie, using adversarial loss for information factorization, is very similar to this earlier work, which diminishes the originality of the work. \n\nWith the borderline review scores, the paper can go in either of the half-spaces (accept/reject) but I am hesitant to recommend an \"accept\" due to limited originality of the approach.

The only thing is that quantity is intuitive but it is not immediately linked explicitly to a mutual information estimation. If you have any formal insight how your approach would link to that that would be great addition to the paper. \n\nAnother approach would have been using MINE:\n\nmin_{phi} max_{T}    E_{(x,y) joint }T(E_{phi}(x), y) - log (E_{x,y random } T(E_{phi}(x), y) )\n\nthis would be l_aux that one would add.\n\nI am not asking to baseline this now in the current paper - I acknowledge the novelty of your proposal - but this would have been much more linked to  information based factorization as the title suggests.

Based on these suggestions we have improved the related work section of our paper by adding the following:\n\n\"Finally, while we use labelled data to learn representations, we acknowledge that there an many other models that learn factored, or disentangled, representations from unlabelled data including several VAE variants \\citep{higgins2016beta, kumar2018variational}.\"\n\nWe would also like to draw the reviewer's attention to the six instances where we had already cited InfoGAN in our paper and the one instance of beta-VAE.\n\nBelow is one quoted example where we investigated the inclusion of a component of our model that was inspired by a similar approach in InfoGAN (Section 4.1, page 6): \n\n\"Using \\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{class} does not provide any clear benefit. We explored the effect of including this term since a similar approach had been proposed in the GAN literature \\cite{chen2016infogan,odena2016conditional} for conditional image synthesis (rather than attribute editing). To the best of our knowledge, this approach has not been used in the VAE literature. This term is intended to maximise I(x,y) by providing a gradient containing label information to the decoder, however, it does not contribute to the factorization of attribute information, y, from \\hat{z}.\"\n\nThough we have cited beta-VAE (Section 4.3, page 8), we did not make a direct comparison to beta-VAE since it is trained without labelled data and a classifier is trained post-hoc; this is similar to the DIP-VAE (an improvement on the beta-VAE). Instead, we chose to compare our results to a state of the art classification model, since it outperforms all other methods, including those whose objective is to learn disentangled representations. For the sake of completeness, below is the comparison of our classification results (which are competitive with state of the art) and those reported in the DIP-VAE paper:\n\n\tLabel\t\t|\tDIP-VAE\t\t|\tours\t|\n-\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBlack hair\t\t|\t80.6 \t\t|\t89.8 \t|\nBlonde hair\t\t|\t91.9  \t        | \t97.2 \t|\nHeavy Makeup\t|\t81.5 \t\t|\t92.8 \t|\nWavy hair\t\t|\t71.5. \t\t| \t84.5 \t|\nLipstick. \t\t|\t84.7 \t\t|\t94.4 \t|\n\nAs is clear, our model strongly out-performs DIP-VAE, which is why we did not explicitly compare with these results in our paper, and rather chose to compare to a state of the art classification model.

The decoder reconstructs images from \\hat{y}\nand \\hat{z} concatenated together. A GAN style discriminator attempts to distinguish the \ndecoded image from the original input image as real or fake, allowing the decoder to produce \nhigher quality decoded images. An auxiliary network A attempts to classify the face attribute y\nfrom the class agnostic features \\hat{z}, with the idea being that the encoder should try to produce \n\\hat{z} vectors from which the class cannot be predicted. An additional classifier is trained\nusing a classification loss \\hat{L}_{class} on the encoded reconstructed image, the use of which \nI don't understand.\n\nI think additional work on section 2.5 through section 3 would be helpful to improve clarity.\nAs one example, \"y\" is unnecessarily overloaded: y denotes a specific attribute, \\hat{y}\ndenotes a latent vector that is intended to not be class agnostic, \\tilde{y} denotes the\nprediction of an auxiliary network on an intended class-agnostic latent vector \\hat{z} of\nthe presence of the original attribute y, and \\hat{\\hat{y}} denotes the non agnostic latent\nvector achieved by passing the decoded image back through the encoder.\n\nThis notational complexity is compounded by the fact that a number of steps in the method are\nnot well motivated in the text, and left to the reader to understand their purpose. For example,\nthe authors state that \"we incorporate a classification model into the encoder so that our model may\neasily be used to perform classification tasks.\" What does this mean? In the diagram (Figure 1),\nwhere is this classification model? Why in the GAN loss is there a term that compares the\nfake loss with the result of classifying a decoded z vector? Is this z \\hat{z}, or a latent vector\ndrawn from a distribution p(z)? If it is the former, how does this term differ from the second\nterm in the GAN loss. If it is the latter, then shouldn't it be concatenated with some y in order to\nbe used as input to the decoder D_{\\theta}?\n\nWhy is it important to extract \\hat{\\hat{y}} from \\hat{x}? In the paper you state that the loss\n\"provides a gradient containing label information to the decoder,\" but why can't we use the known label y\nof the original input x to ensure that the encoder and decoder preserve this information if it is used as \\hat{y}?\nLater in the paper, you explicitly state that \\hat{\\mathcal{L}_{class}} \"does not provide any clear benefit.\"\nIf that is the case, then you should ideally include it neither in the model nor in the paper. If it was\nincluded primarily because previous models included it, then I would recommend you introduce its use\nin a background section on Bao et al., 2017 rather than including it in your model description with an\nexplanation like \"so that our model may easily be used to perform classification tasks.\"\n\nUltimately, this last point brings us to a good summary of my concerns with the model: the inclusion\nof too many moving parts, some of which the authors explicitly say later on provide no benefit.\n\nMoving on to experimental results, I think this is another area where I have a few concerns. First, in\nFigure 2, the authors argue that your model is \"better for 6 out of 10 attributes\" and comparable results for most others. The authors include a gap of 0.1 in the \"Gray_hair\" category as \"better\" but label a gap of 0.5\nin the Black hair category as \"comparable.\" I think results in several of the categories are sufficiently close\nthat error bars would be necessary to draw actual conclusions. If \"better\" were to mean \"better by 0.5\" for example,\nthen the authors method is better on 4 tasks (smiling, blonde hair, heavy makeup, mustache) and worse on 3 (black hair, brown hair, wavy hair).\n\nWith respect to the actual attribute editing, my main concern here is a lack of comparison to models other than Bao et al., despite the fact that face attribute changing is an exhaustively studied task. A number of papers like Perarnau et al., 2016, Upchurch et al., 2017, Lample et al., 2017 and others study this task from machine learning perspectives, and in some cases can perform photorealistic image attribute editing without complicated machinery on megapixel face\nimages. At least the images in Figure 3 and 4 are substantially downsampled from the typical resolution found in the Celeba dataset, suggesting that there was some failure mode on full resolution images.\n\n----\n\nEdit: I've reviewed the authors' addressing my concerns in their paper and am happy to increase my rating as a result.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper851/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Information Factorization", "abstract": "We propose a novel generative model architecture designed to learn representations for images that factor out a single attribute from the rest of the representation.

Of the three papers you propose (Upchurch et al., Lample et al., Perarnau et al.) none of them are motivated by representation learning and only Perarnau et al. proposes an encoder that outputs a representation that is sufficient to describe an input image.\n\nAs per your suggestion, we have included a comparison with IcGAN (Perarnau et al.) in Tables 1 and 3, taking values from Lample et al. We compare to IcGAN since they also train on images that are 64x64. Our model without residual layers obtains that same reconstruction error as IcGAN, 0.028, while our model with residual layers achieves a much lower reconstruction error, 0.011. Lample et al. also suggests that the IcGAN only successfully edits attributes (Smiling --> Not Smiling) 9.9% of the time, while our model (with residual layers) successfully edits them at least 98% of the time. Our model without residual layers edits successfully edits them 81% of the time.\n\n[Please note that there is a typo in the Lample et al. paper, the authors write RMSE rather than MSE. We have contacted the authors and they confirm that this was a typo and they were in fact reporting MSE.]\n\nThank you for helping us to improve our paper with additional comparisons to related work."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper851/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper851/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper851/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Information Factorization", "abstract": "We propose a novel generative model architecture designed to learn representations for images that factor out a single attribute from the rest of the representation.

As one example, \"y\" is unnecessarily overloaded: y denotes a specific attribute, \\hat{y} denotes a latent vector that is intended to not be class agnostic, \\tilde{y} denotes the prediction of an auxiliary network on an intended class-agnostic latent vector \\hat{z} of the presence of the original attribute y, and \\hat{\\hat{y}} denotes the non agnostic latent vector achieved by passing the decoded image back through the encoder.\n\n[Authors]\nWe believe our notation is consistent, correct and necessary, and this reviewer (as well as the others) have understood our model. We provide a clear diagram as well as an algorithm and descriptions in the text.\n\n[Reviewer]\nThis notational complexity is compounded by the fact that a number of steps in the method are not well motivated in the text, and left to the reader to understand their purpose. \n\n[Authors]\nOur core contribution is the introduction of an auxiliary network for factorizing attribute information from the rest of the latent code. This is communicated clearly in Section 3.2 and the reviewer appears to understand the * motivation * for the auxiliary network well:\n\nReviewers own words: \"An auxiliary network A attempts to classify the face attribute y from the class agnostic features \\hat{z}, with the idea being that the encoder should try to produce \\hat{z} vectors from which the class cannot be predicted.\"\n\nWe incorporate our network into a pre-existing model, the VAE-GAN which is also communicated clearly in Section 2. In Section 2 we introduce VAEs and GANs, and explain the benefits of combining the two in Section 2.3 'Best Of Both GAN And VAE'. Finally, we also explain conditional GANs. The VAE, GAN and VAE-GAN are previous related works, motivated by their respective authors.\n\n\n[Reviewer]\nFor example, the authors state that \"we incorporate a classification model into the encoder so that our model may easily be used to perform classification tasks.\" What does this mean? In the diagram (Figure 1), where is this classification model?\n\n[Authors]\nWe would like the thank the reviewer for raising this concern. To avoid confusion, we have amended the paper in Section 3.1 to read as follows:\n\"Additionally, the encoder also acts as a classifier, outputting an attribute vector, \\hat{y}, along side a latent vector, \\hat{z}.\"\n\nThere is no separate classification network. The encoder, which takes an image, x, as input, is split in two, outputting a latent vector \\hat{z} and an attribute vector \\hat{y}. The model is trained such that the attribute vector may be used to classify an input image, x, therefore the encoder is also a classifier.\n\nThis is described in Section 2.4 (quote from our paper):\n\u201cthe encoder outputs both a latent vector, \\hat{z}, and an attribute vector, \\hat{y}\u201d\n\nOur point here, is that rather than adding a separate classifier that takes reconstructed images as input, as is done in Bao et al. (illustrated in our paper in Figure 1(b)), we incorporate the classifier into the encoder, E_{y, \\phi}, (illustrated in Figure 1(a)) which allows our model to be used both for image attribute editing and classification. This also avoids the need to train an entirely separate classifier network. We are essentially killing two birds with one stone in this proposed approach.\n\n[Reviewer]\nWhy in the GAN loss is there a term that compares the fake loss with the result of classifying a decoded z vector?\n\n[Authors]\nThere are three terms in the GAN loss. In the first, the discriminator, C_\\chi, is applied to real samples. In the second and third term the discriminator is applied to fake images. There are two sources of fake images; (1) the reconstructed images, D_\\theta(E_\\phi(x)), and (2) synthetic images, D_\\theta(E_{\\phi,z}(x), y). The GAN loss is similar to the one used by Bao et al. (see Line 9 of Algorithm 1 of Bao et al.). \n\n[Reviewer]\nIs this z \\hat{z}, or a latent vector drawn from a distribution p(z)?\n\n[Authors]\nBy definition z is drawn from the prior, p(z), this is described in Section 2.3 when describing VAE-GAN; \u201clatent variable z, which is drawn from a specified random distribution, p(z)\u201d. This is also illustrated in line 5 of Algorithm 1.

In the paper you state that the loss \"provides a gradient containing label information to the decoder,\" but why can't we use the known label y of the original input x to ensure that the encoder and decoder preserve this information if it is used as \\hat{y}?\n\n[Authors]\nL_{class} ensures that \\hat{y} contains label information, but this loss is not dependant on the parameters of the decoder and, therefore, cannot be used to update the decoder. Note that there is a precendence for computing \\hat{\\hat{y}}: the Bao et al. model also use it to provide label information to the decoder. We could have placed an additional classifier at the output of the decoder, as is done by Bao et al., to compute \\hat{\\hat{y}}. However, rather than introducing and training another classifier, we made use of our encoder which is already able to predict labels, thus we pass the reconstructed image back through the encoder. \n\n[Reviewer]\nLater in the paper, you explicitly state that \\hat{\\mathcal{L}_{class}} \"does not provide any clear benefit.\" If that is the case, then you should ideally include it neither in the model nor in the paper. If it was included primarily because previous models included it, then I would recommend you introduce its use in a background section on Bao et al., 2017 rather than including it in your model description with an explanation like \"so that our model may easily be used to perform classification tasks.\"\n\n[Authors]\nThe explanation for using \\hat{L}_{class} is not \"so that our model may easily be used to perform classification tasks.\", it is because  (Section 3.1) it \"provides a gradient containing label information to the decoder\".\n\nWe chose to investigate the need for \\hat{L}_{class} because other works had proposed a similar idea - that is to train a classifier on reconstructed samples \\cite{odena2016conditional, bao2017cvae}. We did not know a priori that this component would be redundant, and only discovered this following investigation. Indeed, it is a useful and relevant finding of our work for the representation learning community. Rather than simply leaving this component out of our model, we chose to perform an extensive ablation study to provide evidence for this.\n\nWe would like to make a final note concerning the quotation \"so that our model may easily be used to perform classification tasks\". This was simply referring to the fact that the encoder outputs an attribute label vector, \\hat{y}, and hence may be used as a classifier. As mentioned above, we have amended this section of the text (Section 3.1) to read:\n\n\"Additionally, the encoder also acts as a classifier, outputting an attribute vector, \\hat{y}, along side a latent vector, \\hat{z}.\"\n\n[Reviewer]\nUltimately, this last point brings us to a good summary of my concerns with the model: the inclusion of too many moving parts, some of which the authors explicitly say later on provide no benefit.\n\n[Authors]\nSince our model is no more complex than that of Bao et al., an accepted paper, we assert that this is not grounds for rejection. The original Bao et al. model consists of 6 components (see Equation 7 of Bao et al.). There is only one term in our loss function that following investigation, we considered to be redundant. Rather than just leaving this out, we performed an extensive ablation study to provide evidence for this.\n\nThe source of the confusion seems to be summed up by the question, \"where is this classification model?\". While the reviewer has understood the core contributions of our paper, this misunderstanding has lead to most of the questions above. Simply, the encoder acts as a classifier because it predicts both an attribute, \\hat{y}, and a latent vector, \\hat{z}. We have amended our paper to make this more clear, adding the following to Section 3.1:\n\n\"Additionally, the encoder also acts as a classifier, outputting an attribute vector, \\hat{y}, along side a latent vector, \\hat{z}.\"\n\nCrucially, the encoder in our model may be used as a classifier, unlike in other attribute editing models and we demonstrate that our classifier achieves results that are competitive with state of the art classification results."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper851/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper851/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper851/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Information Factorization", "abstract": "We propose a novel generative model architecture designed to learn representations for images that factor out a single attribute from the rest of the representation.

First, in Figure 2, the authors argue that your model is \"better for 6 out of 10 attributes\" and comparable results for most others. The authors include a gap of 0.1 in the \"Gray_hair\" category as \"better\" but label a gap of 0.5 in the Black hair category as \"comparable.\" I think results in several of the categories are sufficiently close hat error bars would be necessary to draw actual conclusions. If \"better\" were to mean \"better by 0.5\" for example, then the authors method is better on 4 tasks (smiling, blonde hair, heavy makeup, mustache) and worse on 3 (black hair, brown hair, wavy hair).\n\n[Authors]\nThe quotation \"better for 6 out of 10 attributes\" is no where to be found in our paper. The paper read \"outperformed for 6 out of 10\". However, we understand the reviewer's concerns and agree that the values are close. For this reason, throughout the paper we have stressed that the results are competitive. We have amended the text in the results section to reflect this also:\n\n\"Results in Figure \\ref{fig:state_of_art} show that our model is highly competitive with a state of the art facial attribute classifier \\cite{zhuang2018multi}. We outperformed by more than 1% on $2$ out of $10$ categories, underperformed by more than 1% on only $1$ category and remained competitive with all other attributes.\"\n\n[Reviewer]\nWith respect to the actual attribute editing, my main concern here is a lack of comparison to models other than Bao et al., despite the fact that face attribute changing is an exhaustively studied task. A number of papers like Perarnau et al., 2016, Upchurch et al., 2017, Lample et al., 2017 and others study this task from machine learning perspectives, and in some cases can perform photorealistic image attribute editing without complicated machinery on megapixel face images. \n\n[Authors]\nWe would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out additional related work, this has helped us to improve the related work section of our paper.\n\nThe focus of our work has been to learn a representation that factors attribute information from the rest of the representation. We test this factorization process in two ways: (1) attribute editing and (2) attribute classification.\n\nPerarnau et al., 2016 is similar to our model without the L_{aux}, \\hat{L}_{class} or \\hat{L}_KL. While Perarnau et al. does perform image attribute editing, they do not present classification results.\n\nThe method proposed by Upchurch et al., 2017 requires a reverse mapping procedure which is very computationally intensive, applying gradient descent in image space. Additionally, the focus of the work by Upchurch et al., 2017 is not on representation learning and may not be used for image classification. \n\nIn our paper, the goal is to learn representations for images. For this goal, our encoder network needs to encode more than just the attribute-invariant information, but also the attribute information itself. The encoder of the Fader Network proposed by Lample et al., 2017 predicts only the attribute-invariant information, while our encoder network predicts both attribute-invariant information and the attribute. This makes our model not only suitable for attribute editing, but it also makes our model suitable for classification. Ultimately, developping models capabable of more than just one task are exciting and important steps forward for the field. \n\nWe have updated our paper to include references to Perarnau et al., 2016, Upchurch et al., 2017 and Lample et al., 2017, as per the reviewer's suggestions, to strengthen the related work section of our paper.\n\n[Reviewer]\nAt least the images in Figure 3 and 4 are substantially downsampled from the typical resolution found in the Celeba dataset, suggesting that there was some failure mode on full resolution images.\n\n[Authors]\nWe use the standard image size, 64x64, and these were used directly without down-sampling. Unfortunately, some resolution was unintentionally lost in Figure 4, when annotated with \\hat{y}=0 and \\hat{y}=1. We have rectified this and have updated the image with a higher resolution version. However, images in Figure 3 were not affected and we are not aware of any failure modes.\n\nWe use images of size 64x64, rather than larger image sizes, (a) to make our ablation study more computationally feasible and (b) to make our results more reproducible by those with modest resources. We believe that this is generally good for the field.\n\nWe provide extensive quantitative results which show (a) that the attribute manipulation is reliable and (b) that we achieve a low reconstruction error. Additionally, our classification results are further evidence that our model does indeed factor attribute information from the rest of the latent vector, which is our objective."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper851/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper851/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper851/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Information Factorization", "abstract": "We propose a novel generative model architecture designed to learn representations for images that factor out a single attribute from the rest of the representation.

Most of our components are also less complex because losses are computed on network outputs rather than on features extracted from multiple intermediate layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that terms in our loss function, \\hat{L}_{class}, may be excluded, making our model less complex.\n\nThroughout our work we have been intentionally explicit and detailed about the costs we use. This may have resulted in the complexity of our approach being excessively emphasised, however, it is merely a thorough presentation of our idea, intended to make the work reproducible. Complexity appears to be the reviewer\u2019s main concern, however, since our paper is no more complex than papers previously accepted, we assert that our paper, detailing a novel approach, should be accepted. \n\n\n[2] Comparison to related work:\nThe focus of our work has been to learn a representation that factors attribute information from the rest of the representation.

For example, the loss of in (6) actually includes 6 components (5 are from L_enc) and 4~5 tuning hyper-parameters. \n\n[Authors]\nWe appreciate that our model has several components, however, the original Bao et al. model also consists of 6 components (see Equation 7 of Bao et al.) along with 4 hyper-parameters. Since our model is no more complex than that of Bao et al. \u2014 an accepted paper \u2014 we assert that this should not be seen as a weakness of our paper.\n\nDespite having a few hyper-parameters, our model does not require extensive hyper-parameter tuning. However, to obtain high fidelity reconstructions it is necessary to select low values of delta (the weight on the L_gan term) and alpha (the weight on the KL term).\n\n[Reviewer]\nThe L_gan also includes 3 parts. \n\n[Authors]\nThe L_gan term is similar to the one used by Bao et al, which also has three components. Note also that the GAN loss is intended purely to improve the visual quality of the samples. Our contribution is still valid without L_gan, since our main contribution is the introduction of an auxiliary network, A_\\psi, and the loss, L_aux.\n\n[Reviewer]\nThe reason of adding gan loss lacks either theoretical or empirical analysis. So as L_KL.\n\n[Authors]\nThe use of the gan loss and the KL loss are motivated already by Bao et al. in the VAE-GAN which we introduce in Section 2.\n\nAccording to our understanding of the GAN literature, it is generally accepted that GAN loss improves the visual quality of samples. Experimentally, we found this to be true for our model also.  Similarly, regularisation of the latent space helps with generalisation to test samples. We found that our model performed better with a small amount of KL regularisation than without any, and that models trained without regularisation overfit and had very poor reconstruction (MSE=0.0381). \n\nInterestingly, when our model is trained without a GAN loss or KL loss, it is still able to edit attributes with high accuracy, however, the visual quality of samples is poor. This shows that the attribute information is still factored from the rest of the latent representation, which is the main contribution of our work. \n\n[Reviewer]\nIn addition, the second term in L_gan is unnecessary since you already have a reconstruction loss. It also make it to be unclear what we obtain if the equilibrium of the GAN objective achieved.\n\n[Authors]\nWe use a similar L_gan to that used by Bao et al. Please refer to Algorithm 1, line 9 of Bao et al. In the cVAE-GAN there are two sources of `fake' images, (a) reconstructed images, D_\\theta(E_\\phi(x)) and (b) sampled images, D_\\theta(z), z ~ p(z), where p(z) is the prior. This is why there are three terms in the GAN loss. Reconstruction loss alone is often not enough to achieve high quality reconstruction.\n\nWe explicitly wrote out the GAN loss as three terms for clarity, but the GAN loss could still be written as two terms, where C_\\chi is the discriminator:\nE_p_real(x) log C_\\chi(x) + E_p_fake(x) log (1 - C_\\chi(x)), where sampling x_fake ~ p_fake(x), includes both reconstructed images and sampled images. This is the same as the original GAN loss."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper851/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper851/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper851/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Information Factorization", "abstract": "We propose a novel generative model architecture designed to learn representations for images that factor out a single attribute from the rest of the representation.

We would appreciate it if the reviewer could please let us know what they had in mind when making this connection?\n\nWe appreciate the additional references that the reviewer proposed, two of which we had already included (beta-VAE and InfoGAN). Based on these very helpful and constructive suggestions we have improved the the related work section of our paper, by adding the following:\n\n\"Finally, while we use labelled data to learn representations, we acknowledge that there are many other models that learn factored, or disentangled, representations from unlabelled data including several VAE variants \\citep{higgins2016beta, kumar2018variational}. The beta-VAE \\cite{higgins2016beta} objective is similar to the information bottleneck \\cite{burgess2018understanding}, minimizing mutual information, I(x;z), which forces the model to exploit regularities in the data and learn a disentangled representation. In our approach we perform a more direct, supervised, factorisation of the latent space, using a mini-max objective, which has the effect of approximately minimizing I(z;y).\"\n\nWe agree that disentanglement has indeed been studied before, however, when making comparisons we have focused on comparing to models that, like ours, make use of labelled data. When comparing our model to previous work, we chose the most challenging benchmark for facial attribute classification, not just those that use disentangled representations. Those that use disentangled representations perform worse than this benchmark. Our classification results are highly competitive with this benchmark.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, our work is the * only * approach to learn disentangled representations which enable image attribute manipulation and simultaneously achieves competitive results with state of the art models on image classification. We believe the demonstrated versatility and novelty of this work are strong grounds for acceptance.\n\nAgain, we would like to sincerely thank the reviewer for helping us to improve our paper with their constructive suggestions."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper851/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper851/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper851/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Information Factorization", "abstract": "We propose a novel generative model architecture designed to learn representations for images that factor out a single attribute from the rest of the representation.

A single object may have many attributes which when altered do not change the identity of the object itself. Consider the human face; the identity of a particular person is independent of whether or not they happen to be wearing glasses. The attribute of wearing glasses can be changed without changing the identity of the person. However, the ability to manipulate and alter image attributes without altering the object identity is not a trivial task. Here, we are interested in learning a representation of the image that separates the identity of an object (such as a human face) from an attribute (such as 'wearing glasses'). We demonstrate the success of our factorization approach by using the learned representation to synthesize the same face with and without a chosen attribute. We refer to this specific synthesis process as image attribute manipulation.
