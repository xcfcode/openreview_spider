(1) They introduce the framework of softmax Q-distribution estimation, through which they are able to interpret the role the payoff distribution plays in RAML. Specifically, the softmax Q-distribution serves as a smooth approximation to the Bayes decision boundary. The RAML approximately estimates the softmax Q-distribution, and thus approximates the Bayes decision rule. (2) Algorithmically, they further propose softmax Q-distribution maximum likelihood (SQDML) which improves RAML by achieving the exact Bayes decision boundary asymptotically. (3) Through one experiment using synthetic data on multi-class classi\ufb01cation and one using real data on image captioning, they show that SQDML is consistently as good or better than RAML on the task-speci\ufb01c metrics that is desired to optimize. \n\nI found the first contribution is sound, and it reasonably explains why RAML achieves better performance when measured by a specific metric. Given a reward function, one can define the Bayes decision rule. The softmax Q-distribution (Eqn. 12) is defined to be the softmax approximation of the deterministic Bayes rule. The authors show that the RAML can be explained by moving the expectation out of the nonlinear function and replacing it with empirical expectation (Eqn. 17). Of course, the moving-out is biased but the replacing is unbiased. \n\nThe second contribution is partially valid, although I doubt how much improvement one can get from SQDML. The authors define the empirical Q-distribution by replacing the expectation in Eqn. 12 with empirical expectation (Eqn. 15). In fact, this step can result in biased estimation because the replacement is inside the nonlinear function. When x is repeated sufficiently in the data, this bias is small and improvement can be observed, like in the synthetic data example. However, when x is not repeated frequently, both RAML and SQDML are biased. Experiment in section 4.1.2 do not validate significant improvement, either.\n\nThe numerical results are relatively weak. The synthetic experiment verifies the reward-maximizing property of RAML and SQDML. However, from Figure 2, we can see that the result is quite sensitive to the temperature \\tau. Is there any guidelines to choose \\tau? For experiments in Section 4.2, all of them are to show the effectiveness of RAML, which are not very relevant to this paper. These experiment results show very small improvement compared to the ML baselines (see Table 2,3 and 5).  These results are also lower than the state of the art performance. \n\nA few questions:\n(1). The author may want to check whether (8) can be called a Bayes decision rule. This is a direct result from definition of conditional probability. No Bayesian elements, like prior or likelihood appears here.\n(2). In the implementation of SQDML, one can sample from (15) without exactly computing the summation in the denominator. Compared with the n-gram replacement used in the paper, which one is better?\n(3). The authors may want to write Eqn. 17 in the same conditional form of Eqn. 12 and Eqn. 14. This will make the comparison much more clear.\n(4). What is Theorem 2 trying to convey? Although \\tau goes to 0, there is still a gap between Q and Q'. This seems to suggest that for small \\tau, Q' is not a good approximation of Q. Are the assumptions in Theorem 2 reasonable? There are several typos in the proof of Theorem 2. \n(5). In section 4.2.2, the authors write \"the rewards we directly optimized in training (token-level accuracy for NER and UAS for dependency parsing) are more stable w.r.t. \u03c4 than the evaluation metrics (F1 in NER), illustrating that in practice, choosing a training reward that correlates well with the evaluation metric is important\".

Our experiments are designed to verify our theoretical claims. An exhaustive comparison with current state-of-the-art are however outside the scope of this work (due also to the space limit).\n\nFor your concerns about the numerical results of our experiments, from Figure 1 we see that SQDML is quite stable for different values of tau in the region from 0.1 to 3.0. The results in Figure 2 fluctuate when \\tau is pretty large, which verifies our discussion in section 3.5 that the softmax Q-distribution becomes closer to the uniform distribution when \\tau becomes larger, making it less expressive for prediction. In practice, we found that choosing \\tau in the region of (0.5, 1.5) results pretty good performance. One may perform fine-tuning of \\tau on the validation sets.\n\nThe experiments in section 4.2, as discussed in the first paragraph of this section, is to further confirm the empirical success of RAML (and SQDML) over ML. The models of NER and dependency parsing are classical feature-based statistical models, whose performance are not as good as state-of-the-art neural network models. But our experiments on machine translation are based on the state-of-the-art attentional neural sequence-to-sequence model, and we obtained better performance than Bahdanau, et al. (2017) which incorporated actor-critic algorithm with sequence-to-sequence, demonstrating the effectiveness of RAML. Moreover, from the results in Table 6 in this section, we observed that RAML outperforms ML on the directly optimized metrics while ML gets better results under exact match accuracy. This is in line with our theoretical analysis.\n\nFor your questions about details:\n(1) Bayes decision rule is a commonly used terminology in statistical decision theory.\n(2) You said that one can sample from (15) without exactly computing the summation in the denominator. We do not fully understand it. Did you say importance sampling? We have experimental results of importance sampling for machine translation, which is a little bit worse than the n-gram replacement used in this paper. Please see Appendix D 2.4 for details.\n(3) We sincerely appreciate your comment for improving the notation and will revise it in the next version.\n(4) Theorem 1 proved that when \\tau becomes larger, the approximation error tends to be zero. At the same time, however, the softmax Q-distribution becomes closer to the uniform distribution, providing less information for prediction. Thus, in practice, we cannot choose a large \\tau in order to achieve small approximation error. Theorem 2 is trying to say that under some assumptions, small approximation error is also able to be achieved even with small \\tau. The exponential tail bound assumption in Theorem 2 holds when the conditional distribution P(Y|X=x) is close to a deterministic distribution w.r.t a 'ground-truth' y*. \n(5) In the experiments of NER, to efficiently compute the objective function, we use token-level accuracy as the reward which is not exactly the same as the evaluation metric F1 score. For dependency parsing, we use the UAS as the reward which is just the official evaluation metric for this task. According to the results in Table 2 and 3, RAML is quite stable on token-level accuracy and UAS w.r.t \\tau, but less stable on F1 score."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Softmax Q-Distribution Estimation for Structured Prediction: A Theoretical Interpretation for RAML", "abstract": "Reward augmented maximum likelihood (RAML), a simple and effective learning framework to directly optimize towards the reward function in structured prediction tasks, has led to a number of impressive empirical successes.

Moreover, as pointed out in quesiton (iii), there is no rigorous theorectical evidence showing that RAML provides a better prediction function. From our Softmax Q-distribution estimation framework in section 3, we derived that the globally optimal solution of RAML is actually Q' in Eq (16), and linked the Q' distribution with our softmax Q distribution in Eq (12) by providing two KL-based bounds in Theorem 1 and 2, demonstrating that Q' is approximating to Q. We really appreciate your comment about the confusion of this part and will definitely revise this paragraph to make the problems of RAML more clear.\n\nFor your question about Theorem 1 and 2, both of them are trying to characterizing the approximating error from Q' to Q by upper-bounding the KL divergence between them. Since the Q and Q' distributions are the \"target\" distributions that SQDML and RAML are learning, respectively, and the prediction functions of SQDML and RAML are directly generated by decoding from these two distributions, we can say that SQDML and RAML should have similar predictive rewards if Q and Q' are close. And decoding from Q distribution delivers Bayes decision rule, thus Theorem 1 and 2 guarantee that RAML would have similar predictive rewards when the assumptions hold. Further, our experiment on syntactic data empirically demonstrate that RAML is able to achieve similar predictive rewards with SQDML which asymptotically achieves Bayes decision rule.\n\nThe exponential tail bound assumption holds when the conditional distribution P(Y|X=x) is close to a deterministic distribution w.r.t a 'ground-truth' y*. \n\nResults in Table 1 illustrate that SQDML achieves better performance towards the oprimized metric. We conceded in the paper that the improvements of SQDML over RAML are not significant, and gave a possible explanation that the reference captions for each image are largely different, making it highly non-trivial for the model to predict a \"consensus\" caption that agrees with multiple references. Examples are given in Figure 3. \n\nThe selection of \\tau in practice depends on the task and the properties of reward funciton r(y, y*). In our experiments on different NLP structured prediction tasks, we found that choosing \\tau in the region of (0.5, 1.5) results pretty good performance.

Additional experiments on three structured prediction tasks with rewards defined on sequential (named entity recognition), tree-based (dependency parsing) and irregular (machine translation) structures show notable improvements over maximum likelihood baselines.", "pdf": "/pdf/fe09043ffcdcc20e3997491c74a91ebb9a3ff35a.pdf", "paperhash": "ma|softmax_qdistribution_estimation_for_structured_prediction_a_theoretical_interpretation_for_raml", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nma2018softmax,\ntitle={Softmax Q-Distribution Estimation for Structured Prediction: A Theoretical Interpretation for {RAML}},\nauthor={Xuezhe Ma and Pengcheng Yin and Jingzhou Liu and Graham Neubig and Eduard Hovy},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1mSWUxR-},\n}", "keywords": ["structured prediction", "RAML", "theory", "Bayes decision rule", "reward function"], "authors": ["Xuezhe Ma", "Pengcheng Yin", "Jingzhou Liu", "Graham Neubig", "Eduard Hovy"], "authorids": ["xuezhem@cs.cmu.edu", "pcyin@cs.cmu.edu", "liujingzhou@cs.cmu.edu", "gneubig@cs.cmu.edu", "hovy@cs.cmu.edu"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "duedate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "tmdate": 1516825736501, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper271/Official_Comment", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"replyto": null, "forum": "B1mSWUxR-", "writers": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper271/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper271/Authors|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper271/Area_Chair|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper271/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper271/Authors|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper271/Area_Chair|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "value-dropdown": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper271/Authors_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper271/Reviewers_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper271/Area_Chairs_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 0, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper271/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper271/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper271/Area_Chair", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "cdate": 1516825736501}}}], "count": 9}
