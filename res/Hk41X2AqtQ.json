For example, equation 4 refers to q as the prior distribution but this seems like it's the posterior distribution as it is described just below equation 5. p(z_1|z_2) is also not well defined. It would be clearer to specify the full algorithm in the paper. \n\nThanks for pointing out this confusing typo. In the revised version, we have corrected \u2018prior\u2019 to \u2018posterior\u2019 while describing equation 4. As to the specific configuration of p(z_1|z_2), it is actually described in the supplementary materials (due to the space limit). To avoid any confusions here, we added a 'Model specification\u2019 section, at the beginning of the 'Experiments' part in the revised version, to illustrate these details and hyperparameter choices.\n\n> The work also mentions that words are generated for each sentence until the _END token is generated. Is this token always generated? What happens to a sentence if that token is not generated?\n\nThe reviewer brings up a good point about the end_token generation. In our training data, all sentences have an _END token (at the end of each sentence), and the word-level LSTM is able to learn that there will be an _END token after each sentence and generate that token.  We should also note that, we constrained the model to generate a maximum number of words for each sentence. We use maximumly 20 words for the Yelp reviews dataset and 25 for the arXiv dataset. This part has been made more clear in the revised version. \n\n> It's also unclear how this work is novel with regards to the works below.\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that there are similarities between our model and the VHRED model proposed by Serban et. al., however our model is quite different in terms of the architecture and motivation. Firstly, the VHRED model infers a latent variable for each context/utterance, and the context is provided to the decoder while generating each response. In contrast, our model leverages a global latent variable to model the entire paragraph without any additional inputs (no contexts are provided). As a result, the latent variables in our model are designed to abstract globally meaningful features from the entire paragraph. \n\nSecondly, we have leveraged a hierarchy of latent variables to mitigate the \u2018posterior collapse\u2019 issue, which has given rise to promising empirical results. Specifically, the generative network has made better use of the latent variable information, indicated by a larger KL term (please refer to our response to Reviewer 2 for additional information). This strategy has not been employed and discussed in the \u2018Hierarchical Variational Autoencoders for Music\u2019 paper either.\n\nTo further prove that our model can extract globally informative features, we conducted an additional experiment, in the revised paper, to visualize the learned latent variable. Specifically, from the arXiv dataset, we select the most frequent four classes/topics and re-train our hier-VAE-D model on the corresponding abstracts. We plot the bottom-level latent variable for our hier-VAE-D with t-SNE (which is supposed to contain the global features). The result is shown in Figure 2 of the revised manuscript. It can be observed that the latent codes of paragraphs from the same topic are indeed grouped together in the embedding space, indicating that the latent variables has encoded high-level features from the input paragraph. \n\nAs to the factorized hierarchical VAE paper, although they utilize the hierarchical nature of sequential data, their VAE model only takes a sub-sequence (segment) of the entire sequence as the input (as illustrated in Figure 3 of the factorized hierarchical VAE paper). Therefore, their model can only be used to modify the style/attribute of a sub-sequence (short sentence), rather than generate/sample an entire sequence (long-form document).\n\n> Minor comments\n\nThanks for pointing the typos out. We have corrected them accordingly in the revised paper.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1322/Authors"], "readers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1322/Authors", "everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1322/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1322/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Hierarchically-Structured Variational Autoencoders for Long Text Generation", "abstract": "Variational autoencoders (VAEs) have received much attention recently as an end-to-end architecture for text generation.

Most of the sequences change both in content and in sentiment.

The only real instance of keeping content similar is \"my boyfriend and i\" appearing in the second-to-last example, but otherwise the content is totally different - the original is talking about buying game cards; the transferred is talking about a restaurant.

The model creates two levels of latent variables; one level of sentence-level latent variables and another single global latent. This avoids posterior collapse issues and the authors show convincing results on a few different applications to two datasets.\n\nOverall, it is an impressive result to be able to convincingly model paragraphs with a useful global latent variable. Apart from some issues with confusing/incomplete notation (see below), my main criticism is that the authors fail to compare their approach to \"A Hierarchical Latent Structure for Variational Conversation Modeling\" by Park et al. As far as I can tell, the approaches are extremely similar, except that Park et al. may not learn the prior parameters and also use a hierarchical RNN encoder rather than a CNN (which may be irrelevant). They also are primarily interested in dialog generation, so the lower-level of their hierarchy models utterances in a conversation rather than sentences in general, but I don't see this as a major difference. I'd encourage the authors to compare to this and potentially use it as a baseline. More generally, it would have been nice to see more ablation experiments (e.g. convolutional vs. LSTM encoder). Finally, I know that space is tight, but other papers on global-latent-variable models tend to include more demonstrations that teh global variable is capturing meaningful information, e.g. with attribute vector arithmetic. The authors could include results of manipulating review sentiment via attribute vector arithmetic, for example.\n\n\nSpecific comments:\n\n- \"The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term ... which can be written in closed-form (Kingma & Welling, 2013), encourages the approximate posterior distribution q\u03c6(z|x) to be close to the multivariate Gaussian prior p(z).\" The prior is not always taken to be a multivariate Gaussian. You should add a sentence stating that the VAE prior is often taken to be a diagonal-covariance Gaussian for convenience.\n- 3.2 has a few things which are unclear. In the second paragraph, you define z as the sampled latent code which is fed through an MLP \"to obtain the starting state of the sentence-level LSTM decoder\". But then LSTM^{sent} appears to be fed z at every timestep. LSTM^{sent} is also not defined - am I to assume that its arguments are the previous state and current input, so that z is the input at every timestep? Also, you write \"where h^s_0 is a vector of zeros\" which makes it sound like the starting state of the sentence-level LSTM decoder is a vector of zeros, not the output of the MLP which takes z as input. In contrast, LSTM^{word} takes three arguments as input. Which are the \"state\" and which are the \"input\" to the LSTM?\n- I don't see any description of your CNN encoder (only the LSTM decoder in section 3.2, 3.3 only covers the hierarchy of latent variables, not the CNN architecture). What is its structure? Figure 1 shows a CNN encoder generating lower-level sentence embeddings and a high-level global embedding. How are those computed? It is briefly mentioned in 4.1 under \"Datasets\" but this seems insufficient.\n- p_\\theta(x | z) is defined as the generating distribution, but also as a joint distribution of z_1 and z_2. Unless I am missing something I think you are overloading the notation for p_\\theta.\n- I don't think enough information is given about the AAE and ARAE baselines. Are they the same as the flat-VAE, except with the KL term replaced by the an adversarial divergence between the prior and approximate posterior?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1322/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Hierarchically-Structured Variational Autoencoders for Long Text Generation", "abstract": "Variational autoencoders (VAEs) have received much attention recently as an end-to-end architecture for text generation.

The mean latent vector for all negative reviews are computed in the same manner. The two vectors are then subtracted (i.e., positive mean vector minus negative mean vector) to obtain the \u2018\u2019sentiment attribute vector\u2019\u2019. For evaluation, we randomly sample 1000 reviews with negative sentiment and add the \u2018\u2019sentiment attribute vector\u2019\u2019 to their latent codes. The manipulated latent vectors are then fed to the hierarchical decoder to produce the transferred sentences (which should hopefully convey positive sentiment). Below are some transferred results:\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\nOriginal: you have no idea how badly i want to like this place, they are incredibly vegetarian vegan friendly , i just haven t been impressed by anything i ve ordered there , even the chips and salsa aren t terribly good , i do like the bar they have great sangria but that s about it .\n\nTransferred: this is definitely one of my favorite places to eat in vegas , they are very friendly and the food is always fresh , i highly recommend the pork belly , everything else is also very delicious , i do like the fact that they have a great selection of salads .\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal: papa j s is expensive and inconsistent , the ambiance is nice but it doesn t justify the prices , there are better restaurants in carnegie .\n\nTransferred: love the food , the prices are reasonable and the food is great , it s a great place to go for a quick bite .\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal: my boyfriend and i are in our 20s , and have visited this place multiple times , after our visit yesterday , i don t think we ll be back , when we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards . \n\nTransferred: my boyfriend and i have been here twice , and have been to the one in gilbert several times too , since my first visit , i don t think i ve ever had a bad meal here , the servers were very friendly and helpful .\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal: a friend recommended this to me , and i can t figure out why , the food was underwhelming and pricey , the service was fine, and the place looked nice . \n\nTransferred: a friend of mine recommended this place , and i was so glad that i did try it , the service was great , and the food was delicious .\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nAs shown above, the original sentences have been successfully manipulated to positive sentiment with the simple attribute vector operation.

In the revised manuscript, we particularly discuss the differences between our method and the VHCR model in the \u201cHierarchical structures in NLP\u201d part of section 2. Specifically, our approach is unique from the following perspectives: (i) both latent variables in our hier-VAE are designed to contain global information. More importantly, although the local/utterance variables are generated from the global latent variable in VHCR, the priors for the two sets of latent variables are both fixed as standard diagonal-covariance Gaussians. In contrast, the prior of the bottom-level latent variable in our model is learned from the data (thus more flexible relative to a fixed prior), which exhibits promising results in terms of mitigating the \u201cposterior collapse\u201d issue (see Table 2); (ii) in hier-VAE, the underlying data distribution of the entire paragraph is captured in the bottom-level latent variable. While in the setup of VHCR, the responses are modeled/generated conditioned on both the latent variables and the contexts. Therefore, the (global) latent variable learned by our model should contain more information.

We would like to mention that in our original submission, we included a section in the experiments where we reported results to measure the continuity of the learned latent space. This measure is commonly used in latent-variable models to evaluate how smooth the learned VAE latent space is. Our results demonstrated that the generated samples are syntactically and semantically reasonable. We even found that the generated sentences, along a linear trajectory, gradually transit from positive to negative sentiment (as shown in Table 4). Having said that, we followed reviewer's suggestion and are currently running additional experiments to manipulate the review sentiment via attribute vector arithmetic. We will update with the corresponding results shortly.\n\nFurthermore, we\u2019ve just reported the results of our new experiment to visualize the learned global latent variable by plotting the corresponding t-SNE embeddings on the arXiv dataset (please refer to our response to Reviewer 1 for additional information).\n\nBelow, please also find our responses to the specific comments of the reviewer:\n\n[VAE prior] Thanks for pointing this out. We have revised this sentence according to your suggestion.\n\n[Feeding z to LSTM] We apologize for the confusion. As to feeding the latent codes z to LSTM, we follow [2] and use z to infer the initial state of LSTM and feed it to every step of LSTM as well. That said, z is employed as the input to the sentence-level LSTM (higher level decoder) at every time step. For the word-level LSTM, the plan vectors are utilized by the decoder in a similar manner. Different from the higher-level LSTM, the input to the word-level LSTM at each step is the concatenation of z and the word embedding of the previous token. We have revised the description of this part in Section 3.2 to avoid any confusion.\n\n[CNN encoder structure] Due to space limit, the specific structure of CNN encoder is described in the supplementary materials. To make it more clear, we added a ''Model specification\u2018\u2019 section in the revised version, in the beginning of ''Experiments\u2018\u2019 part, detailing the encoder structure..\n\n[Notation] \\theta is defined as the parameters of the whole generative network.

The VHCR model (as denoted in their paper) indeed bears close resemblance to our proposed method. However, there are two key differences that make our work unique: \n\n1) To allow the model to make more use of the latent variable, this reference proposes to employ an \u2018utterance drop\u2019 strategy. Their goal is to weaken the autoregressive power of hierarchical RNNs by dropping the utterance encoder vector with a certain probability. Although the KL divergence term tends to get larger with this modification, the modeling capacity of the LSTM decoder may be sacrificed. Instead, we try to resolve the same issue from a different perspective (without weakening the decoder during training). Specifically, we propose to improve the flexibility and expressiveness of the prior distribution, by leveraging a hierarchy of latent variables. This setup endows the encoder/inference networks with stronger ability to extract high-level (global) features of a paragraph. Notably, the model proposed in [1] shares the same high-level idea of making the inference networks more expressive to resolve the \u2018\u2019posterior collapse\u2019\u2019 problem.\n\nTo compare the effectiveness of the two different strategies (to mitigate the `posterior collapse\u2019 issue), we experiment the \u2018utterance drop\u2019 (u.d) method based upon our hier-VAE-S model on the Yelp dataset (note that to allow fair comparison, we use hier-VAE-S as the baseline to evaluate the two strategies). The corresponding language modeling results are shown as below:\n\n\t\t\t                    NLL        KL        PPL \nhier-VAE-S: \t\t           160.8      3.6       46.6\nhier-VAE-S (with u.d):     161.3  \t  5.6       47.1\nhier-VAE-D: \t\t           160.2      6.8       45.8\n\nAs shown above, their u.d strategy allows better usage of the latent variable (indicated by a larger KL divergence value). However, the NLL of the language model becomes even worse with the u.d method, possibly due to the weakening of the decoder during training (similar observations have also been shown in Table 2 of the VHCR paper). In contrast, our \u2018hierarchical prior\u2019 strategy yields larger KL terms as well as lower NNL value, indicating the advantage of our strategy to mitigate the \u2018posterior collapse\u2019 issue.\n\n2) The previous VHCR model considers a multi-turn dialogue generation scenario, where the dialog context is provided at each time step (in terms of the higher-level LSTM) and the model seeks to generate the corresponding response conditioned on the context. What is different in our hier-VAE model is that, we are interested in generating long and coherent units merely conditioned on the latent variable (no additional context information is provided to the decoder). As a result, the underlying data distribution of the entire paragraph is captured in the bottom-level latent variable. While in their setup, the responses are modeled/generated conditioned on both the latent variables and the contexts. In this sense, the problem we are trying to tackle is relatively more challenging. \n\n> More generally, it would have been nice to see more ablation experiments (e.g. convolutional vs. LSTM encoder)\n\nAt the initial stage of this project, we found that the hierarchical CNN encoder employed here is important for the VAE model to work well (relative to a flat CNN encoder). Based on reviewer\u2019s suggestion, we re-ran the language modeling experiments with a flat CNN encoder and a hierarchical LSTM encoder (on the Yelp dataset). The results are shown below:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t                          NLL        KL        PPL \nFlat CNN encoder:\t\t\t         164.6      2.3       50.2\nHierarchical LSTM encoder:\t\t 161.3\t 5.7       46.9\nHierarchical CNN encoder:                 160.2      6.8       45.8\n\nIt can be observed that the model with a flat CNN encoder yields worst (largest) perplexity, suggesting that it is beneficial to make the encoder hierarchical. Additionally, hierarchical CNN encoder exhibits slightly better results than hierarchical LSTM encoder according to our experiments.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1322/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1322/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1322/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Hierarchically-Structured Variational Autoencoders for Long Text Generation", "abstract": "Variational autoencoders (VAEs) have received much attention recently as an end-to-end architecture for text generation. Existing methods primarily focus on synthesizing relatively short sentences (with less than twenty words). In this paper, we propose a novel framework, hierarchically-structured variational autoencoder (hier-VAE), for generating long and coherent units of text. To enhance the model\u2019s plan-ahead ability, intermediate sentence representations are introduced into the generative networks to guide the word-level predictions. To alleviate the typical optimization challenges associated with textual VAEs, we further employ a hierarchy of stochastic layers between the encoder and decoder networks. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method, where hier-VAE is shown to make effective use of the latent codes and achieve lower perplexity relative to language models. Moreover, the generated samples from hier-VAE also exhibit superior quality according to both automatic and human evaluations.
