The clustering is performed on overlapping windows of the signal, thus connecting them over time and allowing them to evolve as the young bird develops.\n\nThe abstract is well written and quite clear.  The originality of the method lies more in its use of a new method to analyze birdsong than in its development of a new method for clustering temporal sequences in general.  It is not clear that t-SNE is really required here, perhaps other clustering techniques performed over such sliding windows would work just as well on this task.\n\nPros: important problem examined by domain experts, well executed, interesting scientific results\n\nCons: no comparison with other approaches, straightforward extension of existing representation learning techniques", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"CMT_id": "", "title": "Learning stable representations in a changing world with  on-line t-SNE: proof of concept in the songbird", "abstract": "Many real-world time series involve repeated patterns that evolve gradually by following slow underlying trends.
