R2 recommends Weak Reject based on similar reasoning, that the approach consists of existing components (albeit combined in a novel way) and suggest some ablation experiments to isolate the source of the good performance. R3 recommends Weak Accept but feels it is \"unsurprising\" that BERT allows for faster training and higher accuracy. In their response, authors emphasize that the application of pretraining to named entity recognition is new, and that theirs is a methodological advance, not purely a practical one (as R1 suggests and other reviews imply). They also argue it is not possible to do a fair ablation study that removes BERT, but make an attempt. The reviewers chose to keep their scores after the response. Given the split decision, the AC also read the paper. It is clear the paper has significant merit and significant practical value, as the reviews indicate. However, given that three expert reviewers -- all of whom are NLP researchers at top institutions -- feel that the contribution of the paper is weak (in the context of the expectations of ICLR) makes it not possible for us to recommend acceptance at this time.

We appreciate the positive assessment of the clarity of our writing.\n\nRegarding the suggested ablations,\n\n1. For reasons outlined in our response to the public comment you reference, we do not believe this ablation (as suggested) would be meaningful. For convenience, we have copied that response here: In our model, BERT is more than a source of contextual word embeddings as we fine-tune all of its ~110M parameters during training. Simply replacing BERT with distributed embeddings and a character-CNN or LSTM wouldn\u2019t allow us to determine the effect of contextualized embeddings because we would simultaneously be removing the majority of our model\u2019s trainable parameters. Nevertheless, we performed the suggested ablation by swapping BERT for GloVe embeddings (300 dimensional) and found that NER performance dropped from 89.46% to 40.33% and RE performance fell from 66.83% to 14.44% on the test set of the ConLL04 corpus (note that we had to increase the learning rate by 10X to get the model to converge). If you were to somehow control for this drop in model capacity, say by adding in an LSTM network, the ablated model would closely match this paper [1], whom we outperform by ~3% overall on the CoNLL04 corpus. This paper is not cited in Table 1 as they report macro-averaged F1 scores, while most other papers (including the current state-of-the-art [2]) report micro-averaged F1 scores, as we did. Finally, it is well known that contextual embeddings outperform distributed embeddings on a wide range of NLP tasks, including NER [3]. The aim of our study wasn\u2019t to compare contextual vs. distributed embeddings but on how to successfully integrate BERT into a state-of-the-art joint NER and RE architecture.\n\n2. Thank you for this suggestion. We are currently performing the ablation, and will comment again once we have the results. We will be performing the same ablation as used in [2] (see section 6.2). Just note, because our manuscript is already at the page limit, we may have to place the results of this ablation in the appendix.\n\nRegarding predicted entity label embeddings,\n\nBefore training, all unique entity labels (e.g. B-PER, I-PER, ... etc.) are embedded by assigning them to randomly initialized, continuous vectors of 128 dimensions (this hyperparam is mentioned in Table A.2 of the appendix). The embeddings are then updated along with the rest of the models' parameters during training. Practically speaking, this is handled for us via the embedding layer in PyTorch [4].  This is the same method used in the works we compare to ([1], [5], [6]). We have updated the text in the manuscript (under section 2) to make this more clear.\n\nThank you again for taking the time to review our paper.\n\n[1] https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-15712-8_47\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05529\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365\n[4] https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#embedding\n[5] https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1105/\n[6] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741741830455X"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1048/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1048/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["john.giorgi@utoronto.ca", "xindi.wang@uhnresearch.ca", "nicola.sahar@mail.utoronto.ca", "wonyoung.shin@mail.utoronto.ca", "gary.bader@utoronto.ca", "bowang@vectorinstitute.ai"], "title": "End-to-end named entity recognition and relation extraction using pre-trained language models", "authors": ["John Giorgi", "Xindi Wang", "Nicola Sahar", "Won Young Shin", "Gary Bader", "Bo Wang"], "pdf": "/pdf/1462260f8feb38efc3c3c6a48383eeb9d679c3c9.pdf", "TL;DR": "A novel, high-performing architecture for end-to-end named entity recognition and relation extraction that is fast to train.", "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) are two important tasks in information extraction and retrieval (IE & IR).

We are integrating BERT as part of our model architecture and fine-tuning it along with the task-specific parameters (as stated in the second to last paragraph of the introduction). For the particular problem of joint NER and RE, we found this to be critical. For example, early on in our experiments we tested using BERT as a feature extractor vs. fine-tuning the entire architecture and found that performance dropped to ~42.82% (from 78.15%) on the CoNLL04 corpus.\n\nIntegrating BERT as part of our model (as opposed to simply using its embeddings as inputs) allowed us to swap recurrent architectures common in joint NER and RE models in favour of simple and shallow task-specific architectures composed of feed forward neural networks. This reduced training times while improving performance (see our response to official review #1 for more details).\n\nAgain, thanks for your constructive comments! \n\n[1] https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-15712-8_47\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05529\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1048/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1048/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["john.giorgi@utoronto.ca", "xindi.wang@uhnresearch.ca", "nicola.sahar@mail.utoronto.ca", "wonyoung.shin@mail.utoronto.ca", "gary.bader@utoronto.ca", "bowang@vectorinstitute.ai"], "title": "End-to-end named entity recognition and relation extraction using pre-trained language models", "authors": ["John Giorgi", "Xindi Wang", "Nicola Sahar", "Won Young Shin", "Gary Bader", "Bo Wang"], "pdf": "/pdf/1462260f8feb38efc3c3c6a48383eeb9d679c3c9.pdf", "TL;DR": "A novel, high-performing architecture for end-to-end named entity recognition and relation extraction that is fast to train.", "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) are two important tasks in information extraction and retrieval (IE & IR).

In particular:\n\n- To the best of our knowledge, our specific implementation of entity pre-training is novel. Our technique can be ported to other neural, multi-task setups with a strong dependence between tasks (e.g. where a model must learn to perform some task before attempting to learn one or more dependent tasks jointly). For example, we have already begun porting this scheme to a neural cross-lingual summarization project of ours.  Entity pre-training accounted for a 0.63% increase in our ablation experiment. On the CoNLL04 test set, it accounts for a 1.26% boost in performance, which is large relative to historic improvement on this corpus [1].\n- As opposed to previous models (e.g. [2], [3]) we were able to drop all recurrent architectures, which reduced training times substantially. Our work is one of the first architectures for joint NER and RE to do this. Because previous papers do not report their training times, we contacted the authors of a comparable method [4] for their training times and found that our method converged between 3-35X times faster for the ACE04, ADE, and CoNLL04 corpora (keeping in mind that we did not train on the same hardware). The large range in our estimate is because [4] trained for a wide range (60-200) of epochs.\n\nOur model serves as a strong baseline for future studies on joint NER and RE architectures and provides guidance on how to best integrate a pre-trained language model into such an architecture. For the ADE corpus in particular, we advance SOTA RE performance by >10%, which is substantially larger than improvements have been historically [5]. It is also complementary to [6] (published in ACL this year), by demonstrating similar performance without the need for templated queries, which, as pointed out in our introduction, may become a limiting factor where domain expertise is required to craft such questions (e.g., for biomedical or clinical corpora).\n\nRegarding your comments on a System Demonstration submission to ACL, \n\nOur paper is a methodological advancement, not a system, tool, or demonstration [7] and is not suitable for submission to System Demonstrations at ACL. \n\n[1] https://paperswithcode.com/sota/relation-extraction-on-conll04\n[2] https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-15712-8_47\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07847\n[4] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741741830455X\n[5] https://paperswithcode.com/sota/relation-extraction-on-ade-corpus\n[6] https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05529\n[7] https://aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-2020-call-system-demonstrations"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1048/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1048/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["john.giorgi@utoronto.ca", "xindi.wang@uhnresearch.ca", "nicola.sahar@mail.utoronto.ca", "wonyoung.shin@mail.utoronto.ca", "gary.bader@utoronto.ca", "bowang@vectorinstitute.ai"], "title": "End-to-end named entity recognition and relation extraction using pre-trained language models", "authors": ["John Giorgi", "Xindi Wang", "Nicola Sahar", "Won Young Shin", "Gary Bader", "Bo Wang"], "pdf": "/pdf/1462260f8feb38efc3c3c6a48383eeb9d679c3c9.pdf", "TL;DR": "A novel, high-performing architecture for end-to-end named entity recognition and relation extraction that is fast to train.", "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) are two important tasks in information extraction and retrieval (IE & IR).

Simply replacing BERT with distributed embeddings and a character-CNN or LSTM wouldn\u2019t allow us to determine the effect of contextualized embeddings because we would simultaneously be removing the majority of our model\u2019s trainable parameters. Nevertheless, we performed the suggested ablation by swapping BERT for GloVe embeddings (300 dimensional) and found that NER performance dropped from 89.46% to 40.33% and RE performance fell from 66.83% to 14.44% on the test set of the ConLL04 corpus (note that we had to increase the learning rate by 10X to get the model to converge).\n\nIf you were to somehow control for this drop in model capacity, say by adding in an LSTM network, the ablated model would closely match this paper [1], whom we outperform by ~3% overall on the CoNLL04 corpus. This paper is not cited in Table 1 as they report macro-averaged F1 scores, while most other papers (including the current state-of-the-art [2]) report micro-averaged F1 scores, as we did.\n\nFinally, it is well known that contextual embeddings outperform distributed embeddings on a wide range of NLP tasks, including NER [3]. The aim of our study wasn\u2019t to compare contextual vs. distributed embeddings but on how to successfully integrate BERT into a state-of-the-art joint NER and RE architecture. \n\nRegarding the expected result of BERT improving RE,\n\nWhile we agree that it is unsurprising that the addition of BERT leads to state-of-the-art performance, our study still provides guidance on how to successfully integrate BERT, e.g. task-specific architectures for NER and RE, entity pre-training, hyperparameters, and the demonstration that performance holds across multiple domains simply by swapping in domain-specific BERT checkpoints. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work to successfully integrate BERT into a joint NER and RE model, without the need for templated queries [2].\n\n[1] https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-15712-8_47\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05529\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1048/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1048/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["john.giorgi@utoronto.ca", "xindi.wang@uhnresearch.ca", "nicola.sahar@mail.utoronto.ca", "wonyoung.shin@mail.utoronto.ca", "gary.bader@utoronto.ca", "bowang@vectorinstitute.ai"], "title": "End-to-end named entity recognition and relation extraction using pre-trained language models", "authors": ["John Giorgi", "Xindi Wang", "Nicola Sahar", "Won Young Shin", "Gary Bader", "Bo Wang"], "pdf": "/pdf/1462260f8feb38efc3c3c6a48383eeb9d679c3c9.pdf", "TL;DR": "A novel, high-performing architecture for end-to-end named entity recognition and relation extraction that is fast to train.", "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) are two important tasks in information extraction and retrieval (IE & IR).
