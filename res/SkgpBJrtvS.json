Theoretically, we show our objective is maximizing a lower bound on mutual information between the latent representations of the teacher and student network. Empirically, we show our method consistently outperforms all 12 recent knowledge distillation methods published in NeurIPS, CVPR, ICCV and other top conferences (we note that many of these previous works were also just different distance metrics between teacher and student networks).\n\n\u201cComparing with original distillation method (KD) I'm not sure how significant the improvement is\u201d\nWe clarify that it\u2019s important to see the relative improvement, rather than the absolute improvement. Suppose the gap of accuracy between well-trained teacher and student networks is only 3 percentage points, how can we ask the knowledge from the teacher model improves the student by 10 absolute percentage points, or even 5 percentage points. Indeed, our CRD outperforms the second best method (KD, see Table 1&2) with a 57% average relative improvement.\n\n\u201chowever it is in the spirit of what the distillation work is all about and I do not see this as being fundamentally different, or at least not different enough for an ICLR paper\u201d\nThese 12 other methods we compare here are just as similar to KD but are published in top venues. However, our method not only outperforms recent SOTA methods, but also forges a connection between two literatures that have evolved mostly independently: knowledge distillation and representation learning.\n\n\u201cIt would be helpful to also include the variance of each experiment\u201d\nWe have added the standard deviation in Sec 6.9 and Tables 9&10.\n\n\u201cWhy this particular distance metric between the representations? Why not just L2?\u201d\nWe have both theoretical analysis and empirical validation for the improvement provided by this distance metric. An L2 metric is provided by FitNet, which we compare to in Tables 1, 2, 4, 5 and Figure 3 (CRD outperforms FitNet).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1708/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1708/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Contrastive Representation Distillation", "authors": ["Yonglong Tian", "Dilip Krishnan", "Phillip Isola"], "authorids": ["yonglong@mit.edu", "dilipkay@google.com", "phillipi@mit.edu"], "keywords": ["Knowledge Distillation", "Representation Learning", "Contrastive Learning", "Mutual Information"], "TL;DR": "Representation/knowledge distillation by maximizing mutual information between teacher and student", "abstract": "  Often we wish to transfer representational knowledge from one neural network to another.

We have revised the contribution section to make it more accurate. \n\nHyperparameters (architecture types, transfer connections between layers). For architecture types or student-teach pairs, we just randomly sampled over a candidate pool which contains widely-used networks. As for the transfer connections for feature based distillation methods, we tried two methods: (1) connect the layers with 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 depth of the whole network; (2) connect the last layer of each specific spatial size, e.g., the last layers, which have spatial size of 32, 16, 8 and 4, are connected correspondingly. We found (2) generally works better and stick to it.\n\nWe agree that we might achieve higher accuracies if we separately tune hyperparameters for each specific student-teacher pairs. But on the other hand, we consider it to be more interesting to see how each method can generalize across different architecture types without much tuning. This is also our motivation of randomly sampling different student-teacher pairs to form the benchmark.\n\n2. Compatibility. We have included another table in the revised paper (see Sec. 6.6 and Table 6) discussing the combination of different distillation objectives. We found: (1) other objectives combined with KD still underperform CRD; (2) combining CRD with other objectives, such as KD and PKT, can further improve the performance.\n\n3. The main reason why we don\u2019t extensively compare with all other baselines in other Tables is that we have limited resources. Given such a situation, we are inclined to distribute our resources towards building complete results (Tables 1&2) on the standard CIFAR-100 benchmark, rather than the proof of concept on specific settings, such as Table 5 and Figure 3. \n\nWe appreciate the idea of comparing transferability with other methods. We have included a new table (see Sec 6.7 and Table 7) showing the transferability of all methods with different architectures.\n\n4. VID also claims to capture the MI between the representations of student and teacher, but their instantiation is very different from ours. In order to achieve a tractable computation of MI, VID used a Gaussian distribution as a variational approximation of the true conditional distribution. Our conjecture is that the true conditional distribution is perhaps very different from the Gaussian assumption, and therefore it leads to suboptimal results. \nOther issues:\nWe have added a note to indicate that Online-kd does not use pre-trained ResNet-34. We can also remove this item if needed.\nWe tried CRD on middle layers but only see very marginal improvement, so we opt to keep our methods simpler. Indeed, only using penultimate layers makes CRD more robust to different architecture types.\nFSP only works for teachers and students with the size of features being equal, so it\u2019s not available there. We will mark it as N/A.\nThe typos have been fixed.\n\nPlease don\u2019t hesitate to let us know for any additional comments.

And technically this is just a distance metric between the internal representation or output of the student and teacher.

It would be helpful to also include the variance of each experiment i.e., it was mentioned that the results were averaged by repeating 5 experiments to make sure the proposed method consistently better than others.

The performance gap compared to the existing distillation approaches seem to be significant.\n\nMajor Concerns:\n- The authors claim that \"none of the other methods consistently outperform KD on their own\". I feel that this claim is somewhat aggressive because some of them outperform KD without combining with KD, e.g., Table 1 in FT (Kim et al., 2018) and Table 2 in SP (Tung & Mori, 2019). Since the distillation (or transfer) methods are typically sensitive to hyperparameters (e.g., architecture types, transfer connections between layers), I also wonder how to set the hyperparameters for baselines, especially in Table 2, because choosing the transfer connections between different architectures is very important when using feature-based methods such as FitNet and AT.\n- Moreover, the baselines are developed for improving distillation performance, not replacing KD. Especially, feature-based methods (e.g., FitNet, NST) are easily combined with logit-based ones (e.g., KD). So I think the compatibility between the proposed and exisiting methods should be checked. However, in this paper, only Table 4 shows the compatibility with KD (CRD+KD).\n- The authors compare the proposed method with only KD, AT, FitNet except Table 1-3. For example, when evaluating the transferability (Table 4), why other baselines are not compared?\n- VID also maximizes MI between penultimate layers. What is the key difference and why CRD perform better? I think detailed verfication should be provided in the paper.\n\nMinor Comments\n- Comparison with Online-KD is unfair because it does not use pre-trained ResNet32.\n- Why only use penultimate layers? CRD between intermediate layers is also available like VID.\n- A result in Table 1 is missing (FSP WRN40-2 -> WRN40-1).\n- In Section 4, both CKD (contrastive knowledge distillation) and CRD (contrastive representation distillation) are used, so one of them should be removed.\n- In Section 4.1 Transferability paragraph, \"Table 3\" should be changed to \"Table 4\".\n- On page 4, \"space\" after \"before the inner product.\" should be removed.\n\nI think the proposed method is well-principled and provides meaningful improvements on various distillation settings, thus this paper seems to be above the borderline. It would be better if additional supports for the above concerns is provided in a rebuttal."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1708/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1708/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Contrastive Representation Distillation", "authors": ["Yonglong Tian", "Dilip Krishnan", "Phillip Isola"], "authorids": ["yonglong@mit.edu", "dilipkay@google.com", "phillipi@mit.edu"], "keywords": ["Knowledge Distillation", "Representation Learning", "Contrastive Learning", "Mutual Information"], "TL;DR": "Representation/knowledge distillation by maximizing mutual information between teacher and student", "abstract": "  Often we wish to transfer representational knowledge from one neural network to another.
