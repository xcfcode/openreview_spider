Instead of using KL, the authors propose using symmetric KL. Also to further improve performance the authors also suggest matching the marginal distributions and conditional distributions. \n\nI think the idea of matching marginals, conditionals and joint distributions together can be useful. However the paper is not very clearly written, and also experimental study is somewhat weak.\n\n1. How many discriminators you used for estimating the density ratios? My understanding is that you need 4?\n2. What is sn-dcgan in Table 1?\n3. What do you mean by showing the embedding in Figure 1?\n4. How does your method compare to ALI/ALICE quantitatively?\n\nI understand it's a bit strict to ask a workshop abstract to perform thorough experiments. But given the fact that we have so many variants of GANs (and many of them generates very good looking images), I think it's important to demonstrate the advantage of a new approach via clear quantitative analysis.\n\nIn summary, the abstract contains novel ideas, but in all doesn't quite meet the \"late-breaking developments, very novel ideas and position papers\" criteria.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variational Implicit Distribution Matching", "abstract": "Modeling with implicit distributions such as GAN is effective technique in the probabilistic generative models because of its flexibility and few assumptions on the target distribution.

They then argue that joint-distribution-matching does not lead to good reconstructions and causes missing modes; so they add to the objective function distribution matching to enforce the conditional and marginals.\n\nThe paper is not well-written; aside from the verbose mathematical derivations, it was hard to ground each of these distributions into something concrete in terms of a probability model, variational approximation, and data distribution. I recommend the authors make connections clearer to individual distributions.\n\nI also am not convinced that joint-distribution-matching is why ALI has poor reconstruction and missing modes: please back this up with empirical evidence (or related literature).\n\nOverall, the objective function seems overly complicated: Can you clarify the computional considerations, for example, how many neural networks/parameters, how many forward passes are required per neural network? Can you do an ablation study dropping individual terms of the objective to verify your claims about why conditionals or marginals are as important to include in the objective?
