The authors specifically consider the orthogonal initialization, and prove that with the orthogonal initialization proposed in equation (4), the gradient descent can achieve zero training error in a linear convergence rate. The improvement of the orthogonal initialization lies at the dependence of the layer width $m$, which is independent of the network depth $L$.\n\nThe problem considered in this work is very interesting since there are lots of empirical studies show that good initialization can benefit the training of deep neural networks. However, my main concern about this work is its novelty, especially for the proof techniques used in the current paper. It seems that most of the proofs are similar to the previous work Du & Hu (2019), and the main reason that it can remove the dependence of $L$ seems to be Lemma 4.2, which can be derived using the orthogonal property of the initialization. In this sense, there is not too much contribution for the current paper given the previous work Du & Hu (2019). Are there any other significant changes need to be made in the proofs to get the main results? If the authors can provide the convergence guarantees of the stochastic gradient descent, the contributions would be strong. \n\nFor the proof of Theorem 5.1, is it a straightforward extension of the proofs in Shamir (2018)? What is the main challenge when prove the general $d$ case?\n\n\nMinor comments:\nFor the last equation in (4), why you need $W_L(0)W_L(0)^\\top=mI_{d_y}$ instead of $W_L(0)^\\top W_L(0)=d_yI$ as you used in the later proofs?\n\nThere is no experiment to verify the theory\n\nUpdate:\nI thank the authors for their response, I would like to keep my score.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1665/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1665/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["huwei@cs.princeton.edu", "xlc@google.com", "jpennin@google.com"], "title": "Provable Benefit of Orthogonal Initialization in Optimizing Deep Linear Networks", "authors": ["Wei Hu", "Lechao Xiao", "Jeffrey Pennington"], "pdf": "/pdf/a60d8aafaea6e5267adae54c4ed91ca061e858b4.pdf", "TL;DR": "We provide for the first time a rigorous proof that orthogonal initialization speeds up convergence relative to Gaussian initialization, for deep linear networks.", "abstract": "The selection of initial parameter values for gradient-based optimization of deep neural networks is one of the most impactful hyperparameter choices in deep learning systems, affecting both convergence times and model performance.

Please see our response to each individual question below.\n\n\n\u2014 Similarity to Du and Hu (2019) \u2014\nWhile the proof technique for our result on orthogonal initialization (Thm 4.1) is similar to that of Du and Hu (2019), we\u2019d like to stress that the contribution of this paper is much more than the specific proof of this theorem.\n\nFirst of all, we believe that the main contribution of this paper should be the results themselves rather than the specific proof techniques. We establish rigorously that orthogonal initialization can drastically speed up optimization compared with Gaussian initialization in deep linear networks, which was empirically observed in a lot of previous work without a formal theoretical justification except for initialization.\n\nFurthermore, our negative result on Gaussian initialization (Thm 5.1) is an important piece of the paper (which takes up at least half of the technical part of the paper). This result is novel - there was no such result in Du and Hu (2019), and its proof is not adapted from any previous work (see our response to Reviewer 3).\n\n\n\u2014 Can use identity matrices in intermediate layers & only the randomness of the last layer is used \u2014\nYou are correct. Thanks for pointing out! It is true that we can just use identity initialization in intermediate layers. We think this is due to the specialness of linear networks. When generalizing this result to deep non-linear networks (on-going work), the randomness in all layers becomes important. Such randomness was also used in previous work that studied orthogonal random initializations, e.g. Pennington et al. (2017, 2018).\n\n[Pennington et al. (2017)] Resurrecting the sigmoid in deep learning through dynamical isometry: theory and practice.\n[Pennington et al. (2018)] The emergence of spectral universality in deep networks.\n\n\n\u2014 Distribution of $W_L(0)$ \u2014\n$W_L(0)$ has size $d_y \\times m (d_y \\le m)$ and is drawn from the uniform measure over all row-orthogonal matrices satisfying $W_L(0)W_L(0)^\\top = mI_{d_y}$. Then $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt m} W_L(0)$ has unit-length orthogonal rows. When $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt m} W_L(0)$ is multiplied by $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, it\u2019s effectively projecting $z$ onto $d_y$ random directions (corresponding to rows of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt m} W_L(0)$), and as a result we can apply concentration bounds on the norm of this product. Thank you for raising the confusion, and we will explain this more clearly in the paper.\n\n\n\u2014 Experiment \u2014\nThank you for the suggestion! We have added a short experiment section (Section 6) to the paper. We train a family of deep linear networks with their widths ranging in [10, 1000] and depths ranging in [1, 700]. Each network is trained on the same dataset using gradient descent starting from both Gaussian and orthogonal initialization, and we produce heat-maps whose colors exhibit the losses after 10,000 steps for all configurations.\n\nThe heat-maps clearly demonstrate a sharp transition from untrainable to trainable when we increase the width of the network. For Gaussian initialization, this transition occurs across a contour characterized by a linear relation between width and depth; for orthogonal initialization, the transition occurs at a width that is approximately independent of the depth. These observations match our theory excellently.

Shamir\u2019s proof relies on several special properties of 1-dim linear networks, such as a gradient norm bound for weights near initialization (Lemma 3 in his paper). Due to such specialness, his proof cannot be extended to any dimension greater than 1, as explicitly mentioned in his paper. Our result not only deals with multiple dimensions, but also reveals a nearly tight relation between width and depth for trainability (see paragraph after Thm 5.1). Key to our analysis is a careful control on the spectral norm of $A_{j:i}$ at initialization (Lemma 5.3) and after perturbations during training (Lemma 5.4). An important element in establishing the result is identifying the right things to bound and the right bounds for them.\n\n\n\u2014 On $W_L(0)$ \u2014\nWe sample $W_L(0)$ from the uniform measure over all row-orthogonal matrices satisfying $W_L(0)W_L(0)^\\top = mI_{d_y}$.

Most of the problem setup, analysis techniques and proof roadmap are adapted from Du & Hu (2019). The difference is the orthogonal initialization compared with the Gaussian initialization in Du & Hu (2019). Since the product of orthogonal weight matrices is identity, the new initialization can remove the dependency of the number of nodes $m$ on the depth $L$ of the network. The authors also proved a lower bound of the loss function trained by Gaussian initialization within certain iterations. This justifies the disadvantage of Gaussian initialization.\n\nMy biggest concern is that this paper seems to be very similar to Du & Hu (2019) in many places. The whole Sections 3 & 4 are almost the same as Sections 3,4,5 & 7 in their paper. The contribution in this paper is too incremental given previous work. \n\nWhat is the advantage of using orthogonal matrices in (4) compared with just using identity matrices as initialization? Can we prove the same result with just identity initialization? In this case, what would we lose by restricting us to this special case?\n\nIn the proof of Lemma 4.2, it seems that only the randomness of the last layer $W_L(0)$ is used. Why do we need all the layers to be uniformly sampled?\n\nIt should be explained in more details that $W_L(0)$ is drawn from a uniform distribution over orthogonal matrices in $d_y\\times d_y$ space. Then $1/\\sqrt{m} W_L(0)\\cdot z /\\|z\\|^2$ is not distributed on the whole space of $d_y$-sphere. The argument in the proof of Lemma 4.2 thus needs more justification.\n\nIt would be interesting to see an empirical comparison of the proposed initialization and the Gaussian initialization. Due to the lower bound proved in this paper, the experiments are expected to show distinct difference between these two.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1665/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1665/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["huwei@cs.princeton.edu", "xlc@google.com", "jpennin@google.com"], "title": "Provable Benefit of Orthogonal Initialization in Optimizing Deep Linear Networks", "authors": ["Wei Hu", "Lechao Xiao", "Jeffrey Pennington"], "pdf": "/pdf/a60d8aafaea6e5267adae54c4ed91ca061e858b4.pdf", "TL;DR": "We provide for the first time a rigorous proof that orthogonal initialization speeds up convergence relative to Gaussian initialization, for deep linear networks.", "abstract": "The selection of initial parameter values for gradient-based optimization of deep neural networks is one of the most impactful hyperparameter choices in deep learning systems, affecting both convergence times and model performance.
