Specifically, they focus on the noisy-robust (NR) variant of the action robust framework proposed in [1]. As noted in [1], as strong duality does not hold in the NR variant it can not be solved using deterministic policies (pure strategies).\nThe authors propose to combine SGLD with DDPG, to maintain a distribution over deterministic policies (essentially a mixed strategy) - hence overcoming these issues.\nThe results look promising, outperforming [1] in all tested domains.\n\nReview:\nOverall this seems like the first approach of using Bayesian learning in order to reach mixed Nash equilibrium in RL. This is super-important, since many problems can be formulated as zero-sum games for which the solution is not necessarily a pure strategy.\nAs [2] have already shown the ability of this concept to find mixed equilibria in GANs, the main novelty is the introduction to RL.\n\nAs this work does not introduce new theory or a dramatic new concept, I feel that the acceptance of this work lies mainly on the empirical side. In my opinion, the experiments need to be more convincing - for instance, include additional domains (such as the Inverted Pendulum which was a failure case in [1]) and additional forms of robustness (e.g., the probabilistic-robust variant from [1] which is based on deterministic strategies and was shown to work better, and RARL [3] which test robustness to external disturbances).\nAn addition option is to build a low-dimensional toy problem in which the exact solution is known. This will enable you to show that while the naive solution in [1] either does not converge or converges to sub-optimal solutions, the SGLD approach is capable of finding superior solutions (hopefully the global optimum).\n\nThe idea is in the right direction. However, in my opinion, it is not there yet and is thus not ready for ICLR.\n\n--- Post Rebuttal ---\n\nI stand by my original assessment. I feel that such work needs to be more convincing. I for one would feel more confident had the authors provided simpler experiments in which they show that their approach indeed converges to the mixed Nash equilibria while the NR-DDPG approach from [1] does not.\nI did overall like this direction and I believe Robustness in RL is very important.\n\n\n[1] Action Robust Reinforcement Learning and Applications in Continuous Control - Tessler et al. 2019\n[2] Finding mixed nash equilibria of generative adversarial networks - Hsieh et al. 2019\n[3] Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning - Pinto et al. 2017", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2205/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2205/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Robust Reinforcement Learning via Adversarial Training with  Langevin Dynamics", "authors": ["Huang Yu-Ting", "Parameswaran Kamalaruban", "Paul Rolland", "Ya-Ping Hsieh", "Volkan Cevher"], "authorids": ["yu.huang@epfl.ch", "kamalaruban.parameswaran@epfl.ch", "paul.rolland@epfl.ch", "ya-ping.hsieh@epfl.ch", "volkan.cevher@epfl.ch"], "keywords": ["deep reinforcement learning", "robust reinforcement learning", "min-max problem"], "abstract": "We re-think the Two-Player Reinforcement Learning (RL) as an instance of a distribution sampling problem in infinite dimensions.

As mentioned before I don't have the background to carefully assess the experiments and will have to rely on my fellow reviewers here. However I stand by my opinion that the experimental results would need to be very strong to warrant an acceptance, since the conceptual contribution is relatively limited.\nI was also disappointed by the authors unwillingness to back up their claims of \"theoretically convergent\" with a proof, or at least a theorem. Therefore I still tend towards rejecting the paper.\n-----------------------------------------------\nSummary\nThe present work proposes to use the recently developed Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) to compute mixed approximate equilibria in two-player reinforcement learning, following the methodology proposed by hsieh et al for generative adversarial networks. The authors report practical improvements compared to pure strategies computed as proposed by Tessler et al.\n\nDecision\nThe idea of using randomized strategies for two-player reinforcement learning is interesting and natural. However, as the authors note, mixed strategies are classical in game theory. Furthermore, the adaption of the methodology of hsieh et al is straightforward, limiting the strength of the theoretical contribution. \nUnfortunately, the theoretical contribution is not stated consistently, since in the introduction, the paper states \"Our paper precisely bridges this gap between theory and practice in previous works, by proposing the \ufb01rst theoretically convergent algorithm for robust RL\", but this claim is missing in the abstract or conclusion, and there is no theorem that justifies this rather strong claim. \nIn my opinion, this paper should only be accepted if it provides very convincing numerical experiments, which I am not qualified to assess. I happy to increase my score if the experimental results are deemed strong by the reviewers with more expertise in practical reinforcement learning.\n\nQuestions to authors\nYou write \"Our paper precisely bridges this gap between theory and practice in previous works, by proposing the \ufb01rst theoretically convergent algorithm for robust RL\".

Please see further our previous comment. \n\nWe now would like to argue that the technical contribution is also sufficient. \n\nFirst of all, thanks for acknowledging that our approach as the first approach of using SGLD to reach the mixed Nash equilibrium in reinforcement learning (RL). The mixed Nash perspective should be investigated further as it also sheds light into popular problems, such as self-play. As a result, bringing this to the attention of the literature is important. \n\nWhile the two player algorithm via the Langevin dynamics is the same algorithm from [1], there is no need to improve on it since it is already theoretically grounded. We do not need to provide new infinite dimensional convergence theorems to show that it is useful in RL. We thought that the mixed setting itself is novel and that we do not need to obfuscate the contributions, and hence, we relied on a state-of-the-art algorithm [1]. \n\nHowever, we observe in our paper that the algorithm in [1] is computationally demanding even though it uses a mean approximation in its inner loop (which already saves significant resources). \n\nAs a result, we introduced a new approximation by setting delta=0 and K_t=1. You can see this as just applying entropic mirror descent with a short inner loop for a sampling problem that has a dirac delta solution (i.e., there is no mixed solution but just a pure solution). \n\nEven in this pure case, the new algorithm performs superior to the baseline (i.e., non-robust DDPG algorithm) with similar per iteration computational complexity to DDPG itself; cf., Figure 3. This simultaneous improvement should also not be understated since it has implications in all the applications of DDPG. \n\nIn the light of these observations, we respectfully ask the reviewers to acknowledge that our novelty is sufficient for publication. \n\nbest,\nAuthors \n\n\n[1] Finding mixed nash equilibria of generative adversarial networks - Hsieh et al. 2019\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2205/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2205/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Robust Reinforcement Learning via Adversarial Training with  Langevin Dynamics", "authors": ["Huang Yu-Ting", "Parameswaran Kamalaruban", "Paul Rolland", "Ya-Ping Hsieh", "Volkan Cevher"], "authorids": ["yu.huang@epfl.ch", "kamalaruban.parameswaran@epfl.ch", "paul.rolland@epfl.ch", "ya-ping.hsieh@epfl.ch", "volkan.cevher@epfl.ch"], "keywords": ["deep reinforcement learning", "robust reinforcement learning", "min-max problem"], "abstract": "We re-think the Two-Player Reinforcement Learning (RL) as an instance of a distribution sampling problem in infinite dimensions.

We obtain superior performance on the inverted pendulum, which is the failure case for [1]; cf., Figures 1 and 3.\n\nRegarding these two figures, we would like to emphasize that the baseline in Figure 1 is the action robust-DDPG algorithm proposed in [1], and the baseline in Figure 3 is the standard non-robust DDPG algorithm, which is the baseline for [1].\n\n2. We include additional results with MuJoCo environments: Swimmer, Reacher, and Humanoid. SGLD-DDPG performs clearly better than the baseline [1] in these examples. \n\nRegarding the additional as well as the previous results, note that we have done all the standard/common set of experiments reported in robust deep-RL papers. In particular, please compare our numerical evidence and that of [1]: Both have 8 MuJoCo environments. Finally, similar to [1], we have also followed the best practices prescribed in [2]. \n\n3. We are currently trying to setup the hide and seek environment from openAI, which creates a stylized two-player case. Since the setting is simple, we expect both our algorithm and the baseline to perform similarly; however, it is nonetheless a great warm up exercise to show the contrast that follows with superior performance on the MuJoCo environment as well as the inverted pendulum. We hope to include this result before the rebuttal deadline; we can for sure include it in the camera ready, if accepted. \n\nIn summary, we believe that our numerical evidence is more than sufficient.

THE NR-MDPs can be thought of as an agent learning in an adversarial environment.\nThe paper is well written and the references pointed to give sufficient background to understand the problem undertaken.\nMost of the theory comes from the \"Finding mixed nash equilibria of generative adversarial networks.\" (ICML, 2019), and the papers main contribution lies in applying the theory to reinforcement learning.\nIt is not altogether unexpected though that Langevin Dynamics give better results than the more standard gradient-based approach considered for saddle-point problems, that's what they are supposed to do. But, this seems to be the first time SGLD has been applied to such a problem.\nThe authors compare on the MuJoCo benchmark with common but not identical instances to \"Action robust reinforcement learning and applications in continuous control\", which also provides the baseline algorithm used for comparison. Mentioned in this paper is the difficulty of solving the \"inverted pendulum\" instance by the algorithm proposed therein. It is infact mentioned as a failure case. Maybe, the authors can show results on the same. \nAdditionally, maybe it would make sense to have an ablation study of the hyper-parameters from Table 1. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2205/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2205/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Robust Reinforcement Learning via Adversarial Training with  Langevin Dynamics", "authors": ["Huang Yu-Ting", "Parameswaran Kamalaruban", "Paul Rolland", "Ya-Ping Hsieh", "Volkan Cevher"], "authorids": ["yu.huang@epfl.ch", "kamalaruban.parameswaran@epfl.ch", "paul.rolland@epfl.ch", "ya-ping.hsieh@epfl.ch", "volkan.cevher@epfl.ch"], "keywords": ["deep reinforcement learning", "robust reinforcement learning", "min-max problem"], "abstract": "We re-think the Two-Player Reinforcement Learning (RL) as an instance of a distribution sampling problem in infinite dimensions.
