A connection is provided to mutual information regularization.  Compared to entropic regularization, this approach is expected to work better when actions have significantly different importance.    The algorithm is shown to beat baselines in 11 out of 19 Atari games.\n\nThe paper is well written.  The derivation is novel, and the resulting algorithm is interesting and has good empirical results.  A few concerns were raised in initial reviews, including certain questions about experiments and potential negative impacts of the use of nonuniform action priors in MIRL.  The author responses and the new version were quite helpful, and all reviewers agree the paper is an interesting contribution.\n\nIn a revised version, the authors are encouraged to\n  (1) include a discussion of when MIRL might fail, and\n  (2) improve the related work section to compare the proposed method to other entropy regularized RL (sometimes under a different name in the literature), for example the following recent works and the references therein:\n    https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07798\n    http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/asadi17a.html\n    http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6870-bridging-the-gap-between-value-and-policy-based-reinforcement-learning\n    http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/dai18c.html", "confidence": "4: The area chair is confident but not absolutely certain", "recommendation": "Accept (Poster)", "title": "Interesting contribution that improves on the widely used entropy regularized algorithms"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper643/Area_Chair1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper643/Area_Chair1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Soft Q-Learning with Mutual-Information Regularization", "abstract": "We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that uses mutual-information regularization to optimize a prior action distribution for better performance and exploration.

However, earlier DQN papers do report an epsilon value of 0.05 for evaluation (original DQN in Mnih et al. 2015, double DQN in van Hasselt et al. 2016, prioritized DQN in Schaul et al. 2016). While an epsilon value of 0.01 might improve evaluation results, we feel a value of 0.05 is not unreasonable since we compare all methods under the same evaluation procedure.

The intuition is that limits in transmission rate prevent overfitting on the training set. Similarly, in our work for the RL setting, limits in transmission rate prevent the agents to bootstrap with a \u2018harsh\u2019 max-operator that would lead to overestimation and sample inefficiency, but instead use a softened version less prone to overestimation with an adaptive prior that additionally improves exploration. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper643/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper643/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper643/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Soft Q-Learning with Mutual-Information Regularization", "abstract": "We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that uses mutual-information regularization to optimize a prior action distribution for better performance and exploration.

The novelty lies in learning a state-independent prior (instead of a state-dependent one) that can help exploration in the presence of universally unnecessary actions. They derive an equivalence to regularizing the mutual information between states and actions.\n\n** Quality: **\nThe paper is mathematically detailed and correct.\n\n** Clarity: **\nThe paper is sufficiently easy to follow and explains all the necessary background.\n\n** Originality & Significance: **\nThe paper proposes a novel idea: Using a learned state-independent prior as opposed to using a learned state-dependent prior. While not a big change in terms of mathematical theory, this could lead to positive and interesting results empirically for exploration. Indeed they show promising results on Atari games: It is easy to see how Atari games could benefit as they have up to 18 different actions, many of which are redundant. \n\nMy two main points where I think the paper could improve are:\n- More experimental results, in particular, how strong are the negative effects of MIRL if we have actions that are important, but have a lower probability in the stationary action distribution?\n- A related work section comparing their approach to the many recent similar papers in Maximum Entropy RL", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper643/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Soft Q-Learning with Mutual-Information Regularization", "abstract": "We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that uses mutual-information regularization to optimize a prior action distribution for better performance and exploration.

We also added a related work section to note that other algorithms have considered optimizing the ELBO with respect to both variational and prior policy. However, these approaches do not use the marginal prior or have any connection to mutual information but instead optimise the policy while staying close to the previous policy. Additionally, we moved the connection to Mutual information for the case of gamma -> 1 to the appendix, and adopted another way to show this connection similar to what the reviewer has proposed.\n\n\n\nThe experiments could be strengthened by addressing the following:\n* What was epsilon during training? Why was epsilon = 0.05 in evaluation? This is quite high compared to previous work, and it makes sense that this would degrade MIRLs performance less than DQN and SQL.\n\n----------->[Epsilon in training and evaluation] Epsilon during training was decayed from 1.0 to 0.1 over the first 10^6 steps of the experiment. We used a fixed evaluation epsilon of 0.05. This procedure is standard in the literature for ATARI, as introduced by the DQN paper (see e.g. Mnih et al, 2015 ). We understand that in later DQN papers (e.g. Rainbow) different values for these hyperparameters have been used but we feel our choice is not unreasonable.\n\n\n\n* What is the performance of SQL if we use \\rho as the action selector in \\epsilon-greedy. This would help understand if the performance gains are due to the impact on the policy or due to the changes in the behavior policy.\n\n----------->[On marginal exploration] We have run additional experiments combining SQL with marginal exploration. Using the marginal exploration helps SQL, but MIRL still achieves the best performance.\n\n* Plotting beta over time\n----------->[Plotting beta] We include the beta values evolving over time in the appendix. Additionally, we also include a more relevant term (beta x Qvalues).\n* Comparing the action distributions for SQL and MIRL to understand the impact of the penalty. In general, a deeper analysis of the impact on the policy is important.\n* Are their environments we would expect MIRL to outperform SQL based on your theoretical understanding? Does it? * How many seeds were run per game?\n----------->[Policy and grid world] Responding the previous two questions: We have added additional experiments and plots to the paper in an effort to  provide more insight into the behavior of our method. These experiments include a simple grid world in which we expect MIRL to outperform SQL and a grid world in which we expect the prior to have negative effects (as suggested by another reviewer).\n* How and why were the 19 games selected from the full set?\n------------->[On other aspects] Due to computational constraints we were not able to run experiments on the full set of ATARI games. Therefore, we selected a subset of 20 random games, without prior experimentation on any of the games. We then evaluated our method using a single seed for every game. Data for experiments on 1 game were lost because of a cloud instance failure.  \n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper643/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper643/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper643/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Soft Q-Learning with Mutual-Information Regularization", "abstract": "We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that uses mutual-information regularization to optimize a prior action distribution for better performance and exploration.

Hyperparameter values were chosen by using values reported in the literature. Values for the new parameters introduced by MIRL were fixed by running a small number of exploratory experiments. Overall, we found the algorithm to be robust to changes in these values. All other hyperparameters were kept the same for all algorithms. \n\n\nWhile it is true that the prior does not converge in all of our ATARI experiments, we note that during the later stages of learning the plots do show a higher probability for subsets of actions. We have empirically observed that convergence of the prior can take a very long time, especially when the learner is still improving.  We expect that, given enough time, the probabilities of the marginal policy will eventually settle. Additionally, in these experiments we used a non-decaying learning rate for the marginal policy. This means that we can expect some oscillation due to tracking behaviour of our approximation, while the policy and state distribution still change.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper643/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper643/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper643/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Soft Q-Learning with Mutual-Information Regularization", "abstract": "We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that uses mutual-information regularization to optimize a prior action distribution for better performance and exploration.

MPO proposes a general coordinate ascent type optimization in which the ELBO is updated in alternating steps, either with respect to the variational policy or the prior policy (while the other policy is kept fixed). Different design choices for the policies and optimization procedures give rise to different, but related algorithms. This approach is also common in variational inference based policy search and describes a large family of related policy search algorithms (see Deisendroth et al, 2013 for an overview.)\n\nOur algorithm follows recent soft Q-learning algorithms (e.g. Fox et al, 2016, Haarnoja et al. 2017). These algorithms consider the same ELBO, but omit the optimization with respect to the prior policy and only optimize the variational policy pi.  This can be seen as an entropy-regularized version of standard Q-learning algorithms.  When the prior is fixed to be a constant uninformative policy, this procedure reduces to max-entropy policy learning. The algorithm replaces the classic Bellman operator with a soft Bellman-operator to prevent deviations from a state-independent fixed prior policy. Several papers (e.g.Haarnoja et al 2017, Schulman et al 2017 ) have shown that these \u201csoftened\u201d algorithms offer advantages over their unsoftened counterparts, in terms of exploration, generalization and composability. Our approach further improves on soft Q-learning (as shown in our Atari experiments) by allowing for optimizing the prior (while still being state-independent). As shown in the paper, this results in a mutual information constraint (rather than a max entropy constraint) on the resulting policy.\n\nSo while we follow the same general scheme as soft Q-learning, we do update our prior policy as in the MPO algorithm. However, contrary to MPO, we do not consider the alternating, coordinate descent style optimization. Rather than executing a separate prior maximization step, we solve the ELBO for the optimal prior in the special case of state-independent priors.  We then directly estimate this optimal prior in our algorithm, instead of performing a gradient style update on the ELBO. While it is possible to consider the same class of state-independent priors with MPO, the way in which both algorithms optimize the ELBO will still be different. \n\nA modified MPO that uses a state-independent generative policy would converge to a solution that is penalized by an optimal marginal policy. However, since the parameter epsilon (that determines the deviation between the variational and the generative policy) is fixed and not scheduled in the course of training, the final solution is still constrained by the marginal policy which is sub-optimal because it is state-independent. This constraint would essentially limit the asymptotic performance of such a modified MPO. Of course, this could be alleviated by setting epsilon to a large value but this would correspond to an ordinary actor critic  approach without any regularization in the policy.\n\nIf the prior policy in our algorithm is replaced by a state-dependent prior, the optimal solution for such a prior is the variational policy (i.e. pi) itself. This essentially would eliminate the KL-constraint and reduce our algorithm to standard Q-learning. Q-learning is known to suffer from sample-inefficiency caused by the hard max-operator in the target (this leads to overestimated q-values). This is exactly the problem that was been addressed by soft Q-learning with entropy regularization. \n\nDeisenroth, M. P., Neumann, G., & Peters, J. (2013). A survey on policy search for robotics.

The difference between the variational inference formulation in MPO and our variational inference formulation is the following:\n- The policy of the generative model in our case is state-independent (similar to [1]) with the optimal solution being the marginal distribution over actions ([1] does not consider an optimal marginal distribution though). In contrast, in MPO the generative policy is state-dependent and given by the previous-round behavioural policy. \n\nImportantly, our specific choice of state-dependent variational policy and state-independent generative policy directly leads to a mutual information regularizer. Note that the mutual information is not any expected KL, but a specific expected KL under the assumption of an optimal marginal policy (which is exactly what we model). MPO does not have the notion of an optimal marginal policy (in the sense of a state-independent marginal policy) and therefore the expected KL in MPO is not a mutual information.\n\nIn our experimental section we empirically validate that our mutual information regularized objective leads to improvements over soft-q learning (see [1]) where the generative policy is also state-independent but not subject to optimization (but instead given by a uniform distribution). \n\nWe will clarify this point in a revised version of the manuscript.\n\n[1] Levine, S.
