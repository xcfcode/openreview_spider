In theory, this would allow the planning method to operate in an abstract, high-level space and delegate low-level action selection to policies trained on simulated rollouts. If I understand the paper correctly, the result of the LSP learning algorithm is the skill policy and a (fixed?) distribution over a skill variable; no planning is performed at test time. This only became clear when reading the section on further work, since the abstract states \"For this, actions are produced by a policy that is learned over time while the skills it conditions on are chosen using online planning.\". If there is indeed no planning during evaluation I would propose that \"online planning\" is not an apt description of the architecture. I general however, I like how the presented algorithm mixes MI-based skill discovery (which is typically unsupervised) with explicit supervision via long-horizon planning and would regard this a useful contribution to the current literature on hierarchical RL.\n\nMy rating is mainly influenced by the experimental section, as well as several minor issues with the overall presentation. The experiments show that the method is at least as good, and sometimes better, than Dreamer when training from scratch, and universally (although marginally) better when adapting to new tasks.  This is a good result, but some relevant details on the tasks and plots are missing, which make the achievements hard to interpret (see below). The difference to Dreamer is most pronounced on the \"Quadruped Run Pixels\" task, but as mentioned before it's not easy to judge the results; for example, in Figure 8 in the Dreamer paper they report scores of ~750 after 2e6 environment steps. It would also be helpful to provide reference numbers for a standard model-free algorithm on those tasks. The \"Random Skills\" baseline performs very poorly; does it still include the intrinsic rewards to ensure diversity of skills? What would happen if you would drop them so that you basically have Dreamer with an additional random skill input (cf. the \"Switching Ensemble\" baseline from [Why Does Hierarchy (Sometimes) Work So Well in Reinforcement Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10618))? Finally, the experiments don't give much insight into the nature of skills that have been discovered. In particular, what do the resulting skill distributions look like?\n\nSeveral aspects of the experimental section are unclear to me and hinder the interpretation of the results:\n- Several crucial details on the environments are missing, such as the reward functions. For \"Quadruped Reach\", is the goal constant or randomly selected for each episode?\n- In Figure 3, what does the x-Axis represent?\n- In Figure 3, tasks like \"Quadruped Run\", \"WalkerRun Pixels\" and \"Quadruped Run Pixels\" don't seem to be trained to convergence.\n- There is a significant drop in performance at x=0.4 for \"Quadruped Reach\" for some seeds.\n- In 4.4., the text for \"Quadruped GetUp Walk -> Reach Goal\" does not line up with the descriptions in 4.1. as it says the pretraining task would be to run as fast as possible rather than getting up and walking.\n- In the same paragraph: \"We see that LSP can adapt much quickly to the transfer task, achieving a reward of 500 only after 70, 000 steps, while Dreamer requires 130, 000 steps to achieve the same reward\". From Figure 4 this appears to be the result for \"Quadruped Walk -> Reach Goal\", and in addition it's also worth noting that Dreamer catches up pretty soon afterwards (even though LSP maintains higher performance throughout training).\n- For the transfer experiments, it would be useful to include the learning curves from Figure 3 so that it is apparent whether it is generally beneficial to adapt a pretrained model as opposed to learning from scratch.\n\nA few more notes on the overall write-up:\n- The site with videos linked to in the abstract is empty\n- In the introduction, it's not immediately clear what \"amortized\" means even though it is mentioned several times. My interpretation is that it means that you use a learned model to train a policy rather than using the model during evaluation. The term could be described more explicitly; in particular I was slightly confused by the notion of \"amortizing over the entire training experience\".\n- At the end of Section 5, regarding Dreamer: \"[...], which is fast even for high-dimensional action spaces, but cannot directly transfer to new environments with different dynamics and reward functions.\" This is in contradiction to the transfer experiments in 4.4. which show a good amount of transfer performance?\n- Figure 2b) and c): $\\phi$ in text vs. $\\Phi$ in figure.\n- In section 3 the reference should be to Figure 2 rather than 2b)?\n- In section 3, \"Low level policy\", it would be good to cite the Dreamer paper once more.\n- In 3.1, \"Behavior Learning.\", the backwards skill predictor is mentioned but not introduced yet. Refer to section 3.2 for a definition?\n- Section 3.2.: it would be good to relate the MI objective to previous methods. The resulting objective looks quite similar to [Variational Intrinsic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07507).\n- Section 5: DADS is mentioned, but it might be also be worth noting that they performed experiments with online planning on top of the discovered skills.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1425/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1425/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Latent Skill Planning for Exploration and Transfer", "authorids": ["~Kevin_Xie1", "~Homanga_Bharadhwaj1", "~Danijar_Hafner1", "~Animesh_Garg1", "~Florian_Shkurti1"], "authors": ["Kevin Xie", "Homanga Bharadhwaj", "Danijar Hafner", "Animesh Garg", "Florian Shkurti"], "keywords": ["Model-Based Reinforcement Learning", "World Models", "Skill Discovery", "Mutual Information", "Planning", "Model Predictive Control", "Partial Amortization"], "abstract": "To quickly solve new tasks in complex environments, intelligent agents need to build up reusable knowledge.

Considering my initial misunderstanding of a fixed skill distribution at test time, I'll raise my score to 5.\n\nRegarding the model-free baseline, I actually wanted to see a non-hierarchical model-free baseline (sorry for not being 100% clear on this). For example, similar to Dreamer, it would be good to add a \"top-line\" of the result that D4PG achieves at convergence. These numbers are available in the dm_control paper. This way, it would be clear that the proposed algorithm learns faster but might not be able to reach the final performance of a non-hierarchical method (for example, https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00690v1 reports a mean score of 560.4 for \"Hopper Hop\" after 1e8 steps, while your algorithm achieves ~300). However, I definitely also appreciate that you added the comparison to HIRO.\n\nIt would be great if you could fix the plotting error for Quadruped Reach.

The approach is shown to be more sample efficient than a recent model-base RL approach (Dreamer), and is able to learn to solve a new (but related) in simple walking tasks relatively faster as well.\n\nStrengths:\n+ The main idea (planning over low-level dimension and learning amortized low-level policy over high-dimension) is intriguing and makes a lot of sense, especially compared to alternative learning schemes such as purely CEM or purely amortized policy training.\n\n+ The approach is well motivated and is easy to understand.\n\n+ The results in simple tasks show promising results over existing approaches. \n\n+ I find the background and the discussion of the connection between existing model-based approaches and the proposed method very helpful.\n\nWeakness:\n- The high-level skill planner / generator p(z |\\cdot) does not seem to rely on the physical states, which is different from typical HRL approaches where the option/subgoal at each step depends on the latest state, e.g., p(z^t | s^t). This seems to suggest that the plan of skills for a task is somewhat fixed regardless of the initial or immediate states. This may work when the environment is simple and does not vary a lot from episode to episode; but I can not see how this formulation can tackle more complex scenarios. Moreover, a fixed hyper-parameter 'K' seems to require additional tuning for new tasks and environments, which may make the approach less 'generalizable.'\n\n- On a related note, it would be good to see more discussion on the advantages of the proposed skill generator/planner over the prior work on HRL. The related work section briefly mentions some prior work, but there is no detailed theoretical and/or empirical comparison. As of now, it is not clear to me how this is better than conventional HRL methods (e.g., learning a high-level policy).\n\n- The main objective of the approach seems to be improving the transferability of skills learned by RL as stated in the main text and in the title. However, the transfer setting is quite simple (from 'learning to walking' to 'learning to walk to a goal location'). I would be more interested in seeing more difficult settings such as walking in new and complex environments (e.g., with obstacles). It is also not clear to me what exactly is transferred here. Is it the low-level policy? Is it the high-level skill plan? Based on my understanding, the authors may be aiming at the former. If so, a transfer setting where the low-level policies are fixed and only the high-level plans are updated / fine-tuned would be far more convincing. After all, I think that is what people would normally expect when you are claiming skill transfer, isn't? In fact, to my knowledge, some HRL approaches have attempted to reuse previously learned & fixed policies (e.g., [1,2]). I'm not saying that these approaches are better, but since the focus is skill transfer, I think a proper discussion/comparison would be critical. \n\nFor rebuttal, please address my concerns listed above. I think the paper presents an interesting and promising idea, but I am not fully convinced that the approach has the advantages as claimed in the paper.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Tessler et al., A Deep Hierarchical Approach to Lifelong Learning in Minecraft, AAAI 2017.\n\n[2] Shu et al., Hierarchical and Interpretable Skill Acquisition in Multi-task Reinforcement Learning, ICLR 2018.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1425/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1425/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Latent Skill Planning for Exploration and Transfer", "authorids": ["~Kevin_Xie1", "~Homanga_Bharadhwaj1", "~Danijar_Hafner1", "~Animesh_Garg1", "~Florian_Shkurti1"], "authors": ["Kevin Xie", "Homanga Bharadhwaj", "Danijar Hafner", "Animesh Garg", "Florian Shkurti"], "keywords": ["Model-Based Reinforcement Learning", "World Models", "Skill Discovery", "Mutual Information", "Planning", "Model Predictive Control", "Partial Amortization"], "abstract": "To quickly solve new tasks in complex environments, intelligent agents need to build up reusable knowledge.

Doing this yields slightly better or as good results as with updating the low level policy in the target environment. While, we still need to re-plan and update the skill distribution in the target environment, because the high-level skills which must be composed to solve the new task have changed from the source task. We have added details explaining this in Section 4.4 of the revised paper.**\n\n\nIs that a mistake or is there no evaluation of HIRO in environments with image-based observations? **We would like to kindly note that HIRO has not been shown to work from images in the original paper [1], and so we do not have learning curves for HIRO in the image-based environments, as it cannot scale directly to work with image based observations.**\n\nLastly, I would encourage the authors to provide more discussions on all the new experimental results in the main text **Thank you for pointing this out.

In particular, it is good (and surprising) to see that with fixed low-level policies, LSP can achieve a sightly better performance than the original version. I have to admit that this is a bit counter intuitive to me. This is not a criticism, but could you explain why a harder transfer setting where you don't refine the low-level policies can give you slightly better results? Also, I can't find the curves for HIRO in Figure 3 for the cheetah pixels, quadruped run pixels, and walkerrun pixels tasks. Is that a mistake or is there no evaluation of HIRO in environments with image-based observations? Lastly, I would encourage the authors to provide more discussions on all the new experimental results in the main text (currently I can only see the new curves in the figures)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1425/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1425/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Latent Skill Planning for Exploration and Transfer", "authorids": ["~Kevin_Xie1", "~Homanga_Bharadhwaj1", "~Danijar_Hafner1", "~Animesh_Garg1", "~Florian_Shkurti1"], "authors": ["Kevin Xie", "Homanga Bharadhwaj", "Danijar Hafner", "Animesh Garg", "Florian Shkurti"], "keywords": ["Model-Based Reinforcement Learning", "World Models", "Skill Discovery", "Mutual Information", "Planning", "Model Predictive Control", "Partial Amortization"], "abstract": "To quickly solve new tasks in complex environments, intelligent agents need to build up reusable knowledge.

The major review comments were about addition of new baselines, and issues with the clarity of writing/presentation in some places. We have now added two baselines - Dreamer with an additional random skill input (as mentioned by the reviewer), and a strong model-free Hierarchical RL baseline, HIRO [1]. In addition we have addressed the concerns with presentation and provided clarifications. \n\nWe would request the reviewer to revisit the paper in light of these revisions and clarifications, and let us know if any further reservations remain. We have highlighted major modifications, wherever possible in blue.\n\nIn the points below, we first paraphrase texts from the review, and provide our responses in bold.\n\n\nIf I understand the paper correctly, the result of the LSP learning algorithm is the skill policy and a (fixed?) distribution over a skill variable; no planning is performed at test time. **We would like to kindly clarify a misunderstanding here and point out that at test time we in fact do planning with MPC and the skill distribution is not fixed.**\n\nThe \"Random Skills\" baseline performs very poorly; does it still include the intrinsic rewards to ensure diversity of skills? What would happen if you would drop them so that you basically have Dreamer with an additional random skill input.  **We have now added this baseline named \"RandSkillsInp\" in Figure 3 of the paper. This performs slightly better than the previous Random Skills baseline (in yellow), but still the performance of this is not good. We believe that this is a strong indication of the utility of learned skills.**\n\nIt would also be helpful to provide reference numbers for a standard model-free algorithm on those tasks. **We have also added results for comparison with a strong model-free Hierarchical RL baseline, HIRO based on the authors' code that learns a high level policy and a low level policy, in Figures 3 and 4 of the revised paper.**\n\nSeveral crucial details on the environments are missing, such as the reward functions. For \"Quadruped Reach\", is the goal constant or randomly selected for each episode? **For the Quadruped Run, Quadruped Walk, Cheetah Run, Walker Run, Hopper Hop environments we used the standard reward functions from DM Control https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control For the Quadruped Reach task, the goal is randomly selected at the start of each episode, and there is a dense reward signal (as a function of the distance to goal) for the agent to reach the goal**\n\nIn Figure 3, what does the x-Axis represent? **We have mentioned in the first line of the caption that x-axis represents number of environment interactions in terms of fraction of 1 Million. We did not include it in the Figure itself due to space constraint in the figure**\n\nThere is a significant drop in performance at x=0.4 for \"Quadruped Reach\" for some seeds. **We apologize for the confusion. The drop at the very last datapoint showed up due to smoothing issues during plotting, and is not an actual drop in the performance of any of the seeds**\n\nIn 4.4., the text for \"Quadruped GetUp Walk -> Reach Goal\" does not line up with the descriptions in 4.1 **Thank you for pointing this out. We have fixed this line now.**\n\nThe site with videos linked to in the abstract is empty. **Sorry about this. We have fixed it now.**\n\nIn the introduction, it's not immediately clear what \"amortized\" means even though it is mentioned several times. **We have clarified this now. Amortization here refers to learning a parameterized policy, whose parameters are updated using samples during the training phase, and which can then be directly queried at each state to output an action, during evaluation.**\n\nFigure 2b) and c). **We have made the notations in the figure and the caption consistent now**\n\nIn section 3 the reference should be to Figure 2 rather than 2b)? **Yes, we have fixed this.**\n\nIn section 3, \"Low level policy\", it would be good to cite the Dreamer paper once more. **Thanks. We have done this now.**\n\nIn 3.1, \"Behavior Learning.\", the backwards skill predictor is mentioned but not introduced yet. Refer to section 3.2 for a definition?   **We have added the definition in section 3.1 as well now.**\n\n[1] Nachum, O., Gu, S.S., Lee, H. and Levine, S., 2018.

We address your questions and comments pointwise below. Our responses are in bold.\n\nThe approach consists of multiple learned components working together. I wonder how stable learning of such dependent separate components is, and how much tuning is required. Can authors comment on the stability of learning, and how their system would perform under different hyperparameter values? **The relevant hyper parameters added by our approach on top of Dreamer's are the skill duration, the reverse skill predictor input noise and settings related to CEM planning. We did not do much tuning of any of these parameters as the initial values we tried worked well compared to Dreamer and because of computational constraints. We kept the common parameters same as Dreamer for consistency. The training is stable and different random seeds are consistent in their performance as can be seen in our figures.

The main points raised in the review are clarification about the skill planner, addition of a HRL baseline, and addition of a baseline for transfer that keeps the policy fixed. We have clarified the first point below, added a strong model-free HRL baseline HIRO [1] (in Figures 3 and 4) and added a baseline that keeps the low-level policy fixed during transfer (Figure 4). We have updated the related works section with discussions about HRL approaches.\n\n\nWe would request the reviewer to revisit the paper in light of these revisions and clarifications, and let us know if any further reservations remain. We have highlighted major modifications, wherever possible in blue.\n\nIn the points below, we first paraphrase texts from the review, and provide our responses in bold.\n\n\nThe high-level skill planner / generator $p(z |\\cdot)$ does not seem to rely on the physical states, which is different from typical HRL approaches where the option/subgoal at each step depends on the latest state, e.g., $p(z^t | s^t)$.  **There might be a point of confusion here. We would like to point out that the MPC procedure makes use of the latest state in generating the parameters $\\zeta$ of the parametrized distribution $p(z |\\zeta)$ over skills, specifically the current state is where the rollouts of MPC start from. This is different from the induced conditional probability as the MPC procedure itself is also stochastic.**   \n\nMoreover, a fixed hyper-parameter 'K' seems to require additional tuning for new tasks and environments, which may make the approach less 'generalizable.' **In all our reported results we have used the same fixed K and did not tune this. We agree that it would be ideal to have an automatic way of tuning the value of 'K' during training, but we could not devise a simple way of doing it without adding a large complexity overhead to the model (for example, by meta-learning K).**\n\nOn a related note, it would be good to see more discussion on the advantages of the proposed skill generator/planner over the prior work on HRL. The related work section briefly mentions some prior work, but there is no detailed theoretical and/or empirical comparison. As of now, it is not clear to me how this is better than conventional HRL methods (e.g., learning a high-level policy). **We agree with this completely. The main intuition for us to study a model-based setting is because we can clearly isolate dynamics learning and planning using the learned dynamics - so we can analyze transfer to settings with similar dynamics but different tasks. We have now added a strong model-free HRL baseline, HIRO. (in Figures 3 and 4). HIRO does exactly what you mentioned - learning a high level policy. For a fair comparison, we used the same intrinsic reward for HIRO as our approach (in the original HIRO paper, the intrinsic rewards correspond to intermediate goals, but that would require additional information from the environment to be incorporated for this baseline, and the comparison to our method would not be fair.)**\n\nThe main objective of the approach seems to be improving the transferability of skills learned by RL as stated in the main text and in the title. However, the transfer setting is quite simple (from 'learning to walking' to 'learning to walk to a goal location'). I would be more interested in seeing more difficult settings such as walking in new and complex environments (e.g., with obstacles). **Our method focuses on learning environment dynamics and low level skills that can be used in the environment for planning. As such we did not consider transfer cases where the low level dynamics of the target task differs from the source task as would be the case for ``walking in new and complex environments (e.g., with obstacles)\".**\n\nIt is also not clear to me what exactly is transferred here. Is it the low-level policy? Is it the high-level skill plan? **It is the low level policy, and how the policy is conditioned by high level skills. Additionally, the learned dynamics model is also transferred.**\n\nIf so, a transfer setting where the low-level policies are fixed and only the high-level plans are updated / fine-tuned would be far more convincing. **Thank you for suggesting this. We have now added this comparison in the transfer setting in Figure 4. This performs slightly better than the original version of our method LSP used in transfer and is consistent with our previous results.**\n\n[1] Nachum, O., Gu, S.S., Lee, H. and Levine, S., 2018.

For example, a learned world model captures knowledge about the environment that applies to new tasks. Similarly, skills capture general behaviors that can apply to new tasks. In this paper, we investigate how these two approaches can be integrated into a single reinforcement learning agent. Specifically, we leverage the idea of partial amortization for fast adaptation at test time. For this, actions are produced by a policy that is learned over time while the skills it conditions on are chosen using online planning. We demonstrate the benefits of our design decisions across a suite of challenging locomotion tasks and demonstrate improved sample efficiency in single tasks as well as in transfer from one task to another, as compared to competitive baselines.
