These costs are not addressed in the paper text, and make the method significantly less practical for real-world use where performance is very often important.\n\n-Given these large additional costs, the core of the idea is not sufficiently validated, to me.  In order to verify that the improved performance is actually coming from some unique aspects of the proposed technique, rather than simply the fact that a higher-capacity network is being used, some additional baselines are needed:\n(1) Allowing the original network weights to be learned for the target task, as well as the additional module.  Outperforming this baseline on the validation set would verify that freezing the original weights provides an interesting form of regularization for the network.\n(2) Training the full module/stitched network from scratch on the *source* task, then fine-tuning it for the target task.  Outperforming this baseline would verify that having a set of weights which never \u201csees\u201d the source dataset is useful.\n\n-The method is not evaluated on ImageNet, which is far and away the most common domain in which pre-trained networks are used and fine-tuned for other tasks.  I\u2019ve never seen networks pre-trained on CIFAR deployed anywhere, and it\u2019s hard to know whether the method will be practically useful for computer vision applications based on CIFAR results -- often improved performance on CIFAR does not translate to ImageNet.  (In other contexts, such as more theoretical contributions, having results only on small datasets is acceptable to me, but network fine-tuning is far enough on the \u201cpractical\u201d end of the spectrum that claiming an improvement to it should necessitate an ImageNet evaluation.)\n\nOverall I think the proposed idea is interesting and potentially promising, but in its current form is not sufficiently evaluated to convince me that the performance boosts don\u2019t simply come from the use of a larger network, and the lack of ImageNet evaluation calls into question its real-world application.\n\n===============\n\nEdit (1/23/17): I had indeed missed the fact that the Stanford Cars does do transfer learning from ImageNet -- thanks for the correction.  However, the experiment in this case is only showing late fusion ensembling, which is a conventional approach compared with the \"stitched network\" idea which is the real novelty of the paper.  Furthermore the results in this case are particularly weak, showing only that an ensemble of ResNet+VGG outperforms VGG alone, which is completely expected given that ResNet alone is a stronger base network than VGG (\"ResNet+VGG > ResNet\" would be a stronger result, but still not surprising). Demonstrating the stitched network idea on ImageNet, comparing with the corresponding VGG-only or ResNet-only finetuning, could be enough to push this paper over the bar for me, but the current version of the experiments here don't sufficiently validate the stitched network idea, in my opinion.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Beyond Fine Tuning: A Modular Approach to Learning on Small Data", "abstract": "In this paper we present a technique to train neural network models on small amounts of data.

The idea itself is interesting and complements existing training and finetuning approaches, although I think there are a few baseline approaches that can be compared against, such as:\n\n(1) Ensemble: in principle, the idea is similar to an ensembling approach where multiple networks are ensembled together to get a final prediction. The approach in Figure 1 should be compared with such ensemble baselines - taking multiple source domain predictors, possibly with the same modular setting as the proposed method, and compare the performance.\n\n(2) comparison with late fusion: if we combine the pretrained network and a network finetuned from the pretrained one, and do a late fusion?\n\nBasically, I think it is a valuable argument in section 3.2 (and Figure 4) that finetuning with a small amount of data may hurt the performance in general. This builds the ground for freezing a pretrained network and only augmenting it, not changing it. I agree with the authors on this argument, although currently other than Figure 4 there seem to be little empirical study that justifies it.\n\nIt is worth noting that Figure 3 seems to suggest that some of the module filters are either not converging or are learning unuseful features - like the first two filters in 3(a).\n\nOverall I think it is an interesting idea and I would love to see it better developed, thus I am giving a weak accept recommendation, but with a low confidence as the experiments section is not very convincing.", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Beyond Fine Tuning: A Modular Approach to Learning on Small Data", "abstract": "In this paper we present a technique to train neural network models on small amounts of data.

The most widely used current technique is that of fine-tuning. The idea in this paper is to instead learn a network that learns features that are complementary to the fixed network. Additionally, the authors consider the setting where the new network/features are \u201cstitched\u201d to the old one at various levels in the hieararchy, rather that it just being a parallel \u201ctower\u201d. \n\nThis work is similar in spirit (if not in some details) to the Progressive Nets paper by Rusu et al, as already discussed. The motivations and experiments are certainly different so this submission has merit on its own.\n\nThe idea of learning a \u201cresidual\u201d with the stitched connnections is very similar in spirit to the ResNet work. It would be nice to compare and contrast those approaches.\n\nI\u2019ve never seen a batch being used 5 times in a row during training, does this work better than just regular SGD?\n\nIn Figure 5 it\u2019d be nice to label the y-axis. That Figure would also benefit from not being a bar chart, but simply emulating Figure 4, which is much more readable!\n\nFigure 5 again: what is an untrained model? It\u2019s not immediately obvious why this is a good idea at all. Is TFT-1 simply fine-tuning one more layer than \u201cRetrain Softmax\u201d?\n\nI think that the results at the end of section 3 are a bit weak because of usage of a big network. I would definitely like to see how the results change if using a smaller net.\n\nThe authors claim throughout the paper that the purpose of the added connections and layers is to learn *complementary* features and they show this with some figures. The latter are a convinving evidence, but not proof or guarantee that this is what is actually happening. I suggest the authors consider adding an explicit constraint in their loss that encourages that, e.g. by having a soft orthogonality constraing (assuming one can project intermediate features to some common feature dimensionality). The usage of very small L2 regularization maybe achieves the same thing, but there\u2019s no evidence for that in the paper (in that we don\u2019t have any visualizations of what happens if there\u2019s no L2 reg.).\n\nOne of the big questions for me while reading the paper was how would an ensemble of 2 pre-trained nets would do on the tasks that the authors consider. This is especially relevant in the cars classification example, where I suspect that a strong baseline is that of fine-tuning VGG on this task, fine-tuning resnet on this task, and possibly training a linear combination of the two outputs or just averaging them naively.\n\nDisappointing that there are no results in figure 4, 5 and 8 except the ones from this paper. It\u2019s really hard to situate this paper if we don\u2019t actually know how it compares to previously published results.\n\n\nIn general, this was an interesting and potentially useful piece of work. The problem of efficiently reusing the previously trained classifier for retraining on a small set is certainly interesting to the community. While I think that this paper takes a good step in the right direction, it falls a bit short in some dimensions (comparisons with more serious baselines, more understanding etc).\n\n\n", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Beyond Fine Tuning: A Modular Approach to Learning on Small Data", "abstract": "In this paper we present a technique to train neural network models on small amounts of data.

A substantial number of machine learning applications are in this regime, and standard deep learning approaches tend to struggle. Hence, this paper provides a welcome alternative. \n\nFurthermore, deep networks extract general representations which can be reused at many levels of granularity, and this paper shows that the appropriate level needs not be a hyperparameter, as it is the case with fine-tuning approaches; instead, lateral connections to an appropriately chosen representation together with standard validation of other hyperparameters (e.g. model size) can result in substantial improvements in generalization. \n\nWhile differences to progressive nets are indeed in the architecture details, the message of the paper as a whole is complementary, since it is not at all clear how a result in online deep reinforcement learning will apply to supervised learning with standard datasets. Actually, there are many reasons why it would not, e.g. online RL uses large amounts of data which is not i.i.d. and optimizes a drifting objective function based on a Bellman update.\n\nMy take away from this paper is that when I was learning from fMRI data with 12 examples/class I should have progressively extended a frozen and well regularized network trained on large amounts of data from a related task, rather than default to linear models or fine-tuning. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Beyond Fine Tuning: A Modular Approach to Learning on Small Data", "abstract": "In this paper we present a technique to train neural network models on small amounts of data.
