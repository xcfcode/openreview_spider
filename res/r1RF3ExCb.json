It consists of a number of broad ideas regarding density estimation using transformations of autoregressive networks. Specifically, the authors examine models involving linear maps from past states (LAM) and recurrence relationships (RAM). \n\nThe critical insight is that the hidden states in the LAM are not coupled allowing considerable flexibility between consecutive conditional distributions. This is at the expense of an increased number of parameters and a lack of information sharing. In contrast, the RAM transfers information between conditional densities via the coupled hidden states allowing for more constrained smooth transitions.\n\nThe authors then explored a variety of transformations designed to increase the expressiveness of LAM and RAM. The authors importantly note that one important restriction on the class of transformations is the ability to evaluate the Jacobian of the transformation efficiently. A composite of transformations coupled with the LAM/RAM networks provides a highly expressive model for modelling arbitrary joint densities but retaining interpretable conditional structure.\n\nThere is a rich variety of synthetic and real data studies which demonstrate that LAM and RAM consistently rank amongst the top models demonstrating potential utility for this class of models.\n\nWhilst the paper provides no definitive solutions, this is not the point of the work which seeks to provide a description of a general class of potentially useful models.\n\n\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Transformation Autoregressive Networks", "abstract": "The fundamental task of general density estimation has been of keen interest to machine learning.

At the time of writing we were unaware that the work by Papamakarios et al. (2017) was to be published and hence did not extensively compare to those results; we now revise with added comparisons.\n\nWorking off of both the paper and code in https://github.com/gpapamak/maf, we carefully preprocessed the datasets found in (Papamakarios et al. 2017) to work over the same instances/covariates. As can be seen in Section 4.2.1 Table 2 and Section 4.4 Table 4, Table 5, we are considerably beating both MAF, MADE, and Real NVP models in every dataset used by Papamakarios et al. (2017) (POWER, GAS, HEPMASS, MINIBOONE, BSDS300, MNIST, CIFAR-10).\n\nWe also wish to reemphasize the extent of our contribution. Whereas many modern density estimation work will introduce a single new conditional model for factors of the chain rule or a single new transformation of variables, this paper introduces *multiple* new methods for each of these components: the LAM conditional model, the RAM conditional model, the LU linear transformation, the recurrent transformation, and recurrent shift transformation. \n\nIn addition, our extensive empirical study shows the fundamental result that modern density estimation methods should employ *both* a flexible conditional model and a flexible transformation. Our extensive original experiments coupled with these new comparisons of TANs to MADE, Real NVP, and MAF make a very strong case for using TANs for density estimations.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Transformation Autoregressive Networks", "abstract": "The fundamental task of general density estimation has been of keen interest to machine learning.
