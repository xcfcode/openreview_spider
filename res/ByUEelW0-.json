It performs experiments on bAbI tasks and showed that the results are better than the simple baselines with original LSTM cells. There are a few problems with the paper.\n\nFirstly, the title and abstract discuss \"modifying memories\", but the content is only about a rotation operation. Perhaps the title should be \"Rotation Operation in Long Short-Term Memory\"?\n\nSecondly, the motivation of adding the rotation operation is not properly justified. What does it do that a usual LSTM cell could not learn? Does it reduce the excess representational power compared to the LSTM cell that could result in better models? Or does it increase its representational capacity so that some pattern is modeled in the new cell structure that was not possible before? This is not clear at all after reading the paper. Besides, the idea of using a rotation operation in recurrent networks has been explored before [3].\n\nFinally, the task (bAbI) and baseline models (LSTM from a Keras tutorial) are too weak. There have been recent works that nearly solved the bAbI tasks to perfection (e.g., [1][2][4][5], and many others). The paper presented a solution that is weak compared to these recent results.\n\nIn a summary, the main idea of adding rotation to LSTM cells is not properly justified in the paper, and the results presented are quite weak for publication in ICLR 2018.\n\n[1] Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Jason Weston, Rob Fergus.

The transform allows for explicit rotations and swaps of the hidden cell dimensions. The idea is illustrated for LSTM units, where the transform is applied after the cell values are computed via the typical LSTM updates.\n\nMy first concern is the motivation. I think the paper needs a more compelling example where swaps and rotations are needed and cannot otherwise be handled via gates. In the proposed example, it's not clear to me why the gate is expected to be saturated at every time step such that it would require the memory swaps. Alternatively, experimentally showing that the network makes use of swaps in an interpretable way (e.g. at certain sentence positions) could strengthen the motivation.\n\nSecondly, the experimental analysis is not very extensive. The method is only evaluated on the bAbI QA dataset, which is a synthetic dataset. I think a language modeling benchmark and/or a larger scale question answering dataset should be considered.\n\nRegarding the experimental setup, how are the hyper-parameters for the baseline tuned? Have you considered training jointly (across the tasks) as well?\n\nAlso, is the setting the same as in Weston et al (2015)? While for many tasks the numbers reported by Weston et al (2015) and the ones reported here for the LSTM baseline are aligned in the order of magnitude, suggesting that some tasks are easier or more difficult for LSTMs, there are large differences in other cases, for task #5 (here 33.6, Weston 70), for task #16 (here 48, Weston 23), and so on.\n\nFinally, do you have an intuition (w.r.t. to swaps and rotations) regarding the accuracy improvements on tasks #5 and #18?\n\nSome minor issues:\n- The references are somewhat inconsistent in style: some have urls, others do not; some have missing authors, ending with \"et al\".\n- Section 1, second paragraph: senstence\n- Section 3.1, first paragraph: thorugh\n- Section 5: architetures", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Modifying memories in a Recurrent Neural Network Unit", "abstract": "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units have the ability to memorise and use long-term dependencies between inputs to generate predictions on time series data.

The paper only provides results on the bAbI task. \n\nQuestions:\nHave you compared against to the other parametrizations of the LSTMs and rotation matrices?

The validation that was presented in the paper shows that the RotLSTM outperforms a baseline LSTM in most of the bAbI tasks and in some cases, it requires a smaller cell size to achieve the same accuracy and it converges earlier. As part of the reproducibility challenge, we downloaded the code that was provided with the paper and tried to reproduce the results.  We used that code to see if the numbers that were published matched the paper results. We also tried to see if the conclusion held after performing model selection and picking better models.\n\nPros:\nThe code was helpful, implementing exactly what was presented in the paper. It did not take us more than a couple of hours to reuse it for other purposes (model selection or different architectures and different datasets).\nThe ideas in the paper were clearly explained and the paper was easy to understand.\n\nCons:\nWhen we rerun the published code on the same tasks with the same hyper-parameters we had a different outcome. In our setup RotLSTM did not converge faster than the baseline LSTM except on task 18, and accuracy wise it performed at most as well as the baseline LSTM.\n\nWe performed model selection to choose a good LSTM to compare with. We limited the tasks to task 5, task 7, and task 18 as they were the best-performing tasks from the published results. In 2 out of these three tasks (5 and 7), training the selected LSTM and a RotLSTM that uses the same hyperparameters shows that the RotLSTM performed better than the LSTM. In the third task (task 18) it was the opposite. The hyper-parameters that were tuned during this task are the epochs, the batch size, the embedded hidden size, the query hidden size and the sentence hidden size. We performed Bayesian optimization to select the model, each 5-uplet of values is used to train 5 different models and the output of the objective function is the average of accuracies of these 5 models. The regions of the search are:\nEpochs [5:5:200] ([start:step:end])\nBatch size [16:16:256]\nEmbedded hidden size, query hidden size, and sentence hidden size [1:1:100] each\n\nOther comments:\nThe experiments took significant time to be performed. Model selection for each task takes between 3h30 and 4h00 (on 4 core blade using Keras and GPyOpt\u2019s multicore options). The reproduction of the results regarding the impact of the cell size on the test accuracy took 24 hours of experimentation (4 cores and Tesla K80 GPU).\nWe tried to experiment with a time series dataset but we found no difference in accuracy between LSTM and RotLSTM. RotLSTM also required significantly more time to train.\n\nReproducibility report: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ok4z66ccg5m6bff/comp-551-final.pdf?dl=0\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Modifying memories in a Recurrent Neural Network Unit", "abstract": "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units have the ability to memorise and use long-term dependencies between inputs to generate predictions on time series data.
