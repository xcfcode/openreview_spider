In this work we seek to leverage meta-learning methods from MAML with model-based RL methods based on MuZero to design agents which can quickly adapt online. We propose a new model-based meta-RL algorithm that can adapt online to new experience and can be meta-trained without explicit task labels. Compared to prior model-based meta-learning methods, our work can scale to more visually complex image based environments with dynamics that change significantly over time and can handle the continual RL setting which has no episodic boundaries.", "pdf": "/pdf/47fb84afe4190a338c36d313802fc69b2cdc70d7.pdf", "proposed_reviewers": "", "paperhash": "anonymous|accelerating_online_reinforcement_learning_via_modelbased_metalearning", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021accelerating,\ntitle={Accelerating Online Reinforcement Learning via Model-Based Meta-Learning},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to Learning to Learn - Workshop at ICLR 2021},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=XCJ5PEkuMkC},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "proposed_reviewers": {"value-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615595596483, "tmdate": 1615844205826, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/Learning_to_Learn/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
