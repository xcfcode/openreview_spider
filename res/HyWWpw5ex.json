Comparison between (Wang et.al 2016) \n\t\nOur work is significantly different in both modeling and learning: \n\n1. (Wang et.al 2016) uses a specific and simple process (Hawkes process) to model the evolution of features, which corresponds to a *linear* summation of history features. Our work is more expressive and general since we use the *nonlinear* recurrent framework. Specifically, we use a latent state to capture the histories, and update it using RNN. The RNN aspect makes our work able to capture the nonlinearity in the data hence our work has consistent improvements over (Wang et al 2016) in the prediction tasks.\n\nA recent work (Recurrent Marked Temporal Point Process, Nan et.al 2016)  shows that the RNN is quite flexible to approximate many point process models. This work systematically compared the RNN with many other point process models, such as Hawkes and self-correcting processes. Thus using RNN to capture the coevolutionary feature process gives us a powerful and flexible model.\n\n2. Regarding the # parameters, In (Wang et.al 2016), # parameters are O( #user \\times #item). However, our work only has O(#user + #item) regardless of RNN related parameters.\n\n3. In terms of learning: (Wang et.al 2016) uses a convex optimization which is a batch method. However, we develop a novel stochastic training technique which is *never* explored in this co-evolution dynamic graph scenario before. Our method can also be potentially applied to online setting. \n\n4. In terms of the time prediciton task: (Wang et.al 2016) needs to simulate future events to predict the next event time, which more sampling computation and less accurate. However, we assume the history is encoded in the hidden states of RNN and we can use a parametric distribution which has the closed form of the expected value of next event time.\n\nAccording to the universal approximation theorem, the network with sigmoid (or tanh) function used in our paper is already powerful enough [Cybenko., G. (1989)]. And also, it is straightforward to incorporate more complicated RNN cells, such as GRU or LSTM, to further strengthen the representation power. We also tried different parameterizations of the intensity functions (e.g., the version used in Nan et.al 2016), different dependency of multidimensional point process (e.g., user-centric multidimensional one used in (Wang et.al 2016), versus our symmetric NxM dimensional one),  different activation functions (ReLU has poor performance in this case), and used the best paramertrization choice in our paper.\n\nPlease check http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~ywang/papers/WanDuTriSon16.pdf for the NIPS paper (Wang et al 2016). \n\nB.  Evaluation metric:\n1. To test the item prediction performance, given a triple of the upcoming test event (user U, item I, time T), we ask the question: what is the item the user U will interact at time T? Since we know the true answer is item I, we evaluate the model\u2019s prediction against this groundtruth.\n\n2. Accurate prediction of the returning time of a customer to a specific service is also very useful for the service provider. Although the following important applications are from different domains, they can be well captured by the proposed model: \n\nI. As a web company, like Google and Facebook, time-sensitive recommendations can have potential impact first to display ads. If we can predict when our users will come back next, we can make the existing ads bidding much more economical, allowing marketers to bid on time slots. After all, marketers do not need to blindly bid all time slots indiscriminately. \n\nII. For most online stores, accurate prediction of the returning time of customers can help to improve stock management and products display and arrangement. \n\nIII. For mainstream personal assistants, like Google Now, because people tend to have different activities dependent on the temporal/spatial contexts like morning vs. evening, weekdays vs. weekend, making recommendations on the right thing and at the right moment can make such services more relevant and usable. \n\nIV. In modern electronic health record data, patients may have several diseases that have complicated dependencies on each other. The occurrence of one disease can trigger the progression of others. Predicting the returning time on certain disease can effectively help to take proactive steps to reduce the potential risks.\n\nC. complexity\n1. # parameters: If we use one-hot representation of user and items, then the basic feature embedding would take (#user + #item) \\times embedding_size parameters; the interaction features are independent to #user or #item (e.g., bag of words features); other model parameters are independent of the dataset size, so we won\u2019t have many more parameters than basic MF models. \n\n2. Training complexity: we use stochastic training to handle large datasets, each time we focus on consecutive K samples. When a new event happens, two embeddings gets updated, and #user + #item dimensions will update their constant intensity functions. So ideally we need O((#user + #item) \\times K) to forward the intensity and its integration (survival probability, which has closed form of integration).  However, as we mentioned in the paper, we use NCE to sample C \u2018\u2019negative\u2019\u2019 (i.e., the dimensions survives from last event to current event) dimensions, in order to further reduce the terms of survival probabilities, analogous to NCE used in language model to deal with large vocabulary size. So finally, we update 2K embeddings, and correspondingly compute C*K survival terms.  \n\n3. Testing task complexity: a) for item recommendation, we need O(N) time to compare with each item for the current user; this is unimprovable. b) for time prediction, it takes O(1) since we have closed form of expectation calculation; c) we use RNN to update two embeddings corresponds to the current user and item. It still takes O(1). \n\nIn summary, our method is scalable in both training and testing. During testing, it has same complexity as traditional matrix factorization based methods. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Recurrent Coevolutionary Feature Embedding Processes for Recommendation", "abstract": "Recommender systems often use latent features to explain the behaviors of users and capture the properties of items.

The later are modeled as coupled \u2013 autoregressive processes \u2013 i.e. the representation of a user/item changes when he interacts with an item/user, and is a function of both the user and the item representations before time t. This is called coevolution here and the autoregressive process is called recurrent NN. The model may also incorporate heterogeneous inputs. Experiments are performed on several datasets, and the model is compared with different baselines.\nThere are several contributions in the paper: 1) modeling recommendation via parametrized point processes where the parameter dynamics are modeled by latent user/item representations, 2) an optimization algorithm for maximizing the likelihood of this process, with different technical tricks that seem to break its intrinsic complexity, 3) evaluation experiments for time dependent recommendation.\nThe paper by the same authors (NIPS 2016) describes a similar model of continuous time coevolution, and a similar evaluation. The difference lies in the details of the model: the point process model is not the same and of the latent factor dynamic model is slightly different, but the modeling approach and the arguments are exactly the same. By the end, one does not know what makes this model perform better than the one proposed in NIPS, is it the choice for the process, the new parametrization? Both are quite similar. There is no justification on the choice of the specific form of the point process in the two papers. Did the authors tried other forms as well? The same remark applies for the form of the dynamical process: the non-linearity used for the modeling of the latent user/item vectors here is limited to a sigmoid function, which probably does not change much w.r.t. a linear model, but there is no evidence of the role of this non linearity in the paper. Note that there are some inconsistencies between the results in the two papers.\nConcerning the evaluation, the authors introduce two criteria. I did not get exactly how they evaluate the item recommendation: it is mentioned that at each time t, the model predicts the item the user will interact with. Do you mean, the next item the user will interact with after time t? For the time prediction, why is it a relevant metric for recommendation?\nA comparison of the complexity, or execution time of the different methods would be helpful. The complexity of your method is apparently proportional to #items*#users, what are the complexity limits of your methods.\nOverall, the paper is quite nice and looks technically sound, albeit many details are missing. On the other hand, I have a mixed feeling because of the similarity with NIPS paper. The authors should have make a better work at convincing us that this is not a marginal extension of previous work by the authors.  I was not convinced either by the evaluation criteria and there is no evidence that the model can be used for large datasets.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Recurrent Coevolutionary Feature Embedding Processes for Recommendation", "abstract": "Recommender systems often use latent features to explain the behaviors of users and capture the properties of items.

It is fundamental both in insights and methodology.\n\nAs for the insight, designing model in point process framework allows us to predict not just potential items, but also the *precise* timings of user item interactions. Precise time prediction is especially novel and not possible by most prior state-of-arts . The fundamental insight is that our framework models time as a *random variable* and learns the generative pattern of events. However, most prior session-based works discretize time into epochs, which needs the tuning of epoch size and prediction accuracy is limited by epoch length.\n\nAs for the methodology, our model also leads to technical challenges since user embeddings and item embeddings are *interdependent* and intertwined over time. The embedding of latent features are further captured by the RNN. Another key contribution is the efficient optimization algorithm that solves the stochastic training over nested dependent samples (non iid) and makes the BTPP tractable in our co-evolving case. ( the sentence after \u2018and\u2019\u2018 might be repetition)\n\nIn Yelp dataset, most of the users only have one interaction event per interacted item, ie, a user typically posts his comment on a business only once. For the point process framework, it requires at least two events to learn the model and predict the next event time. Thus we select active users with more than hundreds of events. We will adopt your comments and continue refining our experiment section.
