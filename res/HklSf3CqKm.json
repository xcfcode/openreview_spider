We respond to the specific questions in turn.\n\n\u201cChallenge of extending SQW to non-smooth case\u201d --- The high-level ideas of obtaining the two results are the same: characterizing the nice global landscape of the respective objectives on the sphere, and then designing specific optimization algorithms taking advantage of the particular landscapes. Characterization of the landscape is through the use of first-order (and second-order) derivatives. For our nonsmooth setting, we have to use the subdifferential to describe the first-order geometry, which involves dealing with set-valued functions and random sets (due to the randomness in the data assumption)---very different than dealing with the gradient and Hessian in the smooth calculus, as in SQW. Moreover, traditional argument of uniform convergence of random quantities to their expectation often relies on Lipschitz property of the quantities of interest. For random sets, the notion of concentration is unconventional, and the desired Lipschitz property also fails to hold. We introduce tools from random set theory and construct a novel concentration argument getting around the Lipschitz requirement. This in turn implies that the first-order geometry of the sample objective is close to the benign population objective, from which the algorithmic guarantee follows.\n\n\u201cPotential generalizations\u201d --- \u00a0We believe that our theory has the potential to generalize into the overcomplete case. There, a natural generalization of the orthogonality assumption is that the dictionary A is a well-conditioned tight frame (n x L \u201cfat\u201d matrix with orthonormal rows and suitably widespread columns in the n-dim space). Although the \"sparse vectors in a linear subspace\" intuition fails there, we would still expect the columns a_i of A minimize the population objective ||a^T Y||_1 = ||a^T A X||_1: due to the widespread nature of columns of A, a_i^T A would be an \u201capproximately 1-sparse\u201d vector (i.e., with one dominant entry and others having small magnitudes) and so vectors a_i^T AX are expected to be noisy versions of rows of X, which are the sparest (in a soft sense) vectors among all vectors of the form a^T AX. Figuring out the precise optimization landscape in that case would be of great interest. \u00a0"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1259/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1259/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1259/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Subgradient Descent Learns Orthogonal Dictionaries", "abstract": "This paper concerns dictionary learning, i.e., sparse coding, a fundamental representation learning problem.

We respond to the questions in the following.\n\n\u201cExtending to overcomplete DL\u201d --- We believe that our theory has the potential to generalize into the overcomplete case. There, a natural generalization of the orthogonality assumption is that the dictionary A is a well-conditioned tight frame (n x L \u201cfat\u201d matrix with orthonormal rows and suitably widespread columns in the n-dim space). Although the \"sparse vectors in a linear subspace\" intuition fails there, we would still expect the columns a_i of A minimize the population objective ||a^T Y||_1 = ||a^T A X||_1: due to the widespread nature of columns of A, a_i^T A would be an \u201capproximately 1-sparse\u201d vector (i.e., with one dominant entry and others having small magnitudes) and so vectors a_i^T AX are expected to be noisy estimates of rows of X, which are the sparest (in a soft sense) vectors among all vectors of the form a^T AX. Figuring out the precise optimization landscape in that case would be of great interest.  \n\n\u201cNonsmooth approach vs. (randomized) smoothing\u201d --- We wonder whether you\u2019re referring to the smoothed *objective*, or applying smoothing *algorithms* on our non-smooth objective. We will discuss both as follows.\n\nA smoothed objective was analyzed in Sun et al.\u201815. Smoothing therein helped to make conventional calculus tools and expectation-concentration style argument readily applicable conceptually, but the smoothed objective and its low-order derivatives led to involved technical analysis---the smoothed objective loses the simplicity of the L1 function. This tends to be the case for several natural smoothing schemes. Also, L1 function is the regularizer people use in practical dictionary learning. This paper directly works with the non-smooth L1 objective and is able to obtain stronger results with a substantially cleaner argument, using unconventional yet highly accessible tools from nonsmooth analysis, set-valued analysis, and random set theory. \n\nSmoothing algorithms on non-smooth objective is an active area of ongoing research. For example, Jin et al. \u201818 showed that randomized smoothing algorithms succeed on minimizing non-smooth objectives as long as it is point-wise close to a smooth objective, which is often chosen to be its expected version. However, in our case, even the expected objective is non-smooth (see e.g. Section 3.1), so it is not readily applicable. Moreover, the result there is based on a zero-th order method, which is a conservative algorithmic choice when the (sub)gradient information is readily available---this is the case for us. In this paper, we are able to show the convergence of subgradient descent (i.e., a first-order method) directly on the non-smooth objective. It would be of interest to see whether first-order smoothing algorithms work as well.\n\n\u201cNonsmoothness in neural networks\u201d --- It depends on what perspective we take. \n\nIf we are interested in the landscape (i.e. the global geometry of the loss function), then the nonsmoothness matters a lot as the nonsmooth points are scattered everywhere in the space, and if one initializes the model adversarially near the highly nonsmooth parts, intuitively the performance can be hurt by the nonsmoothness.\n\nHowever, if we are more interested in the trajectory of some particular algorithms (say, SGD), then maybe the non-smoothness won\u2019t hurt a lot --- as long as nice properties on the trajectory can be established. Such a trajectory-specific analysis has been done recently in, e.g., Du et al. \u201818. Even in this kind of results, there is no formal theory or statement saying that the nonsmooth points won\u2019t be encountered. \n\nBesides our work, there are other recent papers showing why nonsmoothness should and can be handled on a rigorous basis, e.g., Laurent & von Brecht \u201917, Kakade & Lee \u201918. \n\nReference:\nSun, J., Qu, Q., & Wright, J.

This leads to a natural non-convex optimization problem, whose local optimum are hopefully the rows of X. This was proved in SWW for *very* sparse X, and then later improved in SQW to the linear sparsity scenario. The present paper refines this approach, and obtain slightly better sample complexity by studying the most natural non-convex problem (ell_1 regularization on the sphere).\n\n\nI am not an expert on SQW so it is hard to evaluate how difficult it was to extend their approach to the non-smooth case (which seems to be the main issue with ell_1 regularization compared to the surrogate loss of SQW).\n\n\nOverall I think this is a solid theoretical contribution, at least from the point of view of non-smooth non-convex optimization.

Preliminary synthetic and real experiments corroborate our analysis and show that our algorithm works well empirically in recovering orthogonal dictionaries.", "keywords": ["Dictionary learning", "Sparse coding", "Non-convex optimization", "Theory"], "authorids": ["yub@stanford.edu", "qjiang2@stanford.edu", "sunju@stanford.edu"], "authors": ["Yu Bai", "Qijia Jiang", "Ju Sun"], "TL;DR": "Efficient dictionary learning by L1 minimization via a novel analysis of the non-convex non-smooth geometry.", "pdf": "/pdf/10966db6ec539d94cfb645c847cc838aa2d11038.pdf", "paperhash": "bai|subgradient_descent_learns_orthogonal_dictionaries", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nbai2018subgradient,\ntitle={Subgradient Descent Learns Orthogonal Dictionaries},\nauthor={Yu Bai and Qijia Jiang and Ju Sun},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HklSf3CqKm},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1259/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234269222, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "HklSf3CqKm", "replyto": "HklSf3CqKm", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1259/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335907758, "tmdate": 1552335907758, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1259/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 15}
