The paper also reports that combining the automatically extracted corpora with Europarl results in strong BLEU improvements over training only on Europarl. BLEU scores on TED test sets obtained using only the automatically extracted corpus are also reported. The corpus has been released.\n\nOverall the methodology presented in the paper is strong and the corpus is likely going to become a valuable tool to build machine translation systems and other multi-lingual applications. However, I am concerned that ICLR 2020 may not be the appropriate venue for this paper, as in my understanding dataset release papers are not explicitly solicited in the Call for Papers https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2020/CallForPapers . The corpus generation method is based on existing techniques, and to the extent that the engineering effort is innovative, it might not necessarily transfer well to data sources other than Wikipedia, thus limiting its broad scientific value. Therefore I suggest to submit the paper to a different venue.\n\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1738/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1738/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "WikiMatrix: Mining 135M Parallel Sentences in 1620 Language Pairs from Wikipedia", "authors": ["Holger Schwenk", "Vishrav Chaudhary", "Shuo Sun", "Hongyu Gong", "Francisco Guzm\u00e1n"], "authorids": ["schwenk@fb.com", "vishrav@fb.com", "ssun32@jhu.edu", "hgong6@illinois.edu", "fguzman@fb.com"], "keywords": ["multilinguality", "bitext mining", "neural MT", "Wikipedia", "low-resource languages", "joint sentence representation"], "TL;DR": "Large-scale bitext extraction from Wikipedia: 1620 language pairs in 85 languages, 135M parallel sentences, Systematic NMT evaluation on TED test set.", "abstract": "We present an approach based on multilingual sentence embeddings to automatically extract parallel sentences from the content of Wikipedia articles in 85 languages, including several dialects or low-resource languages.

The paper considers 1620 languages and the final dataset contains 135M parallel sentences. The language pairs are general and therefore the data does not require the use of English as a common language between two other languages.\n\nTo evaluate the quality of the extracted pairs, a neural machine translation system has been trained on them and tested on the TED dataset, obtaining good results in terms of BLEU score.\n\nThe article provides information on the system used to extract parallel sentences and opens up different directions for future investigations.\n\nThe dataset seems, from the given details, useful. However, without access to the data and, more importantly, extensive testing of it, it is difficult to say how and how much it would help the advancement of the field. For the moment it seems to be good. However, I am not really sure that this paper could be of interest to a wide audience, except for those involved in machine translation.\n\nIn general, the article describes everything at a high level, without going into the real details.\nAn example of this is on page 6, section 4.2, where the article says that its purpose is to compare different mining parameters, but I do not see any real comparison. Some words are spent for the mining threshold, but there is no real comparison, while other possible parameters are not considered at all.\n\nFor this reason, I would tend to give a low score, which does not mean that the dataset is not good. It means that the real content of the paper seems to me to be too little to be published at ICLR, since the paper only informs about the presence of this new dataset, saying that it contains a large number of sentences and seems to allow good translations based on the results of a preliminary test.\n\nTypos:\n- on page 9 \"Aragonse\"\n- on page 9, end penultimate line, the word \"for\" is repeated.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1738/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1738/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "WikiMatrix: Mining 135M Parallel Sentences in 1620 Language Pairs from Wikipedia", "authors": ["Holger Schwenk", "Vishrav Chaudhary", "Shuo Sun", "Hongyu Gong", "Francisco Guzm\u00e1n"], "authorids": ["schwenk@fb.com", "vishrav@fb.com", "ssun32@jhu.edu", "hgong6@illinois.edu", "fguzman@fb.com"], "keywords": ["multilinguality", "bitext mining", "neural MT", "Wikipedia", "low-resource languages", "joint sentence representation"], "TL;DR": "Large-scale bitext extraction from Wikipedia: 1620 language pairs in 85 languages, 135M parallel sentences, Systematic NMT evaluation on TED test set.", "abstract": "We present an approach based on multilingual sentence embeddings to automatically extract parallel sentences from the content of Wikipedia articles in 85 languages, including several dialects or low-resource languages.

This is mentioned in the abstract and the conclusion of the paper (the download URL is not given to guarantee anonymity). In addition, we have trained more than 1800 neural machine translation systems covering 45 languages and report BLEU scores for all of them on the TED corpus. 23 systems achieve BLEU scores over 30. We believe that this qualifies for \u201cextensive testing\u201d, given that in most of the papers in NLP, evaluation is limited to a handful of tasks or language pairs.\n\n2) \u201cEverything is described at a high level without going into detail, e.g. no real comparison of the mining parameters.\u201d\nWe would like to point out that our algorithms are described in detail in section 4 which spans over 2 pages. In particular, our mining approach has only one parameter, the mining threshold. We provide an extensive study of the impact of this parameter in section 4.2 for four different language pairs (see Figure 1).\n\n3) \u201cReal content is too little to be published at ICLR, informs only on the presence of a new dataset\u201d\nWe would like to argue that this paper makes a substantial contribution for several reasons:\n - this is the first approach which can be applied to many language pairs without the need to adapt it to the specific language pair. In fact, the corpus is particularly useful for research in low resource translation, which is an active research area. \n- the mined corpus is unique in its genre, with respect to the number of languages covered, including many low-resource languages, and the fact that we consider all possible language pairs (instead of the usual English/foreign pair)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1738/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1738/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "WikiMatrix: Mining 135M Parallel Sentences in 1620 Language Pairs from Wikipedia", "authors": ["Holger Schwenk", "Vishrav Chaudhary", "Shuo Sun", "Hongyu Gong", "Francisco Guzm\u00e1n"], "authorids": ["schwenk@fb.com", "vishrav@fb.com", "ssun32@jhu.edu", "hgong6@illinois.edu", "fguzman@fb.com"], "keywords": ["multilinguality", "bitext mining", "neural MT", "Wikipedia", "low-resource languages", "joint sentence representation"], "TL;DR": "Large-scale bitext extraction from Wikipedia: 1620 language pairs in 85 languages, 135M parallel sentences, Systematic NMT evaluation on TED test set.", "abstract": "We present an approach based on multilingual sentence embeddings to automatically extract parallel sentences from the content of Wikipedia articles in 85 languages, including several dialects or low-resource languages.
