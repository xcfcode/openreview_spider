We also explain the figure clearly in the context.\n\nQ2: \u201cExperimental evidence is not convincing\u201d,  \u201cVery limited experiments is done on two datasets only using one particular GAN. \u201d , \u201cyou should show that this works on multiple generative models on multiple datasets \u201d\nA2: Yes, there are multiple generative models. But VAEs and GANs are suitable for high-dimensional data like images. VAE works well for patterns of simple structures like hand-written digits. However, it cannot produce photo-realistic results for complex objects. Therefore, it is less meaningful to use VAEs to perform such experiments. \n\nThe ProGAN we used is the oral work published on ICLR 2018 (https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk99zCeAb). It is the state-of-the-art  GAN  that has accepted 1076 citations (Google citation result up to now) in the past two years. In other words, ProGAN has wide impact on generative models. This is why we chose ProGAN to test our algorithms.\n\nThe datasets of cats and faces we used for experiments are benchmark datasets for GANs now. We have already verified the effectiveness of our algorithms on these two complex data.\n\nQ3: \u201cThere are not of imprecise statements in the paper.\u201d, \u201c\"base set that guarantees a proper converge of generative models\". What do you mean by \"proper convergence\"?\u201d,   \u201c\"moderate compared to m\". Again, what is moderate? \u201d\nA3: To make them easily understood, we change the words in the revised version.\n       \"base set that guarantees a proper converge of generative models\" -> base set that contains sufficient data to attain convergent generative models\n       \u201cmoderate compared to m\u201d -> usually less than m\nThanks for the advice. We will further polish our paper.\n\nQ4: \u201cI don't understand the relevance of some of the results in the paper. For ex, what does Corollary 3 signify?\u201d\nA4: Corollary 3 is to solve epsilon used in equation (3). We explain this clearly in the context.\n\nQ5:  \u201cWhy do you use ResNet features (5.1) for distance? Why is this a reasonable or the best metric while computing your graph?\u201d\nA5: Using ResNet to extract features of images is a very common way in computer vision. We follow this convention. But \u201cthe best metric\u201d is really hard to be determined, not only for our work but also for nearly all the tasks for feature extraction. It is beyond the scope of our work. \n\nQ6: \u201c \"We determine the parameter \\alpha of the edge weight by enforcing geometric mean of the weights to be 0.8\". It seems very arbitrary to me. Can you justify this choice?\u201d\nA6: Actually, we determine the parameter by referring to the following NeurIPS paper\n\nCyclizing Clusters via Zeta Function of a Graph\nhttps://papers.nips.cc/paper/3412-cyclizing-clusters-via-zeta-function-of-a-graph\n\nwhere the robustness of choosing the geometric mean is validated for graphs.

One question I have is how exactly this centrality is measured\n\nThe word \u2018curriculum\u2019 has become a terminology used to describe a wide variety of totally different algorithms. While the authors provide an excellent introduction to this diversity and clearly differentiate their own flavor of \u2018cluster curriculum\u2019, I am wondering if they would not have been better off by describing the proposed approach in terms of outlier removal, especially has it has very little in common with the original idea of curriculum, which is a learning progression designed by the teacher.\n\nNevertheless, the paper is very clearly written and reads well in the present form. I am especially impressed about the clarity of the rather technical part on percolation.\n\nIn terms of outlier removal, this could be interpreted as the following constructive algorithm:\n\u2022\tExamples are ranked along their centrality measure \n\u2022\tOne identify the critical point in percolation for a starting point where too many examples are removed\n\u2022\tMore examples are added until a minimum is found on validation data\nThis process can be made faster as:\n\u2022\tThe optimum can happen very soon after the critical point\n\u2022\tOtherwise, an active set algorithm can be used to control the size of the training set.\n\nWhile my recent expertise has been more NLP than Vision, I think this algorithm is original, and could have a significant impact as it can be extended beyond GANs. The technical presentation is excellent.\n\nOne puzzling issue is the computation of the centrality measure: all I could find in Appendix A1. and A.3 is that it is directly measured on the raw image (RGB pixels?) by taking some distance, which I assume is Euclidean? My experience in image classification suggests such a distance is meaningless, so I may be missing something. I looked for a Github pointer, but none was provided.\n\nThe English is OK, but there are missing words and strange constructions:\n\u2022\tPage 1:  \u201cDeep generative models HAVE piqueD researchers\u2019 interest in the past decade\u201d\n\u2022\tPage 4: \u201cThe training of many loops will lead to time-consuming (MISSING WORD)\u201d\n\nIn particular, the usage of \u201cthe\u201d, for instance in pages:\n\u2022\t7 \u201cTherefore, a fast learning strategy can be derived from THE percolation process.\u201d\n\u2022\t7 \u201cTraining may begin from the curriculum\u201d\n\u2022\t8 \u201cCluster curriculum is proposed for robust training of generative models.\u201d\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1056/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1056/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Curriculum Learning for Deep Generative Models with Clustering", "authors": ["Deli Zhao", "Jiapeng Zhu", "Zhenfang Guo", "Bo Zhang"], "authorids": ["zhaodeli@gmail.com", "jengzhu0@gmail.com", "guozhenfang@pku.edu.cn", "zhangbo@xiaomi.com"], "keywords": ["curriculum learning", "generative adversarial network"], "TL;DR": "A novel cluster-based algorithm of curriculum learning is proposed to solve the robust training of generative models.", "abstract": "Training generative models like Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)  is challenging for noisy data.

To address this, the authors propose to training methodology (or curricula)  where \"easier\" or more \"relevant\" points are presented first followed to the model followed by the less relevant ones. The relevance is determined used by calculating centrality on a graph constructed out of the data points. \n\nI lean towards rejecting the paper, primarily because 1) The authors have not provided evidence to claim the noisy data points makes training challenging or characterized anything about under how much noise the training breaks down. 2) Experimental evidence is not convincing  3) There are not of imprecise statements in the paper. \n\nThe authors claim (without citation) that training generative models in the presence of noisy data is challenging. How much noise are we talking about? If the entire training set is very noisy, maybe we don't have any hope to learn to generate clean samples, but if it's just a little bit of noise, maybe it's fine. I also understand that when the authors use the word \"noise\" they don't really mean noise,  but changes in view point etc. Some convincing demonstration that such characteristics of dataset adversely affects the training of generative models will be helpful (in addition to one passing sentence in the experiment section about it).\n\nI am not convinced by any of the experiments. More importantly, it seems like the proposed training curricula is in general valid for a lot of generative models. The experimental evidence is really not convincing. Very limited experiments is done on two datasets only using one particular GAN. To convincingly demonstrate that your training methodology is doing something non-trivial, you should show that this works on multiple generative models on multiple datasets and compare your performance (and visualize some generated samples) against just training blindly on the entire dataset. In addition to this, I don't understand the relevance of some of the results in the paper. For ex, what does Corollary 3 signify?\n\nSome other points:\n1. First para. \"non-trial' -> non-trivial\n2. First para: \"model collapse\" -> mode collapse\n3. 3.2 para 2. \"base set that guarantees a proper converge of generative models\". What do you mean by \"proper convergence\"?\n4. 3.2 para 2. \"moderate compared to m\". Again, what is moderate? \n5. Why do you use ResNet features (5.1) for distance? Why is this a reasonable or the best metric while computing your graph?\n6. \"We determine the parameter \\alpha of the edge weight by enforcing geometric mean of the weights to be 0.8\". It seems very arbitrary to me. Can you justify this choice?\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1056/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1056/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Curriculum Learning for Deep Generative Models with Clustering", "authors": ["Deli Zhao", "Jiapeng Zhu", "Zhenfang Guo", "Bo Zhang"], "authorids": ["zhaodeli@gmail.com", "jengzhu0@gmail.com", "guozhenfang@pku.edu.cn", "zhangbo@xiaomi.com"], "keywords": ["curriculum learning", "generative adversarial network"], "TL;DR": "A novel cluster-based algorithm of curriculum learning is proposed to solve the robust training of generative models.", "abstract": "Training generative models like Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)  is challenging for noisy data.
