Although all reviewers find the overall approach is important and some results are interesting, the main concern is about the novelty. At the technical level, the proposed method is the extension of the original two-view KERMIT to multiviews, which I have to say incremental. At a higher level, multi-lingual language generation itself is not a very novel idea, and the contribution of the proposed method should be better positioned comparing to related studies. (for example, Dong et al, ACL 2015 as suggested by R#3). Also, some reviewers pointed out the problems in presentation and unconvincing experimental setup.

We address your questions below:\n\n1. Indeed, we agree that Multi30k is not a typical large scale machine translation dataset. However, we chose the Multi30k dataset because it provided us with multiple high quality channels that expresses the same underlying meaning (i.e. the image) under different viewpoint (languages in this case), in order to highlight our approach. While we have not performed experiments with datasets that have partially (m<k) parallel data (such as bilingual pairs or monolingual data as suggested), we believe that our approach should also be able to take advantage of partially parallel data. The partially parallel data should also be weighted by the prior on how often we believe that combination of channels is encountered. \n\n2. While the Multilingual KERMIT approach can be considered incremental conceptually, we believe that we contributed the novelty in terms of the empirical investigations and characterizing the (unconditional and (partially) conditional) samples from the model. In addition, multilingual KERMIT is only one possible implementation of the proposed MGLM framework, with the hopes that this helps encourage others in the community to pursue this line of generative modeling of multichannel texts. \n\n3. We will clarify our interpretation of these results in the main paper with more details about the test sets and our hypothesis of the model\u2019s performance. The Flickr test sets are considered \u201cin-domain\u201d, while the MSCOCO are the harder \u201cout-of-domain\u201d where the captions were selected to contain ambiguous verbs, which makes the translation task harder. In those cases, we found that training the model on the more difficult task (i.e. multi-target (any language -> rest) helped with generalization to the MSCOCO test set in the case of English -> German. In the case of English -> French, we hypothesize that the bilingual model performed the best because there is a high mutual information between English and French, such that training on additional languages do not help the model generalize, but rather even distracts the model. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2241/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2241/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["hchan@cs.toronto.edu", "kiros@google.com", "williamchan@google.com"], "title": "Multichannel Generative Language Models", "authors": ["Harris Chan", "Jamie Kiros", "William Chan"], "pdf": "/pdf/db58d3ed2153df0d6efed04a621cca3305d92e36.pdf", "TL;DR": "we propose Multichannel Generative Language Models (MGLM), which models the joint distribution over multiple channels, and all its decompositions using a single neural network", "abstract": "A channel corresponds to a viewpoint or transformation of an underlying meaning.

We will revise the paper to include their work in the related work section and discussion. \n\nOne difference with Dong et al. to our approach is that during the multi-target generation, our model\u2019s output at each time step can be conditioned on both the source sentence and the partial translations of all the target languages, while Dong et al.\u2019s model only conditions on the input and the partial translation of the particular target language (in parallel). Our experiment compares the effects of conditioning only on one partial target versus all partial targets inference time. \n\nOn novelty: while our specific implementation can be considered incremental from KERMIT, we believe that the task of learning a generative model over several channels is an underexplored direction that is worthwhile to pursue. Despite the vast interest in unconditional generative modeling in images (GANs, VAEs, etc.), we have seen much less interest in the text domain.

In fact, Dong et al. investigated the problem of learning a machine translation model that can simultaneously translate sentences from one source language to multiple target languages. Although machine translation is just an example of MGLM, Dong et al. is highly relevant to the conditional generation with MGLM, needless to say that they share the same multi-language translation problem domain. Thus, this paper will be much stronger if comparison with important baseline methods is provided.\n\n* Limited novelty: This paper extends Chan et al.'s KERMIT by applying its objective on tasks with more than 2 sequences, in order to learn the joint distribution p(channel_1, ..., channel_k) over k channel sequences. Most of the math in this paper can be found in the original Chan et al.'s paper. The extension to the multichannel case is incremental as it is hard to justify the challenge of such extensions.\n\nBesides, as minor suggestions, it would help readers if more illustrations of Figure 1 (especially the inference part) can be provided."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2241/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2241/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["hchan@cs.toronto.edu", "kiros@google.com", "williamchan@google.com"], "title": "Multichannel Generative Language Models", "authors": ["Harris Chan", "Jamie Kiros", "William Chan"], "pdf": "/pdf/db58d3ed2153df0d6efed04a621cca3305d92e36.pdf", "TL;DR": "we propose Multichannel Generative Language Models (MGLM), which models the joint distribution over multiple channels, and all its decompositions using a single neural network", "abstract": "A channel corresponds to a viewpoint or transformation of an underlying meaning.

KERMIT is an extension of \u201cInsertion Transformer\u201d (Stern et. al, 2019), a non-autoregressive model that can jointly determine which word and which place the translated words should be inserted. KERMIT shares the encoder and decoder of insertion Transformer, and the source sentence and target sentence are concatenated to train a generative model (also, various loss functions are included). In this work, parallel sentences from more than two languages are concatenated together and fed into KERMIT. Each language is associated with a language embedding. This work demonstrates that a joint distribution p(x1, . . . , xk) over k channels/languages can be properly modeled through a single model. The authors carry out experiments on multi30k dataset.\n\n[Pros] Some discoveries of this work are interesting, including: (1) It is possible to use a single model to translate a sentence into different languages in a non-autoregressive way. (2) The unconditional multilingual generation in Section 4.5 is interesting, especially, the generation order is determined by the model rather than left-to-right.\n\n[Questions]\n1.\tThe authors work on multi30k dataset, which is not a typical dataset for machine translation. \n(A)\tThe dataset and the corresponding information is at https://github.com/multi30k/dataset. The number of words in a sentence is smaller than 15, which is too short for a machine translation. Also, the pattern of sentences is relatively simple.\n(B)\tFor real world application, I am not sure whether it is possible to collect a large amount of k-parallel data where $k>2$. Therefore, the application scenario is limited. What if we have a large amount of bilingual data instead of k-parallel data? How should we leverage the large amount of monolingual data?\n2.\tFor novelty, this is an extension of KERMIT to a multilingual version, which limits the novelty of this wok.\n3.\tThe best results on En->De in Table 1 are inconsistent. On tst16, bilingual en<->de is the best; on tst17, en<->{rest} is the best; on mscoco, any<->rest is the best. In Table 2, seems using bilingual data only is the best choice.

Even though your extension from two views to multiple is simple I find reliance on a diagram to be a mistake as I find your description not to be very clear. Given that there are no equations to support the reader and that the original equations are not adequate I find it hard to understand Sections 2 and 3. The key experimental result in Table 1 is only briefly commented on despite featuring multiple models with different strength and weaknesses, multiple types of inference.
