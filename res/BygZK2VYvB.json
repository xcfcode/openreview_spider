Thank you for your feedback and insightful discussions.", "comment": "Your concerns are insightful. We updated the paper to add some discussions and experimental results and polish the presentation according to your feedback.\n\nRegarding formulation\n\n1. A degenerated case of containing identity mapping.\nThank you for pointing out this. We surely agree with your remarks on the possible degenerated case (i.e. f(e) containing identity mapping) but this is not a bad thing if it naturally emerges from a training process. If this emerges, what we obtain is a solution that maximizes the mutual information and minimizes the original loss as well. Then, this is actually a feasible optimal solution, which does not affect our main conclusion.\n\n\n2. Motivation and why not applying to node embedding.\nOur work is motivated by the lack of focus on improving performance of existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through better utilization of edge features. The idea is built upon well-established information theory, experts can easily judge its usefulness and/or limitations for specific applications. Simple ideas tend to be more universally applicable. This rule-of-thumb works well in our case: the MI loss can be applied to many GNN architectures without much coding efforts, and the solid performance boosts across a wide range of applications (from small to large graphs) chosen in our experiments surely motivated us to report this finding. \n\nWe thank the referee for this insightful idea, and fully agree that applying our MI loss to node embedding is worth trying. However, the key emphasis of this work is how to better utilize edge features in GNNs. We think it is best to perform the suggested analysis in a future study.\n\n\n\nRegarding experiment\n\n1. The training loss of EIGNN is better than MPNN.\nOur paper has been updated to discuss this phenomenon. In the updated figure 1, we show the standard deviation over 3 runs, which verifies that the results are statistically significant. Hence, this is an experimentally reproducible phenomenon. More discussions are provided in the main text in Section 4.1.\n\nReduced training loss for EIGNN can be attributed to our key observation in this work: \u201cthe improvement of EIGNN over baselines is not due to simple regularization effect (like L_2 regularization) but comes from exploiting edge features.\u201d This does seem to be counterintuitive if we take the auxiliary MI loss as a regularization. A possible explanation is that the auxiliary MI loss enforces better exploitation of edge features and smooths the optimization landscape, assisting the network to escape local optima. However, we admit that this is simply an intuitive explanation and topics on the optimization landscape and local optimums remain as a future work.\n\n2. The original paper of MPNN reports the relative MAE [Gilmer et al. 2017].\nThe reason we use MAE instead of relative MAE is that it is common to report MAE in terms of chemical unit. This practice has been widely adopted not only in computational chemistry but also in the machine learning community working on molecular graphs [Morris et al. 2019, Wu et al. 2018]. It can be found that our MPNN results are consistent with [Morris et al. 2019] (Table 2), [Wu et al. 2017] (Table 12) and implementations in the widely used libraries for graph-based deep learning such as [PyG] and [DGL]. \n\nWe would like to further emphasize that the relative MAE is simply the ratio of MAE to some predefined constants (i.e., the so-called chemical accuracy) and possibly involves unit change. For easy comparison, we added Table 5 in Appendix A which clearly lists all targets with descriptions and units. Nevertheless, according to your suggestion, we added Table 6 in Appendix A which contains the relative MAE for MPNN and our EIGNN. As pointed out in your comments, the improvement shown in our paper shall be consistent regardless whether it is reported in terms of relative MAE or original MAE. \n\n3. One simple ablation study would to concat the edge feature directly inside the \u2018message passing\u2019 procedure, or have some \u2018residual\u2019 type of connection for edge features.\nAccording to your advice, we concatenate edge features to node representations in message passing and repeated the experiments 3 times. We updated Figure 1 in our paper to report the additional results. Concatenation is unable to identify correlations between edges and nodes (This is also claimed in Section 2 of [Gilmer et al. 2017]). Our results show that by concatenating edge features, the model achieves slightly better mean validation accuracy but the variance of accuracy is larger.\n\n\nReference:\n[Gilmer et al. 2017] Neural Message Passing for Quantum Chemistry.\n[Morris et al. 2019] Weisfeiler and Leman Go Neural: Higher-Order Graph Neural Networks.\n[Wu et al. 2018] MoleculeNet: A Benchmark for Molecular Machine Learning.

The component of the edge features.\nWe surely agree with you that the component of edge features does affect the model performance, which actually supports our claim on the importance of edge features and our motivation of better utilizing the features. The influence of the component of edge features has been directly demonstrated in our experiments. For example, In Table 1, we have shown that MPNN can outperform sMPNN by using additional edge features, i.e., the pairwise distance between atoms.\n\nEdge feature design is a topic of feature engineering and requires domain knowledge according to specific applications. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our EIGNN, we follow previous literature and use the same feature engineering for fair comparison.

Such loss is to maximize the mutual information between edge representation and corresponding edge feature in GNN \u2018message passing\u2019 function. By assuming a gaussian distribution of edge feature given edge representation, the training can be done efficiently with tractable density. Experiments on molecule regression and knowledge graph completion show better performance than MPNN. \n\nOverall the paper is written in a clear way which is easy to follow. The idea of using mutual information as some kind of regularization is also interesting. However, there are some concerns I have with the paper:\n\nRegarding formulation\n\n1. The derivation up to Eq(8) looks fine to me, where the assumptions are reasonable. However from Eq(8) one can see this is reduced to an \u2018auto-encoder\u2019 type of regularization, where one can have a trivial solution for reconstruction -- the identity network, when the hidden dimension is larger than input dimension. And in this paper, dimension of W should always be larger than the dimension of e (for example, in molecules e should be low dimension vector with the bond type, distance, etc., while W should have dimension that matches the node embeddings).\n\nI think the original loss (i.e., the supervised MSE, cross entropy etc) would help a bit with such degenerated case, but it is possible that the learned f(e) contains both identity mapping (or equivalent) and the representation that contributes to original loss.  \n\n2. Actually I\u2019m also not sure if I get the motivation here. If one needs to do this regularization for edges, why don\u2019t we consider this auxiliary loss for node embeddings as well? As in molecules, atoms have more interesting features than bonds, which should account more if the mutual information loss is needed. \n\nRegarding experiment\n\n1. In Figure 1, the training loss of EIGNN is better than MPNN. This is a bit counterintuitive to me, as I think the auxiliary is a kind of regularization -- which might help with generalization but not necessarily the training loss. \n\n2. The original paper of MPNN reports the relative MAE. Is it possible to report the results using the same metric as previous paper? It would make the comparison more consistent -- though showing the improvement in current way is not too bad. \n\n3. I think one simple ablation study would to concat the edge feature directly inside the \u2018message passing\u2019 procedure, or have some \u2018residual\u2019 type of connection for edge features. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper67/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper67/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Utilizing Edge Features in Graph Neural Networks via Variational Information Maximization", "authors": ["Pengfei Chen", "Weiwen Liu", "Chang-Yu Hsieh", "Guangyong Chen", "Pheng Ann Heng"], "authorids": ["chenpf.cuhk@gmail.com", "wwliu@cse.cuhk.edu.hk", "kimhsieh@tencent.com", "gycchen@tencent.com", "pheng@cse.cuhk.edu.hk"], "keywords": ["Graph Neural Network", "Edge Feature", "Mutual Information"], "TL;DR": "We use a principled variational approach to preserve edge information in graph neural networks and show the importance of edge features and the superior of our method in extensive benchmarks.", "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) broadly follow the scheme that the representation vector of each node is updated recursively using the message from neighbor nodes, where the message of a neighbor is usually pre-processed with a parameterized transform matrix.
